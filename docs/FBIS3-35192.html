			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reliable reports from Baghdad yesterday said that  gradually and cautiously evolving developments threaten a  suicidal popular uprising to be led this time by hungry Iraqis  who, thanks to soaring prices of essential commodities and an  all-time low Iraqi dinar, find it hard to survive. The reports  said the Iraqi people are effectively on the threshold of a  mammoth revolution to express their anger with the unjust  regime, which is primarily responsible for the people's bitter  suffering today.    The reports said a state of extreme tension and anxiety  prevail in the streets of Baghdad and the governorates in  anticipation of possible developments in the next few days if  the economic deterioration and collapse continue and hunger,  want, and destitution affecting the overwhelming majority of  citizens sharpen.</p>

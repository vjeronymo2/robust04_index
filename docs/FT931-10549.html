			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Vauxhall acts to reduce stocks held by dealers VAUXHALL IS introducing a new car distribution system intended to reduce stocks held at dealers' premises and cut the total number of vehicles in its supply pipeline by 20 per cent. When fully implemented by 1995, it is expected to save the company and its dealers 'tens of millions of pounds a year', according to Mr Dean Barrett, marketing services director of the General Motors subsidiary. More than half of all new Vauxhalls sold are transferred between dealerships to satisfy customer orders, rather than supplied directly to the dealer by Vauxhall. In future Vauxhall's 535 dealers will draw their cars from a network of five large storage facilities, each linked strategically to either a Vauxhall manufacturing plant or, in the case of imported vehicles, their port of entry. The system bears some similarities to that already instituted at rival Rover Group, which last autumn opened a network of seven wholly owned regional distribution centres. As with the Vauxhall system, Rover's dealers carry only showroom stock and test vehicles. They no longer carry bulk stocks in their compounds but call up cars as they are ordered from the seven regional centres. Rover, which has smaller UK sales than Vauxhall, believes its own system could save the group and its dealers up to Pounds 80m a year. Traditionally, Vauxhall's dealers have held six weeks' or more of stocks, swapping them as necessary as orders for a particular specification and colour came in. The new system is scheduled to start in the spring.</p>

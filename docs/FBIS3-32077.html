The URNG General Command, based in Mexico City, said in a  communique that the large abstentionism of 84 percent proves the  lack of credibility and legitimacy "of the counterinsurgency  model" implemented with the "self-coup" of former President  Jorge Serrano Elias.    The unprecedented abstentionism in the country reflects the  rejection of the constitutional reforms, which were faulty in  origin. The reforms are the expression of deals reached between  corrupt politicians and show the extent of a regime devoid of  political support, the URNG communique states. "The  government's attempt to present as a triumph the scant yes  garnered at the polls constitutes one more imposition on the  Guatemalan people," it states.    The result of the referendum to reform the Constitution and  to purge the Congress does not resolve the crisis. On the  contrary, it prolongs and heightens it, the URNG states. The  URNG says that this situation will permit the sectors opposed to  a political solution of the crisis and which support armed  conflict to harden their positions and seriously endanger  efforts to build democracy in Guatemala.    "The constitutional and institutional reforms and  socioeconomic transformations the country needs, that society  demands and wants, can only be achieved by a government of unity  and national salvation, which is the democratic expression of  the country's majority," the URNG communique concluded.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Ireland US losses increase THE US subsidiaries of Bank of Ireland incurred an increased pre-tax loss of Dollars 123.4m (Pounds 70m) last year, against Dollars 99.8m. The bank blamed the continuing recession in New Hampshire, where its subsidiaries operated, and the severe decline in real estate values during 1991. There is also a Dollars 4m extraordinary item arising from additional wind-down costs for Vendor Funding. Total assets of Bank of Ireland First Holdings, which controls the US subsidiaries, rose by 52 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn, reflecting the purchases last autumn of Amoskeag Bank and BankEast Corporation. Total deposits were up by 63 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. Loans increased by 31 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.</p>

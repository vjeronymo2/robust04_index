			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jeyes tumbles to Pounds 374,000 JEYES Group, the cleaning products manufacturer which stunned the market with a profits warning in June, yesterday reported an 82 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 374,000 on sales 61 per cent higher at Pounds 57.9m. Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, was confident, however, that the sharp profits downturn had been a hiccup after a series of one-off factors. These included over-enthusiastic spending on marketing in the company's bleach and wipes business, and the costs of restructuring the group's divisions following the acquisition last year of Globol in Germany. Mr Moir said Jeyes had spent some Pounds 4m on marketing bleach and wipes in the UK, leaving it with a greater market share. Although the spending had been budgeted for, margins were severely hit when competition forced down prices. However, Mr Moir said conditions had now returned to normal. The chief executive remained cautious about the full year, however, until autumn trading became more clear. 'It is crucially important that we deliver the bacon at that time,' he said. The UK division, which accounts for 45 per cent of turnover, was showing a 5 per cent increase in year-on-year sales. The international division, excluding Germany, had been hindered by difficult trading in France and Spain and destocking in North America. Mr Moir said the North American business had since improved significantly. Germany was showing a 10 per cent increase in sales at the half year, he said. Jeyes took an exceptional charge of Pounds 610,000 to pay for redundancy costs. A further provision of Pounds 5.8m was shown in the balance sheet to cover restructuring costs. Some 27 management jobs were cut in the first half, and Mr Moir said the group expected to reduce the workforce by a further 250. Earnings per share tumbled from 9.4p to 1.2p. The dividend was increased to 3.3p. COMMENT As Mr Moir frankly admits, Jeyes may have 'chased the market a little too hard'. But since the group has won greater market share as a result, the most severe damage in the medium term may well have been to its credibility in the City. The shares are likely to tread water at least until the finals, when Mr Moir's cautiously optimistic statements will be put to the test. Jeyes will also have to prove that it can get gearing, currently at 54 per cent, to an acceptable level. Expectations are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m, leaving a prospective p/e of 22 times. It is likely to be 1994 before Jeyes begins to recover its shine.</p>

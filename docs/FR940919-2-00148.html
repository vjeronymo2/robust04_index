			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. No AT&amp;T Trust will be permitted to allocate, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total assets to Arrangements which are the subject of the proposed exemption, determined at the time any such Arrangement is established and at the time of any subsequent allocation of additional assets, including the reinvestment of assets, to such Arrangement. The foregoing limitation does not apply to an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity, which is defined as any group trust, partnership or other entity, the assets of which are deemed to be ``plan assets'' by reason of the application of 29 C.F.R. 2510.3&hyph;101, but only if (a) fifty percent or more of the interests in such entity are held by one or more AT&amp;T Trusts and (b) AT&amp;T is the named fiduciary or manager of the assets of such entity. An AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity may allocate up to one hundred percent of its asset to Arrangements subject to the proposed exemption. However, solely for determining if an AT&amp;T Trust satisfies the twenty percent limitation, the assets of any AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity in which such AT&amp;T Trust has an interest will be deemed to be the asset of such AT&amp;T Trust only to the extent of such AT&amp;&amp; Trust's interest in the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity. As an example, the applicant explains a hypothetical situation in which an AT&amp;T Trust has total assets of $100 million: This AT&amp;T Trust may allocate up to $20 million to Arrangements. In the hypothetical example, $15 million of the AT&amp;T Trust's assets are invested in an AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity which has total assets of $30 million, fifty percent of which are allocated to Arrangements. For the purpose of determining if the AT&amp;T Trust satisfies the twenty percent allocation limit, $15 million of the assets of the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity, representing the AT&amp;T Trust's investment therein, are deemed to be assets of the AT&amp;T Trust. Because fifty percent of the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity's overall assets are allocated to Arrangements, fifty percent (or $7.5 million) of this $15 million is deemed to be allocated to Arrangements. Thus, by virtue of its investment in the AT&amp;T Plan Assets Entity, the AT&amp;T Trust is treated as having allocated $7.5 million to Arrangements. Accordingly, in this hypothetical example, the AT&amp;T Trust may allocate up to $12.5 million of its remaining assets to Arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Throughout the term of an Arrangement, AT&amp;T will receive quarterly and annual reports prepared by the asset manager relating to the overall financial position of the assets under management, including a statement regarding the amount of all fees paid to the asset manager during the period covered by the report, and annual reports indicating the current fair market value of all assets as determined on the basis of the most recently available independent valuations, as defined in Part III, Section (k) of the proposed exemption. AT&amp;T will also receive annual audited financial statements prepared by independent certified public accountants approved by AT&amp;T, generally within ninety days of the end of the twelve month period covered by the statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The proposed exemption requires AT&amp;T to provide for the maintenance, for six years, of records necessary to enable determinations of whether the conditions of the proposed exemption are satisfied. Such records must be unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal business by any duly authorized representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service, any contributing employer (or its representative) with respect to an employee benefit plan with assets held in a Fund which has entered into an Arrangement, and any participant or beneficiary (or his/her representative) of such a plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

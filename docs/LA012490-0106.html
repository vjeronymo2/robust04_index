			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS AUSTRALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> FORMER CHAMPIONS TAKE ON CHALLENGES  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander, each former Australian Open  champions, stepped onto the sizzling courts today (Wednesday) hoping to move  closer to another title.  </P> <P> Opposing them were three young players -- Andrei Cherkasov, David Wheaton and  Boris Becker -- hungry for their first Australian championships.  </P> <P> The three quarterfinal matches offered a view of some of the dominant players  of the 1980s and perhaps the key players of the 1990s, the past clashing with  the future in the first Grand Slam tournament of the decade.  </P> <P> Lendl, the defending champion and No. 1-ranked player, is the oldest in the  group at 29 and faced the youngest, Cherkasov, a 19-year-old Soviet baseliner  born on July 4.  </P> <P> Cherkasov, playing in his first Grand Prix quarterfinal last year, gave Lendl a  tough time before losing 6-4, 6-4 on clay in Hamburg.  </P> <P> "It was a very good match for me," Cherkasov. "I think it was the best in my  career."  </P> <P> Edberg, the 1985 and 1987 Australian champion now ranked No. 3, took on a  stranger in Wheaton, a 20-year-old with a powerful serve-and-volley game.  </P> <P> Edberg, the only quarterfinalist not to drop a set in his first four matches,  tuned up for the meeting with a five-set doubles match in the 140-degree  courtside heat Tuesday.  </P> <P> Wheaton, from Lake Minnetonka, Minn., made it to the quarters by beating No. 5  Aaron Krickstein, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Wheaton may have been a little lucky to get so far -- with Krickstein slowed by  a pulled groin and third-round opponent Mark Woodforde retiring in the second  set with a sprained ankle -- but is widely regarded as one of the top young  players.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old Wilander, winner of the Australian in 1983, 1984 and 1988, has  been struggling the past year. He faced the toughest of the young players, the  22-year-old, second-ranked Becker, winner of three Wimbledon titles and the  U.S. Open last year.  </P> <P> Becker won six of their previous eight matches, losing only on the clay at the  French Open. In their last meeting, in the Davis Cup final in December, Becker  trounced Wilander, 6-2, 6-0, 6-2.  </P> <P> The fourth quarterfinal match pitted 12th-ranked Yannick Noah of France against  Mikael Pernfors, the Swedish-born former NCAA champion at Georgia who benefited  from the default of John McEnroe.  </P> <P> Noah, who beat Lendl en route to winning a tuneup event in Sydney, won both his  previous matches with Pernfors in close matches, once on clay in 1985 and  another on hard courts in 1986.  </P> <P> The heat at this $3 million tournament Tuesday turned the stadium into the  world's largest sauna and tested the fortitude of the top players.  </P> <P> If there were an award for durability, it would go to the winners of the  longest doubles match in Australian Open history -- South Africans Pieter  Aldrich and Danie Visser, who outlasted Americans Scott Davis and Robert Van't  Hof in a five-hour, 29-minute match.  </P> <P> Aldrich and Visser's winning score was 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 23-21.  </P> <P> The match, which began in the hottest part of the day and ended in the balmy  evening, was 19 minutes longer than a five-set, 84-game marathon won two years  ago by Andrew Castle and Roberto Saad against Glenn Michibata and Grant  Connell.  </P> <P> "It helped a lot that the sun went down later in the match," Visser said. "We  started feeling cramps because we were losing a lot of liquid. When the sun  went down we stopped sweating so much."  </P> <P> In earlier women's quarterfinal matches, top-seed Steffi Graf defeated Patty  Fendick, 6-3, 7-5; No. 6 seed Mary Joe Fernandez beat Zina Garrison, 1-6, 6-2,  8-6; West Germany's Claudia Porwik beat Angelica Gavaldon, 6-4, 6-3, and No. 4  seed Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia defeated Bulgaria's Katerina Maleeva, 6-4,  6-3.  </P></p>

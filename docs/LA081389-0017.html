			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ON SMART &amp; FINAL IGNORED COMPANY'S SIDE  </P> <P> When I read Harry Bernstein's labor column of Aug. 1, "Many Americans Share  Miners' Problem," I was dismayed to find that untruths, half-truths and  innuendoes had been so freely used to attack Smart &amp; Final Iris Corp. and  falsely portray the facts and circumstances of its current labor situation.  </P> <P> Bernstein never requested comment from either myself or, to my knowledge, any  other Smart &amp; Final representative. Had he done so, he would have been  provided the following information contradicting the "facts" presented:  </P> <P> First, Smart &amp; Final never "refused to continue paying health-care premiums  for retirees." Health care was provided to retirees under the terms and  conditions of the Teamster/Employer Health and Welfare Trust. Smart &amp; Final  only contributed on behalf of active employees.  </P> <P> Last February, when negotiations broke down and Smart &amp; Final implemented  its final offer, the trust advised us that they could no longer accept  contributions for active employees and had unilaterally elected to terminate  coverage for retired employees. We felt this decision was in direct violation  of the terms and conditions of the trust and proceeded to file suit in federal  court on behalf of all retirees in order to compel continued coverage.  </P> <P> In June, when it became clear to me that the lawsuit would not be quickly  resolved, I informed all retirees by letter that Smart &amp; Final would assume  responsibility for all medical coverage until the lawsuit was resolved. I  realize that the image of retired persons being denied medical care makes for  sympathetic prose, but it is clearly a far distance from the truth in this  instance.  </P> <P> Second, Bernstein makes reference to Smart &amp; Final leaving certain  "employer associations" to gain competitive advantage over its "industry  rivals." Smart &amp; Final did belong to the Food Employers Council, or FEC, a  group of retail supermarket operators, when it owned the Thriftimart operation.  When Thriftimart closed, the reason for belonging to the FEC ceased to exist.  </P> <P> Smart &amp; Final is clearly a different operation with different needs than a  retail supermarket chain. We sell products in large quantities to business  customers, have no butchers or retail clerks and use different methods of  distribution. As a result, we resigned from the FEC in 1984 and did not  participate in the FEC negotiations last October or in the previous round of  negotiations in 1985. It is difficult to gain a competitive advantage against  "rivals" with whom we do not compete.  </P> <P> Finally, Bernstein accuses Smart &amp; Final of "reducing the wages and  benefits of active workers." He fails to mention that the wage offer that Smart  &amp; Final did implement in February of this year actually pays more per hour  to its employees than the "industry" contract. He also neglects to mention that  when that offer was extended to Smart &amp; Final employees, over two-thirds of  them left the picket lines and returned to work. Further, that offer did not  "reduce" anything. In fact, Smart &amp; Final has gone out of its way to  provide the same (or in some cases better) benefits than the previous contract.  </P> <P> Given the ready availability of the facts in this case, I must conclude that it  was Bernstein's intent to serve Teamster interests without regard to the truth.  </P> <P> ROGER M.

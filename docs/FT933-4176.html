			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Frankfurt finally delivers goods THE Bundesbank yesterday ended its cat-and-mouse game with the international financial markets and delivered the cut in interest rates that everybody had been waiting for. After more than two months of refusal to cut the internationally sensitive discount rate - a stubbornness which led directly to the July upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism - the German central bank chopped the discount and the Lombard rates by half a percentage point to 6.25 and 7.25 per cent respectively. The move brought confused and conflicting reactions inside Germany. The German government, in the shape of Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said the move would 'support efforts to restore growth within and outside Germany'. German industry, on the other hand, was much more sceptical. The German chamber of commerce and industry (DIHT) described the move as 'questionable' in the light of continuing excess growth in money supply. 'If interest rates are cut again in spite of excessive money supply growth, the German Bundesbank's money supply-oriented anti-inflation policy will be thrown into doubt,' it said. The DIHT, like many economists, also doubted that the move would have any significant direct effect on German economic growth - because long-term interest rates are already at a historic low point. Its beneficial effect, they said, will only come indirectly through export growth, if other European economies can expand faster as a result of the interest rate move. Mr Franz-Josef Link, of the IW economic institute in Cologne, attached to the federation of German industry, cautioned against seeing the latest recovery in the growth rate of gross domestic product - up by 0.5 per cent between the first and second quarters - as anything more than stagnation. For some time the markets have been expecting the Bundesbank to resume its gradualist approach to interest rate cuts. Long-term interest Bund yields have sunk to 30-year lows in anticipation of further easing and the German stock-market has for weeks been buoyant. The DAX index of 30 leading German shares closed marginally down yesterday and long bund yields closed unchanged at 6.13 per cent. There were technical and political reasons for the timing and size of the cut. The technical reason is that for nearly six weeks the repurchase rate at which the Bundesbank supplies wholesale funds to the banking sector has been extremely close to the discount rate. The Bundesbank's freedom of manoeuvre in its money market operations is limited under such an interest-rate constellation and observers expected the discount rate to fall by at least 25 basis points to create a decent gap between it and the repo rate. The political reason is that the Bundesbank never likes to be seen to be giving into international pressure when it makes its rate cuts. The last meeting of the policy-making council coincided with a visit to Bonn from the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur: not a good moment to cut. The next meeting is immediately after the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meeting in Washington. To cut then might also seem like bowing to outside calls for cheaper money. These were not the arguments used by the Bundesbank to justify yesterday's move however. In a terse statement, the bank explained that there had recently been signs of a gradual slowing down of the inflation rate - and that money supply growth was likely to turn out to be less pronounced than had been feared after the Bundesbank's currency interventions last month. This positive message was amplified in comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president: he said the pressure on prices was quietening down. The Bundesbank believes that its gradualist approach has succeeded in restraining inflation - despite signs to the contrary. 'We wouldn't want to create the impression that Germany doesn't have any inflationary problems any more,' Mr Schlesinger told the VWD news agency, 'but they are less pronounced than they were'. The annual inflation rate was 4.2 per cent in August - more than twice the Bundesbank's long-term 2 per cent target. In July M3 - or broad money - grew well outside the the 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range for the fourth month in a row. The 7.4 per cent seasonally adjusted, annualised growth in July M3 was cited as a reason why rates were not cut a fortnight ago. Against this background, Mr Schlesinger's words and the interest rate cut served to stimulate hopes of inflation below 4 per cent cent in October and money supply back within the target range. This would allow further cuts in short-term rates before the end of the year. Mr Schlesinger said the council had reached its decision to cut rates after assessing evidence that the German economy had passed its low point, citing the fact that the small increase in western German GDP in the second quarter of the year. 'We weighed all this up, without sharing in any great optimism,' he said, reiterating the central bank's stance that German industry cannot rely on interest rate cuts to reverse a recession or to remove the need for structural measures.</p>

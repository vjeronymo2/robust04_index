			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: US judge overturns Price Waterhouse jury verdict A US JUDGE has overturned a Dollars 338m jury verdict brought by Standard Chartered against Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, in a move which paves the way for a new trial next spring. Judge John Sticht, of the Superior Court of Arizona, has granted PW's motion for a new trial, which was submitted in July following a verdict last May against the firm on seven of eight charges. In a memo circulated yesterday to all his Price Waterhouse partners, Mr Shaun O'Malley, the senior partner in the US, says the judge called the jury verdicts 'so irreconcilably inconsistent as to be blatantly erroneous'. But Standard Chartered said last night that it remained confident in its claims and would be 'pressing forward to recover the full amounts, together with the interest now accruing'. It has the options of appealing the judge's verdict, pursuing the new trial or entering out-of-court discussions for a settlement. The PW memo said no such discussions had yet taken place. The court case stems from a lawsuit brought in 1988 by Standard Chartered which alleges that Price Waterhouse had failed to identify and report 'material deficiencies' in the loan portfolio and internal controls system of United Bancorp, an Arizona bank bought by the UK bank in 1987. Standard Chartered paid Dollars 335m for United, which made heavy losses, and 18 months later sold it to Citicorp for Dollars 207m. The UK bank's lawsuit claimed that Price Waterhouse was negligent in its 1985 and 1986 audits of United Bancorp. The trial in Arizona lasted 11 months until last May, and has already cost Price Waterhouse and Standard Chartered millions of pounds in legal fees. If Judge Sticht had not granted the application for a new trial, PW would have been forced to produce a bond of at least Dollars 200m before it could have appealed the verdict to a higher court. Standard Chartered announced the sale of 13 commercial buildings in Hong Kong housing some of its branches, which it will lease back from the local purchaser. The sale proceeds before disposal costs will be Pounds 64m (Dollars 97.3m) while the cost of the properties including improvements was Pounds 9m. The bank said the sale would increase its Tier 1 capital by Pounds 55m.</p>

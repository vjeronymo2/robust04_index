			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "State Duma's June Schedule. </F> Great Deal of Space Given to Army Topics"]    [Text] Our readers want to know what draft laws relating  to defense and army life parliamentarians will be examining in  June. Before naming some of them, announced in the June  schedule, I have to say that the mention of a particular draft  law (even when a specific date is given for the discussion) does  not necessarily mean that the deputies will actually get round  to it.    For instance, the draft State Duma decree "On Amendments to  the 19 May 1993 Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree `On  Some Measures Connected With the Implementation of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Military Service Obligation and Military  Service"'" is scheduled for discussion on 10 June. Let us  remember that this decree was about reducing or suspending the  effect of the preferential articles giving entitlement to  deferment of conscription for military service. The  conscription situation today is such that adjustments in the  direction of further reducing the list of "privileged persons"  are simply inevitable.    An examination of the draft federal law "On Amendments to  the  Russian Federation Law `On Defense'" is planned for 17 June. A  whole range of amendments is envisaged, connected with the  military doctrine that has been adopted and the further reform  of the Russian Federation Armed Forces.    On 22 June the deputies may adopt on second reading the  draft  law "On the Procedure for Providing Russian Federation Military  and Civilian Personnel for Participation in Operations to  Maintain or Restore International Peace and Security and Other  Types of Peacemaking Activity." The first reading was on 16  March and the second was planned for the end of April. We are  now in June. And our peacemakers are already moving up into  position in Abkhazia...    The draft law "On Amendments and Additions to the Russian  Federation Law `On the Russian Federation State Border'" is  slated for its first reading on 22 June (how symbolic!).    The draft law "On the Defense Order," which has been a long  time in gestation, will be submitted for the supreme assembly's  perusal on 24 June.    The State Duma Council is to discuss in June draft laws "On  Alternative Service," "On Military Courts," "On Russian  Federation Counterintelligence Organs," "On Social Services for  the Elderly and Infirm," and "On Veterans." The latter draft  law, strangely enough, since it concerns our old people, is a  contender for the "longest playing" title. This law has been  gestating for an amazingly long time, considering that it had  its first reading back last fall in the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet.</p>

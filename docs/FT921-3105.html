			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Pharaoh Sanders Quartet - Jazz Cafe You could hardly blame Sanders for asking the crowd not to smoke during his set. The technique of circular breathing which he employs, where air is drawn in at the same time as it is expelled continuously across the reed, brings a whole new dimension to the problems of passive smoking. On a good night, a fierce saxophonist like Sanders will exchange the entire volume of a small club like the Jazz Cafe through his tenor many times over. These have been good nights at the Camden club with John Coltrane's sideman teamed up with his own favourite pianist, Bill Henderson III and drummer Idris Muhammed. However, if the packed house was there to hear the wild abstraction for which Sanders is famed, the night was not given over entirely to screeching. Instead, Sanders delivered a set of bludgeoning hard bop finished off with a touch of the avant-garde, and raucous but accessible solos to satisfy the strongest appetite. Opinions differ over the right ingredients for hard bop: if it is the harsh side of bebop, with blue inflection, and some deliciously abrasive improvisation on the side, that is what Sanders is up to nowadays. The quartet came to the stand late and, judging from the pent up energy released in the first number, had used that extra time in the dressing room getting psychologically pumped up. While Russell Blake on electric bass uncoiled so violently it seemed a string might be broken, Henderson yomped across the keyboard with an exuberantly clanging blues march set to Muhammed's forceful time. Against this explosive rhythm, Sander's corrosive sound, cutting in and out of the lowest registers, was bewitching in its strength. Towards the end of what I took to be 'So What]', the magic extended to Sander's taking the instrument away from his lips but continuing to play using the valves and a still resonating bell. To close, Sanders put down the sax and brandished a huge skein of shakers; Henderson conversed with an African talking drum tucked under his arm and Muhammed beat a little gong very hard. With his broad, white goatee which seems glued to carved mahogany features, Sanders cuts a striking figure. His association with Coltrane and Albert Ayler has him pigeonholed with the 1960s improvisers. But with the stabbing right hand of Henderson, the blistering bass of young Blake and non-stop pounding of Muhammed behind him he sounds more contemporaneous with his young audience suddenly. Had Courtney Pine not been busy at Canary Wharf's Cabot Hall, he would have enjoyed it.</p>

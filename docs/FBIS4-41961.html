			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential candidate Aleksandr Lukashenko who is  firmly in the lead after the first round of presidential  elections in Belarus and three of his campaign officers were  attacked by police outside his office at the Government House in  Minsk on Monday [27 June].    Yesterday, the House Management handed Lukashenko the keys  to  his office where the anti-corruption commission he led had  worked before. However, the office was again closed this  morning.    Interior Minister Aleksandr Danko issued an order to provide  Lukashenko with security guards of the chief state security  department who accompanied him to his office on Tuesday.    In an interview with INTERFAX, Lukashenko said that he was  told by members of another security unit of the department  outside the Government House that police were ordered not to let  him into the building.    Lukashenko spoke of a police assault on himself and his  campaign officers outside the House. All four received minor  injuries, a fact confirmed by ambulance workers.    Lukashenko himself has formally appealed to the Prosecutor  General for investigating the incident provoked, as he put it,  by "Interior Minister Aleksandr Danko."    Lukashenko who won the biggest number of votes in the first  round now faces a run-off against Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich.</p>

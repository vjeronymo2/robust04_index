			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK water Rumblings from deep underground have long signalled that Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, would get tough with the water industry. Concern over rapidly rising bills meant that action was required. The lowish rate of return of between 5 and 6 per cent which Mr Byatt suggested is part of the squeeze. His efforts to defer part of the capital programme required by EC directives should also slow the rise in bills. Mr Byatt clearly wants higher borrowing by companies to take part of the strain. Yet the industry is waving rather than drowning. The rate of return is more like 5.5 to 6.5 per cent when it is adjusted for the fact that, unlike British Gas, water companies pay no mainstream corporation tax. The timescale for reducing returns has been extended to 10 years and the asset base on which they will be calculated will also be more generous than originally assumed. That much flexibility will be needed since some companies will see interest cover fall and gearing rise sharply in the next few years. Excessive tightness now could make the strain on balance sheets intolerable. Further reductions in required capital expenditure and efficiency gains will help, but several companies will still need price rises significantly above the rate of inflation. Mr Byatt may be forced to accept either that he cannot hold down prices as much as he would want, or that water charges will vary substantially across the country.</p>

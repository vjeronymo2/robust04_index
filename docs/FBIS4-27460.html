			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh -- Banks function to take deposits and  make loans to the public. On either side of the balance sheet,  the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC] Economic and Monetary  Statistics Review for February aims to deliver an optimistic  report.    "In the banking sector, one feature which needs to be  highlighted is the buoyancy in deposits growth," it said.    "It may be recalled that aggregate deposits had shown a dip  in November 1993. There was a recovery in December 1993. The  growth in deposits during the first two months of 1994 has been  remarkable with an increase of more than 30 billion riels  witnessed in each of these months," the report added.    The NBC links the increase to foreign currency deposits  which  reached a new height of 180 billion riels in February. It would  be even more encouraging to see an outright growth in demand  deposits which suggest the extent of development of a nation's  financial structure.    However, intermediation in financial services are being  built  up gradually. A 1992 World Bank report cited the "lack of  public confidence in the banking system" particularly in rural  parts of the kingdom and the "scant earning potential for  depositors with riel-dominated accounts".    It is true that savings as a percentage of GDP only notches  a  low eight per cent, but rural credit schemes are being evolved  and are being custom-made for the local context.    On the assets side of the banking system, the NBC reports  that credit to the private sector "recorded a sizeable decline  from 181.94 billion riels in January to 169.4 or a decline of  6.9 per cent." However, it urges that the decline be "viewed in  the context of a sharp rise of 12.6 per cent witnessed in  January 1994", and also notes that the level of credit to the  private sector for February remains higher than that for  December.    Net claims of the banking system on the public sector remain  unchanged. However, the NBC records a 7.2 billion-riel rise in  credit to the government which it attributes to a decline in  "deposits of the Government with the banking system", which  dipped to 47.5 billion riels from 55 billion riels.    Meanwhile, total foreign exchange assets of the banking  system continue to rise, though not as dramatically as in the  previous two months. February saw a 11.4 billion-riel rise for  forex assets, to reach a total of 321.9 billion riels.    This is a four per cent rise and though not as high as the  21.6 per cent and 19 per cent increase reported for previous  months, the report concluded that "this consistent uptrend in  assets is quite encouraging". A significant increase in forex  assets would provide a support to import activity and structural  adjustment of the economy.    Foreign exchange assets are an important indicator of the  future health of the economy as all official reserve assets are  either held as foreign exchange, as balances with overseas  correspondence banks or through bilateral clearing arrangements.    Overall, the NBC report is confident that the banking system  is "growing from strength to strength".</p>

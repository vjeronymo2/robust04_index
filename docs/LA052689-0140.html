			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY SEEKING MONEY FROM FUND FOR JAILS  </P> <P> County fiscal officers, always seeking ways to fund day-to-day operation of  Orange County Jail, hope to get their hands on an additional $1 million  annually from a fund set up to ease moves into new or expanded jail facilities.  </P> <P> Doug Woodyard of the county's administrative staff said the fund has about $1.8  million in it from assessments on court fines and traffic tickets. It was set  up 18 months ago, he said, at the same time as a similar fund in Solano County  was established by the Legislature. The purpose of both funds is to provide  money for transition staffs and to buy such things as heavy equipment at new or  enlarged jail facilities.  </P> <P> Both funds are scheduled to be terminated July 1, 1991, but Assemblyman Thomas  M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) has introduced a bill to extend the life of the  Solano County fund indefinitely.  </P> <P> Woodyard's office has recommended that Orange County supervisors support  Hannigan's bill and try to have it amended so that it applies to both  jurisdictions.  </P> <P> Woodyard said the fund could still be used for transitions and will be used at  Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange, when and if that facility is doubled in size.  The county began construction there earlier this month, but a Superior Court  judge ordered the work stopped until legal challenges have been resolved.  </P> <P> Woodyard admitted that that the $1 million is not a lot of money in this case.  The annual cost of operating the county's jail facilities is estimated at $55  million to $65 million, he said.  </P> <P> The county's legislative planning committee, which includes all five  supervisors and 11 other county officials, is scheduled to discuss Hannigan's  bill next week.  </P></p>

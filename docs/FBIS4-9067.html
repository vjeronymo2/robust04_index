			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 18 (ATA) -- As regards the April 15  incident with the Yugoslav border guards killing two Albanian  citizens about 150 meters in the territory of former Yugoslavia  [FRY], the spokesman of the Albanian Foreign Ministry says "We  have to do with a barbarous and unjustifiable killing. The  massacre could be avoided and the local mix commission as well  as the group of the Albanian and Serbian experts observed that  the victims carried with themselves no weapon or any other  defensive means. These very grave acts follow other earlier  acts committed against Albanian citizens and run counter to the  most elementary human norms included the respective  international documents and acts. These crimes are part of  constant provocations and brutal behaviour of the Serbian  authorities against the Albanians in general and those who live  in their own territories in Kosova and Montenegro. They intend  to increase tension in the border between the two countries and  in the Balkan region. We do not consider the latest event as a  sporadic border incident, but a deliberate and coordinated act,  taking into account the April 10, 1994 event in Peshkepi of  Gjirokaster. These monstrous acts, in such coordination, aim at  extending the flames of war in former Yugoslavia further in the  south. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of  Albania energetically protested this tragic event through a note  sent to the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  Serbia and Montenegro, in Tirana", the spokesman of the Albanian  Foreign Ministry concludes.</p>

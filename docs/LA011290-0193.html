			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MISS AMERICA RETURNS HOME  </P> <P> Spotting Miss America during her Missouri Capitol homecoming was easy -- just  look for her official escort.  </P> <P> A dozen state troopers, deputy sheriffs and Capitol Complex police, many in  dress uniforms, walked Debbye Turner through visits with the governor, both  chambers of the Legislature, and individual officeholders Wednesday.  </P> <P> Turner, an Arkansas native who is the first Missouri resident to wear the Miss  America crown, also addressed the House and Senate after talking to 400  children in the Rotunda.  </P> <P> Turner explained how others told her she could never be Miss America because  she is black and too short and because her talent -- marimba playing -- was too  oddball for pageants.  </P> <P> "If this marimba-playing, 5-foot-7 minority can be be Miss America, then you  can do anything," she said.  </P></p>

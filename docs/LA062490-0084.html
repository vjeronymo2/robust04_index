			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> RUNNING DOWN THE FANS' ALL-STAR VOTING  </P> <P> In the popularity contest that is the All-Star election, Wade Boggs, Ozzie  Smith and Cal Ripken Jr. appear to be retaining their traditional starting  spots.  </P> <P> These are the most glaring injustices in the 1990 process.  </P> <P> With voting for the July 10 game at Chicago's Wrigley Field scheduled to end  July 2, it is time for a progress report, to evaluate what new damage the  paying patrons have wrought. Here is one man's opinion:  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE  </P> <P> First base -- Mark McGwire is No. 1 in the voting and having an All-Star year.  Unfortunately, it pales compared to that of Cecil Fielder, who is No. 3 in the  voting and should be No. 1.  </P> <P> Second base -- It's an off year for second basemen in the AL. Steve Sax and  Julio Franco are first and second in the voting. Statistically, they probably  should be reversed -- and, anyway, the honor probably should go to transplanted  Jody Reed, a shortstop on the ballot.  </P> <P> Shortstop -- As much as Ripken's durability and defensive play are to be  admired, he has been a .220 hitter for most of the season. Ozzie Guillen and  Alan Trammell should be 1-2 but are 4-6 in the voting.  </P> <P> Third base -- At a fluctuating .270 to .290, well below his career average,  Boggs simply can't be automatic here, particularly when Kelly Gruber, second in  the voting, is superior in every category and even giving Fielder competition  for the runs batted in title.  </P> <P> Catcher -- Terry Steinbach has been one of the league's hottest hitters in June  and may deserve his No. 1 status by July 2, but at this point, Lance Parrish,  seventh in the voting; Pat Borders, sixth, and Sandy Alomar, second, should be  ahead of him.  </P> <P> Outfield -- Can't argue with the electorate's first three of Jose Canseco,  Rickey Henderson and Ken Griffey Jr. One oversight: Ivan Calderon should be  higher than 14th.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE  </P> <P> First base -- Either Will Clark or Glenn Davis is an appropriate choice. The  fans are opting for Clark. Davis is sixth, way too low.  </P> <P> Second base -- Ryne Sandberg is as clear-cut as it gets, but it's nice to see  the fans recognize two rising young players, Delino DeShields and Roberto  Alomar, who are justifiably 2-3 in the voting.  </P> <P> Shortstop -- No apology is needed, but Smith just isn't the wizard he once was.  Barry Larkin, second in the voting, should be No. 1, and Shawon Dunston and  Jose Uribe also should also be ahead of Ozzie.  </P> <P> Third base -- It's hard to separate Chris Sabo, Tim Wallach and Matt Williams.  They are 1-3-4 in the voting, and Sabo seems a legitimate choice at the moment,  but the charging Williams might be the right choice by July 2.  </P> <P> Catcher -- Fans were been doing it right, with Benito Santiago No. 1 and Mike  Scioscia No. 2. Then Santiago broke his arm when hit by a pitch, leaving  Scioscia the best of the rest.  </P> <P> Outfield -- Andre Dawson and Kevin Mitchell are fine as 1-2 in the voting. The  fans have Tony Gwynn third, which isn't bad, but either Bobby Bonilla, who is  fourth, or Lenny Dykstra, now sixth, would be a stronger choice. The biggest  balloting mistake: Joe Carter, vying with Williams for the NL's RBI lead, is  16th among outfielders.  </P> <P> When relief ace Mark Davis rejected their four-year, $12-million offer and  moved to the Kansas City Royals as a free agent, the San Diego Padres had to go  to $5.35 million to sign free agent Craig Lefferts to a three-year contract as  Davis' replacement. Lefferts has proved to be a money-saving bargain and a  better pitcher than Davis -- based, at least, on the latter's performance with  the Royals.  </P> <P> Lefferts has a 5-1 record, 10 saves in 11 chances and a 1.36 earned-run  average. He has stranded the last 19 runners he inherited and 21 of 23 for the  season.  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants, Lefferts' former team, won nine consecutive games and  16 of 17 before Lefferts saved Tuesday night's 4-3 San Diego victory, then  pitched 2 1/3 shutout innings to get credit for Wednesday's 4-3 victory in  which San Francisco closer Steve Bedrosian took the loss.  </P> <P> "I bet the Giants wish they had him back," San Diego Manager Jack McKeon said  of Lefferts. Said Giant Manager Roger Craig: "It's not like we didn't want him  back. He's no surprise. He's pitching well and has a chance to make my All-Star  team."  </P> <P> The Giants may have wanted him back but never made more than a two-year offer,  which is why the fans booed, he believes, when he made his Candlestick Park  appearances last week.  </P> <P> "They were booing (Giant President) Al Rosen, that's the way I looked at it,"  Lefferts said.  </P> <P> American League owners, meeting recently in Cleveland, quietly voted to outlaw  the eye-in-the-sky, the system by which a coach or a club official sits in the  press box and positions the defense via a telephone to the dugout. The ban  stemmed from charges by the Baltimore Orioles that the Chicago White Sox  positioned their eye at ground level to help steal signs. The National League  will continue to permit a roving eye.  </P> <P> Burdened with too many outfielders -- too few of whom, if any, are complete  players at this point in their careers -- Angel Manager Doug Rader has  attempted a judicious juggling act, but the burial of Dante Bichette seems a  sad and costly byproduct of the acquisition of Dave Winfield.  </P> <P> Bichette had started every game but one when Winfield arrived on May 18. He was  leading the league in outfield assists and batting .281 with four home runs and  20 RBIs, a pace that projected to more than 20 homers and 100 RBIs.  </P> <P> Since then, however, Bichette has started only 17 of 35 games through Friday.  His average had dropped to .252. A power hitter who needs regular employment,  he has one hit in his last 25 at-bats, four in his last 38.  </P> <P> There are questions that beg to be answered. Did Bichette develop terminal  flaws between May 17 and 18? Did the promise, the potential, the productivity  suddenly disappear? Why was there no explanation? It's a mystery, but then so  is the continued employment of Devon White, whose trade value is now nil.  </P> <P> While Bichette sits, White has started every game but three since May 18. Yes,  he can play a position that the Angels believe Bichette can't, and that is  important, but White has yet to prove he can adequately fill a position in the  batting order. First or ninth, it is always the same. He had eight hits in his  last 50 at-bats through Friday and a .211 average. Oh well, it is only his 10th  season in pro ball and his fifth with the Angels. The miracle may happen by the  turn of the century.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Bichette seemed in the process of making something happen,  before the plug was pulled.  </P> <P> Strange business.  </P></p>

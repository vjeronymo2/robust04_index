			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (3): Accountants' cash in  -Environmental audits are big business AMIDST much kicking and shoving, environmental consultants are jostling for the fast-growing but increasingly competitive green market. As insults are traded about the ability of individuals and companies to carry out the best job, the industry is still trying to make clear its definitions and lay down standards in response to concerns over the quality of service being delivered. In the meantime, business is coming under increasing public, political and legislative pressure to pay serious attention to environmental auditing, with mixed results. Environmental audits have become big business. The latest edition of the directory of environmental consultants published tomorrow by Environmental Data Services (Ends), based in London, says the total market for consultancy in the UK was about Pounds 400m this year. That was generated by 339 mainstream firms, representing 9,000 professional staff working on 19,000 separate contracts. More than 1,200 of these contracts - or 6.4 per cent - covered environmental auditing alone. It is difficult to draw comparisons with the past because much of the data is being collected for the first time. But the growth has been rapid. There were only 125 environmental consultants in the first edition of the directory in 1989, and 225 in the 1990 version. Most firms are expecting business to escalate rapidly. That growth, particularly at a time of recession, is encouraging many new entrants. Ends estimates that more than 1,000 firms claim to be environmental consultants of sorts. Alongside the traditional players such as Arthur D Little, a host of boutiques have sprung up. At least three of the leading accountancy firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Touche Ross, Coopers &amp; Lybrand - have established special units. That has led to some barbed comments between the competition: What is the quality of the smaller firms? Do the accountants have the appropriate skills? Are the non-accountants too focused on technical rather than managerial and rigorous sampling aspects of the audit? There is still also ambivalence about future growth in the consulting industry. Demand for services is not without its difficulties. While contracts may prove lucrative in the short-term, auditors may in the future run the risk of being sued if they fail to unearth or highlight the significance of potential environmental liabilities such as site clean-up costs forced on their clients at great expense. Yet this competition has to be put in perspective. Most companies still do not have environmental audits. Companies who audit tend to do it irregularly, on only parts of their operations, and entrust the job to in-house staff. When audits do take place, very few of the findings make it into the public domain where they could be more objectively scrutinised. There are exceptions. The chemical industry and some of the other sectors often regarded as more environmentally harmful have long conducted audits of sorts, not only to ensure compliance with regulations but for solid commercial reasons: recycling saves vast amounts of money. More recently, public pressure, good practice guidelines and existing and prospective legislation has begun to have a more wide-ranging impact. The 100 Group of leading finance directors produced one set of guidelines earlier this year. BS7750, the British standard on environmental management systems, is perhaps the document most widely quoted by companies. Among its recommendations is that businesses should produce a publicly available environmental policy, specify targets and conduct regular internal environmental audits. Many point with some concern to the EC's eco-audit requirements, which most companies still regard suspiciously even after intensive lobbying to dilute their power. When initially proposed in 1990, the eco-audit was to be a mandatory scrutiny of environmental facets of all activities in many industries, which would culminate in publication of the results. Over time, it has been diluted so that compliance is entirely voluntary, and need not cover all a company's site. There is still the requirement for external verification of audits, and the corporate fear that the proposals will ultimately become mandatory. In the meantime, the level of disclosure and reliability of environmental reports remains disappointing. A survey in September by Company Reporting, an Edinburgh-based organisation that monitors the annual accounts of UK companies, concluded that most green information provided is disappointingly thin. From a sample of 570 companies, only one third disclosed any environmental information. There are some notable exceptions. Body Shop has probably gone further than most British companies, with a detailed audit. The company has also publicly called for the eco-audit requirement to be made compulsory. Even so, its verification report conducted by Arthur D Little is limited in scope. Most other companies are far less advanced. RTZ is one company which proudly highlights its environmental achievements with a published statement on green policies. But it sees little prospect of making public the results of internal audits in the short-term. It also questions the ability of external auditors to do better than its own staff, or to be told how often audits should be conducted.</p>

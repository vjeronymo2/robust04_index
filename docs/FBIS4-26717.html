			<p>BFN     [By reporters Debin (1795 2430) and Wang Rantong (3769 3544  1749): "Inner Mongolia Central Economic Zone Should Become an  Important Piece in the National Layout of Productive Forces"]    [Text] Superior developmental conditions and an important  strategic position determine that the Inner Mongolia central  economic zone should become an important factor in the national  layout of productive forces. This was a common understanding  reached at the "symposium of the development strategy for the  Inner Mongolia central economic zone" held in Beijing on 13 June.    The symposium was cosponsored by the Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Regional Party Committee and Government and the China  Comprehensive Development Research Institute. Attending were  Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Yun Bulong, Zhou Weide, and Tu Ke, regional  leaders; and Ma Hong, Liu Yunshan, Chen Tonghai, Xu Penghang, Wu  Jie, An Zhiwen, Pei Yingwu, Wang Wenze, Bi Qun, Fan Weitang, Lu  Yanchang, Wang Min, Lin Ling, Liu Shulan, and Zhou Daozhi,  leaders of relevant ministries, committees, and units of the  state.    In his speech, Wang Qun expounded the important strategic  significance in building the Inner Mongolia central economic  zone. He said: Developing the Inner Mongolia central economic  zone is a strategy to make the country prosper and the border  area strong, which has taken shape after earnest investigation  and study based on the state overall economic development plan  and Inner Mongolia's reality. It is an issue not only for Inner  Mongolia but also for the entire country; and it is not only an  economic issue but also a political issue. In the overall  strategy for the state's economic development, the Inner  Mongolia central economic zone will become an important pillar.  Building this economic zone conforms to the state's industrial  policy and the requirements of the state's overall development  strategy and is also conducive to the development and stability  of the border minority nationality areas. Exploitation of the  abundant resources of this zone is all the more conducive to the  state's construction of the energy resources base in the 21st  century and will also effectively promote the endeavors to  strengthen the border area and consolidate national defense and  to achieve the common prosperity of the various nationalities.    The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is a triangle area  along Huang He, which borders on northern Shanxi and Shaanxi and  takes Hohhot, the capital city of the autonomous region, Baotou,  the steel city in the grassland, and Ih Ju League, the sea of  coal, as its mainstay. It holds not only 80 percent of the  world's rare earth, one-sixth of China's coal, abundant iron,  nonferrous metal, and oil and gas, but it also holds one-third  of Inner Mongolia's industrial fixed assets and a half of its  scientific and technical forces. With a substantial industrial  foundation, convenient transport systems, and favorable  conditions for the alignment of industries, it has good  exploitation prospects and a tremendous development potential.    Focusing on the "outlines of the development strategy for  the  Inner Mongolia central economic zone," the participating  leaders, experts, and scholars conducted sincere study and  exploration. They held: A locality should look for new ways of  development if it is to narrow its gap from advanced localities.  Domestic and foreign experiences proved that the most effective  strategy to narrow the gap is giving preferential policies to  key localities and key industries, investing the limited  economic resources in a relatively concentrated manner in the  localities with better conditions for comprehensive development  and a relatively superior economic and social environment to  facilitate their extraordinary development and to turn them into  regional polar nucleus of increase or development center, and  then, through their spreading and transmission role, promoting  the economic growth and social progress of other localities.  The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is one of the  localities with the best conditions to become such a polar  nucleus of increase. In addition, accelerating the development  of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone will help the  shaping of the polar nucleus of increase that effectively  facilitates the continuous escalation of the industrial and  technological structure of the entire Inner Mongolia and will  lead to the economic development and social progress of Inner  Mongolia. It also can be regarded as the best combination  between the state's key industries and the superior localities  suitable for developing these industries and the organic  combination between the emphasis given to industries and that  given to localities and between the preferential policies given  to industries and those given to localities to develop the  priorities of development. In the process of moving the  strategic priorities of state development to the west, this zone  will become the first base for making progress that links the  east to the west. Besides, the Inner Mongolia central economic  zone is an important hinterland of the economic zone around  Bohai Sea and also an important area linking Northeast Asia with  the Eurasian continental bridge. Accelerating the development  and construction of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone  conforms to the state's overall layout of economic development  because it helps link the economy and the market of north,  northeast, and northwest China and the Bohai rim and link  China's economy with the economy of the world.    Some participants familiar with Inner Mongolia's conditions  also pointed out optimistically: Despite the fact that the  "outlines of the development strategy for the Inner Mongolia  central economic zone" have yet to be appraised and improved,  construction of the zone has begun long ago, and many state and  regional key projects built in this zone have made eye-catching  headway. Some comrades pointed out in their speeches: The  world has developed to a new historical stage, and the new world  pattern calls for speeding up the exploitation and construction  of border minority nationality areas and for enabling their  abundant natural resources to play a proper role in economically  consolidating and strengthening the border areas.    The participants also earnestly discussed a series of issues  in building the Inner Mongolia central economic zone and offered  many valuable and constructive opinions. Wu Liji, chairman of  the regional government, and Ma Hong, honorary director of the  State Council Development Research Center and president of the  China Comprehensive Development Research Institute, gave  speeches to summarize the symposium.</p>

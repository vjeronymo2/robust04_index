			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Angola fighting leaves 100 dead MORE THAN 100 people were killed in a battle between forces of the Angolan government and the former rebel movement Unita in the southern city of Lubango yesterday, the Angolan government news agency Angop said, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Government forces now controlled Lubango, capital of Huila province, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Angop as saying. It added that Unita's military commander in the region, Brigadier Padrinho Pilartes, had been captured. Mr Jorge Valentim, spokesman for Unita, earlier accused government forces in Lubango of attacking Unita positions in the city with armoured vehicles, artillery and aircraft. In its report from the Angolan capital Luanda, Lusa quoted Angop as saying that nearly 100 Unita fighters were killed in one gunfight at the Hotel Imperio in Lubango. Mr Valentim, Unita's secretary for information, said earlier that the fighting began yesterday morning and lasted about three hours before UN peace-keeping forces brought about a truce. He said the battle had been sparked off by a government attack on Unita positions, launched by the city's military commander. Angop said Unita forces tried unsuccessfully to capture the local television station and they continued to shell Lubango airport, a key air force base, after fighting in the city had ended. Mr Valentim said Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita's leader, had told UN representatives in Angola that senior officials from Unita and the ruling MPLA should meet next week to put the peace process back on track. Mr Savimbi lost presidential elections to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the MPLA in September Mr Valentim said it was important that the MPLA and Unita meet so that the UN would have grounds for renewing the mandate of its peace-keeping forces in Angola. This expires at the end of January.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Price erosion leaves Microgen at Pounds 6.7m Microgen Holdings, the specialist computer services group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 8.24m to Pounds 6.7m for the year to October 31 despite an 8 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 53.4m. The shares fell 3p to 145p yesterday although the company warned of the downturn when it reported interim results in July, then causing a 12p drop in the share price to 173p. Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said: 'We have suffered price erosion particularly in our UK computer output microfilm business.' However, he was confident about the current year and to back this up the board is holding the final dividend at 5.05p to give a same-again total of 7.25p. Earnings per share were 10.5p (13.8p). 'Because of the cash generative nature of the business, although our dividend cover is only 1.4 (1.9) times, we feel it is appropriate to maintain the dividend.' He said the present year would see a full contribution from the company's Norwegian operations. Also, operating profits of Pounds 6.51m (Pounds 8.28m) reflected a Pounds 500,000 loss in the company's Danish operations which was not expected to be repeated, as well as a Pounds 500,000 loss due to the one-off costs of starting the Demand Publishing division of its electronic publishing business. The company said that the acquisition of the computer output business of JDC was of strategic benefit. 'The important thing is the revenue that Microgen derives from electronic publishing has grown quite strongly and is now 34 per cent of total turnover. 'The area where demand is growing most strongly is becoming an ever bigger part of our business.' The company started its last financial year with cash of Pounds 2.5m and ended with Pounds 1.3m, although it spent Pounds 5m as part of its programme of capital expenditure and Pounds 1.5m on goodwill associated with acquisitions in Norway and Germany. Microgen booked a Pounds 187,000 interest credit (charge Pounds 33,000).</p>

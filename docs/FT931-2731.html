			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Towards the Millennium - Concert Like all the best concepts 'Towards the Millennium' is proving to be simple in principle, endlessly fascinating in its working out. As this rolling festival sweeps through the 20th century, sampling a decade at a time, it cuts across the intertwining lines of development that make up the texture of music history. If anything was designed to belie the outmoded view of musical evolution as a strictly linear process, in which X leads to Y and then on to Z, it is this strictly chronological perspective, which throws up all kinds of historical juxtapositions and short circuits. Monday's programme at the Royal Festival Hall, conducted by Simon Rattle with the London Sinfonietta and its Voices and Chorus, brought together a clutch of folk-tinged works from the 1920s - Bartok's Village Scenes, Janacek's Rikadla, Villa-Lobos' third Choros, Vaughan Williams's Flos Campi, Stravinsky's Les Noces. Far from proving that in the Twenties the forces of modernism suddenly dived for the comforting cover of the folk tradition the concert showed how different strands of music could moved together almost arbitrarily, only to diverge again almost immediately. As a showcase of styles and of vocal and instrumental virtuosity it was a great success too, carefully graded to begin with the faithful replications of the Bartok, played and sung with wonderful pungency by the Sinfonietta forces, and to move neatly into the Janacek nursery rhymes, even though their discontinuity was not aided by Rattle's decision to respect the composer's wishes and to read the texts of each rhyme before it was delivered. The Vaughan Williams appeared as the culmination of this progressive distancing of musical invention from source material. The folksy background to Flos Campi comes to seem increasingly remote and almost spurious, though the rapturous eloquence of Paul Silverthorne's solo viola and the sheer sensuousness of many of the textures was never in doubt. After that Les Noces was honestly bracing, fresh and startlingly original. Almost any work of the 1920s (Wozzeck excepted) would be hard to set against Stravinsky's masterpiece; in this context its ability to make the folk material uniquely its own seemed quite extraordinary. Rattle concentrated throughout on precision and textural clarity; a little more freedom, more hedonism, was needed to make the performance comprehensively definitive.</p>

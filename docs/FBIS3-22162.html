			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb 22 KYODO -- An Environment Agency  affiliate will give a total 405 million yen of subsidies in  fiscal 1994 to 104 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) which  are helping promote preservation of the global environment,  officials said Tuesday [22 February].    But civic groups are critical of the inclusion of an  industry  association -- the Japan Industrial Conference for Ozone Layer  Protection, a group set up by automakers and electrical  appliance manufacturers -- as a recipient of the subsidies.    Among the recipents are 23 NGOs which will receive such  subsidies for the first time from the Japan Environment Corp.    The amount of subsidies to the 23 organizations will total  112 million yen, the officials said.    The subsidies will be disbursed out of a 2 billion yen fund  set up with joint financing from the government and public  gambling proceeds, the officials said.    Projects covered by the subsidies will include one for  planting seedlings of a mangrove whose existence in the  Philippines is threatened by industrial pollution, they said.    A spokesman for the Consumers Union of Japan said, ``it is  outrageous for the JEC to help finance the activities of the  industry association. They should uphold the principle of  having polluters pay for the cost of environmental  preservation.''    An official of another civic group, the Peoples' Forum 2001,  Japan, said, ``government ministries in positions to supervise  business corporations and their industry bodies should not link  up with those business organizations. Rather, they should focus  their assistance on the NGOs led by citizens.''</p>

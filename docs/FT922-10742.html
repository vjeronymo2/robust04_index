			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / GrandMet sells Express Foods' Irish dairy interest GRAND Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, yesterday took a further step in the disposal of its Express dairy and foods business with an agreement to sell Express Foods' Irish dairy interests in a series of deals worth IPounds 99m (Pounds 90m). The Express operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, except for an 80 per cent interest in Carbery Milk Products, are to be sold to Waterford Foods for IPounds 63m. In addition, GrandMet will retain ownership of Express Foods Group (Ireland). The assets of Express Foods Group (Ireland) will consist of IPounds 15m in cash and receivables after the deal is completed. The Express stake in Carbery Milk Products, a Cork-based cheesemaker, is to be sold for IPounds 21m to Carbery Creameries, a co-operative of dairy farmers which supply the business with liquid milk. The businesses being acquired from GrandMet by Waterford are Virginia Milk Products, Express Northern Foods and WED, an Express Dairies joint venture with Waterford Co-op. The deal will make Waterford the leading dairy group in Ireland, with projected annual sales of IPounds 700m and control over about a fifth of Ireland's liquid milk output. At present, Waterford has 29 per cent of the liquid milk market nationally and 72 per cent in Dublin. Waterford has spent IPounds 215m on acquisitions in the UK, the US and Ireland since it was floated on the stock market in 1988. It has 25 per cent of the liquid milk market in the north-west of Britain, 15 per cent of the UK fruit juice market and 45 per cent of the US condensed milk market. Yesterday's deals, which are subject to Irish regulatory approval, provide for Waterford to continue supplying GrandMet with cream for its Bailey's Original Irish Cream liqueur. In November, GrandMet sold its Express Dairy and Eden Vale businesses to Northern Foods for Pounds 359m. The only Express businesses remaining with GrandMet are the UK cheese and food service operations. GrandMet decided to sell the Express operations because they do not fit with its current strategy of focusing on international branded businesses. Acquisitive Waterford, Page 28</p>

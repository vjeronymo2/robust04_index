One should use every opportunity to create  a permanent work tone in our cooperation, said today in Tbilisi  the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan. At a  press-conference following immediately their private meeting  with Eduard Shevardnadze, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who came here  with a single-day visit, observed that practically all problems  of mutual interest were concerned during the visit. Much  attention has been given in particular to the regional problems,  to situation in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh.    "Together with Eduard Shevardnadze we came to a conclusion  that there is no alternative to the peaceful settlement of such  conflicts, declared Ter-Petrosyan. He also noted that it is  highly undesirable if the Armenians living here would be  involved in the ethnical conflict in Georgia.    Answering the SNARK's question, what is the position of  Armenian President to the idea of a Caucasian 3+1 [Armenia,  Azerbaijan and Georgia plus Russia] dialogue, proposed earlier  by the Georgian head, Ter-Petrosyan told: "We have confirmed our  intention to organize the meetings at high-level between  Armenia, Turkey [as received] and Azerbaijan in presence of  Russia. They must become traditional".</p>

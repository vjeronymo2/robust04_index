			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT;  </P> <P> WOLVES FIGHTING CRIME GO 'B-A-A-A';  </P> <P> IT'S ONE THING TO OPPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY, ANOTHER TO PRETEND SUPPORT WHILE  ERECTING RULES TO THWART IT.  </P> <P> The House of Representatives is poised to take a major step backward in the  fight against violent crime. In a bill purporting to be an anti-crime measure,  the House Judiciary Committee has sent to the floor a proposal that would  effectively abolish the death penalty in this country.  </P> <P> An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the death penalty is a just  punishment for the most heinous crimes. Thirty-six states have adopted capital  punishment. Yet, for more than a decade, these laws have been rendered almost  unenforceable by a system that allows convicted murderers to delay  indefinitely, and ultimately to avoid, imposition of their sentences. After  exhausting all appeals, murderers are allowed to file endless habeas corpus  petitions in state and federal court, raising largely technical challenges to  their convictions and sentences.  </P> <P> The writ of habeas corpus originally was a legal device used to challenge  attempts by the government to seize and detain an individual without trial.  During the Warren court era, the writ was converted into a right to multiple  appeals of issues already decided. This radical expansion of the scope of  habeas corpus has allowed inmates sentenced to death to nullify their sentences  through strategic delay.  </P> <P> As of 1988, the average delay from time of sentencing to time of execution of a  capital sentence was almost seven years. In that same year 296 individuals were  convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death while only 11 capital  sentences were actually carried out. Obviously, such delay undermines the  deterrent and retributive force of the death penalty and breeds frustration and  disrespect for our criminal justice system.  </P> <P> The case of Robert Alton Harris illustrates the point. In 1978, while on parole  for voluntary manslaughter, Harris shot two teen-age boys to steal their car  for a robbery. Later, he confessed to the murders. He was convicted of  first-degree murder and sentenced to death by a California jury in 1979. In  1981, the California Supreme Court upheld this conviction and sentence, finding  that "none of the many contentions raised by (Harris) has merit." Since that  time, Harris has filed several state and four federal habeas petitions, each of  which has been rejected. His sentence has still not been carried out.  </P> <P> A panel of jurists chaired by retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. has offered a  solution to this problem. If a state provides those on Death Row with counsel  at state expense in state habeas corpus proceedings, the prisoner will get only  two "bites at the apple" -- one state proceeding and one full federal review.  No further habeas corpus petitions could be filed unless a claim of factual  innocence were raised. The Bush Administration, the National Assn. of Attorneys  General and the National District Attorneys Assn. support the principles behind  Justice Powell's reform proposals. The House bill, far from curing present  abuses, would make matters worse.  </P> <P> First, the House proposal rejects the Powell Committee's quid pro quo  principle. It affirmatively encourages the filing of successive habeas corpus  petitions containing claims unrelated to guilt or innocence. At the same time,  it imposes requirements for state-appointed counsel that very few lawyers can  meet and even fewer state taxpayers can afford. Under the House proposal,  convicted murderers like Harris would go on avoiding punishment by raising  alleged technical "defects" in their sentences -- "defects" that have nothing  to do with their guilt or innocence.  </P> <P> Second, the House proposal overrules two recent Supreme Court decisions that  attempt to provide some reasonable safeguards against habeas corpus abuse. In  Teague vs. Lane, the Supreme Court held that prisoners cannot use habeas corpus  to challenge their convictions based on judicial decisions that were not even  rendered at the time of their trial and appeals. The House proposal overrules  Teague, and thus renders every criminal conviction in the nation subject to  constant challenge based on cases that have not yet even been decided. The  Judiciary Committee proposal also overrules the court's decision in Wainwright  vs. Sykes. The Sykes decision requires that defendants follow state procedural  rules in order to preserve claims for federal review, thus preventing criminal  defendants from "sandbagging," that is, from holding back their claims in state  court only to raise them years later in a federal proceeding. The House  proposal would effectively reward defendants who ignore state procedural rules.  </P> <P> It is one thing to openly and honestly oppose the death penalty outright -- a  position the American people have rejected. It is another thing entirely to  proclaim support for the death penalty in order to curry political favor while  at the same time voting to erect a labyrinth of procedural rules to prevent the  penalty from ever being applied. This crime bill is a sheep in wolf's clothing.  </P></p>

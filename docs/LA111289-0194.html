			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> CHILDREN WHO DRESS FOR EXCESS;  </P> <P> TODAY'S YOUNGSTERS HAVE BECOME FIXATED WITH FASHION. THE RIGHT LOOK ISN'T  ENOUGH -- IT ALSO HAS TO BE EXPENSIVE.  </P> <P> When 15-year-old Michael Thomas left home for school last May, he couldn't have  been prouder. On his feet, thanks to his mother's hard work, were a pair of  spanking new Air Jordans -- $100 worth of leather, rubber and status that to  today's youth are the Mercedes-Benzes of athletic footwear.  </P> <P> The next day it was James David Martin, 17, who was strolling down the street  in Thomas' new sneakers, while Thomas lay dead in a field not far from his  school. Martin was arrested for murder.  </P> <P> For the Baltimore school system, Thomas' death was the last straw. He was the  third youngster to have been killed over his clothes in five years. Scores of  others had been robbed of name-brand sneakers, designer jogging suits, leather  jackets and jewelry.  </P> <P> This fall, the school board instituted an exclusionary dress code. Devised by  parents, students and educators, it prohibits leather skirts and jackets,  jogging suits, gold chains and other expensive items.  </P> <P> Clothes, said board president Joseph Smith, had just gotten out of hand.  </P> <P> Across the nation, parents, school officials, psychologists and even some  children agree.  </P> <P> They say that today's youngsters, from New York's poverty-ridden South Bronx to  Beverly Hills, have become clothes fixated. They worry over them, compete over  them, neglect school for them and sometimes even rob and kill for them.  </P> <P> This obsession with clothing, say those who study it, is fueled by the visual  media and advertising, is nurtured by overindulgent parents and is reinforced  by youthful peer pressure and the child's overriding desire to fit in.  </P> <P> And, they note, the clothing industry is using advertising to court today's  youngsters at a younger age and with much greater intensity.  </P> <P> "All of these people understand something that is very basic and logical, that  if you own this child at an early age, you can own this child for years to  come," said Mike Searles, president of Kids 'R' Us, a chain of specialty  children's stores. "Companies are saying, 'Hey, I want to own the kid younger  and younger and younger.' "  </P> <P> Thus, as early as age 4, many of today's children embark on a frenetic quest  for the right clothes with the right style and the right name in order to  maintain the right look.  </P> <P> For schoolchildren, clothes no longer represent just good grooming; they have  become symbols of status, indicators of wealth and a passport into the  mainstream of today's childhood.  </P> <P> "We've seen that to today's kids, the clothes and footwear are a sense of who  they are," said Betty Richardson, vice president of marketing for Reebok. "They  represent what they think to be special and what they think to be important to  them."  </P> <P> And what is important, youngsters say, are name brands -- Nike, Reebok, L.A.  Gear, Guess, Bugle Boy, Jimmy Z, Cavarrichi, Edwins, Benetton, Esprit, Public  Image, Gitano, Jordache, Ultra Pink and dozens more.  </P> <P> They wear the names like badges of honor. Show up for school without them,  students say, and they may be ridiculed, scorned and sometimes even ostracized  by their classmates.  </P> <P> "When people look at you and you're not wearing something that has a name  brand, they'll comment on it," said Aime Lorenzo, an 11th grader at Beach High  School in Miami.  </P> <P> "People will tease you and talk about you, say you got on no-name shoes or say  you shop at K mart," said Darion Sawyer, 10, of Tench Tillman Elementary School  in Baltimore. Children have developed derisive nicknames for non-name brands --  "bo bos, no names and fish heads."  </P> <P> One group of Miami sixth-graders have even developed a sarcastic couplet: "Bo  bos cost $1.99. Bo bos make your feet feel fine."  </P> <P> Youngsters, naturally, try to avoid such taunting. Jessica Hoffman, 11, spent  three hours earlier this year trying to decide what to wear for her first day  at Walter Reed Junior High School in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It sounds stupid," she said, "but what I was worried about was whether people  would like what I was wearing."  </P> <P> Schoolmate Tim Baca picked out his first-day outfit three days before school  started.  </P> <P> "I think there are very few people who dress for themselves," Shelly Ann  Gouldborne, a Miami High School student, said of her contemporaries.  </P> <P> Educators complain that because of such attention to attire, schools from the  elementary level to high school have become fashion shows as students try to  either outdo each other or just keep up with rapidly changing trends.  </P> <P> "I've seen kids come in with wallets and purses that must be well over $100,  and I can't figure out why a kid would spend that much money," said Alan  Joseffberg, counselor at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. "And they all have  to have a label on their jeans."  </P> <P> Robert Davis, a teacher at a middle school in one of Miami's poorer  neighborhoods, said as a class exercise he and his class priced the clothes one  student was wearing. It came to $180.  </P> <P> "And that was just for one day," he said.  </P> <P> In many cases, students are so concerned about what they and their classmates  are wearing, they forget what they came to school for, educators said. Teasing  and arguments over clothes, particularly at the elementary level, result in  fights and disruptions. On the high school level, counselors report that more  and more students are working, often so they can keep up their wardrobes.  </P> <P> "Everybody is spending huge amounts on clothes and the kids who can't afford it  -- instead of doing homework and studying -- are taking jobs after school just  to buy designer jeans," said Patrick Welsh, a high school English teacher in  Washington, D.C. "It's crazy."  </P> <P> In response, scores of public schools, mainly in Eastern cities, have  voluntarily adopted school uniforms to cut down on competition. Paradoxically,  educators say, in the current fashion climate, dressing students alike allows  them greater freedom to be individuals.  </P> <P> But elsewhere, parents complain that their children are pressing to keep up.  </P> <P> "My daughter wants the $60 pair of jeans, but we're a $30 household," said Pat  Anderson, who lives in Geneva, Ill., just outside Chicago. "Maybe if we had a  $300,000-a-year income, that would be fine. But we're on a limited budget and  there's no way we can afford this stuff."  </P> <P> "Money is always a battle," said Char Christian, who lives in the Chicago  suburb of Hinsdale. "I am torn trying to determine the difference between what  she needs and what she wants."  </P> <P> "It's awful," said Lissa Thompson of Orange County, the mother of two  daughters. "It bothers me that children who are so young -- 7 and 9 -- are  aware of things that are so unimportant. Don't get me wrong, I like nice  clothes too, but I think there's a time and a place to be a kid. This is no  time for them to be preoccupied with what you put on every day."  </P> <P> Psychologists say that an interest in trends and fashion, particularly at the  older ages, is just a part of growing up.  </P> <P> "Some of this whole clothes business has to do with a normal developmental  process," said Maryland psychologist Andrea Vanderpool, "but I think it takes  on a more dangerous kind of aura when you see the lengths that these kids have  to go to to look like everybody else and how the kids who don't look like  everybody else are treated."  </P> <P> For clothing models, children look increasingly to the visual media --  television, video and even movies. And, advertising executives say, there is no  group more susceptible to advertising than youngsters.  </P> <P> Nancy Shalek, president of Shalek Advertising Agency, which has handled  accounts for a number of children's clothing lines, is also a mother who is  concerned about the effect of advertising on today's youth.  </P> <P> "Advertising at its best is making people feel that without their product,  you're a loser," she said. "Kids are very sensitive to that. If you tell them  to buy something, they are resistant. But if you tell them they'll be a dork if  they don't, you've got their attention. You open up emotional vulnerabilities  and it's very easy to do with kids because they're the most emotionally  vulnerable."  </P> <P> Peer pressure can also be a powerful force.  </P> <P> One result is readily apparent in the shopping cycle. Stores say the two  biggest shopping periods for school clothes are the week before school begins  and the week after school begins.  </P> <P> "The kids go to school and they find out somebody is wearing Reebok instead of  Nike or acid-washed jeans instead of tapered," Searles said. "So the desire to  fit in drives to more purchases that are totally peer-related."  </P> <P> But, observers say, parents can also unwittingly add pressure.  </P> <P> Prof. Carol Seefeld of the University of Maryland's Institute for Child Study  sees too many acquisitive, success-sodden adults chasing after too few  superficial advantages for their children.  </P> <P> "It's the Reagan 'You are what you spend' mentality," she said. Seefeld said  that parents too often have a need to turn their kids into pint-size status  symbols.  </P> <P> "I have parents who tell me they buy $50 Nikes for their kids because the kids  really want them. I know developmentally that a 4-year-old doesn't know labels  unless it is drummed into him. That's why you end up with pre-adolescents  demanding $100 outfits."  </P> <P> She adds that adolescent pressure and advertising aimed at kids can hardly be  blamed for the huge amount of money being spent on status items for newborns --  $300 strollers, $40 name-brand sneakers, $10 designer booties, $80 coveralls.  </P> <P> Child, a magazine devoted to the nation's newest customers, said a couple can  spend $60,000 in the first two years of a baby's life. In interviews for this  story, some parents admitted spending as much as $4,000 a year to outfit older  children.  </P> <P> "It's a very strong sign of the times when our generation is more  materialistic, where greed and consumption are high on the list," said Lydia  Caffery, an editor with the Tobe Report, a fashion industry trade publication.  "The children learn it from their parents -- who has the nicest car on the  block, who's redecorating the living room."  </P> <P> A related problem, observers say, is that today's parents are no longer the  countervailing voice against their children's desire for unchecked consumption.  Consequently, the relationship between parent and child has changed.  </P> <P> "When I grew up, you wore what you were given," said Searles of Kids 'R' Us.  "Now, the relationship we see is that parents have veto rights as opposed to  selection rights. They can say no, but the child is the one who says yes."  </P> <P> "A lot of parents don't have the control because this society is so confusing  that they try to appease their kids any way they can," psychologist Vanderpool  said. "A lot of it comes from the fact that parents are more confused today in  terms of what's right and what's wrong."  </P> <P> For many youngsters, designer labels are mainly a way of letting other students  know that what they're wearing had high price tags.  </P> <P> Yes, students must have name-brand sneakers to be in step, agreed three pupils  at Burrville Elementary in Washington, D.C., "and they have to cost more than  $40," chimed in one. The others nodded in agreement.  </P> <P> In city after city, when students were asked whether they would wear expensive  name-brand clothes without the designer label, they said no. The reason?  "People wouldn't know what it costs."  </P> <P> "They see it as a way of stating their own personal conviction and  commitments," Shalek said. " 'I'm making a commitment to $60 or $100 versus  $19.99. This is who I am.'  </P> <P> "Or they see it as a sign of how much your parents care for you. Sometimes,  it's 'I feel good about my ability to control my parents because I made them  pay 70 bucks for this.' "  </P> <P> Teens shun discount stores. Linnea Chastain in Chicago refers to them as "loser  stores." One Chicago mother said her daughter and son won't even sit in the car  in a discount store parking lot. A mother in Detroit said her son actually hid  in the restroom when he spotted a classmate as they were shopping in K mart.  </P> <P> Parents, educators and psychologists are disturbed that the emphasis on clothes  reflects heightened class consciousness among youngsters. And they are saddened  that children judge individual worth largely on something so superficial.  </P> <P> "On one hand, who am I to say that a parent who can afford to buy his  16-year-old a Corvette, shouldn't," said Burrville Elementary Principal Walter  O. Henry. "But . . . where do we draw the line? When we start letting children  dictate to us, then we've lost them. Simply because parents are able to buy  whatever their children want, doesn't necessarily mean that it's the best thing  for them."  </P> <P> Lorie Lawson, a Baltimore custodian, agrees. A single parent, Lawson shelled  out $1,000 a year to keep her 10-year-old son in the latest clothes, and only  stopped this year when her son's elementary school went to uniforms.  </P> <P> "I spoiled him rotten," she said. "I bought him Nike. I bought him Reebok. I  bought him BMW sweat shirts. Every day, it was something he just had to have.  And the more I got, the more he wanted.  </P> <P> "It ruined him. His grades went down. He couldn't concentrate in school for  trying to pay attention to what everybody had on.  </P> <P> "It did something to him and it did something to me. I see what it means for a  person to be addicted to cocaine."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LMU'S SCOTT GETS TWO WINS  </P> <P> When the shadows grow long on afternoon double-headers, Loyola Marymount Coach  Chris Smith looks at his pitching corps and sees a thin red line. So far this  season, Smith has lost starting pitchers to injury (Brian Walker) and  ineligibility (Mike McNary).  </P> <P> So it makes Smith especially happy when he sees Darryl Scott still sitting at  the end of his bench.  </P> <P> Smith called Scott's name twice Saturday afternoon, and the senior right-hander  responded with victories in both ends of Loyola's West Coast Conference sweep  of visiting University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Twice in double-headers this season, Smith has looked at All-American catcher  Miah Bradbury as a temporary pitching solution. Bradbury hasn't been scored  upon this season, but that doesn't mean Smith likes having to use him.  </P> <P> Saturday, Bradbury had to come out from behind the plate to work an  inning-and-a-third of relief behind starter Joe Caruso and reliever Chris  Spears.  </P> <P> But when Bradbury got into trouble in a 5-5 tie in the first game, Smith turned  to Scott, who pitched an inning-and-two-thirds of scoreless relief to get the  win in the opener. Loyola won, 6-5, when freshman shortstop Chris Gomez singled  Scott home from third base with two outs in the ninth.  </P> <P> A half-hour later, Scott (now 3-1) was back on the mound. He scattered eight  hits and struck out five in a 4-3 complete-game win.  </P> <P> Saturday afternoon, Loyola backed Scott with some clutch defense. The Lions  turned six double plays on the day. And Loyola (11-6 overall, 6-2 in conference  play) also got just enough timely hitting to get the job done.  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Amato misreads public mood of hostility: The prime minister has made his first error in handling the corruption scandal THE subtle touch has for once deserted Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, and his credibility has been badly damaged by his handling of the corruption scandal. In pressing for a political solution to the complex problems presented by Italy's growing list of political and commercial corruption cases, he misread public opinion, underestimated the opposition of the judiciary, and miscalculated the hostility of parliament. As a result President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has refused to sign the most sensitive item of legislation - a decree depenalising the illicit funding of political parties. The president's action has defused a growing wave of protest over what was seen as an unacceptable attempt to provide an easy way out for businessmen and politicians involved in bribery and the illicit funding of political parties. But it has left the 54-year-old Socialist prime minister looking extremely vulnerable and at odds with a key institutional figure who until now has been his staunchest ally. Mr Amato has also lost a useful cabinet ally, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the environment minister. Mr Ripa de Meana, who last month resigned from the Socialist party because of its involvement in corruption, confirmed yesterday he had tendered his resignation over Mr Amato's handling of the anti-corruption legislation. How then did Mr Amato and his four-party coalition end up in this mess? When the government announced its intention 10 days ago to find a 'political' solution to the problems being created by the corruption scandals there was little protest and much support. The arguments were strong for such an approach. After a year more than a 1,000 senior politicians, businessmen and officials are now under investigation for corruption, and this is considered the tip of the iceberg. The practice of businessmen paying bribes to parties to secure contracts and privileged market positions is now known to have been the norm in almost every aspect of life, but most notably in public works contracts. With a slow legal process that requires six to 10 years for cases to proceed through the courts, the scandals will clog up the entire judicial system - and leave the fate of hundreds, if not thousands, of Italy's elite uncertain during a key moment of transition. The investigations themselves threaten to decapitate the political and business establishment. Another side-effect of the contracts probes is the paralysing of public works. Against this background, the cabinet last Friday proposed new rules on public tendering, aids to restart public works halted by corruption investigations, and a comprehensive decree governing the financing of political parties. The latter reflected the text just approved in a Senate commission. This depenalised illicit funding and removed control of party financing from the judiciary to the government-appointed prefects. It was a serious miscalculation to cut out the judiciary, appearing to offer an easy exit to corrupt politicians by subjecting them to administrative sanctions. But it was compounded by framing the legislation in a decree (which has immediate effect but has to be approved by parliament within 60 days). President Scalfaro on Sunday found a judicious way out by refusing to sign the decree on the grounds that it conflicted with one of the 10 referendums due to be held on April 18, that concerning abolition of public funding of political parties. The government now must either hand the task over entirely to parliament or frame new laws which accommodate the sensitivities of both the public and the judiciary. In the meantime, the referendum on abolition of public financing of political parties has acquired an infinitely higher profile, and could well confuse the even more important referendum concerning the reform of the electoral system. Parliament itself has to find a new head of the constitutional reform commission to replace Mr Ciriaco de Mita, who resigned last week because of the involvement of his brother in a corruption scandal. All these issues weighing down on a weakened government make it ever more important for electoral reform to be agreed, since early elections appear the sole alternative for everyone concerned.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: CBoT approves trading floor expansion Members of the Chicago Board of Trade, the big US futures exchange, have approved plans for a badly-needed trading floor expansion. The expansion plan was voted down twice in 1993. The plan provides Dollars 26m to acquire a building just east of the exchange's LaSalle and Jackson Street headquarters. Members are expected to approve plans to build a 60,000 sq ft trading facility on the site for a cost of about Dollars 171m in another ballot in the spring. The new building, to be connected to the CBoT by a walkway, will more than double the CBoT's trading space, and will be among the most costly trading floors built in the US. The new floor will house the exchange's financial futures and options pits. Construction is expected to begin this summer. Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, won members over by promising not to raise trading fees to pay for the expansion. The exchange intends to finance the project from general revenues. The CBoT traded a record 178m contracts last year, and Mr Arbor has said that with proper facilities and recent growth rates, volume could double by 1998. The CBoT's rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, opened a new trading floor in July, doubling trading space there to 70,000 sq ft. That expansion was completed at a cost of Dollars 27m.</p>

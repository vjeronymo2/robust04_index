Russian Government Wants Foreign Credit Only  Under Its Own Conditions"]    [Text] The Russian Government intends to put an end  to the practice of past years and take a firmer stand regarding  the so-called "tied" credit granted by state export-import banks  of foreign countries. This conclusion can be drawn from the  negotiations that took place yesterday among First Deputy Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko, Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin, and  representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and the  Mitsui Corporation.    "Tied" credit was an extremely popular form of foreign  borrowing for a long time--mainly because of the obvious  advantage for the creditor country. This is explained by the  fact that almost all the funds granted to Russia were ultimately  spent on paying for products or services in the country that  granted the credit (Russia was also obligated to pay interest on  this credit). Moreover, for Western bankers the guarantees from  the Russian Government were also extremely attractive. They  eliminated all the commercial risks of such credit (in the words  of Aleksandr Shokhin, the former Governments of the USSR and  Russia gave these guarantees in an amount of $9 billion). The  Russian Government managed to achieve "independence" of credit  from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for the first time last  summer--"oil credit" was granted without government guarantees.  But they did not manage to get rid of the other essential  shortcoming--the actual support of American machine building  (through obligations to place orders only in the United States).    The delegation from the Japanese Export-Import Bank, headed  by Vice President Makoto Sunagawa, imposed much stricter  conditions, which can even be called political. In addition to  government guarantees for two projects--modernization of the  Yaroslavl Nefteorgsintez Association and the creation of a  Transsiberian telecommunications system (overall cost of $3  million)--the Japanese made further cooperation conditional on  Russia's fulfillment of agreements with the IMF and the Paris  Club of creditor countries.    This position was completely unsuitable to the Russian side:  In the words of Oleg Soskovets, for Russia "there is no point in  giving government guarantees for commercial, paid projects." The  government, in the words of the economics minister, is prepared  to guarantee the Yaroslavl Plant unchanging export quotas  assigned for this project and to exempt it from payment of  customs duties. Additionally, the technical and economic  justifications for the projects considerably dampened the  government's enthusiasm--according to Russian figures, 85  percent of the equipment was to be purchased from Japan and the  rest of it from third countries. (Makoto Sunagawa, to be sure,  sees this ratio differently: 55 percent in Japan and 45 percent  in third countries but not Russia.)    Taking into account this polarity in the initial positions  of  the parties, one can say that the negotiations ended in a  "draw," or, to look at them from practical positions, nothing.  The Japanese confirmed their participation in two projects and  the Russians, stating for the sake of argument that the local  market could be taken up by Americans, convinced the bank  leaders to do clarification work with their government and get  them to back off from the strict linkage between credit and  Russia's agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club.</p>

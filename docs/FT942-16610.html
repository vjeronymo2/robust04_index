			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Widening crackdown on activists clouds Balladur's visit to China China has detained another prominent dissident in a widening crackdown that is certain to inflame western criticism of Chinese human rights behaviour. Police on Thursday detained Mr Xu Wenli, one of the leaders of the 'Democracy Wall' movement of the late 1970s, less than 12 months after he was released from jail after serving a 12-year sentence. News of Mr Xu's detention will have added to the discomfort of Mr Edouard Balladur, the visiting French prime minister, who has been under considerable pressure on the human rights issue. Mr Balladur was reluctant at a press conference to comment on the latest crackdown, saying that 'being efficient (on human rights) very often means being discreet and not saying too much in public'. In Paris, the opposition Socialist party strongly criticised what it claimed was his weak approach on human rights. The French premier arrived in Beijing on Thursday to celebrate the restoration of working relations with China after friendly ties were resumed earlier this year. China's latest foray against its dissident movement follows the detention of Mr Wei Jingsheng, its best-known political activist. Mr Wei was taken into custody last week for interrogation in connection with 'new crimes'. These have not been specified. Mr Wei and Mr Xu were the most prominent activists engaged in the pro-democracy agitation of the late 1970s. Their release last year, before their jail terms expired, was seen as an attempt by China to improve its human rights record. But their fresh detention has complicated the impending decision by US President Bill Clinton on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status, allowing lower-tariff access to the US market, which depends on 'overall, significant improvement' in human rights behaviour.</p>

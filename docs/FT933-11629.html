			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Strong domestic sales help AECI to 22% rise AECI, South Africa's largest chemicals group in which Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK has a 38 per cent stake, reports a 22 per cent increase in earnings per share for the six months to June. Turnover rose 6 per cent to R2.69bn (Dollars 770m), with domestic sales up 9 per cent and export revenues falling 14 per cent. Restructuring allowed margins to be broadly maintained, and net trading profit was 9 per cent higher at R162m. Net profit, before R14m in extraordinary income from a change in the tax rate, was R61m, against R50m. Earnings per share rose to 39 cents from 32 cents. The dividend is being maintained at 18 cents. Discussions are under way with ICI 'with a view to strengthening the linkage between AECI and ICI in businesses where AECI has a global market position'. The outcome of these talks will be announced by the end of the third quarter. AECI expects its earnings growth, before abnormal items, to be maintained in the current six months, provided the political situation does not deteriorate further and the agricultural sector enjoys reasonable summer rains.</p>

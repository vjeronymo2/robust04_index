			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (6): The high price of national unity - A steep fall in employment levels / 37 per cent of the eastern labour force is now idle Rarely, if ever, has a labour force experienced such a radical and swift transformation as that which swept eastern Germany. When the Berlin Wall was breached in November 1989, the 9.3m workers of eastern Germany were heavily concentrated in manufacturing and agriculture. More than 920,000 people worked on the land. That number has since dropped to 210,000, a 70 per cent reduction. More significantly, the 3.17m employed in manufacturing are now down by 60 per cent to 1.29m. In mining and energy, production decreased by 39 per cent between 1989 and 1992. Overall, the number of available jobs fell by at least 34 per cent from 9.3m in 1989 to 6.2m in 1993. Since that time, the total labour force has decreased to 8.2m, largely as a result of migration. Several factors explain the steep fall in employment. Most of the products from east German manufacturing were aimed at markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The competition caused by the merging of the GDR's Ost-Mark with the western D-Mark. The collapse of the Comecon socialist trading organisation, and the inability of the eastern European countries and the former USSR to pay for east German goods. The policies of the Treuhand privatisation agency, which sought to reduce overmanning, close or break up and restructure the large Kombinate, or state-owned enterprises, to prepare them for privatisation. The breakup of the LPGs, or collective farms. The wage levels, which imposed another brake on the demand side of the labour market. Since wages are set to equal west German levels by 1996, despite productivity often 60 per cent below west German levels, unit labour costs are around 170 per cent of west German levels. 'In reality, we would require a reduction by a further third of the work force if we were to match productivity levels of western Germany,' commented one economist. By March of this year, 16.8 per cent of the labour force, or 1.26m, were unemployed. That did not include those on short-time work (135,000), job re-training and job creation schemes (249,000, and 238,000 respectively) and those who had taken early retirement (205,000). All told, 37 per cent of the total eastern labour force is idle. Last year, the federal labour office paid out DM54.7bn in unemployment benefit. The question is whether these very high unemployment levels have become permanent features of eastern Germany, and whether the federal government can continue to allocate nearly DM55bn each year as the price for maintaining social stability and for subsidising consumer spending in the east. A recent report by the Berlin-based DIW Institute for Economic Research concluded that if the labour market in Germany did not radically change, there would be around 5m people without regular employment in the unified Germany by the end of the decade. It added that the economy would be burdened by higher taxes which would reduce enterprises' profits and could dampen the willingness to invest. Against this background, few economists believe that - with the exclusion of women - the size of the labour market in eastern Germany will ever correspond to west German or western European levels. Mr Wolfgang Scheremet, a labour expert at the DIW Institute, said that even when the recession ended in Germany, 'there will simply be not enough new jobs in eastern Germany to absorb the high levels of unemployment.' The manufacturing base, overmanned before unification, and now in a state of collapse, could no longer be considered as a viable instrument for rebuilding mass employment. Instead, Mr Scheremet believes that some positive and negative trends within the labour force are likely to emerge in the following sectors: Construction. This sector will continue to play an important role as the housing stock is modernised, the infrastructure is upgraded, and hotels and offices are erected. Mr Scheremet reckons that the construction industry already accounts for about 12 per cent of the labour market. Innovative technology. A lot of money is being spent on introducing innovative and high levels of technology which will quickly become competitive and find a niche in international market. For instance, Siemens is investing DM2.4bn in a new microchip plant in Dresden which will create more than 1,200 jobs. The success of such enterprises are underpinned by investment grants. Services and the Handwerk, (the small trades and craftsmen sector). These sectors are already capitalising on the construction boom. The DIW and other economic institutes see the Handwerk, embracing 700,000 people, as one of the engines of economic revival. 'The number of people in the Handwerk are increasing as the manufacturing continues to decrease,' says Mr Schemeret. But these trends alone are not enough to absorb the high levels of unemployed. By 1993, western Germany was still supplying 90 per cent of the goods and services bought in eastern Germany. Meanwhile, the cheap labour in neighbouring eastern Europe could help to keep high unemployment figures in eastern Germany. The German economic institutes argue that if any small increase in the demand for labour emerges, especially for intensive labour, western German enterprises are more likely to shift production to the neighbouring countries of eastern Europe. The DIW study argues, that in the short term, this will deter investment both in west and east Germany. In the medium and long term, it would benefit Germany as a whole because it would create a hinterland with very favourable cost conditions for suppliers. However, it concludes: 'The positive effects of this will, however, not be felt until the beginning of the next decade at the earliest.' Women are the only sector of the labour market that appears to be matching western German levels. Eastern Germany's 8.1m women represent half the population. Before unification, more than 90 per cent of women, or 49 per cent of the total labour force in eastern Germany, were employed. In contrast, of the 33.4m women in western Germany, more than 20m are classified as housewives while 13m are registered on the labour market. Yet since unification, women, who are now more than two-thirds of eastern Germany's total unemployed, are being economically and socially forced back to the home as the labour market shrinks and radically different patterns of work take hold. By late 1992, more than 4.2m east German women were registered as housewives, and 3.9m were registered on the labour market. Yet even on the labour market, more than 905,000 are unemployed - not including those women on short-time work, job creation and job retraining schemes and early retirement. In western Germany, the number of unemployed women is 858,000.</p>

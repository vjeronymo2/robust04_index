			<p>BFN     [Text] Paulo Sampaio, vice president of the Brasilia  Federal Policemen Union, fears the Federal Police strike may get  out of control unless the government meets the policemen  demands. The institution has been on strike for 50 days.    Federal policemen countrywide want salaries equal to those  of  the Brasilia civil police. The difference between the salaries  of the two institutions surpasses 200 percent.    Federal Police Director Wilson Romao has asserted that the  government will provide the union leaders with a proposal today.</p>

An official at the Ministry of Science and Technology said  the agreement was made at a meeting in Beijing between South  Korean Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and his  Chinese counterpart, Song Jian, minister of the State Science  and Technology Commission.    Minister Kim was in Beijing as a member of the official  suite  of President Kim Yong-sam presently on a state visit to China.    As an initial project of joint environmental programs, the  two countries would soon inaugurate a joint Yellow Sea study  team to work out ways to control Yellow Sea contamination.    In the aeronautical area, South Korea and China would  jointly  develop knowhow on airplane design with a view to producing  mid-sized airplanes in a joint scheme.    Also at Monday's meeting, the two ministers decided to  exchange 30 technicians between their countries this year  instead of 15 and step up cooperation in the area of elementary  science.    They further agreed to conclude a Korea-China atomic energy  agreement and an atomic energy safeguards memorandum at the  second Korea-China joint Science and Technology Committee  meeting slated for October this year in Seoul, the official said.</p>

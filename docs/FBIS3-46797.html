Relations between the two  countries have been based on the principles of respect for each  other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nonviolation and  noninterference in each other's internal affairs for mutual  equality and peaceful coexistence.    Progresses have been achieved in many fields since the  normalization of relations between Vietnam and China. High-level  meetings and exchanges of delegations from different branches  and levels were organized. The official visit to China of  Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh in last November marks a new  step in the neighborly friendship relations and cooperation  between the two countries. This visit was of great significance  in strengthening the mutual understanding and reliability as  well as in consolidating the time-honored Sino-Vietnamese  friendship and cooperation.    Up until now, 50 agreements have been signed in order to  resume and step by step develop economy, commerce, science and  technology, culture, education, aviation, maritime, and post.    Basing on the Sino-Vietnamese joint communiques in November  1991 and December 1992, the two sides held negotiations at  experts and state-levels. It was worthy of note that in October  last, the two countries signed an agreement on main principles  for the settlement of territorial issue, to accelerate  negotiations for the early conclusion of basic treaties on  territorial border, on land, and sea between the two countries.    Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong held that the signing  of  this agreement was an ensuring step in solving the border issue  between the two countries and in contributing to promoting the  friendship relations and cooperation between the two countries  in the interest of the two peoples as well as of peace,  stability, and cooperation in the region.    For his part, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister (Hang Jiazuan)  noted that this was an important step creating conditions for  the settlement of pending territorial border between Vietnam and  China and for the further development of bilateral relations.    Reality has shown that the two peoples of Vietnam and China  want to build the Sino-Vietnamese border into one of peace,  stability, and friendship. Now the two countries are  implementing the already signed agreement. China promised to  help Vietnam build a factory to produce chemical fertilzer and  small and medium-size hydroelectric power plants. In trading,  China wanted to buy Vietnam's coal, crude oil, rubber, and sea  products and to export to Vietnam its equipment and other  commodity goods.    Vietnam and China have carried out an agreement on aviation  and promoted an agreement on investment protection.    Though relations between the two countries have been  restored  and developed, thus bringing about the benefit for both sides  and contributing to peace, stability and cooperation in the  region, the two countries recongized that some agreements have  been carried out very slowly. Vietnam and China understood that  economic and trade relations between the two countries have not  yet been developed according to each other's potentials as well  as their peoples' will.    Both Vietnamese and Chinese peoples want to further promote  stable, long-term, and effective friendship and cooperation and  good neighborliness.    Over the past years, the two sides also saw those issues  left  behind by history and newly-appeared issues must be settled by  peaceful means. The two sides agreed neither to use force nor  threaten to use force or any actions to make the situation more  complicated.    Peoples of both China and Vietnam hope that with their  time-honored traditional friendship and cooperation and the  developments in the past year, the Sino-Vietnamese relations  will further be upgraded effectively in many fields.</p>

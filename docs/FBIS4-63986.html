			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshova report "especially </F> for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "Moscow-Beijing: Green Light for  Trade"]    [Text] In 1993 China became Russia's second biggest  trading partner after the FRG, with a commodity turnover of  around $7.7 billion, Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic  relations, stated in connection with the forthcoming visit to  China by an official Russian delegation headed by Russian  Federation Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin.    But a number of essential problems must be solved for the  further development of bilateral economic relations, the  minister noted. For example, the transportation backup for  Russian-Chinese trade remains an acute problem. Owing to the  absence of real possibilities for freight transportation, 25-30  percent of contracts do not come to fruition. Therefore, the  expansion of the capacity of existing border crossings and the  opening of new ones is necessary, as are the more active use of  transit routes through Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the creation of  joint transportation and transport construction companies, and  the more active introduction of container transport.    In the minister's opinion, there is an increasingly urgent  need for a partial revision of the terms of settlements under  the 10 July 1985 intergovernmental agreement on economic and  technical cooperation in the building and modernization of  industrial facilities in the PRC. At the present time the  clearing system of settlements under this agreement has lost its  advantages and has effectively been reduced to interstate  barter. At the same time the interests of Russian organizations  have been significantly damaged as a result of the adoption by  the Chinese side of a so-called "clearing" exchange rate of the  Swiss franc [SFr] against the yuan (artificially lowered,  according to the estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, by 23-24 percent) and the restriction on the range of  Chinese companies supplying barter [vstrechnyye] goods in Russia.    Oleg Davydov cited the problem of paying off loans granted  by  China to the former USSR as one question which has been "left  hanging." The problem of the former USSR's debt to China on  clearing transactions (around SFr808 million) and on the two  state loans given in 1990-1991 to purchase consumer goods and  food totalling SFr1.5 billion must be finally settled. The  question of China's debts to the former USSR -- around SFr66  million provided for the construction of the Wusu-Alashanhou  highway -- also needs to be resolved.</p>

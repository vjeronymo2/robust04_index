			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We used the Department's current related party test, which considers differences in the level of trade, to determine whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length basis. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we considered a party as related to respondent whenever respondent had substantial ownership in, or contractual agreements constituting business control over, the party. See Appendix II to the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for more information on the Department's related party test. We did not include in our analysis any sales to related customers that we determined were not at arm's length. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated FMV based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing. We made deductions for inland freight, rebates and discounts, and direct selling expenses, including promotional and advertising expenses, credit expenses, warranty and guaranty expenses, and interest for guarantee deposits, where applicable. For those rebate programs where respondent did not identify in the database which customer actually received the rebate, we made no adjustment. We disallowed any rebate not established before the filing of the petition. For one expense claimed as a rebate, we determined that the expense, although viewed as a direct selling expense for CNPP, was overstated through a misallocation of the costs; consequently we did not make any adjustment for this expense, but will consider doing so subsequent to verification and further explanation. With regard to one promotional program reported as a direct selling expense, we did not make an adjustment to FMV because respondent failed to report the expense properly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is directed at the customers' customers. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Where respondent's reported total packing costs in Japan for certain transactions for certain packing forms omitted a particular packing processing charge, we added, as minor charge-specific BIA, the reported average charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made the following deductions from FMV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. We calculated home market credit expenses using the reported dates of shipment and payment. Where no payment had been received we used the average credit period for home market sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We deducted from FMV the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, warehousing expenses, product liability premiums, technical service expenses, and two promotional minilab programs, up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales. We reclassified these two promotional programs as indirect selling expenses. While respondent had reported these as direct selling expenses, we have preliminarily determined that respondent has not directly tied them to specific sales of CNPP. We also reclassified technical expenses as indirect selling expenses because respondent's documentation illustrates that these expenses relate to general long-term assistance, rather than customer- or sales-specific expenses. We offset commissions paid to unrelated parties in the United States by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by respondent, capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses incurred, both in Japan and the United States, for U.S. sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated all movement expenses as direct selling expenses. Therefore, in accordance with the decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for home market movement expenses. We recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by reallocating certain rebates and promotional programs as indirect selling expenses rather than as charges or direct selling expenses, respectively, because we found that respondent misclassified these expenses. We classified product liability expenses as indirect selling expenses because respondent's explanations demonstrate that its liability policy is general in nature and not tied to specific sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We included in FMV the amount of the consumption tax collected in the Japanese home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from home market price to calculate FMV (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses, charges, and offsets that were deducted from the home market price). We deducted this amount from the FMV after all other additions and deductions were made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. In addition, we calculated a re-adjustment of the amount of tax to take into account the amount of packing expenses added to FMV (i.e., three percent of the packing expenses). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currency Conversion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Verification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Circumstances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 2, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of CNPP and chemical components thereof from Japan. We preliminarily find that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports of CNPP from Japan, in accordance with section 733(e)(1) of the Act. To determine whether or not there have been massive imports of CNPP (one of the criteria in a critical circumstances analysis) we compared the export volume for the six months subsequent to the filing of the petition to that for the six months prior to the filing of the petition. We found that exports of this merchandise from respondent during the period subsequent to receipt of the petition had decreased. Unless we find that imports of the subject merchandise were massive, we do not need to determine whether there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere or whether there is knowledge that the exporter was selling the merchandise at less than its fair value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension of Liquidation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of CNPP from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Producer/manufacturer/exporter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> percentage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Fuji Photo Film Co.

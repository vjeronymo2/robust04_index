			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Threat of rebellion over Chechnya mission: Popular protests are demoralising the invading forces General Ivan Babichev, a senior divisional commander of the Russian force attacking Chechnya, declared war yesterday - against his political superiors. Addressing several hundred Chechens in the village of Novo Shurvoi, he said: 'Any order to attack Grozny is a criminal one. This operation contradicts the constitution. It is forbidden to use the army against peaceful civilians. It is forbidden to shoot at the people.' His extraordinary statement, made close to where his column has been halted for the past three days 35 miles from the Chechen capital Grozny, is the clearest sign yet that a significant part of the army will not fight Chechens - in spite of overwhelming superiority on the Russian side. Although resistance to the Russian invaders on the part of both Chechens and their neighbours in Ingushetia has been spirited, it has been the popular demonstrations, particularly by the women, which have halted Gen Babichev and which are demoralising the army. 'When I look into the faces of these old women,' the general said yesterday, 'it is as if I see the face of my own mother'. Gen Babichev has had his fill of women. They clambered over his tanks and armoured personnel carriers in Ingushetia; they have wailed and shouted by the side of the road; and where he has halted they have formed barriers, dancing in the middle of the highway with their men behind them. They are a human shield. On the northern front, where the main fighting has occurred but where there was only sporadic shelling yesterday, a young Chechen soldier said the elders of the local community had gone to the Russians to appeal to them not to fight. 'They came back and told us none of them wanted to fight, they wanted to go home.' A harsher message came from Mr Musa Israelov, 42, commander of the frontline tank post on the northern perimeter near Tolstoi Yurt, where the Russian division is now positioned. With the muzzles of Russian tanks on the hills behind him, he said: 'If Russian parents don't take their sons back, they will come back as corpses in buses'. The Islamic undercurrent in the struggle has become more apparent. The Russian nightmare of a jihad on its territory - an eventuality they tried to prevent by taking over the border defences of Tajikistan and pouring troops in to bolster fighting with the Afghani mujahideen - now seems a distinct reality. Mr Mayerbek Bokhacheev, a 28-year old fighter wearing the inscription 'Allah Akbar' (God is Great) on his vest, said: 'This is a holy war. You can tell Yeltsin the Islamic people of Chechnya will never retreat. Our country has never been conquered by anyone.' The relative calm yesterday in Grozny was observed by the Russians in the west by clearing up the debris of smashed and burnt vehicles along the highway, resulting from attacks over the last four days. On the northern front, more barricades were going up; cement blocks were being moved into place, gun emplacements strengthened and camouflage netting placed over them. There is now a lull in the storm. Grozny's streets are filling with people and the impoverished market is doing more business. But the city is still readying itself for war.</p>

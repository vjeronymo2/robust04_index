			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A prominent feature of the Gulf War was the use of  precision guided ordnance using computers. The sight of a  missile trying to arrest another missile was sufficient to prove  the validity of the air-defense system based on electronic  equipment. Components that are produced by Japan Radio Co., Ltd.  are the constituents of various guided ordnance and the  "electronic eyes" that support the heart of the defense system.  They cast watchful eyes on the sneaking enemies.    Of the FY92 sales totaling &yen;140.2 billion, the sale made  to the Defense Agency amounted to about 14&percnt;. Although the  ratio  was as high as about 20&percnt; in the late 1980s, it has been  declining since affected by the defense budget cut. Manabu  Narasaki, a director in charge of the defense business, comments  painfully, "we would like to think that we have reached the  bottom; nevertheless, we are prepared to see a further erosion,  even to the 10&percnt; line." The reduction of the contracts in  terms  of yen value is serious, as they forecast the FY93 sale to fall  back to about &yen;16 billion, a whopping 30&percnt; reduction  from  the previous year.    The equipment related to guided ordnance such as missile and  the electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft are  their two major product lines, the combined sales amount of  which amounts to 60-70&percnt; of the total defense-related  sales of  the company. In addition to those product lines, they make  communication equipment, radar, and various simulators.    The main pillar of the guided ordnance products is the  ground  radar which controls the surface-to-air missile, "Hawk." Hawk  homes in on the target tagging along the radio wave reflected by  the target while the radar scans the target with the radio wave.  It is intended to track down and capture an object flying at a  relatively low speed, such as an airplane flying in formation  and a missile released by a fighter. The ground radar is an eye  of the Hawk system to look for the enemy in distance.    As to the missile-related business, the company also  supplies  the communication equipment for the surface-to-air missile,  "Patriot," and the radio altimeter to be built into  surface-to-surface missiles.    The electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft  captures the movement of submarines that cannot be captured by  radars. The system functions in such a way that buoys dropped on  the sea surface emit radio waves which bounce off the submarine  and are collected by the patrol plane via the buoys. The  electronic equipment the company supplies is used to receive the  signal and deliver the data to a system that is used to identify  the location of the submarine.    The nucleus of their defense business relates to the  front-line equipment which tends to be strongly affected by the  defense budget cut, so that they cannot expect any increase in  the foreseeable future. Therefore, they are considering the  conversion of their defense technology to commercial  applications.    "We will investigate the possibility of venturing into the  amusement industry (game machines, etc.)," says Mr. Narasaki  boldly. They seem to be considering a drastic shift to  commercial fields utilizing the technology they mastered through  the development of aircraft pilot training simulators.    They developed the simulator originally for the trainer  planes of the Air Self-Defense Force. "The business is quite  unpredictable, and sometimes there is no order for more than a  year," says Kzaue Mukogawa, General Manager of Defense Sales.  When it comes to the commercial airline industry, they still  favor imported products so that Japan Radio has been able to  sell only less than 20 units so far, mainly to All Nippon  Airways.    "Simulator sales occur only when new airplanes are adopted  by  the industry," says Mr. Narasaki; with the airline industry in  such a depressed state they are currently in, there is little  hope for this business to expand appreciatively.    That is why they think that a higher growth potential can be  created, if they shift their effort toward "non-aircraft"  business such as game equipment, by means of adding multi-media  output, i.e., voice, character and image, to the simulator  technology.    Accompanying the sales drop in the defense sector of their  business, the number of employees related to the sector has been  continuously decreasing. At the moment, it only amounts to about  14&percnt; of 3,900, the total number of people the company  employs.  The company claims that it has no intention of further reducing  the number as it wants to sustain the defense-specific  technology and know-how. However, they must generate a necessary  earning to support all the employees and their families through  business expansions utilizing the defense element technology  they have nurtured. The informed sources in the industry  predict, however, that it will be difficult for them to go  beyond their boundary of communication and electronic equipment  manufacturing even if they succeed in venturing into commercial  fields. The key to the survival of the defense division of this  company is whether they can successfully enter into new business  sectors such as the amusement equipment industry while making  sure not to miss any renewal orders of the front-line equipment  they delivered in the past and maintenance service contracts.</p>

Karadzic was speaking after  talks with United Nations special envoy for the former  Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi.    "We have been withdrawing already convoys and convoys, and  we  will withdraw even more," he said. "Those which can't be  withdrawn because of snow will be placed under full effective  control of the UN without any reservations."    "Tomorrow at 2400 regardless of other deadlines all heavy  weapons will be under efficient control that is envisaged by UN  regulations."    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has warned that if  Serb weapons ringing Sarajevo are not withdrawn to a distance of  20 kilometres (12 miles) or put under UN control by Sunday  midnight they will be attacked.    Akashi said that from Saturday armed troops of the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will be controlling seven sites  where heavy weapons will be grouped.    "There is a good momentum in full awareness that we have to  make a very quick agreement," he added.    The heavy weapons on both Serb and Moslem side are being  withdrawn or put under UNPROFOR control under an agreement  concluded with the UN on February 9, the same day as NATO issued  its ultimatum.</p>

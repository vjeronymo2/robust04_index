			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MRS. MARCOS WEARS MEDICAL MONITORS  </P> <P> Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos was back in court Monday at her  racketeering trial, wearing heart and blood pressure monitors.  </P> <P> She had left the courtroom pale and sobbing during testimony Friday and her  illness was diagnosed as high blood pressure.  </P> <P> She sat holding rosary beads as U.S. Customs Service official Leslie Kinney  described a suitcase seized from the Marcoses containing negotiable stocks.  </P> <P> Kinney also identified 22 cardboard cartons, each about a foot square, that he  said contained currency totaling 27 million Philippine pesos -- worth about  $1.4 million in 1986.  </P> <P> He said two other suitcases contained mostly jewelry. Pictures of the jewelry  were given to the jury after the judge agreed with a defense request that the  suitcases and one of the boxes, on view at the front of the courtroom, need not  be opened.  </P> <P> Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of  justice for allegedly plotting with her husband to divert more than $200  million from the Philippines treasury for personal use.  </P> <P> The money was allegedly used for art and real estate investments around the  world.  </P></p>

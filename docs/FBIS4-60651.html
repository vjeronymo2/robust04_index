			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council Member Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zandani called on all sons of the Yemeni people to support  their sons and brothers in the battle for Yemen and its unity  against the renegades who are calling for secession.    He urged them to offer sacrifices so that everyone can  contribute to this historic battle.    This call was made after the Presidential Council entrusted  him with supervising the organization of popular efforts,  collecting donations, and coordinating with the official  quarters in order to support the heroic Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley and agencies] </F>   [Text] One of the three suspects arrested in the Qiandao  lake massacre was a demobilised soldier who wore his military  uniform to carry out the attack, it was revealed yesterday. Yu  Aijun was still wearing part of his uniform when arrested last  Sunday, the Beijing- run TA KUNG PAO reported. The brother of  another suspect, Wu Lihong, serves in the paramilitary Peoples'  Military Police in the Hangzhou military district. However the  report said there were only three suspects in the case and no  military involvement in the raid, in which 24 Taiwan tourists  were killed on a pleasure boat on March 31. The director of  Taiwan's National Security Bureau, Yin Tzung- wen, told members  of parliament in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday that eight  to 10 people were involved in the case and that a number of them  were soldiers of the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA). But with  China denying the charge as "pure fabrication" and no evidence  emerging to support the theory, calls began in Taipei yesterday  for Yin to step down. "The issue is serious. If it was found  later no mainland soldiers were involved in the case, he (the  security head) should assume political responsibility for  providing false information," an opposition MP, Chen Shui-hian,  said. Opposition MPs said Yin should not to use false  information to trick lawmakers into supporting the annual budget  of the security bureau. It was during a meeting with opposition  MPs to review the bureau's budget that the PLA charge was made.  "As soon as the mainland government reveals all the details and  completes court proceedings of the case, we will ask Yin and the  military information bureau director to report to us how they  handled the case," Chen said.    Taiwan officials also announced yesterday they would not  allow expansion of imports from China until the completion of an  inquiry into the incident.    Meanwhile, two journalists from the Hong Kong-based TVB  Superchannel (TVBS), who were detained by police in Zhejiang on  Wednesday, remained in Hangzhou last night. Ma Yu-yuen, a  Taiwanese passport holder, and Cheuk Tak-ming, a Hong Kong  resident, were detained and interrogated for reporting without  permits when they arrived at the scene of the incident.</p>

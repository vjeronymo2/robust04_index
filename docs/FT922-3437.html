			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Libya's press assails Gadaffi over Arab ties: A new twist in Libyan policy LIBYA'S official press has launched unprecedented criticism of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's relations with fellow-Arabs, and in an extraordinary twist has called for better relations with the US. For the first time since he came to power in a 1969 bloodless coup, the idiosyncratic Col Gadaffi has been upbraided in the official Al Jamhariya or 'State of the Masses' newspaper - mouthpiece of the regime. 'We say to you, you are free, go alone to your Arabism and your Islamic links. As for us, we have America. It is much better for us to co-operate with America than with all the Arabs because we have realised that our own interests are above all else,' the Libyan news agency, JANA, quoted the paper as saying. Libya-watchers believe that the criticism may have been orchestrated to provide Col Gadaffi with room for manoeuvre on the eve of a meeting this weekend of Libya's General People's Congress, or parliament. Col Gadaffi has said repeatedly that it would be up to the parliament to decide whether to yield to either the US or Britain two Libyans accused of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland in which 271 people perished. Calls for the Libyan leader to distance himself from his brother-Arabs may also reflect intense disappointment at the decision of Arab regimes to fall into line with United Nations sanctions. In April, following Libya's refusal to hand over the two men accused of the Lockerbie bombing, the UN Security Council implemented a sanctions package which included a suspension of air links and a thinning of Libyan diplomatic personnel abroad. The Arabs complied with the air embargo. Col Gadaffi, who expressed great admiration for the late Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, has put Arab unity at the centre of his ideology, and has frequently proposed union with surrounding countries. It is unclear whether the Al Jamhariya commentary might herald a change in policy, but its criticism of the Arabs was unambiguous. It charged them with having shunned Libya and laughing at it while taking part in a 'murder by instalments' through UN sanctions. 'We ask you what benefit did we get from our Arabism, with the Arabs asking you to hand over our sons to the enemy and to obey Western demands and decisions,' the paper said. '. . . We ask you: why do Arab workers benefit from Libyan oil. . . the Libyan oil should go to American workers if they benefit us or if we benefit from them. . . this is better than Arabism and Islam.' Libya is also being pressed to co-operate in investigations into the 1989 downing of a French UTA flight on its way from Brazzaville to Paris, in which all 171 passengers and crew were killed. France wants to question four Libyans in connection with the UTA bombing, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law. JANA also reported on Tuesday that it had been taken over by 'revolutionary forces', and that the agency's director had been dismissed. A commentary accused the previous management of purveying disinformation and attempting to 'ridicule the people in the guise of slogans on Arabism and Islam.' 'Henceforth JANA will be managed by the conscious revolutionary forces which know their interests and those of the Libyans,' the JANA statement said.</p>

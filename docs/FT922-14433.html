			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Football strike vote helps goal THE English soccer players trade union, the Professional Footballers Association, discovered yesterday what the mainstream trade unions learnt some time ago - that strike ballots are a godsend in negotiations. No sooner had the PFA announced that 91 per cent of its first division members had voted to support strike action than the Premier League - with which the PFA is in dispute over revenue from TV coverage - suddenly presented an improved offer. As a result, there will be no industrial action for the immediate future. The PFA has rejected a Premier League offer of 5 per cent of the proceeds of TV coverage of the new league. Under its present agreement with the Football League, the PFA gets 10 per cent of TV revenue.</p>

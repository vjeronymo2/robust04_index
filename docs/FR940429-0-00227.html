			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.26&blank;End of an Institution's Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters believed that if an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation ends, it would be less disruptive to currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled students who are receiving Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance to allow the students to continue to be enrolled and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive Title IV, HEA program assistance until they complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their educational program. The commenters suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate termination of all funds under the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs would likely cause closure of the institution and costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the government resulting from forgiveness of the students'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans. A few commenters argued that if an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation has ended, it would be unrealistic to require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to inform immediately the State in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is located of its loss of participation in the NEISP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or SSIG Program, because there would be no one to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification. The commenters suggested that it would be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for the Secretary to make the notification in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters misunderstood that immediate termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Title IV, HEA program funds occurs for students at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution whose participation ends but that does not close.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The availability of those funds continues through the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment period or period of enrollment in which the participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ends for enrolled students who have received a commitment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those funds. To provide funds beyond that point, however, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oblige the Secretary in effect to continue an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation after the institution no longer qualifies for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation. With regard to the commenters' objections to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying a State upon the loss of an institution's participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the NEISP or SSIG Program, it is no more unreasonable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect an institution to notify the State than to expect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to notify the Secretary of the loss of participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in any other program. Institutions have been complying with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for 20 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters contended that if the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a notice from a SPRE that the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation should be withdrawn, the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation should not end until the institution has had the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to appeal to the Secretary or appropriate authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters believed that an institution's participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not end if the institution's program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement expires due to the Secretary's failure to approve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a renewal of participation in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that, if an institution's participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is terminated as a result of misuse of funds under the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs, the Secretary prohibit the institution from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crediting to a student's account or delivering to the student the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeds of a second or subsequent disbursement of a Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stafford or Federal SLS loan after the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs ends. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it would be inappropriate to allow an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had previously misused funds under the Title IV, HEA program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disburse additional funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter disagreed with the requirement that, if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must submit a letter of engagement for an audit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all funds received under that program within 45 days. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that engagement letters are not required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally accepted auditing standards or Government auditing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the State Postsecondary Review Program, a SPRE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not inform the Secretary that an institution's participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be terminated until the SPRE has afforded the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its full appeal rights. A further discussion of this process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the preamble to the regulations for the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary agrees with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters who were concerned about the expiration of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation if the review of a properly completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, submitted in a timely manner, has not been completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the expiration of participation. An explanation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes made to accommodate this circumstance is found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification procedures (&sect;668.13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES LIKE THE SOUND OF BEATING REDS TWICE  </P> <P> Disharmony filled San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Wednesday evening, but for a  change, it wasn't the Padres' problem.  </P> <P> No, the rampaging Padres swept a doubleheader from the Cincinnati Reds, 2-1 and  10-4, giving them three victories in a row over the NL West's first-place team  and allowing them to feel pretty good about themselves, at least for a night.  </P> <P> If you steered clear of the Padre clubhouse, though, positive vibrations  weren't the order of the evening. The Padres were about the only ones in a good  mood. Between games, the crowd of 25,744 booed lustily when comedienne Roseanne  Barr made a mockery of the national anthem, and Cincinnati Manager Lou  Piniella, angry after the 2-1 loss to the fourth-place Padres, refused to open  the Cincinnati clubhouse.  </P> <P> Piniella hasn't liked what he has seen this week, and it's easy to understand  why. After a Cincinnati victory Monday, the Padres have suddenly begun to look  like the team many expected them to be, and they pretty much dismantled a  Cincinnati team that arrived with the highest winning percentage in baseball.  </P> <P> Piniella had cooled off by the end of the evening. What else could he do?  </P> <P> "They hit everything we threw up there today," Piniella said. "We've got to  regroup tomorrow. That's all we can do."  </P> <P> The Padres scored 10 runs against the Reds Tuesday and again on Wednesday, the  second and third times they have done so this season. That matches a Cincinnati  season high for runs allowed in a game.  </P> <P> "You guys have no idea how good this feels," said Padre Manager Greg Riddoch,  whose victory output Wednesday matched his previous total for the season. He is  now 4-11.  </P> <P> In the first game, the Padres got a vintage performance from Ed Whitson and a  rare one from reliever Craig Lefferts. Then, in Game 2, they unleashed an  offense that had been curiously quiet for most of the past month, pounding out  a season-high 20 hits.  </P> <P> First, the glitter. In the second game, the Padres scored in each of the first  six innings. Mike Pagliarulo was three for five with five runs-batted in, Tony  Gwynn went four for five with two RBIs, and Tom Lampkin and Roberto Alomar each  had three hits. Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi even homered in the fifth. The Padres  chased Cincinnati starter Rick Mahler (4-4) after four innings. He allowed 12  hits and eight runs.  </P> <P> Schiraldi made his first start of the season in the second game. He went six  innings, allowing two runs and five hits as he ran his record to 3-2.  </P> <P> The drama came in the first game. The Padres scored two runs in the first  inning and got an impressive defensive play from shortstop Garry Templeton in  the sixth. Combine that with Whitson and Lefferts . . .  </P> <P> Whitson (8-7) went 7 1/3 innings, allowing a run on six hits. He struck out  four and walked none while lowering his earned-run average to 2.84. He threw 89  pitches -- 60 for strikes.  </P> <P> He has now gone seven consecutive starts -- 48 1/3 innings -- without allowing  a home run.  </P> <P> Still, it was just his second victory since June 23 and third since June 2. In  his seven losses, the Padres have scored more than one run just twice. They  were shut out once.  </P> <P> You can understand, then, why Whitson's postgame cigarette seemed to taste  better than usual.  </P> <P> "Oh, Lordy," he said. "It's about time I get one of these 2-1 wins. We've had  some serious bad luck."  </P> <P> Part of the reason he was able to get the victory was because of Templeton's  game-saving leap to his right in the sixth. The score was 2-1, Barry Larkin was  on second, and Eric Davis was at the plate with two out. Davis hit a hard  grounder into the hole between short and third that might have scored Larkin,  but Templeton dove, stood up and fired to first. He caught Davis by a step.  Whitson waited to greet Templeton before leaving the field.  </P> <P> "That was the turning point of the game, I thought," Whitson said. "That was  one of Tempy's old plays he made years and years ago. He's still making them."  </P> <P> Whitson left in the eighth with one out and Larkin on second, again the  potential tying run. Lefferts came on for his first appearance in 10 days and  was sharp. He held the Reds hitless and struck out two while earning his 13th  save. He has allowed just four of his past 29 inherited runners to score.  </P> <P> "We've got a new guy you've heard about on the mound," Padre Manager Greg  Riddoch said, smiling. "His name is Craig Lefferts. We just brought him up from  the bullpen."  </P> <P> Riddoch said he wanted to use Lefferts in Tuesday's game, but Bruce Hurst was  throwing a shutout, and how can you take a guy out of the game when he's doing  that? So he talked with Lefferts in the outfield before Wednesday's  doubleheader, and Lefferts assured Riddoch that he would be ready anytime  Riddoch needed him.  </P> <P> "He told me (rest) doesn't affect him like some pitchers when they don't get  used a lot," Riddoch said. "He was right."  </P> <P> The Padres scored two in the first, and it turned out that that was enough. Bip  Roberts led off with an infield single, and Alomar followed with a single up  the middle, moving Roberts to second. Trouble was, Gwynn grounded into a double  play.  </P> <P> Roberts moved to third on Gwynn's grounder, and the Padres were in a situation  they're pretty good at blowing: Two outs, runner in scoring position. Not  tonight. Roberts scored on a passed ball with Jack Clark at the plate, and then  Clark walked. Joe Carter followed by drilling a ball just inside of third base  and into the Padre bullpen in left. Clark scored, and Carter had a stand-up  double.  </P> <P> The Padres led, 2-0.  </P> <P> Things got easier later, and who would have figured that the Padres would take  three of four from the Reds and sweep their first doubleheader since June 17,  1988, against the Dodgers? It was their first home doubleheader sweep since  Aug. 9, 1985, against Houston.  </P> <P> The Padres still trail the Reds by 18 games, though.  </P> <P> "Our goal isn't to catch the Reds, it's getting whoever is on top of us (in the  standings)," Whitson said.  </P> <P> They say it's not over until the fat lady sings, and Roseanne sure sang  Wednesday -- or tried to, anyway. So what happens? The Padres go out and win  again, against Cincinnati, nonetheless.  </P> <P> So maybe Roseanne should come back and sing again?  </P> <P> Nah.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Catcher Benito Santiago had the cast removed from his left arm Tuesday night  and went through his first rehabilitation workout Wednesday afternoon. Santiago  said he will wait a week before discussing a target date for his comeback. It  likely will not be before mid-August, though, and possibly as late as Sept. 1.  His arm was weak, and he worked with light weights, but Santiago said he felt  great mentally having just gotten rid of the cast. "The thing drove me crazy,"  he said. "It was on a month and a week, but it felt like a year and a half  already." Padre Manager Greg Riddoch said he doesn't want to rush Santiago's  return. "It's encouraging to see the kid back out here," Riddoch said. "It's  important that we make sure he's 100%. We don't want a situation where he's set  back." Riddoch said the Padres haven't yet decided whether Santiago will spend  time on a rehabilitation assignment in Las Vegas (triple-A), but if he did, he  would have to make a pretty quick recovery; the triple-A season is done by the  end of August. Santiago's arm was broken on June 14 when San Francisco pitcher  Jeff Brantley hit him with a pitch.  </P> <P> The new Padres owners would like to change the team's uniform colors to navy  blue and orange. Any change would have to be approved by major league baseball.  . . . Bruce Hurst has thrown the past two complete games by a Padre pitcher. He  defeated Cincinnati, 10-0, Tuesday and St. Louis, 3-1, on July 7. . . . Padre  Library: Bip Roberts is reading Dave Dravecky's book "Comeback." "It's pretty  good," he said.  </P> <P> Friday's and Saturday's games against Houston will both begin at 7:35 p.m. Joan  Kroc Night is Friday, and the Equitable Old-Timers game is Saturday. This is  the last Equitable Old-Timers event, as the company has decided to not sponsor  the series anymore. It will not be a regular game but take the form of a  home-run hitting contest. . . . Cincinnati second baseman Mariano Duncan left  the first game Wednesday for a pinch-hitter in the third inning after  re-aggravating an injury to his left wrist.  </P></p>

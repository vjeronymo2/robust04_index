			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Councils opt for Sunday trading LOCAL authorities in England and Wales want Sunday shopping to be deregulated, a survey indicates today. The findings, in a report by the Institute of Public Finance, will add impetus to calls for reform when Sunday trading is debated in the next session of parliament. About 90 per cent of local authorities have adopted a 'passive or inactive' stance to enforcing the existing regulations, the survey says. Only a few authorities have been testing legislation in the courts. As prosecutions and injunctions are few, net legal costs for authorities will probably not exceed Pounds 250,000 in England and Wales this year, according to the report. Councils therefore fear that any change in the law except total deregulation would lead to heavy extra costs because councils would need to take an 'active' stance. Authorities were asked to pick one of five options including maintenance of the status quo. Total deregulation was the first or second preference of 93 per cent, while partial deregulation, which would limit larger shops to six hours on a Sunday, was the first or second choice of 59 per cent.

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Receivers called in as Rosehaugh loses battle with banks ROSEHAUGH, a prominent property developer in the 1980s, yesterday gave up its battle for survival. It owes its banks, led by Barclays, a total of about Pounds 350m. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, is expected to be appointed today as its receiver, making Rosehaugh the latest high profile property company to go into receivership this year. In contrast with a stock market value of Pounds 746m in July 1987, Rosehaugh is now believed to have negative net assets. The downturn in the British property market, which has halved office values in London over the past three years, is expected to result in several billions of pounds of losses for banks operating in the UK. Yesterday's move was the final stage in a lingering death. As the huge losses accumulated over the past three years, it became increasingly clear that Rosehaugh had no future. The company's former chairman and driving force, Mr Godfrey Bradman, resigned from the board at the start of this year. Rosehaugh's best-known asset, the Broadgate office complex in the City of London, is not directly affected by its receivership. It is owned by a Rosehaugh subsidiary, Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, which last week secured its future through a refinancing of its Pounds 1.25bn debt. That refinancing triggered the decision to put the rest of the company into receivership. The reason for the receivership was partly attributed to the banks' desire to cut Rosehaugh's overheads, particularly the cost of its head office lease. The decision by Rosehaugh's 26 banks to put the company into receivership contrasts with their agreement, at the start of this year, to refinance Rosehaugh's Pounds 310m of loans until January 1994. However, funds are not committed in this type of banking standstill and so the agreement was not binding. In June 1991, Rosehaugh had net assets of Pounds 164m. In the year to June 30 1991, it reported losses of Pounds 227m, which followed losses of Pounds 166m the previous year. Apart from Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, Rosehaugh's principal asset is Pelham Home, a landbank developer which partly owns the Chafford Hundred housing scheme in Essex. It also owns commercial, retail and residential properties. Stanhope Properties, which jointly owns Rosehaugh Stanhope Development, with Rosehaugh, said yesterday it was unaffected by Rosehaugh's receivership. Lex, Page 18 Receivers move in, Page 19</p>

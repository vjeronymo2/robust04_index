			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: No strategic price cutting by Komatsu Sir, Your article 'Barlow Rand eyes Spanish target' (April 24), states that, according to analysts, the decrease in sales of Spain's Caterpillar distributor is mainly due to Komatsu's under-pricing policy in Spain. The increase in Komatsu's sales in Spain in recent years is due not to strategic price reduction, but to the quality of the product, service to customers and a big marketing effort. We believe that to survive in the earth moving equipment sector the highest quality of product and service must be offered to customers.

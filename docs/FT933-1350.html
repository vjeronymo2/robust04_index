			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / A rapid loss of height: Asian airlines face growing pressure It seemed an unbeatable combination. For more than a decade, south-east Asia's airlines developed a worldwide image of exotic service to exotic locations, while simultaneously profiting from lucrative but restricted routes in their own region's high-growth economies. But they are suffering the consequences of their push into other aviation markets. They are having to confront more aggressive competition, and a realisation that it may take more than advertisements showing smiling Singapore hostesses to bring in the passengers. Cathay Pacific, of Hong Kong, recently announced a 46 per cent drop in profits for the first half of 1993. Singapore Airlines (SIA) saw profits fall 8.4 per cent in the year to March, and Thai Airlines announced earnings of 594m baht for the nine months to June - 67 per cent lower than the previous year. A primary cause of the fall in earnings has been the success of Asia's aviation market: recession-hit western airlines have transferred aircraft to routes into the region to curb losses in their home territories. South-east Asian airlines have also been the victim of the success of their domestic economies, where rising labour and land prices have increased operating costs. Mr Rod Eddington, Cathay Pacific's managing director, says: 'Asian airlines will never be able to rely on the combination of circumstances which they have had in the past, to guarantee them high profitability. They had low labour costs, rapidly growing markets and a substantial degree of lack of interest from North American and other airlines.' According to the International Air Transport Association, the Asia-Pacific region - which stretches from the Indian subcontinent to Australasia - accounted for 25 per cent of the world's passenger traffic in 1985. By 2000, it is projected to represent close to 40 per cent, in an area where average fares are higher per kilometre than in either Europe or North America. The market's fast growth means that, despite the recent downturn, south-east Asia's airlines remain more profitable than their main competitors, many of which are making losses. SIA and Cathay are likely to be the first and third most profitable airlines in the world this year - even though a cabin crew strike in January is estimated to have cost Cathay HKDollars 240m (Pounds 20.2m). But a combination of factors is clouding the sky ahead. The most pressing has been Japan's shift towards recession. Japanese travellers represent the largest single market for most of Asia's airlines. Figures from the Japan Travel Bureau, the tourism office, are expected to show a slight fall in the total number of Japanese overseas travellers during July and August 1993 - the first drop in six years - while Japanese travellers to Asian destinations are expected to fall by 10 per cent over the same period. The impact has already been felt: Cathay's passenger yields (a measure of revenue per passenger kilometre) fell by 6.1 per cent in the first half of 1993, while SIA's yields fell 6.7 per cent during 1992. When Japan's economic cycle swings upwards, airline earnings across Asia would be expected to follow, since the aviation industry is sensitive to consumer spending patterns. But each south-east Asian airline faces further individual problems: Cathay's profits are being squeezed by Hong Kong's annual inflation rate of 9 per cent. Its efforts to curb costs led to the 15-day cabin crew strike. The profits of Malaysian Airline System (MAS) have suffered from misjudgments made in the late 1980s. Over-optimistic estimates of demand growth have left it with too many new aircraft. At the same time, the Malaysian government has fixed prices on domestic routes, which MAS is obliged to operate, at below cost. SIA is exposed more than other south-east Asian airlines to the recession affecting European and North American routes, where it has expanded rapidly over the past decade. Thai Air has a record of poor management. Past inefficiencies in placing orders for aircraft, for instance, have left the airline with a fleet comprising nine aircraft types, made by five aircraft manufacturers, with three makes of engine. The company plans to simplify its fleet. Two common challenges face south-east Asia's airlines. The first is the downward pressure on prices caused by competition. The Asian fleet grew rapidly during the 1980s, but demand for tickets always outstripped supply. In the past two years, estimates Jardine Fleming Securities, the Hong Kong-based brokerage, Asian airlines increased capacity by between 10 and 12 per cent a year while demand rose by only about 7 per cent a year. With orders for aircraft made at least two years in advance, the airlines clearly misread the effects of global recession on the Asian market - a predicament worsened by the arrival of overseas competitors. Mr Eddington of Cathay Pacific claims the influx of overseas airlines will be short-lived: 'Airlines had too much capacity and they have dumped a lot of that capacity on Asia,' he says. 'They haven't made any money flying those aircraft to Asia, but they have lost less than they would from flying them to North America or Europe.' The new competitors, primarily US airlines led by United, disagree and have been clamouring for more 'open skies' - that is, access to the highly profitable restricted routes operated by Asian airlines, such as Hong Kong to Taipei, which is dominated by Cathay Pacific and Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines. Mr Roddy Wilson, Far East general manager for British Airways, says western airlines see a long-term future in south-east Asia. 'The increase in capacity underlines the fact that the ability to grow is there. It is likely to reduce yields, but I would have thought that is normal in every industry; those who ordered too much capacity will just have to shake that out.' The second challenge facing south-east Asian airlines is the pressure on costs caused by the strong performances of the region's economies. In an effort to control salary bills, airlines based in the more developed economies have taken on cabin crew from cheaper Asian labour pools, such as the Philippines or India. Cathay has moved some labour intensive operations into China. But costs will remain hard to control in Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, as these countries complete the evolution from low-cost manufacturing centres to higher value-added service economies. Shrinking profit margins may eventually be offset by the emergence of new high-growth markets, such as China, Vietnam and Indonesia. But it will prove difficult for south-east Asia's airlines to relive the golden years of the late 1980s.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA-PACIFIC AIRLINES: CLOUDY SKIES AHEAD  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Net profits              1991     1992     1993     1994*    1995*  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Cathay Pacific HKDollars million       2,995    3,008    2,250*   2,700    3,000 Malaysian Air MDollars million          197      113      146      275      355 Singapore Air SDollars million          913      928      851      910    1,065 Thai Air Baht million            3,503    3,067    1,060*   2,512        -  ------------------------------------------------------------------- * Jardine Fleming forecasts  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

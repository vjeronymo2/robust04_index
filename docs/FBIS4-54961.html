			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The government, at a closed meeting with  the participation of the head of the armed forces, President  Lech Walesa, adopted a document on Poland's defense policy. The  minister of national defense will present it to the Sejm before  the end of the month.    [Correspondent] In the document, two options are presented  for the division of competences between a civilian minister of  national defense and the commanders of the Army. Under the  first, the chief commander of the Army--the post has not yet  been given a name--is subordinate in military matters to the  head of the armed forces, i.e., the president. The civilian  minister of national defense will only exert  administrative-political control.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This option will, I believe,  require legalization of this post, constitutional legalization  of this post, and making the commander in chief constitutionally  responsible for matters like battle readiness, mobilization,  drawing up operational plans, and standard of military training.  At the moment, the minister of national defense bears this  responsibility. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The second option aims at the president  exerting command through a civilian minister, who works out the  tasks for the armed forces and supervises their execution, but  without interference in matters of command.</p>

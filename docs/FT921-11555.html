			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Friendly coating keeps water out particularly in motorway construction where the salt can destroy the concrete if it is allowed to eat into the pillars - hardly seems glamorous. But a technique devised in the US and commercialised in Australia could bring concrete coatings into an environmentally conscious world. Radcon No. 7, which will be sold in the UK by Nationwide Protective Coatings, of Newton Abbot, Devon, is a water-based coating which sinks into the concrete surface and reacts with free calcium in the concrete to produce a hydrophoebic barrier. The coating is sprayed on to the concrete, where it becomes sticky. Then the surface is sprayed down three times with water at regular intervals. This starts the biological process. Additionally, if cracking occurs to the concrete due to thermal stress, the coating is washed into the cracks when it rains, so sealing the fissures.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German data is trigger for widespread selling A wave of selling swept across continental European bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said that while German M3 data had been disappointing - 6.8 per cent against forecasts of 6.6 per cent - reducing the likelihood for further imminent rate cuts, continental markets had performed strongly in recent weeks, a period of consolidation was likely and one could not rule out a rebound before the year end. Mr Albert Edwards, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, commented that there was a movement by some institutions back into cash. The markets that looked vulnerable to a downside, he added, were Germany in Europe and Hong Kong in Asia. Failure of the Alcazar talks between four airlines - KLM, Swissair, SAS and Austrian - was another of the day's talking points. KLM, according to Lehman Brothers, may have walked away from any possible deal at the last moment because of changed and improved trading conditions since the talks were initiated at the start of the year. Lehman's commented that Delta was too great a competitor on the lucrative trans-atlantic routes to have been acceptable to the Dutch carrier, which has made great passenger gains in that area. Mr Raphael Hausmann of Swiss Bank in Basle was surprised that Swissair shares had not fallen further. However, he believed this indicated that investors expected Swissair to resume a search for long-term strategic alliances with other carriers. Mr Frank Jonuschat at Kleinwort Benson commented that the Alcazar alliance would have been ideal for the cash-strapped airline, not least because of the links it would have provided with an American carrier. He said that Austrian needed to find a partner and suggested that the weekend's developments might prompt it to listen more carefully to overtures that had been coming from Lufthansa. KLM lost Fl 3.30 to Fl 37.20, Swissair SFr37 to SFr723, SAS/Sila B shares SKr4 to SKr37 while Austrian rose Sch5 to Sch1,740. MILAN fell 3.3 per cent, the political outlook clouded by the strong performance of the left and right at the expense of the centrist traditional parties in local elections at the weekend. The Comit index shed 17.75 to 526.56. Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan was not surprised that the results had weakened the resolve of foreign investors. However selling pressure by domestic institutions was another matter, since the outcome 'was not so different from what we could have expected,' he said. Morgan Stanley responded by further reducing the Italian weighting in its equity-only European model portfolio from 3.4 per cent to 2 per cent, against a benchmark 4.4 per cent. Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson commented that their expectations for the market had been based on hopes that meaningful reform would lead to a stronger lira which would lead to lower interest rates and a reduced budget deficit: more Italian and foreign investors would then buy bonds and equities, pushing the lira up further. 'The major caveat in this investment thesis was that reform could be stalled if there was no formation of a political centre and if politics fragmented on a regional basis,' they said. 'That risk had already led us to go underweight in Italy. Now the fragmentation exhibited in these municipal election results must be a further cause of concern for investors.' The telecommunications issues, popular with foreigners, were hard hit. Stet shed L238 or 6.5 per cent to L3,428 and Sip was L181 or 5.8 per cent lower at L2,961. FRANKFURT closed sharply down, the DAX index losing 47.37 or 2.3 per cent to 2,030,00, as analysts commented that sentiment was depressed by some disappointing corporate news and growth in M3 data. BASF lost DM6.50 at DM265.40, after news of a 44 per cent drop in nine-month pre-tax profits and the possibility of a reduced dividend payment. Daimler, down DM20.7 to DM696.7, was hit by reports, subsequently denied, that Kuwait might sell its stake. PARIS was beset by technical difficulties that shortened the trading session. The CAC-40 index fell 62.62 or 2.9 per cent to 2,082.61 in turnover of some FFr3.5bn. Euro Disney closed down FFr1.50 at FFr35.20 on further negative press reports. ZURICH finished near its lows for the day as profits were taken in some of the stocks that have seen strong demand in recent weeks. The SMI index shed 37.4 or 1.4 per cent to 2,696.5. AMSTERDAM witnessed a generally poor performance as the CBS Tendency index fell 3.6 or 2.6 per cent to 133.6. Hoogovens gave up Fl 2.50 to Fl 42.50 after saying that it was to make a Fl 373.5m new share issue, while the government's stake would rise to 17 per cent from 12.3 per cent.

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Leasing still faces frontiers - European Trends THE UK's vehicle leasing industry is the EC's most developed and sophisticated by a significant degree, so the advent of the single market in Europe presents unparalleled opportunities. The removal of trade barriers should lead to a growth in business and leisure travel and an increase in the pan-European movement of labour. According to Mr Freddie Aldous, president of the European Car and Truck Rental Association, 'for British-based leasing companies, the single market offers a rich prize: wider markets, increased flexibility and a host of new opportunities.' However, the UK's leasing and contract hire specialists will not be storming Europe overnight; and any forays into Europe are likely to be careful and slow. The reason is that, despite the best efforts of the EC Commissioners, each individual European market retains its own specific characteristics - and, perhaps more importantly, its own fiscal regimes. British companies cannot go blundering into France or Spain and expect to run a vehicle leasing operation on the same lines as their home-based business; so growth in Europe is most likely to come about as a result of joint ventures with a local business that fully understands the local marketplace. That is the view of Mr Norman Donkin, chairman of AT&amp;T Norfolk Finance. 'In the fullness of time we plan to expand into Europe, though how has still to be determined. But we also need to be cautious. So I think the route would be either to acquire a well-founded company or to go into partnership with one. The last thing we would do is set up alone and in isolation.' Though Britain has the lead in contract hire, it is not Europe's largest business car market. Germany is at the top of the tree as far as numbers are concerned with a business car parc (population) of almost 4m units. The more sophisticated European markets - France, Belgium, Holland and Italy - are all experiencing strong growth in contract hire. In Germany, most company car business used to be undertaken by finance lease. However, companies are now moving away from purchasing vehicles towards contract hire, which is known as 'kilometre leasing'. France, which calls its contract hire location longue duree, has seen its leasing business dominated by the home-based manufacturers in the past. So far, the big three - Renault, Peugeot and Citroen - have kept the independent contract hire operators at bay. Italy, too, was once almost wholly dominated by its major domestic manufacturer, Fiat, but other companies such as VAG, Peugeot and Opel are making inroads. Finance leasing is a popular means of acquisition but full contract hire is still relatively small business. It is even smaller business in Spain, where the current tax regime means it is cheaper for the employee if the car is bought by the company rather than leased; as a result contract hire has only a tiny percentage of the market. Holland is a relatively mature market as far as contract hire goes but its customers are traditionally geared towards price only. 'Quality of service and customer loyalty are not high on the list of priorities,' comments Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie Interleasing. He predicts that UK contract hire operators may see Germany and France as likely markets in which to expand in the near future. However, the single market for vehicle leasing will not achieve its potential until full tax harmonisation becomes a reality rather than a myth, says Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet Management. 'Each EC member state still operates its own tax jurisdiction regulating VAT, excise duties, benefit-in-kind and ad hoc car taxes. All of these affect the attractiveness and suitability of the range of lease products on the market compared with other means of acquiring vehicles. National governments also retain control of domestic interest rate structures which impact local lease rates. 'Add these to national variations in car delivery costs, maintenance costs and residual values and the estimated time of arrival of true pan-European leasing is somewhere at the end of the decade,' he predicts. But despite the variables, he does discern one trend: a marked shift in Europe away from purchasing vehicles in favour of leasing or contract hire. 'It will account for around a third of the market by the year 2000, compared with a current market share of 21 per cent,' says Mr Elder though he warns: 'But once again, the lack of true harmonisation within the EC may serve to stifle the development of one of the most advanced leasing products available.'  ----------------------------      INCIDENCE OF COMPANY         CARS IN EUROPE  ---------------------------- DIRECTORS      1989   1992                  %      %  ---------------------------- Germany         80     97 Netherlands     84     94 UK              98     94 Italy           83     93 Belgium         82     93 Spain           85     91 France          83     89  ---------------------------- Source: Monks Partnership  ----------------------------</p>

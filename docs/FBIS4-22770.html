			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lagovskiy: "The Close Circle of the </F> Unified Energy System"]    [Text] Soon enterprises that have "forgotten" to pay for  electricity could possibly be reminded of their debts by having  their electricity cut off. At least such a harsh suggestion was  heard at the regular conference of the first deputy chairman of  the Government of Russia, Oleg Soskovets. The measure is highly  favored by economic managers since it sometimes enables them to  solve operational problems. At this one they were considering  various ways of stabilizing the financial situation of nuclear  power plants and enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle.    The situation is such that nuclear power plants may be  transformed quickly and easily from energy producers to energy  consumers. Many of the plants are threatening to shut down.    Representatives of nuclear power plants state that they have  no money for fuel because the Russian Joint-Stock Company  Unified Energy System Rossiya owes them 450 billion rubles [R].  The latter, in turn, does not consider itself to blame--the  direct consumers of energy owe it even more.    The government has promised credit in the amount of R50  billion to settle the accounts of the nuclear power plants. But  that will apparently not solve the basic problem. The money will  be spent on plugging up holes, and after a month or two the  situation will return to its original impasse. Therefore, in the  opinion of the majority of those present, it is necessary to  change the system: to create a market for electric energy. It  must be sold and not "released."    The conference earmarked a number of immediate measures  which  could possibly help to emerge from the crisis. Among them are  deferring payments on taxes to the republic budget and granting  nuclear power plants the right to conclude direct agreements for  the delivery of electric energy to regional consumers.    There was an amusing side to this. A representative of one  of  the nuclear power plants who was among those picketing the White  House was interested to hear a proposal from the Ministry of  Nuclear Energy to find additional funds by reducing the wages of  the workers at the plants. He said something to the effect that  for the sake of the country's safety he could take such a  measure if he received his "gigantic" wage of 200,000 every  month. But for now he cannot, since the last time he was paid  was in February.</p>

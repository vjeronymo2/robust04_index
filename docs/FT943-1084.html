			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Institutions take a longer term view Large institutional shareholders may take a much longer term view of the prospects of the companies they invest in than is currently believed, according to a new survey. The Investor Relations Society, a professional association, studied the share registers of 10 leading UK companies over a 12-month period. It concluded, based on analysis of the largest shareholders, that the average holding in any single company was 8 years and 4 months, far longer than a holding of between 3.5 and 5 years highlighted in an earlier study by the London Stock Exchange. However, at the margin, there is considerable trading in the shares of each individual company over the course of a year, with the average monthly turnover at 7.1 per cent. But for the 10 largest institutions, the average was 6.4 per cent, while for the 10 smallest, monthly turnover was 7.8 per cent, suggesting that smaller shareholders may be more volatile holders of stock. Significantly, the study also found that life and pensions funds - which tend to be the largest institutional shareholders - are more likely to be longer term holders of stock than are unit and investment trust mana-gers. Of the 45 life and pensions shareholders in the study, only one totally divested itself of a large stake in a single company during the 12-month period. The 45 unit and investment trusts in the study included three cases of total divestment over the same period.

Big Sandy Gas Co.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP95&hyph;46&hyph;000]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on October 31, 1994, Big Sandy Gas Company (Big Sandy), 15375 Memorial Drive, Houston, Texas 77079, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95&hyph;46&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that Big Sandy's proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of certain natural gas gathering systems and other facilities currently owned by CNG Transmission (CNGT) would not subject Big Sandy or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Big Sandy seeks a declaratory order finding that the facilities Cabot wishes to acquire from CNGT will be gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA. CNGT filed on October 21, 1994 in Docket No. CP95&hyph;32&hyph;000, a proposal to abandon these facilities located in Boone, Kanawha, and Raleigh Counties, West Virginia. While Cabot is the party having agreed to purchase these assets from CNGT, the parties anticipate that if this petition is granted, the pipeline and compressor facilities will actually be conveyed to Cabot's subsidiary Big Sandy, and the reserves and wells will be conveyed to Cabot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;198&hyph;000 and CP93&hyph;200&hyph;000, issued an order on July 21, 1994, (68 FERC 61,194, currently pending rehearing) preliminarily approving CNGT's application to abandon certain other gathering facilities Big Sandy proposes to acquire from CNGT. In that same order, the Commission declared that upon their acquisition by Big Sandy, the gathering facilities would be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under the NGA (``Big Sandy I'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Big Sandy says that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation (Cabot) and that Big Sandy owns no jurisdictional facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Big Sandy argues that the facilities to be transferred to Big Sandy meet the physical and non-physical criteria for determining gathering as set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmland Industries, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23 FERC 61,063 (1983), as modified by subsequent Commission orders. Big Sandy states that the diameters and lengths of the facilities to be acquired are consistent with the conclusion that the facilities are primarily gathering facilities. Most of the lines are less than 1 mile in length. More than three-fourths of the pipe to be acquired are 12 inches or less in diameter. Most is six inches or less in diameter. There are no processing plants on or connected to the facilities. There is one compressor station, Whitesville, that functions as a field compressor. The wellhead pressure feeding into the Whitesville System is very low, operating at approximately 50 pounds per square inch-gauge. The Whitesville Compressor Station is at the terminus of a portion of the facilities to be acquired. It is in the middle of another CNGT production area and is connected to CNGT's 12'' TL&hyph;263 line which, Big Sandy argues, likely would also be found to be gathering. Big Sandy says that when considered in the context of the entire area in which they are located, the facilities are in the central portion of a producing region surrounded by and connected to wells and other gathering lines. Big Sandy states that the system is akin to a ``spider web'' and that the facilities to be acquired do not even comprise the whole spider web. Only a part of CNGT's facilities in this area are being acquired by Big Sandy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to non-physical criteria, Big Sandy notes that it operates exclusively in West Virginia, and when it acquires the Big Sandy I facilities that are currently pending rehearing, it will own exclusively gathering facilities. Big Sandy argues that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koch Hydrocarbon Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FERC 61,374, 62,432 (1991), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tom Brown, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FERC 61,103, 61,400 (1990), the Commission declared both facilities in question to be gathering facilities, noting that Koch previously had limited its service in the area to gathering, and that Brown had limited its activities in the area to exploration and production. Further, Big Sandy states that the Commission found as well that Brown neither owned nor provided any jurisdictional service nor owned any jurisdictional facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Having reshaped the profit and loss and introduced a new style cash flow statement, the Accounting Standards Board is turning its attention to the balance sheet. The current hodge-podge of current cost and historical cost asset valuations clearly needs an overhaul. There is little consistency between companies as to what assets are revalued and how often. The ASB must also come up with a solution for the thorny issue of acquired goodwill, which many companies argue should not be amortised like a physical asset but revalued instead. Yet any move towards a system under which all assets are subject to regular revaluation is sure to meet resistance. Mr Ron Paterson of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, has argued for a more traditional approach. He is not alone in the view that the only hard evidence of what most assets are worth arises when they change hands. Introducing regular asset revaluations risks undermining the credibility of information contained on the balance sheet. Extending that approach to intangible assets such as acquired goodwill would introduce another layer of subjectivity. These practical arguments conceal deeper disagreements about the function of the balance sheet and accounts in general. Mr Paterson says that valuation is the job of the market, not the accountant. The balance sheet should thus confine itself to recording transactions and return to a system of pure historical cost. It is not necessary to agree with that conclusion to appreciate the sentiment. Whichever approach to the balance sheet the ASB finally takes, it must be wary of creating an expectations gap between what accounts can provide and what users think they are getting.</p>

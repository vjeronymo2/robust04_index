			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall in returns on assets RETURNS on assets made by Britain's 1,000 largest companies have fallen sharply in the past two years, according to a survey by Director magazine. Profits as a percentage of assets fell from 14.5 per cent in 1989 to 11.5 per cent in 1990 and 9.8 per cent last year, well below the 15 per cent that companies should make to cover what they are paying for borrowed funds. Margins have come under pressure from two sides: as profits have fallen, the value of assets has risen. With average returns at present levels, a number of board rooms are going to have a struggle to justify their long-term view of their company's future, the magazine said. The difficulties caused by inadequate margins are particularly marked among smaller companies - those with turnover of less than Pounds 500m. Pre-tax profits fell from 15 per cent of assets in 1989 to just 7.8 per cent in 1991. Among larger companies, with sales of more than Pounds 500m, profits are also in decline. Not one of the top 18 companies in the Director table could point to a consistent record of improving margins on assets over the past five years, the magazine said. Ford and British Aerospace had shown a negative return on assets, while BAT, the tobacco and financial services group, made only 4 per cent in 1991 and BP, the oil company, made only 5.4 per cent. A small group of large companies had maintained healthy returns however. GEC had made 24 per cent; BTR made 23.5 per cent; Unilever made 22.7 per cent; Marks and Spencer made 19.8 per cent and J Sainsbury 19.5 per cent. Some service companies with very few assets made very high returns, including Alexander Proudfoot, a management consultancy, which made 230 per cent. Foreign-owned companies recorded sharp falls in returns. Half of these companies in the Director 1,000 table made profits of less than 8 per cent of assets. Even those foreign-owned companies with higher returns had experienced sharp declines. Vauxhall, the motor group, fell from 140 per cent to 39 per cent and NCR, the electronic equipment group, fell from 129 per cent to 50 per cent. In contrast Polygram, the record group, made a 430 per cent return.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Big coalfield reclamation agreed - Germany to spend DM12bn on clean-up of lignite sites Germany's federal and state authorities are to pay DM12bn (Dollars 8bn) for one of the largest reclamation programmes for eastern Germany's open cast brown coal, or lignite, fields. The environment ministry yesterday confirmed that the programme will run a further five years to 2002. It was begun in 1991 and had been due to end in 1997. . The extension follows agreement by environmental ministers from the eastern German states to provide additional financing. Strabag, Hochtief, and Thyssen Handelsunion, the country's largest construction and engineering companies, are expected to play a major role in removing contaminated material and reclaiming at least 10,000 hectares. But the Treuhand privatisation agency, which oversees land reclamation projects in eastern Germany, rejected a bid from Morrison Knudsen, the US mining corporation, to participate in the project. Along with Britain's PowerGen and NRG of Minneapolis, Morrison Knudsen last year bought the viable parts of the Mibrag brown coal fields which straddle the eastern states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. The uneconomic parts are being closed by the Treuhand. Depending on the level of contamination, the reclaimed land will generally be used for recreation or farming. Already some of Mibrag's sites have been turned into lakes and leisure centres. The financing of the project, considered by energy experts as one of the environmental ministry's most ambitious land reclamation projects in eastern Germany, will be split between the Bund, or federal authorities, and the eastern states. The Bund will pay 75 per cent. The environment ministry estimated approximately DM1.5bn would be spent each year from 1995 to finance the project, in addition to the DM6bn already spent. 'But apart from bringing the land back to economic use, the decision to continue the land reclamation programme until 2002 means that 17,000 full-time jobs - maybe even 20,000 - will be guaranteed,' the ministry said. Many of the employees are former miners made redundant after German unification. The land reclamation schemes follow closures of several uneconomic brown coal fields belonging to Laubag, eastern Germany's largest lignite complex, located in the eastern state of Brandenburg, and Mibrag. Brown coal, one of the main culprits of east Germany's environmental problems under the communists, was the main source of energy for the region's factories. Laubag was recently sold to a west German energy consortium led by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, the country's largest utility, and including PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk.</p>

In this regard, Sutchit  Nimitkun, governor of Phuket Province, held a closed-door  meeting with some 20 officials at Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel on  13 February to map out reception for the Taiwanese leader and  his delegation.    The Dusit refused to answer any questions, saying the  meeting  is a regular event. However, it was reported that the meeting  discussed the reception and security measures for the Taiwanese  delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan will also come  to meet the president during his stay in Phuket. It was  stressed during the meeting that officials concerned must avoid  giving any news about the visit to the mass media for fear of  affecting the good relations between Thailand and China.    A source revealed that Amnuai Wirawan arrived in Phuket on  12  February and has been staying at the Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel.  However, the place where the Taiwan delegation will stay has  been kept secret. Amnuai was seen at Thai Muang Golf Course in  Phang-nga Province, presumably inspecting the readiness of the  golf course, where the Taiwanese visitors and Thai businessmen  will play friendship matches.</p>

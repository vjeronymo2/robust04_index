			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities turn lower in line with bonds Wall Street Falling crude oil prices and news of strong home sales set the stage for an upbeat opening to trading on US stock markets yesterday, but profit-taking and an afternoon retreat in bond prices left equities easier on balance at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 6.15 down at 3,677.80. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.16 at 461.90, while the Nasdaq composite shed 3.33 to 751.54. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 272.7m shares. Conditions were set for a firm start to trading yesterday when bond prices posted early gains. The bond market has rallied strongly over the past three days, primarily because a sharp fall in oil prices (which was triggered by the failure of Opec to agree on production cuts) and declines in the value of other key commodities have helped to ease fixed-income investors' inflation fears. The rise in bond prices, meanwhile, has lowered long-term interest rates, which has helped to allay concern that credit conditions in the US were tightening. But bonds fell from early highs yesterday, prompting some late profit-taking among equity investors. There was, however, some good news for stock market investors on the economy. Sales of existing homes rose by a larger than expected 3.6 per cent in October, the latest in a long line of statistics that suggest the pace of economic growth is quickening. Although oil companies were again the target of selling because of the drop in crude oil prices, the sector rebounded from its lows in the afternoon. Texaco lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 3/8 , Chevron Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 85 5/8 , Phillips Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 28 3/8 , Mobil Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 75 and British Petroleum Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 58. A positive article about Procter &amp; Gamble in the weekly business newspaper Barron's spurred the stock forward to leave a gain of Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 . Selected retailers were firmer in the expectation of strong Christmas sales. Gap Stores added Dollars 2 at Dollars 40 5/8 and JC Penney Dollars 1 at Dollars 54, but Sears Roebuck, after posting an early gain, staged a sharp reversal to finish Dollars 2 1/4 down at Dollars 53 3/4 . JP Morgan appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Bankers Trust firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 76 after the stock of the two banking groups was upgraded by broking house PaineWebber. Computer issues, after putting in a strong performance last week, ran into profit-taking. Motorola shed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 93 1/2 , Texas Instruments Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 62 and IBM Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 . Canada Dropping gold and energy shares and confirmation of a gloomy economic outlook from Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, pummelled the Toronto stock market to a sharply lower close. An analyst said it was not a good market even before Mr Martin took the podium and announced his bleak deficit and growth forecasts. The TSE 300 index tumbled 50.3 to 4,170.3 and declines trounced advances by 560 to 242 after volume of 53.5m shares valued at CDollars 615.8m. Among the sub-groups, the energy index fell 2.94 per cent, conglomerates 2.68 per cent, golds 2.59 per cent and industrial products 2.21 per cent.</p>

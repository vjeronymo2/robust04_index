			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Save me from Healthspeak: Michael Holman feels patronised by the language of Medical Correctness Save me from Medical Correctness. Protect me from Healthspeak. Deliver me from the well-meaning lobby that seeks to bowlderise and sanitise the language of illness and adversity. Let me declare an interest. I have Parkinson's Disease. Cabin staff on airlines size me up in seconds. I make for my seat, unsteady on my pins, stumbling over the odd word, and displaying that tell-tale tremor. 'What have we here,' they seem to say. 'He must have drunk half his fare in the Club Class lounge. One turn at the drinks trolley, and that's his lot.' I can cope with this. Wear a black armband, is my advice to fellow tremblers. The crew will then assume that you have been drinking to ease the pain, and proceed to press double whiskies on you. And nor do I mind taxi drivers who look the other way when I try to flag them down, as I stumble out of my office late at night. They suspect that I might bring up the one-for-the-road in the back of their cab. But what I cannot abide is Medical Correctness, its patronising language, and its Orwellian overtones. Is there a reader with a heart so hard that they were not moved to laughter, or at least an incredulous snort, when they read that the Spastics Society is to call itself Scope? Any day now I suspect the Royal Society for the Blind will call itself Vision, and the Parkinson's Disease Society will rename itself Horizon. Or possibly Horizon] One can accept the concern that spastic has become a term of abuse; perhaps there is a case for a change of name. So why not the Cerebral Palsy Society? This is dismissed as 'an easy and obvious step' by the society. The term cerebral palsy is 'limiting, medical and rather ugly and old fashioned'. Scope, on the other hand 'carries a degree of weight and a feeling of progress and some other positive associations: opportunity, liberty, elbow room etc'. The public relations campaign to replace its universally recognised brand name by this vacuous alternative will, by the way, cost Pounds 750,000. I fear the malaise is spreading. The Parkinson's Disease Society is also tampering with language. Please do not refer to people with Parkinson's as 'victims', or describe them as 'afflicted' by a 'crippling' condition, wrote the society's press officer in its newsletter last year. These words were 'judgmental', and bad for morale, readers were told. They made us tremblers feel 'helpless, bitter and unattractive'. You should not say that someone 'cannot walk', instead say 'uses a wheelchair'. This suggestion did not go far enough, I wrote in a facetious letter. 'Words such as crippling are not only judgmental, they are descriptive - two disquieting features of far too many words and phrases in the English language.' 'Clearly it is profoundly offensive to say that someone 'cannot walk'. But to say instead 'uses a wheelchair', as the newsletter suggested, is unacceptable,' I argued. 'Let us use the phrase 'enjoys enhanced mobility in a seated position'.' Alas, my letter backfired. The society thought I was serious. But I will return to the fray, for the society recently launched what it calls an awareness campaign. Its theme suggests that the society's left hand does not know what its right hand is doing . . . rather like Parkinson's Disease, come to think of it. The newsletter describes how the television advertisement 'shows a footballer striking the ball into the back of the net . . . fans erupt in a sea of scarves and flags . . . cameras cut to a solitary figure who makes a stark contrast to the animated activity around him . . . it depicts the vivid and compelling eyes of someone with Parkinson's Disease, looking out from a face which seems to be carved out of stone. Parkinson's has turned this person into a statue.' Well, it does not do much for my morale, I can tell you. If it raises awareness, however, and gets research funds rolling in, I'm all for it. But the society cannot have it both ways. If it does not want Parkinson's to be called a 'crippling' disease, it should not use a face of stone-like immobility as a shock tactic to elicit sympathy. Drop the euphemisms, because they do not help. They do not fool the sick, and they mislead the healthy. Sufferers and victims, blind and crippled, let us raise our canes, rattle our Zimmer frames, roll out our wheelchairs, raise our voices, and together cry: 'Down with Healthspeak] Away with Welltalk]' And speak up you silent masses, who are sound in wind and limb, heart and mind. You may be inhibited for fear of being thought intolerant, unsympathetic or insensitive - but it is your language that is being tampered with. Beware the day when Medical Correctness triumphs, and 'able bodied' and 'healthy' and indeed, 'fit as a fiddle' will be words that incur rebuke. 'How are you feeling,' your GP will ask. 'Not physically challenged, thanks doctor.' Medical Correctness is motivated by compassion, but seized by a dangerous illusion: that if you change words, you change reality.</p>

Therefore,  international cooperation is being sought as the only means of  consolidating an effective barrier against a supranational type  of problem. This statement was made yesterday by Raul Campos  Rabago, commissioner of the PGR's [Office of the Attorney  General of the Republic] [National] Institute To Combat Drugs.  He was participating for the second time in the sessions of the  Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse  [CICAD], being held in Mar del Plata, Argentina.    Addressing representatives from North, Central, and South  America, and the Antilles, the Mexican official specified  Mexico's achievements in this respect during 1993, describing  them as a record in the battle against the drug traffic. He  reported confiscations of nearly 46 tons of cocaine, 129 kg of  opium gum, 27 kg of morphine, 26 kg of heroin, and a ton of  poppy seed.    He also cited approximately six tons of marijuana seed, 500  tons of marijuana, 23,000 units of psychotropic substances, more  than 2,000 land vehicles, 24 aircraft, and six vessels seized.  Moreover, five clandestine laboratories for processing and  refining various illicit substances or narcotic precursors were  dismantled. Over 200,000 marijuana plantations and approximately  160 poppy crops were seized as well; and 18,000 nationals and  75,000 foreigners involved in committing crimes against health  were captured.    In the juridical-penal area, Campos Rabago remarked that the  most significant action taken in the context of the national  antidrug policy was the amendment to the regulations of the  Organic Law for the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic. It created the National Institute To Combat Drugs,  assigning a sector of the Federal Judicial Police to that  decentralized agency, to achieve an ethical, professional police  force devoted exclusively to fighting the drug traffic.    At the same time, he gave a reminder that, early this year,  several articles of the Federal District Penal Code pertaining  to both the common jurisdiction and the entire republic were  amended, given additions, or repealed. Including Articles 193 to  199, and 201, regulations pertaining to crimes against health  were established, to provide for more severe punishment.  Addressing the representatives of the CICAD's 24 member nations,  and those of the observer states, he stressed that all the  national and international action taken to combat drugs is  reducing the power of the criminal associations.    Nevertheless, he noted that, to deal with the problem with  modern, really effective methods, "it seems essential to us that  all countries have a juridical frame of reference, a national  program, and a central coordinating and executive organ. Hence,  we take the liberty of urging those who have not yet done so to  ratify and, if pertinent, sign the United Nations Convention of  1988 against the illicit trafficking of drugs and psychotropic  substances."    He explained that, with that expedient, "many of our nations  have taken steps to harmonize their legislation, which is an  essential factor for dealing with the problem on a regional and  international scale, in a coordinated manner. This will make it  possible to accrue increasingly positive results in this battle,  which can be won only through the political will and concerted  action of all nations."    Raul Campos Rabago emphasized that, in the case of the  Mexican experience, "our country has always stressed that the  causes and not merely the effects of the drug traffic must be  attacked." In this forum, he reiterated Mexico's conviction that  it was imperative to promote alternative development of  underprivileged rural areas, where extreme poverty has fostered  the illicit crops as a means of subsistence.    He continued: "In my country, great importance is attached  to  suitable planning and regional coordination of the strategies  for combating drugs and drug addiction. The aim is to reduce  consumption and, hence, the demand for and illicit trafficking  of drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as the associated  activities.    "It is highly desirable to promote the establishment of  coordinated action in the interior and among the various  geographical areas comprising the American Continent, always  based on the principle of respect for national sovereignty and  jurisdictions."</p>

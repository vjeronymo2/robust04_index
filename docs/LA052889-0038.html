			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT CROSSROADS IN THE SQUARE  </P> <P> After weeks of political euphoria, of daily demonstrations of the people's  will, of spoken dreams for a new China, the thousands of students camping on  Tian An Men Square, the tens of thousands of citizens marching each night,  waited. They waited because they knew they had done all they could. They waited  also because it is not they, but a small group of old men who would decide the  path China will next trod.  </P> <P> Each evening last week, thousands of students and professors and bus drivers,  doctors and Popsicle vendors, engineers, journalists and factory workers,  mostly young but some older folks, gathered in front of the ornate gate of  Zhongnanhai, a former imperial compound and now the working residence of  China's leaders. Through the open gate, beneath the crimson lacquered upswept  eaves of this portal to power, the crowd saw, on an inner wall, immense  characters scrawled in the calligraphy of Mao Tse-tung that read: "Wei renmin  suwu" -- "Serve the People."  </P> <P> The people stood, they sang, they chanted, they called on the old men behind  this gate to hear them, to serve them. Cries of "Down with Li Peng," "Long Live  Freedom," "Long Live Democracy," echoed against the high cement walls, even as  the somber green-uniformed praetorian guards stood at attention before them.  </P> <P> Li Peng, the prime minister, had forbidden this. He declared martial law,  banned the encampments on Tian An Men Square, the parades through the heart of  the capital, the slogan-chanting outside his compound. Yet the people  persisted. They blocked his soldiers and ignored his commands. They flaunted  their power and flouted his. But they knew this is China -- and in the end it  is not they but the men in Zhongnanhai who would decide how this all ends and  that it could end at gunpoint.  </P> <P> "Maybe the government will win," said a 23-year-old student of international  politics at Beijing University. "That is because of military power. They have  the guns. If the army wants to come, it could come immediately. Like South  Korea, the people could be defeated."  </P> <P> But before the guns are drawn, it is the party's leaders, Deng Xiaoping, the  man who set China on a course of economic modernization and reform, Yang  Shangkun, the elderly military leader who is the country's president, Qiao Shi,  the Communist Party disciplinarian, Zhao Ziyang, the party's general secretary  who now has been eclipsed, and Li, who would decide. Everywhere on Beijing's  streets, there are rumors of the power struggle being waged within this  coterie, a battle over the soul of the party, over authority, the right to  rule, indeed the right to call oneself a communist.  </P> <P> It is now assumed that Deng, the man unquestionably behind Li's effort to  impose martial law, has turned viciously on his chosen head of the Communist  Party, Zhao Ziyang, labeling him a "counterrevolutionary." Zhao is under house  arrest, and it is said that his personal secretary Bao Tong has been arrested  and a purge of Zhao's supporters is under way. Then again there are rumors that  Li will be dismissed -- because he cannot prevail in one version, because he  must be sacrificed in another.  </P> <P> This leadership battle, the most brutal since Mao's death in 1976, has  paralyzed the government and shattered the fragile succession structure  assembled by Deng in the last two years. Although he has sought to withdraw  from the quotidian work of government, Deng has remained the guiding influence  for significant policy decisions and personnel changes. The explosive momentum  of the student protests -- what are now citizen protests -- has exposed the  frailty of Deng's efforts, and the brittleness of the party he has tried to  rebuild in the past decade.  </P> <P> Last week, Deng, who heads the military commissions of both the party and  government, was forced to tour the country to rally support among China's  regional military commanders. Yet it required some time to determine what their  attitudes were. He has apparently attacked Zhao and thrown his weight behind Li  and the demand for repression -- all in an effort to preserve his vision of a  China, at once wealthy, powerful and controlled by an unshakable Communist  Party.  </P> <P> Unacknowledged by Deng, though, his labors are precisely what have borne the  fruit of protest, a discontent over tyranny and the yearning for some measure  of individual and collective freedom. Economic liberalization -- encouraging  free markets and individual initiative to drive the economy -- cannot be  isolated from other facets of a society's development. This is the lesson of  the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan. But more is at work. New ideas and new  values have flooded into China along with the Sony televisions, National  refrigerators and Peugeot automobiles.  </P> <P> The young politics student, standing unshaven on Tian An Men Square, smoking  distractedly under the midday sun, put it bluntly. "We have grown up in the  last 10 years. The Chinese people have grown up. Everyone is awakened. Everyone  can see."  </P> <P> And what Chinese in cities from Beijing to Canton, Chengdu to Shanghai see is  the unwillingness of China's leadership to embrace the norms of modernity  accepted elsewhere. This is why Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has  mastered the art of discourse, of persuasion, of the genuine, has become a hero  for China's students. Gorbachev has failed utterly to bring Soviet citizens the  material rewards that Deng has, yet he has declared his respect for people's  minds, for their will. This China's leaders have been unable to do -- unable  even to understand why they must.  </P> <P> The Chinese now take economic achievements for granted. They want more, and on  the streets of China's cities, they are saying they want it now. Not everyone  says the same thing, but they all see how their demands are related. This  coalition of desire has fueled the most powerful challenge to China's communist  leadership since 1949. Last week a journalist from the Guangming Daily marched  under his newspaper's banner on Thursday and spoke, not of abstract notions of  freedom, but of censorship. "We cannot write what is true," he said. "We cannot  write what we should. We want to tell the Chinese people the truth." A young  man from Shenyang, a student at the Lu Xun Art Academy, talked earnestly of  democracy, "We should be able to elect our leaders, like they do in the West."  Four workers from a railway department carried a placard reading "Li Peng step  down."  </P> <P> For the Communist Party, and especially for the emerging new hard-line  leadership, none of these ideas is palatable, none acceptable. Free elections,  as experience has shown in the Soviet Union and sentiment on the streets here  has demonstrated, are counterrevolutionary -- at least in that they signal the  demise of the party's claim to represent the people. The right to protest, a  free press, guarantees of individual privacy and a government of law, all  undermine the principles by which the Communist Party continues to exercise its  authority.  </P> <P> On Tian An Men Square, as night closed in once again, the young students  huddled under makeshift tents and lean-tos. Bicycle tea wagons labored through  the maze of passages that separate the encampments, the students of the China  Opera Institute from the Sichuan Foreign Languages Institute, the Petroleum  Institute from Beijing University's archeology department. The students were  weary and admitted being far from their goals. Less than one hour away, in all  directions, were hundreds of thousands of soldiers, armed with assault rifles  and tanks. The students and the citizens of Beijing knew they had stopped the  soldiers before, but they seemed unsure about being able to do it again.  </P> <P> Perhaps all that prevented Deng -- and his public voice, Li -- from issuing  those orders is a deep-seated unease over the probable cost. More likely  though, while the intense struggle was being waged within the leadership, there  was no one -- not even Deng -- who could issue orders of this magnitude. It  seems certain now that the party has suffered damage so serious that it will  never rule with the authority it had before. But nonetheless the new party  leadership appears intent upon a period of intellectual and political  repression, a course that has failed in the past but remains the only one they  know.  </P> <P> "Changes," the student of international politics said, "must come from outside  the party. Inside the party, they won't listen to the people. The walls around  them prevent them from touching the people. This is a long course, maybe 20,  maybe 50 years. But what we are doing is a worldwide trend. If the party does  not reform itself, it will be overthrown by the people."  </P></p>

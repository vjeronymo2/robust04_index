Addressing the sixth session of the kwaZulu legislative  assembly, Mr Buthelezi said: "I cannot see that a large number  of the people of kwaZulu/Natal will be willing participants in  the elections."    Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the African National  Congress [ANC] of using the power of the state to shake the  country and seize power at the polls. "They have the laws which  were made to assist them, and the security forces which they are  reconstituting to apply the laws in their favour," he said.    Mr Buthelezi said kwaZulu took a stand against the interim  constitution because its grassroots constituency had demanded  it. "There is a vast Zulu concern about the future governance of  kwaZulu/Natal, which they see as the kingdom of kwaZulu.    "I warn that should the ANC attempt to destabilise the  kwaZulu government, as it destabilised Bophuthatswana and has  threatened destabilisation against the Ciskei, a conflict of  awesome proportions will be unleashed to the tragic detriment of  South Africa and the democratic process."    Mr Buthelezi said his rejection of the interim constitution,  the Transitional Executive Council and other transitional  mechanisms carried with it powerful conviction that the Zulu  people would not be robbed of their right to self-determination.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER, FORD TO HELP MONITOR VOTE  </P> <P> Former President Jimmy Carter joined fellow ex-President Gerald R. Ford on  Friday to help monitor Panama's presidential election.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Carter said, "The process of democratization of Panama  has been very slow, and that is one of the reasons we decided to come here to  monitor the elections."  </P> <P> Ford arrived Thursday night as part of an delegation headed by Carter under the  auspices of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. Carter is  chairman of the private council.  </P> <P> There was no immediate government reaction to Friday's announcement in  Washington that President Bush is sending an official delegation of 14 U.S.  observers headed by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) to monitor the elections.  </P> <P> The official U.S. delegation is to arrive today at the U.S. Howard Air Force  Base, thereby avoiding Panama's requirement for entrance visas.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Strong comeback at Tandem Computers TANDEM Computers of the US made a strong comeback in its fourth quarter after restructuring earlier in the year. The manufacturer of fault-tolerant computer systems reported record fourth-quarter and full-year revenues. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 27.2m, or 25 cents a share, on the high side of Wall Street expectations, in spite of an Dollars 8m pre-tax restructuring charge. Last year it reported net earnings of Dollars 2.9m, or 3 cents, for the quarter. On Wall Street, the stock price closed Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 13. Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 576.3m, up 13 per cent from Dollars 509.1m in the same period last year. In the first quarter of fiscal 1992, Tandem took a Dollars 98m pre-tax restructuring charge for job cuts and consolidation of operations. This resulted in a net loss for the year of Dollars 41.2m, or 38 cents a share when a fourth-quarter charge of Dollars 8m is included. In 1991, the company earned Dollars 35.2m, or 33 cents. Revenues for the year rose 6 per cent to Dollars 2.04bn from Dollars 1.92bn in 1991. Revenues increased in all geographic regions, Tandem said, with international sales lifted by 'an outstanding quarter and year in Canada'. Although European results were mixed by country, total revenues reached record levels. 'We remain cautious about the future,' said Mr James Treybig, president and chief executive.</p>

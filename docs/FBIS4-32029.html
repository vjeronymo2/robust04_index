			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Zidaru: "Due to the Fact That No </F> Compromise Could Be Reached, the Expression `Elimination of the  Consequences of Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact' Will Be Eliminated From  the Future Romanian-Russian Treaty"]    [Text] Mircea Geoana, spokesman for the Romanian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, referring to the renegotiation of the basic  Romanian-Russian political treaty at a recent news conference,  said: "We continue to have differences in approaching the issue  of including in the future Romanian-Russian treaty certain  provisions that would properly assess all those events that had  a negative impact on Romanian-Soviet relations." As is known,  negotiations were held on 1-3 June between representatives of  the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The main controversial point between the two delegations is  the formula "to eliminate the consequences of the  Ribbentrop-Molotov pact" proposed by the Romanian side and  rejected by the Russian side. "We have not reached any formula  of compromise. We are still far from solutions," as Dumitru  Ceausu, head of the Romanian delegation and director of the  directorate in charge of judicial issues and treaties, told us.  We remind our readers that the normalization of relations with  Russia and the conclusion of a basic treaty were the issues  raised by Ambassador Richard Schifler and General George A.  Joulwan during their recent talks with Romanian authorities in  Bucharest. The next round of talks will take place in Bucharest  in September.</p>

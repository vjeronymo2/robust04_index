			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS, IF NOT YOUR CHECK, IS LIKELY TO BE IN THE MAIL;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT OFTEN INVISIBLE POLITICAL FORCES IN  AMERICA IS THE MAILBOX. IT KILLED CATASTROPHIC HEALTH CARE.  </P> <P> Late last year, Congress overwhelmingly repealed the Medicare Catastrophic  Coverage Act. The same elected officials who a year earlier had proclaimed the  act a major legislative achievement rushed to say that its repeal was no less  important.  </P> <P> What happened? Tons of mail demanding the law's repeal were dumped on Capitol  Hill.  </P> <P> But where did the opposition to the social program for seniors come from? After  all, the legislation was the product of a careful compromise between the Reagan  Administration and Democratic leaders and was supported by the largest  senior-citizen groups in the country. If Congress could flip-flop on such a  universally agreed upon program, what else might it flip-flop on?  </P> <P> The repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was the result of one of  the most important but often invisible political forces in America -- mailbox  politics. One of the major political developments of the 1970s was the growth  of special-interest groups who organized direct-mail campaigns around single  issues. Although the type of person attracted to these organizations changed in  the 1980s, their numbers and political clout grew. The direct-mail techniques  honed by these activists undid catastrophic health care.  </P> <P> Nearly all the big stories during the '80s -- from policy in Central America to  abortion -- shared something in common. Associated with them were large numbers  of donors linked through mailing lists and, as a result, kept informed of new  developments that usually required specific political responses. These  communications were, in essence, an alternative press without the constraints  of the regular media.  </P> <P> The power of such direct-mail organizations to mobilize citizens to action  simply by depositing a message in a mailbox is decried by some, applauded by  others. After the catastrophic-health-care fiasco, some legislators even urged  that this form of political speech be regulated. But as in the case of  television's coverage of politics, criticism and calls for regulation are  mostly intellectual hot air.  </P> <P> "Mail-order" political organizations are a sign of democratic strength.  Viewpoints that may momentarily be in the minority or of little interest to the  general public, but are strongly held by a diverse or scattered constituency,  can be represented and promoted if their advocates can find each other. The  only economically practical way to do this is through the mails.  </P> <P> This type of political activity has its drawbacks, of course. Leaders of  mailbox organizations can exploit essentially unedited communications to  manipulate followers. This is exactly what proponents of the Medicare  Catastrophic Coverage Act accused the repeal groups of doing. Such political  manipulation and demagoguery, to be sure, occur in all political settings. But  with direct mail, there are few, if any, of the usual checks and balances  associated with political advocacy.  </P> <P> Another drawback of mail-order politics is its tendency to focus on a special  interest to the exclusion of all legitimate competing interests. But everyone  looks out after their own interests first. The problem is that decision-makers,  who must balance competing interests, are afraid to talk back to the  direct-mail organizations, as they apparently were in the case of  catastrophic-health-care legislation.  </P> <P> The benefits of advocating through the mails are substantial. Direct-mail  organizations are meaningful and legitimate political outlets for a large and  diverse society. They are a detour around the institutional inertia of the  established political order; they facilitate the introduction of important new  political issues into the political arena. Many senior citizens who supported  repeal of catastrophic health care, for example, felt betrayed by the  established seniors' group because it supported a new tax. They recognized the  need to form a new organization to represent their viewpoint. The mails gave  them their opportunity.  </P> <P> Thus, average Americans can sit at home and let the political process come to  them in the form of "offers" to become involved with new causes and issues. He  or she can select what issues or groups to support with much greater  flexibility -- and often with greater effect -- than either can choose their  representative. As with mail-order merchandise, stay-at-home letter readers can  draft their own mail-order political platform and tailor their own political  campaign. They know where to recruit: from lists of people who have supported  other causes.  </P> <P> This networking of people through the mails is how the Reagan revolution was  able to spread. The opposition to Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the U.S.  Supreme Court was another example of the same phenomenon. Politicians who  switched their allegiances did so because the cumulative weight of active  public opinion shifted.  </P> <P> The passing of a political issue can also be determined, in one sense, by  monitoring the mails: When the targets of the tens of millions of direct-mail  appeals "order" fewer of the "offers" found in their daily mail. It is hard to  create a sense of urgency when there isn't any, or maintain collective,  cooperative efforts when interests diverge. This is one of the safety valves in  the direct-mail system. Another is the existence of competing offers, and the  capacity of people to know when their efforts are being wasted.  </P> <P> The main beneficiaries of "mail-order politics," as with most large-scale  political activities in America, is the middle class. There is something  inherently democratic about a movement composed of hundreds of thousands (even  millions) of individual supporters, which is precisely the case with most  mailbox organizations and not with most political-action committees. The main  losers, as usual, are the less affluent, largely because they do not have any  alternative means of being heard. And since the poor are less settled, less  established and preoccupied with more basic concerns, they remain  underrepresented.  </P> <P> The techniques of mailbox organizations do not exist in the political desert.  Direct mail is now an integral part of most political activity, whether of  candidate, party or political action committee. Neither is the power and  influence of television any less. Actually, many think of direct mail as "poor  man's television." But as the TV-evangelist experience has shown, it is the  checks in the mail, which usually come in response to direct-mail appeals  reinforced by television, that pay the television bills.  </P> <P> The two media -- television and the mails -- combined create the most power,  but only through the mails can carefully targeted, pre-selected messages be  sent. Indeed, the best place to look for the new issues and groups that will  dominate the 1990s will be your mailbox. And if you're lucky, you'll find  messages from the group or groups who represent your views. If you don't see  what you like, why not create your own?  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 6 KYODO -- A special Japanese  envoy met a top U.S. State Department official Wednesday [6  April] at the start of a private visit apparently designed to  seek a breakthrough in stalled bilateral trade negotiations.    Nobuo Matsunaga, a veteran diplomat with extensive ties in  Washington, has arranged several rounds of informal talks with  senior officials in the Clinton administration during his stay  here throughout the week. The appointments include meetings  with trade representative Mickey Kantor, Robert Rubin, head of  the White House National Economic Council, and presidential  National Security Adviser Tony Lake.    Matsunaga began his round of calls after arriving in  Washington on Wednesday with a meeting with Undersecretary of  State for Economic Affairs Joan Spero. He said after emerging  from his visit to Spero that they had only a "general  discussion" on bilateral relations.    There was no discussion on the stalled "framework" trade  talks between the two countries, he said.    State Department officials also said Matsunaga and Spero had  a broad discussion of bilateral ties. Matsunaga "didn't bring  any specific message from Japan," a State Department official  said.    Matsunaga's trip to Washington came after Japan and the  United States set up a meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata and Kantor for next week in Morocco.    Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the stalled framework  talks, which have become a focal point of escalating tension in  bilateral trade ties.    After the trade talks ruptured on February 11 at a summit  between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Washington reinstated the "Super 301"  trade law provision which gives the U.S. Government broad  authority to impose sanctions on countries accused of practicing  unfair trade.    The Japanese Government last week offered a new package of  market-opening measures, but Kantor rejected the proposals as of  "little substance." Earlier this week, the U.S. Government  turned up the heat by putting Japan on top of a list of  countries accused of maintaining significant trade barriers  against U.S. products.</p>

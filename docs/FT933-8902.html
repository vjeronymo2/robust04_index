			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Sweden and Finland announce cut in rates THE CENTRAL banks of Sweden and Finland yesterday cut interest rates to help stimulate a revival of their recession-hit economies. The Bank of Finland cut its base rate by half a percentage point to 6 per cent, its lowest level for nearly 40 years. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, cut its key marginal rate from 8.25 per cent to 8 per cent, continuing a pattern of reductions which began after the country floated its currency last November. Sweden and Finland are expecting their economies to shrink for the third consecutive year in 1993, and badly need lower interest rates to spur recovery and cut unemployment. Both countries are hoping for positive growth next year on the back of higher exports. Sweden's long-term and short-term interest rates are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said the bank had decided to cut its marginal rate for the second time in a week because of the 'significant fall' in long-term interest rates and because financial markets had responded well to previous cuts. He noted that the Swedish krona had strengthened in recent weeks following a sharp depreciation earlier in the year.</p>

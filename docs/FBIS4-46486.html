			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Capt 2d Rank V. Kamenev, cand tech sci, and Capt </F> 1st Rank (Ret) A. Votyakov, cand tech sci, docent: "Seismic Mine  Firing Mechanisms"]    [Text] Many countries of the world--the  USA, Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and  others--are undertaking significant efforts to improve mine  weapons because, in the opinion of specialists, mobility,  covertness of their placement, selectivity of destruction and  the possibility of a prolonged effect upon the enemy during war  raises them to the rank of strategic weapons.    Mines are also viewed as a variant of psychological and  economic weapons, finding wide use in naval operations and local  conflicts. The navies of many countries possess a substantial  arsenal of mines and a sufficient number of carriers for their  mass use, beginning with shallow coastal and ending with deep  remote regions of the world ocean.    Recently, the "countenance" of mine weapons changed  significantly in connection with use of the latest advances in  science and technology. Microprocessor technology, capable of  quickly analyzing and processing a large volume of information,  has come to be used extensively in mine initiation, targeting  and detonation systems. Progress in development of such systems  also made it possible to put nontraditional fields to work, ones  which had not been utilized earlier to create proximity firing  mechanisms for mines.    Being a material body, a ship is known to be the carrier of  a  number of physical fields (magnetic, acoustic, hydrodynamic,  seismic and so on). By its presence it unavoidably creates  certain distortions in most natural physical fields, to which  proximity systems of mine weapons react, isolating a useful  signal from these distortions, to be used for analysis and to  activate its devices. We will dwell here only on use of the  seismic field for these purposes.    A ship's seismic field is secondary, and it is formed in the  material of the sea-bed in response to the ship's hydrodynamic  and hydroacoustic fields. Therefore, the corresponding sensitive  elements of such mines evaluate and analyze the features of this  field with the purpose of revealing perturbations introduced  into the material of the sea-bed as a result of the presence of  a ship or vessel in a particular region.    Figure 1 is a basic model of how a ship's seismic field is  generated. It shows formation of a system consisting of a chain  of elements that generate and shape the signal: the source of  oscillations (the ship), the water column, an elastic medium  (the sea-bed material), and a receiver (a mine with a seismic  proximity firing mechanism). It is arbitrarily referred to by  specialists as a complete seismic channel. A block diagram of a  complete seismic channel is shown in Figure 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-43A>      Figure 1. Basic Model Showing Formation of a Ship's Seismic Field </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-44A>      Figure 2. Block Diagram of a Seismic Channel </FIG>     The sum of characteristic signals of some force in a certain  frequency band forms at the source of the oscillations. These  oscillations transmit a perturbing effect through the water  column to an elastic medium (the sea-bed material), evoking a  seismic wave, which reaches the location of the mine and its  seismic proximity firing mechanism. After the logical circuit  analyzes the obtained information and compares it with a set of  standards, the firing mechanism "makes the decision" regarding  destruction of the object (target).    Judging from communications in the foreign press, mines  equipped with seismic firing mechanisms began appearing in the  ground forces of the USA and then in other armies in the 1960's.  Sea mines appeared in the 1970's. They came to be used widely  together with land models in shallow water, especially in  anti-assault landing minefields.    The advent of such proximity firing mechanisms was brought  on  by:     -  the high speed with which seismic waves spread through the  material of the sea-bed, owing to which the corresponding  receiver could detect the ship's motion with some lead time,  thus increasing the time the mine's equipment has to analyze the  received signal in order to classify the object;    -  presence of a  number of unique characteristics of seismic waves, which in  contrast to hydroacoustic waves for example, make it possible to  develop proximity firing mechanisms that are more resistant to  interference;    -  the possibility of using geophysical methods for  analyzing the signals--their grouping, correlation analysis and  so on, making it possible to employ effective means of isolating  the useful signal from the background of interference of natural  (microcircuit) and artificial (explosions) origin.        The basic characteristics of mines of the world's leading  countries with proximity firing mechanisms containing seismic  channels are shown in the Table.

Intensive development of  such mines is making it necessary to study the fine structure of  a ship's seismic field more carefully, and to seek ways and  means of fighting these mines.

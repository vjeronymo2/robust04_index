			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 71. Proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) concerned applicants who made multiple patent certifications. In essence, the proposed provision would consider the approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be effective on the last applicable date. One comment would amend proposed &sect;314.107(b)(4) by adding a new sentence stating:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the applicant has submitted certifications under &sect;314.50(i) or &sect;314.94(a)(12) and has submitted notice to the owner of the patent pursuant to &sect;314.95, and FDA subsequently receives a stipulation or order by the district court notifying it that the applicant has amended its answer to add new arguments, not included in that notice, in any ensuing suit for patent infringement, the date of approval will be calculated based on a 30-month period starting at the date of receipt by FDA of each such stipulation or order, and the approval will become effective on the last applicable date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatively, the comment suggested that an ANDA applicant who amended its answer to a patent infringement suit to include arguments that were not in the notice to the patent owner under &sect;314.95 would be considered to have been uncooperative in expediting the lawsuit. The comment explained that these revisions would prevent generic drug companies from amending their answers during patent infringement litigation to delay completion of a trial and also delay the start of the 30-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA declines to adopt the comment's suggestion. As stated above, FDA has revised the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52(c) and 314.95(c) to parallel the statutory language rather than specify notice requirements. The agency has neither the resources nor the expertise to engage in patent disputes or questions regarding sufficiency of notice. The statute leaves the issue of extending the 30-month period (based on a lack of cooperation between the parties in patent litigation) to the discretion of the trial court. The agency believes that the trial court should make determinations of cooperation on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the agency declines to amend the rule to consider an applicant to be uncooperative and to extend the 30-month period if the applicant amends an answer to a complaint in patent litigation to include an argument not reflected in the notice to the patent holder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 72. FDA received several comments on proposed &sect;314.107(c) and the 180-day exclusivity period against subsequent ANDA's. As proposed, &sect;314.107(c) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant that made a paragraph IV patent certification (that the patent was invalid or not infringed) and was sued for patent infringement. Seven comments said the language requiring an ANDA applicant to have been sued in order for the 180-day exclusivity period to become effective was contrary to the statute and to a judicial ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act can be applied straightforwardly only when an applicant who seeks the 180-day period of exclusive marketing has been involved in a patent infringement lawsuit. To apply the section where there has been no lawsuit would require that the agency ignore the textual relationship between section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) and (j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act and assume that Congress intended, contrary to the goals it stated in the legislative history, to create an incentive for delay in generic competition, without any countervailing benefit to society. Moreover, it would provide a windfall to an applicant who has not devoted the considerable time and money necessary for patent litigation. Thus, consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of the act, &sect;314.107(c) applies only when the first applicant has been sued. Although, as the comments state, one Federal district court reached a contrary conclusion, the agency appealed that decision and, on appeal, the decision was vacated as moot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inwood Laboratories, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Young,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 723 F.Supp. 1523 (D.D.C. 1989),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vacated as moot,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> no. 89&hyph;5209 (D.C. Cir., November 13, 1989). The agency has not altered its interpretation of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has, however, revised &sect;314.107(c) to clarify other issues, such as the start and end of the 180-day exclusivity period, and to make minor editorial changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

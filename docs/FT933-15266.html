			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad The City's collective memory yesterday strained to recall an occasion when a company had suffered such a rapid reversal of fortune as Owners Abroad so soon after fighting off a hostile bid. Just four months after rejecting Airtours' offer of 150p, Owners has warned that this year's profits may be half the market's expectations. The one-third fall in Owners' share price to 66p expressed the scale of disappointment. During the bid, Owners did not issue a formal profits forecast but made much of its claim that trading was at record levels. Even considering the industry's notorious volatility, the suddenness of the transformation is astonishing. The Takeover Panel should force Owners, and its financial adviser, Samuel Montagu, to justify the statements made during the bid period. The resignation of Owners' chief executive is scant consolation for Airtours which wasted Pounds 9m on its bid.</p>

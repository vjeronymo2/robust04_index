			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Italy faces uncertainty after voters rebuff ruling coalition ITALIAN POLITICIANS turned their attention yesterday to the problems of forming a new government after Sunday's general election left the outgoing four-party coalition with only 47 per cent of the vote. The election result was a sharp rebuff to Italy's long-running Christian Democrat authority and has created an unprecedented fragmentation of parliament. Senior ministers readily conceded this situation had opened up grave uncertainties about the country's governability. 'What people have called an earthquake is indeed true,' said Mr Enzo Scotti, the Christian Democrat interior minister, commenting on the final results. 'Our country now faces institutional problems, delicate problems of governability linked to the decisions concerning institutional reform which will now have to be taken on board.' Newspaper headlines yesterday proclaimed: 'in search of an impossible government', 'the wall of the Christian Democrats has fallen', 'nomenclatura dismissed', and 'four-party coalition buried without heirs'. These reflected the mix of drama and confusion in the face of a protest vote that saw support switch from the Christian Democrats and their main Socialist allies to a range of parties across the political spectrum. Final results showed that 16 parties would be represented in the chamber of deputies. Of these, 12 held less than 6 per cent of the vote and only the Christian Democrats more than 20 per cent. The populist Lombard League emerged as the main new force, capturing 9 per cent of the vote nationwide and becoming the second largest party in northern Italy. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, is due to present his resignation later this week to be followed on April 23 by the first meeting of the new legislature. Between April 27 and April 30 the new parliamentary group is due to be formed. Only when this has been completed will it be possible to talk seriously of the formation of a new government in what could prove a lengthy process. President Francesco Cossiga has pledged to begin informal soundings as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the statements by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev on a change in Russian foreign policy  relating to the CIS states and the Baltic region, Latvian  Council of Ministers President Valdis Birkavs has commented as  follows:    [begin Birkavs recording] Mr. Kozyrev has announced that the  CIS and the Baltic countries [words indistinct] regions in which  quite important Russian interests are concentrated, and from  which the main threat to these interests [words indistinct];  speaking of the military presence in this region, complete  withdrawal from this region, that is, the (?complete lack) of  military presence in this region is extremely [word indistinct].  There is no need to withdraw from those regions which for  centuries have been in the Russian sphere of interest, and there  is no need to be afraid of these words. A security vacuum will  start to form if Russia's troops are withdrawn from here.  Rather than fleeing, supplementary forces are being brought in,  which are always threatening, in some cases hostile to Russia.    In my opinion, this announcement in fact indicates a serious  change in Russia's position. Moreover, I cannot but associate  this position with the recent meeting of U.S. and Russian  leaders. Latvia must, therefore, absolutely reinforce its  position, and in my view security policy has become a state  priority [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

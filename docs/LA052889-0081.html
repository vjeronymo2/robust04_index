			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS HIT GOAL TO SAVE EAGLE ROCK, KEEP GOING  </P> <P> Eagle Rock activists have raised $10,000 as part of an effort to persuade city  officials to buy the 50-foot boulder from which the community gets its name.  </P> <P> The mark was set as an initial fund-raising goal. But the activists say they  are not stopping now.  </P> <P> The Save the Eagle Rock Committee, a community group formed last year to fight  a developer's proposal to build apartments on the land that includes the rock,  is asking the city to create a public park on the 2.2-acre lot.  </P> <P> The committee reached its self-imposed goal by selling paperweights in the  shape of the rock and T-shirts with "Save the Eagle Rock" printed on them. The  group also organized a pancake breakfast that drew city officials, including  Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Stopping'  </P> <P> "Now that we've found out how easy it is, we're gonna change the goal to  $20,000," said Katie Smith, chairwoman of the committee. "You can tell  everybody we're not stopping."  </P> <P> The residents who formed the committee have said that if the city does not find  the money to buy the property north of the Pasadena Freeway, they will buy it  themselves. Their effort has gained widespread support in Eagle Rock and among  residents groups throughout Los Angeles.  </P> <P> City officials have said they will do everything they can to buy the land at a  reasonable price. In November, the city hired an appraiser who estimated the  value of the land at $500,000, said Brad Sales, spokesman for Councilman  Richard Alatorre. The city Department of Recreation and Parks has set aside  $230,000 to purchase the land, and a number of city officials have said they  support the purchase.  </P> <P> City officials are also exploring the possibility of swapping a city-owned lot  for the land that includes the rock, Sales said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historical Monument  </P> <P> The southwest portion of the rock is a sheer cliff that looms imposingly above  the Ventura Freeway. The cliff has an indentation in its face that produces an  eagle-shaped shadow in the afternoon. The entire rock formation was declared a  historical monument in 1982 by the city's Cultural Heritage Board but was not  acquired by the city.  </P></p>

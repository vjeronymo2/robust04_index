			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Europe boosts its Security Council weight Germany and Italy were elected to the UN Security Council last night, giving Europe 40 per cent of the seats when they begin their two-year terms in 1995. Britain, France and Russia are permanent members and the Czech Republic then will be in the second year of its term. Secret balloting was conducted in the General Assembly following nominations by regional groups. Indonesia, Botswana and Honduras also were elected. The fact that the European Union's four principal states will be members for the next two years can only add to a growing clamour by third world countries for a radical restructuring of the council. Discussions that have been going on for some time have made little progress, in part because of disagreement about the size of an expanded council. While Germany and Japan seem likely eventually to be admitted as permanent members, many delegates say claims by big countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America must be considered for a similar status.</p>

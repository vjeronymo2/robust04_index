			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-GERMAN PARLIAMENT OPENS IN BERLIN  </P> <P> The first democratic all-German Parliament in 57 years convened in the historic  Reichstag building Thursday, and its senior legislator, Willy Brandt, called on  the united nation to shoulder greater global responsibilities.  </P> <P> In a keynote speech to the new Bundestag, the policy-making lower house, the  77-year-old former chancellor said that modernizing the former East Germany  will be a huge task but must not detract from growing German duties around the  world.  </P> <P> "Germany would heap guilt on itself if out of its own concerns it forgot world  concerns: hunger, migration of the poor, environmental destruction," said  Brandt, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing East-West detente in the  1970s.  </P> <P> "We all know the tasks in our country are not minor," he said of Bonn's costly  commitment to turn eastern Germany into a mirror of affluent western Germany.  "But we cannot fail to show solidarity with the wretched of this earth."  </P> <P> Elected democratic representatives from all Germany last sat together in  Berlin's Reichstag, the historic seat of German legislatures, in December,  1932. Adolf Hitler's Nazis took control the next year.  </P> <P> The lawmakers will return to the seat of government in Bonn for future  meetings. They eventually will decide whether to move permanently to Berlin,  the unified nation's symbolic capital.  </P> <P> The 662 deputies elected in Germany's general elections Dec. 2 included 150  representing the former East Germany, which dissolved into Bonn's Federal  Republic on Oct. 3.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led  Bosnian presidency Saturday [9 April] evening accused Serbs of  killing ``many people'' in a gas attack on the eastern  Moslem-held enclave of Gorazde.    A spokesman for the presidency here was unable to give  casualty figures, saying reports varied widely with some  mentioning thousands of dead.    In Istanbul, Bosnian Vice-President Eyup Ganic told AFP that  ``hundreds'' of people had been killed during the course of  three chemical attacks on Gorazde on Saturday. ``This is  genocide under UN supervision,'' he said.    Ganic added that he would be flying to New York on Sunday,  at  the demand of President Alija Izetbegovic, to demand an  emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Azeris accused of Karabakh shelling FIGHTING has flared again in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, despite a ceasefire pledge by Azerbaijan, Armenia's ambassador to Russia said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Felix Mamikonyan told a news conference that despite a ceasefire that was due to begin at midnight, Azeri troops had bombarded villages in north and east Karabakh. 'Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed to suspend their armed activities but the Azeri side has already broken its obligations with a series of attacks,' he said. There was no immediate comment from the Azeri side. Itar-Tass news agency later reported that Karabakh Armenians had repelled an Azeri attack on villages in Mardakert district in the north of the enclave, scene of heavy fighting between the majority Armenian population and Azerbaijan. About 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, which was administered by Azerbaijan throughout the Soviet period. Karabakh Armenian authorities now say the enclave is an independent republic. The latest round of bloodshed began in May when Karabakh Armenians drove out their ancient foes and punched a land corridor through Azeri territory to Armenia. Azeri forces launched a counter-attack in June. Exploratory talks in Rome on a peace conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, to be held in the Belarussian capital Minsk under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), were suspended on Tuesday.</p>

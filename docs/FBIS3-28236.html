Representatives of the ruling parties reached the accord as  they resumed talks Friday to avert a major political crisis that  emerged after Hosokawa brushed aside opposition from the largest  governing party, the Social Democratic Party, and announced the  imposition of a new 7 percent indirect tax on Thursday.</p>

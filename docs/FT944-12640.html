			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Workers at Rover accept 10.7% Rover Group car workers have voted narrowly to accept a pay deal which for most of them is worth 10.7 per cent over the next two years. In a postal ballot 11,993 backed the package - seen by many outside the company as over-generous and a dangerous pointer for pay deals elsewhere - and 11,102 voted against it. Mr Tony Woodley, the TGWU national officer for the car industry, said: 'The closeness of the result reflects the complexity of the deal and the frustration among the workforce still undergoing major changes. The company should take nothing for granted.' Rover said it welcomed the result. Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analyst, said: 'The narrow result reflects the fact that people are looking for a little bit more on top of proposed pay offers.' Although the deal provides a 3.7 per cent general pay increase from next month and a further 4 per cent in November 1995 or inflation if higher, most Rover workers will gain extra pay as a result of changes in the grading structure that replaces five manual grades and six non-manual grades with three joint grades. The unions have calculated that this will produce increases of about Pounds 5 a week in the first year and a further Pounds 1.86 a week in the second. Mr Hatchett said the recent rejection by Jaguar workers of a pay offer worth 7.5 per cent over two years may have hardened resistance among Rover Group workers. A strike ballot is being held among Jaguar workers, although talks are continuing between the company and the unions and neither side believes they are on course to conflict. Shopfloor unease reflected at the two companies seems likely to add to pressures at Nissan and Peugeot-Talbot, which are about to negotiate deals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 22 Apr -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  has received Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the  Western European Union [WEU], who is on an official visit to  Ukraine.    Ukraine comes out for the creation of an all-embracing  security system in Europe and regards its participation in this  system as one of the main external guarantees of its own  national security, pointed out President Leonid Kravchuk. He  told the guest that Ukraine regards cooperation with European  structures as one of the priorities in its foreign policy. A  proof of this is the fact that Ukraine was the first among the  CIS countries to joint NATO's Partnership for Peace.  Possibilities of admitting Ukraine to the consultative forum  for cooperation of the WEU with the countries of central-eastern  Europe and the Baltic states were discussed during the meeting.  The Ukrainian president informed the secretary general about  the political situation inside the state after the parliamentary  election, which, in the opinion of the interlocutors, should not  affect relations with foreign states.</p>

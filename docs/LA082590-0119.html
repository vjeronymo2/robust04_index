			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CAROUSEL FANS RIDE IN FOR AUCTION  </P> <P> Marianne Stevens has fond memories of the old carousel ride at Coney Island.  </P> <P> She loved the delicately carved wooden horses with shiny glass black eyes. And  today, more than 30 years later, she owns one of the largest and most exclusive  carousel collections in the country.  </P> <P> In town this weekend for the auction of the Bud Hurlbut carousel collection at  the Anaheim Convention Center, Stevens says America has once again fallen in  love with the vintage musical horses.  </P> <P> "A few years ago they were considered nothing but pieces of wood left to  dry-rot somewhere," said Stevens, who lives in New Mexico. "Now they're a hot  item with people all around the country interested in buying them at whatever  cost. There are not too many things out there built to endure the years like  the wooden horses have. They are truly collectors' items."  </P> <P> Hundreds of collectors are expected to attend today's auction that will  showcase about 120 antique horses and other figures owned by Hurlbut, the  one-time owner and operator of the rides at Knott's Berry Farm. More than half  the figures were located at Knott's Lagoon area.  </P> <P> "Hurlbut just basically decided that it was time to let go of the figures,"  said William Mann, a New York collector also in town for the auction.  </P> <P> "He said he'd held on to them long enough and that it was time for someone else  to enjoy the antiques."  </P> <P> Of the 6,000 hand-craved wooden carousels that were made in this country  between 1900 and 1925, only 200 remain and just 80 are in working condition.  Carousels that are now placed in amusement parks are made of fiberglass and  aluminum.  </P> <P> Mann said the concept of carousels was developed in the 17th Century when  European horsemen, playing an Arabian game, would ride at full speed to spear  gold rings with their lances. To practice for this event, the rider used crude  wooden horses attached by beams to a central pole that was rotated by servants.  </P> <P> Immigrants brought the craft to America and soon carousels were a common sight  at fairs across the country.  </P> <P> The Dentzel factory and the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., both Philadelphia-based  operations, were the largest producers of carousels before the Depression.  </P> <P> The Dentzel products currently have the highest value among collectors, with a  piece made by Gustave Dentzel in 1900 selling for $148,000, the most ever paid  for a figure, at an auction in 1989. On Saturday, collectors expect a 1903  Dentzel horse decorated with the American flag to draw the highest bid,  $100,000. ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

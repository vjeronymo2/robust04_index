			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE PLEAD NO CONTEST IN INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEME  </P> <P> A former secretary in a State Farm Insurance office pleaded no contest Monday  to charges that she stole more than $250,000 from the company through bogus  accident-claim settlements, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Rhonda Simpson pleaded to five counts of grand theft and four counts of  insurance fraud.  </P> <P> Her husband, Robert Simpson, 39, pleaded no contest to four counts of receiving  stolen property.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan accepted the pleas and scheduled  sentencing July 9. Under terms of a plea agreement, Rhonda Simpson will receive  a five-year prison term and her husband a one-year jail term. They must also  pay restitution.  </P> <P> Rhonda Simpson, who worked for a State Farm agent in Canoga Park, was accused  of submitting 165 phony claims during 1986-88 and receiving $251,244 that went  into a joint account with her husband.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker said Rhonda Simpson would use repair and  billing documentation from old claim files to produce a new claim, then forge  the agent's signature and make the draft payable to her husband. She also  altered copies of the draft sent to State Farm to conceal the pattern of  payments.  </P> <P> The fraud was uncovered by a company claim confirmation program in which a  small, random sampling of claimants are sent follow-up letters to confirm the  facts and payment amounts, Licker said. When one claimant denied making the  claim, an internal audit was launched.  </P> <P> The Simpsons were in Colorado when charges were filed and were extradited to  Los Angeles to face charges.  </P></p>

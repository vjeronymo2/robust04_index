			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Hope ascendant in bullish Hong Kong With hopes of an interest rate cut pushing the Dow to a record level, and the pay settlement by metalworkers and employers in Germany sending the DAX to a 21-month high, sentiment was generally bullish last week and the FT-Actuaries World Index gained more than 1 per cent. All was not well everywhere, Finland registering the steepest fall in the index. Insurers and banks were the main casualties. Helsinki has been fairly erratic since the stamp duty tax on share transactions was removed at the start of the month, and after a flurry of interest the market has retreated into lethargy. However, Kleinwort Benson's latest monthly review says there should be a further stimulus once all foreign ownership restrictions are removed, possibly by the autumn. Other Scandinavian markets, with the exception of Denmark ahead of next month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, had a good week. In particular, Sweden is looking strong, with Astra active last week on a better than expected first quarter. Elsewhere in Europe, Italy recovered, the Comit index rising by nearly 3 per cent on Thursday following Fiat's announcement of a Dollars 2bn joint venture with FSM, the Polish car maker. The market should get another short-term boost once the political impasse has been resolved; this is now a little nearer after Monday's election of a new president. Looking to Asia, Hong Kong stood out as the star performer, in spite of beginning the week in negative territory as the Olympia &amp; York troubles led to selling of property issues. However, traders soon put this behind them as hopes of a further easing in interest rates, fulfilled on Friday, pushed the Hang Seng index to new highs. The percentage point cut in the prime rate surprised the market, and analysts had no hesitation in forecasting that the index will soar.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change   % change              % change in local currency**           sterling**  in US                                                                Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of     Start of   Start of                                          1992         1992       1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.36   -1.98   -20.12     +7.75        +3.97      +0.83 Belgium      -0.69   -0.11    -2.64     +4.71        +1.32      -1.73 Denmark      -1.05   +0.29    -6.20     -5.18        -7.66     -10.44 Finland      -5.28   -0.07   -23.92     +7.47        +4.24      +1.09 France       +1.07   +2.96   +13.13    +15.85       +13.80     +10.36 Germany      +3.24   +1.58    +3.98    +12.48        +8.71      +5.42 Ireland      +0.34   -2.79    -0.79     +0.91        -1.51      -4.49 Italy        +5.21   -1.85   -10.25     +0.87        -2.01      -4.97 Netherlands  +0.98   +0.29    +7.06    +10.36        +6.71      +3.49 Norway       -0.26   +5.40   -12.86    +10.07        +7.24      +4.00 Spain        -0.34   +3.92    -6.72     +6.00        +4.70      +1.53 Sweden       +2.89   +5.49    +2.80    +15.52       +13.29      +9.87 Switzerland  +0.10   +3.00   +13.62    +14.99        +7.90      +4.63 UK           +1.19   +2.96   +10.63    +10.42       +10.42      +7.10 EUROPE       +1.44   +2.25    +6.62    +10.57        +8.64      +5.36 Australia    +1.36   +4.36    +7.68     +1.37        +4.13      +0.98 Hong Kong    +3.17  +10.54   +53.64    +37.79       +42.79     +38.48 Japan        +1.69   +3.63   -28.51    -20.73       -21.07     -23.45 Malaysia     -0.08   -0.42    -6.79     +2.42       +13.94     +10.50 New Zealand  +1.02   +5.96    -4.69     +0.45        +2.58      -0.51 Singapore    -0.44   +4.01    -2.13     -1.09        +1.05      -2.00 Canada       -0.49   +0.62    -3.49     -3.68        -3.92      -6.82 USA          +0.91   +1.33   +10.82     -0.61        +2.47      -0.61 Mexico       +0.38   -4.39   +69.39    +19.11       +20.34     +16.71 South Africa -0.16   +9.94   +19.52     +7.39        +0.17      -2.86 WORLD INDEX  +1.24   +2.40    -3.12     -3.42        -2.79      -5.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 22nd 1992.

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLAYTON PITCHES NORTHRIDGE PAST CAL STATE L.A., 3-2  </P> <P> From the moment he was named Cal State Northridge baseball coach in the summer  of 1988, Bill Kernen has maintained that the key to the Matador program will be  effective recruiting.  </P> <P> Overshadowed by the players who signed on last season was Kernen's hiring of  former Cal State Fullerton ace Dave Weatherman as pitching coach.  </P> <P> Weatherman, the winningest pitcher in Fullerton history, helped lead the Titans  to the 1979 national championship. And in his short tenure with the Matadors,  he has helped develop Weathermanesque potential in sophomore right-hander Craig  Clayton.  </P> <P> That was evident again Friday night at Cal State Los Angeles where Clayton  weathered some shaky Northridge defense and pitched a complete game as the  Matadors defeated the Golden Eagles, 3-2, in a California Collegiate Athletic  Assn. contest.  </P> <P> Clayton, who pitched just 6 2/3 innings last season, allowed three hits and  struck out six against the Golden Eagles, improving to 5-2 with his third  complete game.  </P> <P> His effort, coupled with back-to-back home runs by Denny Vigo and Eric Johnson  in the fourth inning, helped the Matadors (11-10, 6-5 in conference play) end a  four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> "Every time I come in between innings I talk to (Weatherman)," Clayton said.  "He tells me what I should be trying to do and it clicks in just like that."  </P> <P> Weatherman, who compiled a 42-11 record at Fullerton, downplays his impact on  Clayton's success -- but their similarities in mechanics and attitude are  obvious to anyone who saw Weatherman pitch.  </P> <P> "(Clayton) has a lot of natural ability but his best quality is his  competitiveness," Weatherman said. "Each time out, he's gotten better and  better."  </P> <P> The Matadors, who committed five errors Wednesday in a loss to Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo, had four more against the Golden Eagles (9-13, 2-2), including two  in the second inning that led to the game's first run.  </P> <P> Northridge came back and took the lead in the fourth on Vigo's and Johnson's  back-to-back-homers off losing pitcher Abdom Pinon (2-1). It was Vigo's seventh  homer and Johnson's second.  </P> <P> The Matadors added what proved to be the game-winning run in the fifth when  Mike Sims scored on a wild pitch by Pinon after reaching on a fielder's choice  and advancing to third on a double by Clayton.  </P> <P> Cal State L.A. pulled to within, 3-2, in the home half of the fifth when Randy  Day walked, stole second and scored when Sharts mishandled a throw by Clayton  on a bunt by Brent Bish.  </P> <P> Cal State L.A. missed an opportunity to tie the score in the sixth when  Picketts, who had singled, was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a  double to left field by Mart Tourville.  </P> <P> The Matadors and Golden Eagles conclude their two-game series today at Matador  Field at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Northridge then plays 11 nonconference games -- eight against Division I  opponents -- before resuming CCAA play April 5 against Cal Poly Pomona.  </P></p>

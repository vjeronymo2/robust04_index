			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (29): Wonder stocks lose their allure - Apart from Roche, the drugs sector had a poor year. The recession also undermined the standings of many chemical companies / Sector Analyses - Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals The wonder stocks of late 1980s and early 1990s, pharmaceuticals companies had a mixed year last year. While a few, such as Roche of Switzerland and Schering of Germany, did more than creditably, others gave their investor relations officers some considerable problems explaining their performance. Overall, the drugs sector endured a poor year. Of Europe's top 10 pure pharmaceuticals stocks, six saw their position in the FT500 fall and two were stationary, while only two - Roche and Schering - moved up the rankings. The reasons for such a disappointing performance were not hard to find. Healthcare reform implemented in Germany and Italy knocked sales back. IMS International, the market research group, estimated European pharmacy drugs sales in the seven largest markets were static during the first nine months last year. That compared with 8 per cent growth during the whole of 1992. The German market during the first nine months was down 10 per cent and Italian sales down 3 per cent. At the same time, pharmaceuticals stocks suffered from fears about President Clinton's healthcare reforms. These were delayed from the spring to the autumn, adding uncertainty. Investors remained wary of the sector's shares as analysts attempted to estimate the impact of the plan on drugs groups' profits. The outstanding exception to the rule was Roche whose market capitalisation overtook not only Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs company by sales, but also Merck &amp; Co of the US, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. The Swiss group marched up the FT500 from sixth position in 1992 to third last year. Roche's outstanding year was partly because it was relatively immune to the US healthcare reform. Although about 40 per cent of its drugs division's sales are in the US, about half of these are to hospitals which are not affected by President Clinton's proposals. In addition, the group has a strong portfolio of new drugs driving impressive volume growth. US brokers Lehman Brothers expect Roche to generate volume growth of 13 per cent until late 1995, an impressive achievement in such a difficult healthcare environment. They forecast Roche's pre-tax profits to increase from SFr2.6bn in 1992 to SFr3bn last year and SFr3.6bn this year. Schering's performance last year has also been impressive, its position rising from 155 to 137. The company has sold its chemical operations and merged its troubled agrochemicals business with that of Hoechst, enabling it to become a pure pharmaceuticals company. At the same time, it revealed Betaseron, the first effective treatment for multiple sclerosis. Goldman Sachs expects compound earnings growth this year and next to be an impressive 30 per cent. Institut Merieux, the French group, moved up from 253 to 216 as its vaccines operations continued to perform well. The rest of the sector disappointed, unable to escape investors' fears about the market and their decision to switch into cyclical stocks capable of benefiting from an economic recovery. Glaxo's market capitalisation suffered considerably over the past 12 months, and its ranking fell from second to seventh. Astra, the Swedish group and Glaxo's main rival, remained static at 32nd. Locally its shares did well, but in dollar terms it was held back by the devaluation of the Swedish krona. Sandoz of Switzerland slipped from 20 to 21, while its neighbour Ciba dropped from 24 to 26. Bayer of Germany was static at 34th. Among the British stocks, SmithKline Beecham fell from 11 to 23 as it was hit hard by the Italian reforms. Fears about the expiry this year of the US patents for its important ulcer treatment Tagamet also undermined support for the shares. Wellcome dropped from 29 to 59 after disappointing underlying growth from its top-selling anti-viral product Zovirax. Preliminary results from an Anglo-French trial which suggested AZT, its treatment for Aids and HIV, might not be effective in HIV-positive people without symptoms, hit both the shares and sales. The once high-flying Fisons dropped from 215 to 311 during a traumatic year which culminated in the sacking of the chief executive, resignation of the finance director, and second profits warning in two years. The group registered the FT500's fifth-worst fall last year. Meanwhile, Zeneca, ICI's former bioscience business, entered the FT500 at 52. In 1992, the chemicals industry performed better than the drugs sector as investors switched into cyclical stocks. But last year, the recession in Germany and France undermined their standings. The German groups suffered particularly. Hoechst fell from 45 to 55 as its profits plunged during the first nine months by 40 per cent and its chairman hinted of another dividend cut. BASF also dropped from 56 to 63, as its pre-tax earnings during the first nine months fell 44 per cent and it also warned of another dividend cut. DSM, the Dutch petrochemicals group, was one of the FT500's biggest fallers, down from 218 to 395, reflecting the dire state of Europe's plastics industry. ICI fell from 28 to 71, but the apparent collapse was due more to the company's split into two separate groups than any particular problems at the British chemical concern. Rhone-Poulenc of France entered the FT500 at 79 after its privatisation by the French government last year. Laporte was one of the few climbers in the sector, up from 306 to 284 following its acquisition of Evode. The industrial gases businesses which had proved a haven from the recession fared less well in 1993. L'Air Liquide fell from 52 to 72, BOC dropped from 80 to 128, and AGA slumped from 203 to 225.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       FT500     Company                          dollars m        Rank    Sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Roche Holding                     35683.6           3      622 2   Glaxo Holdings                    29175.5           7      433 3   Sandoz                            16740.3          21      433 4   Smithkline Beecham                15609.6          23      433 5   Ciba                              14154.9          26      622 6   Astra                             12595.0          32      433 7   Bayer                             12333.6          34      622 8   L'Oreal                           11558.0          42      432 9   Zeneca                            10363.9          52      433 10  Hoechst                            9971.0          55      622  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11  Wellcome                           9185.0          59      433 12  BASF                               9064.6          63      622 13  Imperial Chemical Industries       7871.3          71      622 14  L'Air Liquide                      7865.3          72      621 15  Rhone-Poulenc                      7279.7          79      622 16  Procordia                          6797.5          82      433 17  Viag                               4890.1         118      622 18  BOC Group                          4548.3         128      622 19  Akzo                               4329.7         133      622 20  Schering                           4164.9         137      622  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 21  Elf Sanofi                         3808.8         152      433 22  Reckitt &amp; Colman                   3551.5         157      431 23  Rentokil Group                     3161.5         181      622 24  Courtaulds                         3159.3         182      621 25  Solvay                             2910.1         197      622 26  Novo Nordisk                       2806.6         203      433 27  Institut Merieux                   2630.4         216      433 28  AGA                                2518.1         225      621 29  Roussel-Uclaf                      2397.4         234      622 30  Smith &amp; Nephew                     2285.7         245      431  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 31  Synthelabo                         2112.7         262      433 32  Beiersdorf                         1931.0         281      432 33  Laporte                            1895.5         284      622 34  Degussa                            1874.7         289      622 35  Christian Dior                     1803.3         302      432 36  Fisons                             1749.9         311 433 37  Cookson Group                      1656.5         326 621 38  DSM                                1352.5         395 622 39  Gambro                             1250.4         415 433 40  Gehe                               1238.7         417 433  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 41  Ems-Chemie 1218.2 420 622 42  Altana 1159.9 434 433 43  Nobel Industries 1056.2 463 622 44  Montedison 1033.8 468 622 45  Allied Colloids Group 977.6 484 622  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

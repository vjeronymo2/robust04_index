			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been another arms theft at the Ouidah  Military Camp. A large quantity of arms and ammunition  disappeared last night. The armory guard is said to have left  his guard post to have something to eat between 2100 and 2130.  When he returned he found the armory door ajar. Seven rocket  launchers, [name indistinct] automatic pistols, assault rifles,  magazines, and 300 cartridges had already disappeared. The camp  officials were alerted and an initial search led to the  discovery of some cartridges but most of the arms and ammunition  are still missing.    This theft, which is not the first at the Ouidah Camp, is  happening at a time when security problems have increased and  tension has risen slightly after the CFA franc devaluation.</p>

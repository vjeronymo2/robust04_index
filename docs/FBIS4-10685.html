			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Interests Section in Havana granted only  20,000 of the 100,000 visas requested in 1993. Could this be a  factor prompting the illegal and risky departure of thousands of  people from Cuba?    Why do people chose to leave Cuba illegally? What are the  main causes? Lourdes de Urrutia, a Havana University sociologist  and member of a group who conducted a study on the matter of  illegal emigration, explains.    [Urrutia] "I believe it is interesting to point out why  those  who choose to leave illegally do so. The fact is that 53 percent  of those interviewed do not meet immigration law requirements,  [passage indistinct] first-degree blood relationship that is  required in order to be legally sent for by relatives in the  United States. A certain percentage of those interviewed who do  meet the requirements, or have first-degree blood ties with  relatives in the United States, opt to leave illegally because  they believe it is speedier than leaving via legal channels, and  circumvents all the paperwork required to depart legally. Thus,  I believe illegal departures are conditioned by the  restrictiveness of U.S. policies and by the parameters for  people to be able to emigrate legally to the United States that  that country establishes."    Specialists are of the opinion that economic reasons, as  well  as the difficult situation Cuba is going through, are the main  reasons people weigh in choosing to leave Cuba illegally.    [Urrutia] "Among the economic reasons these people mention  is  the frustration they are experiencing because of the conditions  of the special period. There is also the fact that over 70  percent of them decided to leave Cuba during the special period,  after 1990. Therefore, these are not people left behind from  past surges of emigration. They are people who reached their  decisions between 1990 and the present, and primarily during  1993, which is the year our study was on. This is the year when  the difficulties of the special period were most acutely felt.  We believe that all this supports our conclusion that this  emigration is of an economic nature."    The matter of illegal Cuban emigration to Florida reflects  the status of immigration relations between Cuba and the United  States. It also shows that this matter continues to be part of  this bilateral conflict.</p>

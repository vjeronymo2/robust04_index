			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Building output falling CONSTRUCTION across a recession-hit western Europe is likely to fall by about 3 per cent this year with only a slight improvement expected next year, judging by forecasts from 13 countries published yesterday in Helsinki. The forecasts compiled by Euro-Construct foresee the biggest falls in housing and private sector commercial property development, both hit by high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. Worst affected have been Scandinavia and Britain, where the collapse of property markets has been greatest. In Germany rebuilding the former communist-controlled eastern part of the country is placing an increasing strain on investment elsewhere in the economy. The value of construction output in constant prices is expected to rise by only 1.5 per cent this year and by 1 per cent next year. Forecasts available from Euro-Construct, Millbank Tower, Room 1214, Millbank, London SW1P 4QX, price: Pounds 250. Survey: European building and construction, Pages 33-37</p>

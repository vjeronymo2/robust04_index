			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / British Fittings surprised by pre-tax loss of Pounds 3m THE SHARE price of British Fittings Group, distributor of pipelines and maker of water pumps, fell 31 per cent yesterday, from 153p to 105p, as the company announced a surprise pre-tax loss of nearly Pounds 3m and senior management changes. The company also took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.18m to cover last year's theft of brass and copper bar and plate from a subsidiary, which is being investigated by the police. Announcing the figures yesterday, Mr Brian Stanton, who is about to drop the role of chairman while continuing as managing director, said: 'A month ago I was still working on a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. Two and a half weeks ago I had a phone call to tell me what had happened. It was the first I knew that the profit we were talking about had turned into a terrific loss.' The Birmingham-based company had put out a warning to the stock market in February that its 1991 pre-tax profit would be less than the Pounds 5.7m predicted at the time of a Pounds 7.1m rights issue last July. This was already below the Pounds 6.21m made in 1990. A new finance director - Mr Cecil Buckett, formerly of Newman Tonks  - took up office on May 1. He replaced Mr Brian Smith whose position on the board is under review. Yesterday's figures showed that operating profit slid from Pounds 9.41m to Pounds 3.15m on turnover of Pounds 82.2m, down from Pounds 88.7m. The biggest division, pipeline equipment, limited its fall to less than 50 per cent, while water pumps made less than a quarter of the previous year's figure and non-ferrous metal distribution fell into the red. Exceptional costs of Pounds 3.19m were incurred. The main causes were the transfer of water pump manufacture to one site, redundancies, a write-down in the value of the pump hire fleet, and an adjustment for errors in a subsidiary's 1990 balance sheet which were being investigated by the Fraud Squad. As part of the process of tightening up financial controls, Mr Stanton said seven subsidiary directors had been replaced by four new appointments. Net debt was reduced by about Pounds 4m to Pounds 21.3m, gearing of 61 per cent. The loss per share amounted to 12.95p, against earnings of 20.09p. The final dividend was cut to 4p making a total of 5.375p (7.35p).</p>

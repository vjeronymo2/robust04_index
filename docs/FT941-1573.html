			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman public offer oversubscribed The Swedish government said yesterday its sale to the public of a 34 per cent stake in AssiDoman, the forestry group, had been more than two times subscribed. Combined with a further 15 per cent placed with Swedish and foreign institutions, the sale will raise SKr7.6bn (Dollars 962m). Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said he intended to go ahead with the even larger privatisation in June of Pharmacia, the state-controlled pharmaceutical group spun off last year from Procordia. That issue could raise as much as SKr16bn at current market prices, but some doubts have been raised about the timing due to a spate of new issues in the Swedish market this year and the apparent end of a recent bull market. Mr Westerberg said market conditions would dictate how much of the state's 45 per cent stake would be sold off this year but the intention was to dispose of the entire holding. Some 590,000 Swedes applied for 86m shares in AssiDoman, 2.3 times the 37.5m on offer. The shares, to be listed from April 8, were priced at SKr138 for the public, a discount from the price of SKr153 set for institutions which valued the group at more than SKr16bn.</p>

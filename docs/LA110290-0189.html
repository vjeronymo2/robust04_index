			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ARSON IN N.Y. DAILY NEWS STRIKE  </P> <P> The front of a store selling the strike-torn Daily News was hit by arsonists  today and two delivery men were attacked, but the newspaper said it distributed  more than a million papers overnight.  </P> <P> The violence came after more than 13,000 union supporters rallied in front of  the News building late Thursday, temporarily closing a block on 42nd Street.  </P> <P> Dozens of labor leaders and politicians urged the strikers to continue their  fight. Cardinal John O'Connor sent a letter saying, "I do not believe that  union members wanted to initiate the current strike."  </P> <P> Police initially estimated the crowd at 5,000 but later changed their estimate  to 13,000. They reported no arrests or injuries during the demonstration, but  several scuffles erupted.  </P></p>

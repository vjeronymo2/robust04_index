			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banesto agrees to sell stake in winery business La Corporacion Banesto, the industrial holding company within Spain's Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), has agreed to sell its 67 per cent stake in the winery Bodegas to Bodegas y Bebidas for Pta4.51bn (Dollars 34.5m), AP-DJ reports from Madrid. Bodegas and Bebidas is owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV). Bodegas is the top exporter of wines from Spain's Rioja region. In 1993, it posted a profit of Pta500m on sales of around Pta6bn. The disposal forms part of Banesto's gradual sale of non-banking assets, ordered by Banco Santander when it took a majority stake in April.</p>

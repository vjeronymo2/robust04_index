			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Fall in pound rebounds on holiday costs THE DEVALUATION of sterling yesterday hit the package holiday industry with Thomson, Britain's largest travel company, blaming the weaker pound for price increases of up to 10 per cent on holidays to some European ski resorts. Prices for all 1993-94 winter holidays sold by Thomson will, however, increase by only 2 per cent after the company warned resorts they risked losing UK business. Thomson's winter programme, which goes on sale on Friday, provides the first indication of how sterling's fall will affect big tour operators' prices. This summer's holidays are unaffected by last September's devaluation because tour operators had bought forward their foreign currency until next October. Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, said price rises for skiing holidays in France, Austria and Switzerland had been unavoidable. Thomson has, however, increased its ski programmes in Spain and Italy, where weaker local currencies have enabled the company to lower prices on some programmes. Ms Astles said the price of skiing holidays in Italy had fallen by 5 per cent overall. France, Austria and Switzerland account for 75 per cent to 80 per cent of Thomson's ski programme for 1993-94 compared with 85 per cent last winter. The prices of winter holidays in Florida have gone up by only 3 per cent, in spite of sterling's weakness against the dollar. Ms Astles said Thomson had been able to keep prices low because the US recession and the reluctance of Americans to travel had caused an oversupply of Florida holiday accommodation. Thomson had warned all resorts they would not attract UK tourists unless they took the weaker pound into account when setting prices. Ms Astles said: 'Our negotiating stance was to say: 'If you don't help us you will lose business.' Not everybody helped us, but quite a lot of people realised that it's no use having a price rise of 14 per cent.' Thomson said sales of winter 1993-94 holidays through travel agents were likely to be slightly up on last winter's 2.7m. UK and US government negotiators yesterday began a new round of talks in London to attempt to negotiate a new 'open skies' aviation agreement between the two countries. The talks are expected to take several months.</p>

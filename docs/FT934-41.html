			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reverse takeover for Europe Energy A list of potential car dealer-ship acquisitions is being drawn up by Mr Gerald Davison, the former Honda executive and Keep Trust chairman who is to lead the conversion of USM-quoted Europe Energy from a Welsh mining company into an intended vehicle retailing group. Mr Davison, former Inchcape director Mr Huw Pritchard and two other partners have launched an agreed reverse takeover of Europe Energy, involving a 13-for-4 rights issue partially underwritten by Townsley, their adviser. The Pounds 1.8m proceeds will be used mainly to pay off the debts of Europe Energy, which earlier this month reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 75,000. The remainder will help finance the first of what Mr Davison said will become a chain of vehicle dealerships. Although a first acquisition has not been publicly identified, it is expected to involve further fund-raising, the probable suspension of the shares and reassessment of the company's USM status. Mr Davison will take over as chairman and chief executive from Lord Torrington at an extraordinary meeting to approve the restructuring on January 10. He said the company's mining activities would continue although a buyer might be sought.</p>

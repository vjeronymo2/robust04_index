			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KEYBOARDIST BENOIT IN A CAREFREE MOOD AT THE GREEK  </P> <P> David Benoit must live in a different world. The keyboardist and his group  played a lengthy set Saturday night at the Greek Theatre full of happy-go-lucky  melodies and carefree solos that carried little of the edge we associate with  modern times. Doesn't this guy have any Angst in his life?  </P> <P> If he does, it isn't reflected in his material. Tunes like "Sailing Through the  City" and "Every Step of the Way" typically started with elegant introductions  that soon moved into optimistic, major-key themes. There were no mistakes  during the solos because no one was taking any chances. The emotions expressed  in the songs were genuine; they just didn't run very deep. And when the next  number began, it often sounded suspiciously like the last.  </P> <P> It's not as if Benoit doesn't have the technique to get his point across. He  displayed ability in abundance on a fast-played, untitled blues number that had  him swinging up and down the keyboard in a persistent, if not witty, manner  before supplying a hotbed of chords behind saxophonist Eric Marienthal's  sparking alto solo. But this kind of excitement was the exception rather than  the rule.  </P> <P> Adding further gloss to the already glistening proceedings was the inclusion of  the Warfield Avenue Strings, whose 12 pieces were orchestrated to track the  melodies and add a heart-tugging shimmer here and there. Best addition to the  proceedings was singer Jennifer Warnes, who used her warm, smooth voice to put  a saintly touch to "Song of Bernadette."  </P> <P> The opening act, flutist Tim Weisberg, was also hurt by simplistic material. To  his credit, Weisberg, who has a light, airy tone, avoids blowing overtones or  other novelties like humming into his instrument. But he limited his playing to  short, melodic lines that gained detail only after he kicked in an electronic  echo device.  </P> <P> Fittingly, Benoit brought Weisberg back to the stage for a final encore  together entitled "Duet for Dorothy," a piece that quoted freely from  "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." Isn't it time these guys left Oz and got back to  solid ground? BILL KOHLHAASE  </P></p>

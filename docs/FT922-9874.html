			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pinault profit halved but payout held PINAULT, the French industrial group which recently ran into controversy over its bid for Au Printemps department stores, saw its net profits halved to FFr503m (Dollars 90m) in 1991 from FFr1.05bn the year before. The fall was attributed to a cut in exceptional earnings. Last year it made exceptional gains of just FFr129m, compared with FFr913m in 1990 from the sale of two industrial units and a Paris property. Pinault, chaired by Mr Franois Pinault, one of France's more ambitious industrialists, said its performance so far in 1992 had been 'satisfactory' and expressed confidence about full-year prospects. As a result the board proposed to hold the dividend at FFr9.4 a share, despite a fall in earnings per share from FFr48.6 to FFr23.3. Turnover rose by 11.5 per cent from FFr32.57bn to FFr36.3bn and operating profits by 47 per cent from FFr1.58bn to FFr2.32bn. Pinault said one of its priorities was to cut debt. The group has been left with heavy debts of FFr15.5bn after last year's acquisitions in the retail sector, which included the Conforama chain of furniture stores as well as Au Printemps. The bid for Au Printemps, originally a partial bid for two thirds of the shares, hit the headlines when minority shareholders complained about being excluded from the deal. The ensuing row was one of the catalysts for the French government's on-going reform of takeover legislation.</p>

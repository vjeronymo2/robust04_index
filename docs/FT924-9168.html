			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Special situations enliven mixed day's trade ANY significant movements were restricted to special situations yesterday as most bourses closed mixed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was lifted by short-covering, and an earnings upgrade for the steel and engineering group, Preussag. The DAX index ended 8.24 higher at 1,480.93 as turnover rose from DM3.6bn to DM4.2bn. Deutsche Bank Research said that after Wednesday's analysts' meeting at Preussag, it had revised its EPS forecast from DM27.50 to DM31 a share for 1991/92 and from DM25 to DM27.50 for 1992/93. This followed an earlier, downward revision by the broker three or four weeks ago. Preussag jumped DM9.50 to DM324.00 for a cumulative gain of DM20.50 this week. The group has reduced its dependence on steel and engineering with other divisions, particularly in telecommunications, which have been doing considerably better than some people expected. Mannesmann rose DM4 to DM204.80, and hit DM206 after hours in London on an unlikely story that British Telecom might take it over. Analysts pooh-poohed the story. PARIS moved in a fairly narrow range after the rise earlier in the week took the CAC-40 index above the 1,800 level. The CAC-40 index ended little changed at 1,804.70, up 0.63. Turnover stood at FFr2.37bn, of which FFr1.7bn was generated by CAC-40 stocks. Rhone-Poulenc CIs rose FFr25 or 5 per cent to FFr527 on bargain-hunting after their recent fall, linked to the fall in shares in its unit, Institut Merieux International. There were also rumours that the non-voting CIs were being supported by state-controlled institutions to enable the French government to price its planned partial privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc at FFr535-FFr540 for each new voting share. Carrefour rose FFr15 to FFr2,410 in reasonable volume of 31,090 shares following a positive meeting with some analysts. MILAN ended lower as operators started to close their positions ahead of the close of the account next week. The Comit index fell 9.09 to 429.49 as turnover continued to drop back after the recent high levels. Turnover yesterday was estimated at around Wednesday's L186bn. In its latest market report, Kleinwort Benson recommends selling into strength since it believes that the market's performance in the last month has more than discounted the recent fall in interest rates and the recently acquired government credibility. It adds that fundamentals remain negative. Fiat slipped L107 to L4,441. After the close, car industry data showed that Fiat's share of the domestic market fell to 43.8 per cent in October, down from 46.2 per cent in October 1991. BRUSSELS saw the food retailer, Delhaize, fall BFr120 or 7 per cent to BFr1,585 in heavy volume of 152,900 shares. Dealers blamed the drop on a fall in the shares of its US unit, Food Lion, ahead of the showing of an unflattering film, shot secretly at Food Lion, on the ABC television channel yesterday evening. Delhaize was also hit by news that unions in Belgium might stage strikes in December in support of non-unionised Food Lion employees. The Bel-20 index dropped 9.77 to 1,146.15. AMSTERDAM closed mixed as more gloomy corporate news hit the market. The CBS Tendency index closed at 102.6, up 0.3. Philips dropped Fl 1.70 or 8.9 per cent to Fl 17.40 after announcing a third-quarter loss of Fl 154m, following the release of its third-quarter earnings. Its music and video recording subsidiary PolyGram shed 50 cents to Fl 44.70. KLM picked up 40 cents to Fl 22.50 after it announced a 12 per cent net profit decline in its fiscal second quarter to Fl 170.1m. Akzo added another Fl 2.10 to Fl 133.70 in the wake of its better-than-expected third-quarter results announced earlier in the week. ZURICH extended its rally to a fifth day as the higher dollar encouraged domestic and foreign investors. In spite of profit-taking, the SMI index ended another 10.0 higher at 1,951.5. OSLO inched up 0.19 to 346.29, flattened by lower oil prices although the stronger dollar lifted the shipping index by 5.30 to 317.68, and the state-backed rescue for Elkem, the troubled metals group, left the latter's A shares NKr3.50 higher at NKr17.50.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- November 5                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00     12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1036.42    1036.89    1037.31   1038.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1105.81  1107.71   1105.46  1108.03  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00     Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1039.78    1039.90    1038.73   1038.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1108.84    1109.91    1110.18   1109.13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov 4     Nov 3     Nov 2    Oct 30    Oct 29  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1037.06   1038.76   1032.82   1028.47   1025.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1105.82   1105.49   1095.06   1090.07   1086.76  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1041.76; 200 - 1111.88 Low/day: 100 - 1035.99 200 - 1103.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Russia may  cooperate in nuclear waste research and disposal, a Taiwan power  company (Taipower) spokesman said Saturday [21 May].    Taipower may commission Russia to dispose of high-level  radioactive waste, the spokesman said.    Taipower Chairman Chang Chung-chien visited Moscow earlier  this week at the invitation of the Russian Academy of Science to  inspect its nuclear energy research facilities.    Chang has reached consensus with Russian academy officials  on  cooperation in high-level nuclear waste research and treatment,  the spokesman said.    "The two sides may sign a letter of intent in the near  future  confirming their willingness to cooperate in nuclear waste  disposal," the spokesman said.    In addition to waste treatment, the two sides may [words  indistinct] operation to the study of radioactive substances and  technology for high-level nuclear waste disposal.    The Russian academy is expected to draft a definitive  framework for bilateral cooperation in these fields in the near  future, the spokesman noted.    To test Russia's treatment technology and determine  transport  routes, Taipower may first send a batch of medium-level nuclear  waste to Russia for disposal, the spokesman said.    "We'll make sure that the cooperative project is carried out  without violating any international regulations or causing  unnecessary environmental disputes," he added.    Chang left Moscow Friday for Norway where he will attend an  international energy resources development seminar.</p>

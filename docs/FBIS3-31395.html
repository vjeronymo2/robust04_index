"The period of transition calls for a greater efficiency of  executive power and simultaneously, for a greater efficiency of  legislative power. However, the latter should deal with laws  and not with efforts to create a majority. The president  proposes a prime minister and a government but this does not  necessarily has [as received] to be a majority government or a  government representing some party. The president proposes  concrete persons," Walesa told PAP reporters.    When asked whether the system he proposes would not lead to  excessive concentration of power, the president replied that  "one can always criticize and have elections every six months  instead of doing work." He upheld his opinion expressed after  the September 1993 elections that the present parliament will  not function long.    Walesa rejected the possibility of running in the future  presidential elections as a candidate of the Polish right wing.  He announced that he will decide during the next three or four  months whether he will take part in the elections as a leader of  a presidential bloc.</p>

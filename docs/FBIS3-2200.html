It is the second of its kind after a link was established  between the sse and the securities trading center in east  China's Fujian Province.    With it, all buying and selling orders can be transmitted on  computers. Brokers at both places can trade securities listed  on these two stock markets and can receive quotations and  settled accounts issued by them, and investors' accounts are in  common use in the two cities.    Since a successful trial of the network in January, over  90,000 citizens in Shenyang have been encouraged to open new  accounts within the past two months.    The network will offer more opportunities for members of the  SSE from different parts of the region to enter the Shenyang  market.</p>

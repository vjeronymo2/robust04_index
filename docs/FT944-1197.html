			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: PowerGen buy-back to ease stake sale plans Confirmation yesterday that PowerGen intends to buy back 8 per cent of its shares should ease the way for the government's planned disposal of its stake in the power generators next year. The news, expected after a similar announcement by National Power last month, should make the shares more attractive to investors by enhancing earnings per share. Another feature of the deals - announced last week - should also increase the prospects of success by increasing competition among banks appointed to distribute the stock. The structure of the distribution syndicate is both smaller - only 17 banks are involved - and less hierarchical than that deployed so far in international equity issues. This 'will ensure the most effective distribution for both international offers, promoting healthy competition between managers,' said a spokesman for BZW and Kleinwort Benson, the joint global co-ordinators and bookrunners. Alongside these two banks, four international managers - Cazenove, Paribas, UBS and S. G. Warburg - have been named to run the offering in the UK. Five banks - Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, NatWest Markets and RSC Dominion - will manage the sale in North America, while six other banks  -Argentaria, Mediobanca, Flemings, Lehman Brothers, Nikko and WestLB - will manage the sale in the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Modest rise in Indian exports India's exports, which fell in December and January due to the disruption caused by inter-religious riots, rose in February as businessmen sought to regain lost ground, according to figures announced yesterday, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi. However, the recovery was only moderate in scale, indicating that much of the export revenue lost in the previous two months has been lost for good, as foreign buyers found alternative sources of supply. Exports in February rose 8.1 per cent to Dollars 1.78bn (Pounds 1.2bn) compared with the same month last year. Imports fell slightly to Dollars 1.69bn.</p>

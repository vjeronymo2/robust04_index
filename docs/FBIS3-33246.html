According to police, the clandestine groups of Medellin's  outskirts, linked to the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board  [CNG], claimed responsibility for the attacks because they  regard the peace negotiations between the government and a  similar group, the People's Militia, as "treason."    Carlos Gottberg Riveros, Venezuelan consul to Medellin, said  that although he does not know the reason for the attack, "it  could have something to do with the subversives' interest in  creating confusion in the city. My first impression is one of  surprise because we live in a friendly country. Many Colombians  live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans live in  Colombia in stability and respect."    The bomb attacks only caused damage, estimated at some  $30,000. The worst damage was sustained by the Venezuelan  consulate, located in the Manrique-Rosales neighborhood, in the  western part of Medellin.    The Bolivarian Militia of Medellin believe the negotiations  between the Colombian Government and the People's Militia "are  an unconditional surrender."    The attacks perpetrated in Medellin are part of a wave of  CNG  attacks throughout the country, including the kidnapping of two  parliamentarians and one mayor as well as clashes with policemen  and soldiers in the outskirts of Santa Fe de Bogota.</p>

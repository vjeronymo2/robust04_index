			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Plastics fall dents UCB profits THE DOWNTURN in the plastics sector and the aftermath of European currency turmoil held back first half profits at UCB, the Belgian chemicals company. The group's pre-tax profits fell from BFr1.49bn (Dollars 42.49m) in the first half of last year, to BFr1.07bn. However, an exceptional gain of BFr988m, due mainly to profit on the sale of the group's Belgian chemicals subsidiary Vel, helped increase after tax profits to BFr1.75bn from BFr1.57bn. The company said exceptional gains would help it to match 1992's record net profit of BFr2.25bn, but pre-tax earnings for the year would be lower than in 1992. Mr Georges Jacobs, UCB chief executive, said devaluation of a number of European currencies had hit the group's sales, which slipped to BFr23.4bn from BFr24.6bn in the first half. He estimated that the effects of the currency turmoil might have reduced interim profits by some BFr100m. Mr Jacobs also held out the hope that Zyrtec, UCB's successful anti-allergy drug, would win approval from the Food &amp; Drug Administration for marketing in the US before the end of this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Binyamin Begin: "Talking With Hamas"] </F>   [Text] Shim'on Peres has been treading a tortuous road from  the "malodorous maneuver" of Jerusalem 1990 to the malodorous  maneuvers of Oslo 1993 and Davos 1994. Two weeks ago he proudly  recounted how he overcame disagreements with 'Arafat in Davos.  "You were once a terrorist," Mr. Peres told Mr. 'Arafat, "but  today you are an ex-terrorist." The exterminator of vermin  sprinkled some holy water on "the chairman," and peace descended  on Israel.    So much for sycophancy and its wages. In an interview with  THE NEW YORK TIMES last week, 'Arafat accused Israel of  conducting an "evil plan" by giving out weapons to Arabs in the  Gaza District in a bid to bring about a civil war.  "Procrastination in the negotiations will lead to anarchy," the  bearded righteous man warned, thus rewarding Peres' holy water  with a shower of spittle. The PLO leader is preparing himself an  irrefutable alibi. He says that even after he is given control  of Gaza and Jericho (first) terror will continue from there  ("anarchy"), and he preemptively holds Israel responsible  because it is "giving out" weapons. This ignoble murderer is  being defended by the Israeli Government, and cabinet ministers  say he should not be defeated too often.    This is not a new excuse. "If we do not talk with the PLO,  we will have to talk with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]."  On the eve of Purim, the following verse from the Book of  Esther can aptly be applied to the issue of terror: "Before  whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will  not prevail against him but will surely fall before him." The  moment one begins giving in to terror one will go on  capitulating to it, and whoever decided to talk to the PLO is  actually conducting a dialogue with Hamas.    Pieces of evidence accumulated recently show that the  Israeli  Government is giving in to the demands of Hamas via the PLO.  Two weeks ago in Cairo the foreign minister signed an Israeli  undertaking to grant amnesty to terrorists, and Nabil Sha'th  hastened to explain that the PLO cannot let Hamas members, "the  enemies of peace," rot in prison. Of course, all of them will  be released within months so as to uphold 'Arafat's status.    At the PLO's demand, the prime minister promised two weeks  ago in the Cairo agreement not to arrest Hamas murderers who  stand to be released from jail at the border crossings "only" on  the basis of suspicions that they are planning terror attacks.  They will cross the Allenby Bridge with their amnesty papers so  as to uphold 'Arafat's status. At the PLO's demand, it was  decided in the Cairo talks that membership in Hamas alone will  not be sufficient grounds for an Israeli demand to question (or  even interrogate) a person wishing to enter Gaza and Jericho  from either Egypt or Jordan. Hamas members will freely roam  through the border terminals so as to uphold 'Arafat's status.  In a meeting with high school students last week, the chief of  staff asserted that the murders committed by Hamas serve the  PLO's objectives well and complement them.    The prime minister does not have a plan. He gets dragged  after events, trudges to meetings with "the chairman," suggests  that he sweat it out, makes his foreign minister sweat it out,  and signs -- after perfunctory cringing -- the documents  presented to him by his notoriously tireless adversary. In yet  another of his well-known witticisms, Mr. Rabin announced last  week that it is his job to say "no" to the striking university  lecturers, just as it is his job to say "no" to the PLO.  However, in recent months he has been neglecting the latter "so  as to uphold 'Arafat's status."    After the signing of the Oslo agreement, the prime minister  warned 'Arafat not to use the title "president of Palestine,"  and last week he declared that any attempt by the PLO to run its  affairs from Jerusalem would be a gross violation of the  agreement. It did not take long for 'Arafat to retaliate. He  published an advertisement in the East Jerusalem paper AL-NAHAR  in which he announced the opening of the Palestinian Center for  Statistics in...Jerusalem, and signed it with his three titles:  "Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, chairman  of the PLO Executive Committee, and chairman of the National  Palestinian Authority Council."    Mr. Rabin has kept mum so as to uphold the status of his  friend Yasir, in light of the pressures by Hamas.    The Israeli Government's policy has had a simple and  destructive result: The PLO has become a lever with which Hamas  is pushing Rabin's government to make concessions with regard to  the rights of the Jews in their land and the minimal demands for  their security. What follows is ceding the chances of peace.</p>

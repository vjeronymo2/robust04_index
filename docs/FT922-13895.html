			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Deutsche Bank declares Heron issue in default DEUTSCHE Bank yesterday declared Heron International Finance in default on a DM100m bond issue, AP-DJ reports from London. Heron said the Deutsche Bank move was in line with action on Tuesday by Credit Suisse to formally declare four SFr150m bonds issued by the company's finance-raising arm in default. Both banks lead the respective bond issues. The default declarations also follow Heron's technical default on March 27 when it notified creditors it was suspending debt payments pending a restructuring of its Pounds 1.3bn in debts. Heron, among Britain's largest private companies, is controlled by foundations established by Mr Gerald Ronson, the UK entrepreneur. It has asked creditor banks to extend payments over seven years while it moves to sell off investment properties. The company, which took heavy losses on US investments, has not disclosed what portion of its debt it intends to restructure. However, it confirmed that the restructuring includes the Pounds 450m in bonds it issued in Swiss and French francs, D-Marks, and Ecus. Swiss Bank Corporation (Luxembourg) is issuing up to 20,000 protected equity participation units on registered shares in Sandoz, lead manager SBC Zurich said.</p>

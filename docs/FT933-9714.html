			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: It always takes two to blaspheme BLASPHEMY by David Lawton Harvester Wheatsheaf, 242 pages IF I impugn your God or gods, in your view I blaspheme. So if an alien comes to a Christian country and tells its devout citizens that their belief in virgin birth, miracles, resurrection and so forth, is codswallop, and that they should instead bow down before the horned toad as the true incarnation of deity, that alien would be branded a blasphemer. The alien, of course, would retort the charge on his accusers' heads. And so it would go on, until either he or they were reduced to cinders at some convenient stake. David Lawton begins his study of blasphemy with the claim, surely right, that it is not possible to give a straightforward definition of blasphemy. Blasphemy comes into existence when something that someone says or writes gives a special kind of offence to someone else, the offence typically consisting in a perceived insult to something cherished as divine. But it depends on cases; and it always takes two - a giver and a receiver of offence - to make blasphemy possible. It was the Rushdie fatwa which prompted Lawton to write this book, but although he devotes a chapter to that tragic affair it is not his main topic. Rather, he offers a history of the concept of blasphemy in the Western world, aiming to illuminate its complexity so that we can better understand the painful conflicts it generates. And he also addresses the practical question whether our own blasphemy laws should be extended to cover other religions, or abolished altogether. We gain insights into the concept of blasphemy by looking at examples of its application. Lawton lavishly supplies us with fascinating and entertaining case histories, three of them given at length in the opening chapter. One concerns Susannah Fowles, a 17th-century woman fined and pilloried because, as anonymous accusers alleged, she 'blasphemed Jesus Christ and cursed the Lord's Prayer'. To us she seems merely a frightened girl harassed by stupid people. Another case concerns the poet Charles Sedley, who drunkenly stripped naked and preached a blasphemous anti-sermon from an ale-house balcony. He was fined Pounds 500, a vast sum for 1663. The third is the story of the Italian miller Menocchio, brilliantly told in Carlo Ginzburg's classic The Cheese and the Worms and repeated here by Lawton. Menocchio perished at the stake in 1600 for denying the virginity of Mary and the divinity of Jesus. Menocchio had his own theology, which Ginzburg painstakingly reconstructs; but because it was not the theology of the Inquisition, Menocchio burned. These cases show, Lawton argues, that blasphemy 'exists as an interchange'. It is the product of a conflict between perceptions. On this basis he explores the diffusion of thought about blasphemy in early, medieval and Reformation Christianity to see how the concept developed, citing a wealth of further cases in illustration. In the second half of the book Lawton turns to recent concerns. On the legal question he concludes, in my view rightly, that blasphemy laws should be abolished. From the examples he cites it emerges clearly that these laws, like those relating to obscenity and censorship, are simply instruments for controlling ideas. He therefore argues against them, asserting that blasphemy is 'healthy' because it is a sign of free speech and because it demonstrates the maturing of an intellectual community from one level of belief and practice to another. It would be a mistake, Lawton warns us, to think that controversies over blasphemy are on the whole dying out. It is a Freudian idea that religion, like perversion, is a precultural phenomenon, belonging to the infancy of mankind. But although Freud opposed religion as a sinister force that must be defeated - Lawton characterises Freud as a 'master blasphemer' in this sense - the threat of conflict always lurks. And this indeed is shown in what Lawton describes as a rehearsal for the Gulf War: the Rushdie affair, representing the very clash of perceptions and responses from which blasphemy controversies arise. Blasphemy is a destructive idea, a dangerous, subjective catch-all used by superstitiously besotted people to deny others their liberty of thought. The world would be a better place if the notion were purged from it. Given the richness and value of the case studies and the strong arguments Lawton offers, his book should be required reading, although it is a pity that it is written in literary-critical jargon of a kind to set one's teeth on edge.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / EC and E Europe progress EC foreign ministers yesterday reached broad agreement on measures to accelerate the political and economic integration into the EC of six former communist countries in Eastern Europe. The package includes faster than expected dismantling of tariff barriers in footwear, steel, textiles, cars and other industrial goods. It also holds out the prospect of future EC membership, without offering a firm date. The new measures cover Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, all of whom have association agreements with the EC. These agreements offer preferential trade treatment. A free-trade axis built around the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and, surprisingly, Spain pushed through the package which represents a big political success for EC commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans van den Broek.</p>

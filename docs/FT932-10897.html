			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Denmark's slaughtermen to end strike A RETURN to work by 16,000 Danish slaughterhouse workers is expected on Monday following a strike over wages and working conditions that began on April 26. A compromise agreement was reached yesterday between the Food Workers' Union and the employers. But before it comes into force it must be approved by a ballot of union members over the next few days. The stoppage, which halted meat and bacon exports, was the first in the Danish abattoir industry for ten years. It began after collective wage negotiations broke down and the union rejected an arbitration proposal.</p>

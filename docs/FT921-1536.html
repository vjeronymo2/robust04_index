			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: Pro and con the shadow budget Sir, Lex identifies a gaping hole in the Labour party's shadow budget ('Labour turns on the charm', March 17), but even Lex may have underestimated its size. Mr John Smith has indicated that he would work within the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) target set by the chancellor for fiscal 1992-93. That target depends heavily on continuing receipts of Pounds 8bn from privatisations. But the issue is not simply one of tracking down the difference between this figure and the Pounds 6bn of identifiable privatisation receipts; it is one of judging the market's willingness to finance any further privatisations under a Labour government and therefore of judging on what terms such issues might take place. It is no coincidence that it has taken a general election campaign to concentrate the minds of messrs Kinnock and Smith on the virtues of accepting ongoing privatisation. Other members of the shadow cabinet, however, do not appear to have synchronised their conversion to the new doctrine. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, still appears to believe that the water companies will come back into public ownership under a Labour government. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, believes Labour would take control of the power generators. And Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, is threatening to reverse the recent buy-outs of port authorities. This is yet another example of Labour, under electoral pressure, being prepared to play fast and loose - in this case with the savings of millions of investors.

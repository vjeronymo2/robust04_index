			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Many restrictions on dealers must cease THE commission finds that the selective and exclusive distribution system operated by car suppliers constitutes a complex monopoly in favour of the 24 main suppliers in the market for new cars. It recommends removal of restrictions on franchised dealers which: Limit a dealership's freedom to advertise outside its territory. Limit a dealership's freedom to hold or acquire dealerships outside that territory from other suppliers. Prevent a dealership holding or acquiring competing dealerships within its territory, although the supplier may require that any other dealership acquired must be on a distinct and separate site and a reasonable distance from the acquiring dealership. Restrict the extent to which a dealership can sell car-related goods or services, such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand servicing outside its territory. Limit the total number of the supplier's cars that any dealer or dealer group may sell during any given period, or the proportion of the total sales of its cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group. The selective and exclusive distribution arrangements 'restrict the dealers' independence and freedom of action, and some of the restrictions have adverse effects on competition and prices,' the commission says. It accepts, however, the car industry's argument that the system provides 'consumers with after-sales repair and service facilities that they can be confident are backed by the car suppliers' and it says the system also encourages inter-brand competition.</p>

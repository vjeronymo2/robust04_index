			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- A Persian daily Tuesday  wrote that King Fahd's message to the hajj pilgrims on Sunday  was contrary to the reasonable expectations of the world of  Islam. The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that in fact  the Saudi ruler was expected to invite people to close ranks,  urge Muslims to properly employ their potentials to counter  enemies of Islam and, avoid discord.    On the contrary, in his message King Fahd called on the U.S.  President Bill Clinton to take further steps towards peace with  the Zionist regime and voiced his country's readiness to  cooperate with the U.S. Administration, Arab states and  international bodies interested in the American-sponsored peace  in the region.    The Saudi ruler's message further proves the authenticity of  the reports that the Zionist regime had threatened the Saudi  Government it would be deprived of attending the Arab-Israel  talks if `disavowal of unbelievers' rally were held in Mecca.    King Fahd's message indicates to the fact that he wanted the  Zionist regime and the U.S. keep their promise and enter Saudi  Arabia into the dangerous game on the fate of the Muslim  Palestinian nation, said the article.    Fahd had called for the handing over of the three Iranian  islands to the United Arab Emirates and claimed that the  (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council would support Abu Dhabi in  Iran-UAE dispute.    Elsewhere in his message, the article noted, Fahd tried to  inculcate the idea that there were some disputes among Persian  Gulf states with the aim to make hajj pilgrims believe that  regional countries and nations are not able to reach  understanding and therefore need some guardians.    Turning to the role that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher has played in the region, the editorial said that he  would count on lackey governments to help the U.S. come out of  the Middle East quagmire. Through preventing the `disavowal of  unbelievers' rally, finalizing Gaza-Jericho accord and, creating  a state of terror in Lebanon and occupied Palestine, Warren  Christopher and his agents try to pretend that the Zionist  regime hold the upper hand in the region, it said. By sowing  discord among regional countries, the U.S. intends to prepare  the ground for the emergence of a new source of tension in the  region, said the editorial.    The article regretted the fact that the lackey Arab front  has  rendered great assistance to materialization of Christopher's  conspiracies, adding that King Fahd's message is the latest in  the chain.</p>

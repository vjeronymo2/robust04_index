			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Mikhail </F> Kalmykov]    [Text] Ashgabat 29 April TASS -- French President Francois  Mitterrand said he believes there is an undoubted link between  the 50th anniversary of the landing of the allies in Normandy  and France's recent initiative to conclude a pact on European  stability. Mitterrand said this in answer to a question from  ITAR-TASS upon the conclusion of his two-day state visit to  Turkmenistan. Mitterrand noted that he had participated in the  war and in the events of 50 years ago.    "In a certain sense those events inspired us to form a  structure which we now describe as the European Union.  Countries that were at war twice within one century have  arrived at the conclusion that they should base their future on  accord and durable union, even if with former adversaries. The  creators of post-war Europe scored success." Mitterrand noted  that he now tries to continue their undertaking.    In the past, the balance of forces in the world was based on  the existence of two opposing blocs, Mitterrand noted. The cold  war that was in progress could have turned into a full-scale war  any time. After the Soviet Union's dissolution, the military  bloc opposing NATO disintegrated too. Many countries that were  in that bloc and some former Union republics turned out to be  "unprotected" to a certain degree. Europe is not a large  continent and it is inhabited by many peoples. World history of  many centuries is full of the clashes of their interests. What  can be a guarantee against this in future? New states try to  achieve real independence and ensure their security.    "There exists the CSCE mechanism," Mitterrand said. "It  expands beyond Europe and is based on a good idea. Remarkable  documents have been signed. Still this is a cumbersome,  intricate organisation with slow decision-making. Hence, it  does not offer enough opportunities to avert new wars, cannot  take multistage measures to prevent conflicts," Mitterrand said.  The French president believes "CSCE is not flexible enough and  not prompt enough in decision-making as this process requires a  consensus. But can there be accord between countries that are  ready to fight one another? The conflict in former Yugoslavia  shows that such an accord is impossible."    "This is why the French Government, Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, in coordination with the president proposed a draft  treaty described as a pact of stability. Its purpose is to  avert possible conflicts. The pact must be open to all European  countries and must become a pact of universal security under  which no one will have advantages.    The head of the French Government assessed the initiative of  Paris as one of the most important intitiatives in security area  in the past five years.</p>

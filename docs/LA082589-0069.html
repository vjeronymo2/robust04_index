			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ATHLETE SAYS CANADIANS KNEW OF DRUG USE  </P> <P> Steve Findlay, the athletes' representative for the Canadian Track and Field  Assn. admitted Thursday at the Canadian Government's inquiry into drug use  among athletes that he had evidence of steroid use by some of Canada's top  athletes eight months before the Seoul Olympics. He said Wilf Wedmann,  association president, refused to act.  </P> <P> Wedmann, who testified briefly before the inquiry adjourned for the day, will  have a chance to answer the allegation Friday.  </P> <P> Findlay told the inquiry his evidence was based on a January, 1988, meeting  with Canadian decathlete Dave Steen.  </P> <P> Findlay said Steen told him that Dr. Jamie Astaphan had offered him steroids in  late 1987, confirming earlier testimony by Steen. Steen also told him Astaphan  had been injecting sprinter Angela Issajenko with steroids to improve her  performance after a poor showing at the national track competition in Ottawa in  January of 1988. Astaphan has admitted he injected Issajenko, Ben Johnson and  other athletes training with Coach Charlie Francis.  </P> <P> Findlay said he did not pursue the matter with Paul Dupre, who replaced Wedmann  as president in May of 1988.  </P></p>

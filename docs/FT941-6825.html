			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Accountancy Debate about the liability of accountants for the errors of their ways seems to be hotting up again. Claims against accountancy firms are rising, yet the alarm felt by the profession may not play to a wider audience. Indeed, rather the reverse. Ever since the Law Lords handed largesse to the accountants by deciding that auditors were not accountable to individual shareholders, a backlash has been in prospect. A nebulous duty to shareholders as a group is all but useless, since they cannot sue collectively. Shareholders want a better grip on auditors. The profession's case is not helped by the fact that poor audits and negligence have been widespread. Large firms have driven for market share in audits in the hope that they can gain clients for other services. That competition has put pressure on audit fees. In some cases audits have become loss-leaders, and the temptation has been to maintain margins by using inexpensive trainees. Mistakes have become more likely. The contention that one of the big partnerships may be broken by these rising claims is impossible to test, since none reveal their financial position in any detail. Accountants may want to cap their liabilities or restrict them to the elements for which they are directly responsible. For that the very least they will have to cede is a concrete duty to shareholders and greater openness about their financial affairs.</p>

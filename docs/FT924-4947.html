			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Aid workers in Somalia fear US show of force UNITED Nations officials considering new relief measures for Somalia have been warned that large-scale US intervention could jeopardise aid workers in the country. Aid organisations battling against Somalia's famine have prepared evacuation plans, fearing reports that large-scale US military intervention will make foreign staff targets of Somali gunmen seeking hostages. Virtually all relief organisations have said they would pull out of Somalia while troop deployment took place to avoid the risk of being attacked by racketeers, who are angry at losing their grip on the 'aid business'. The White House confirmed on Friday that the US administration had concluded that 'some form of military activity' involving US troops was the only way to assure the security of relief supplies to Somalia. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the spokesman, said in Maine, where President George Bush is on vacation, that it was premature to speculate on troop deployments at this stage. Critical decisions have first to be reached in the United Nations Security Council, which has been holding meetings to discuss a Somali operation. Somalia's two main warlords have cautiously welcomed reports of the US offer to help the UN protect food convoys and ensure aid reaches the needy. However aid workers with long experience of Somalia are sure armed gangs, only loosely controlled by warlords, would attack UN troops. Washington is aware of the relief agencies' concerns that their staff in Somalia may be placed at greater risk by even the talk of outside military intervention. However, it has concluded that the alternative would be to invite even greater criticism that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe. There has been a fundamental shift in the Defence Department's previously firmly held view that Somalia was unpropitious territory for the engagement of US forces. At a National Security Council meeting last Wednesday, neither Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, nor Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, raised objections to the State Department proposal that as many as 30,000 US troops be offered to a UN force. However this force is composed, the US military still wants to ensure that its contingent remains under US command. This reflects its new belief that looters controlled by various Somali warlords do not pose a serious military threat. Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, briefed President-elect Bill Clinton last week on the new US approach and reported that Mr Clinton fully supported greater US engagement. Mr Larry Eagleburger, acting secretary of state, has been in touch with governments in Europe and in the region, to drum up support for intervention. The case for this has grown stronger with the presentation of evidence that as much as 70 per cent of the international relief supplies reaching Somalia have been purloined and redirected to the broader African black market in food.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Behind the scenes disputes in the Labour Party A GLIMPSE of the behind-the-scenes disputes in Mr Neil Kinnock's shadow cabinet emerged last night as the three candidates for Labour's deputy leadership debated the party's future, Ivo Dawnay writes. Mrs Beckett, Mr Gould and Mr Prescott all admitted that they had expressed serious reservations over the leadership's unwillingness to adopt sharp cuts in defence expenditure. In the three-way debate organised by the Fabian Society, they disagreed over how the leadership had responded to the UK's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism and the longer-term goal of monetary union.</p>

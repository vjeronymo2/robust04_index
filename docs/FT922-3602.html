			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Staff relocation pledge THE continuing depression in the housing market has contributed to a Treasury decision enabling departments to make more generous arrangements for civil servants forced to relocate and facing losses if they sell their homes. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, said yesterday that the government is to make provision for staff who find that the sale of their previous property is not enough to repay their mortgage. Departments will be able to offer people in this category loans on commercial terms and, in particularly difficult cases, offer advances of salary to meet mortgage shortfalls. The decision comes just a week after Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced that 2,000 officials in his department were to move to Docklands, but is primarily directed at the relocation of civil servants out of the south-east. When the Docklands plan was announced more than 1,000 DoE civil servants held an angry meeting in protest. The meeting, which was organised by four Civil Service unions, heard calls for industrial action to stop the move. London and the south-east have been among the areas where property prices have been particularly affected by the slump over the past two years or so. About 3,000 staff from the Ministry of Defence are planned to move to Bristol, more than 1,000 Inland Revenue staff are to go to Nottingham, while part of the Home Office is moving to Derby and part of the Department of Health is moving to Leeds. The new arrangements will not necessarily mean more money is available, but will give departments greater flexibility.</p>

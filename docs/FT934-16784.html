			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Growth in national skills training EMPLOYERS' awareness of vocational qualifications has risen significantly over the past few years, although only a third of employers are offering these work-based qualifications, a survey funded by the Department of Employment has found, Lisa Wood writes. Skill Needs in Britain is the fourth in an annual series examining recruitment difficulties and other skills and training issues among companies that employ more than 25 people. The first National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) were introduced in mid-1987 but they have been slow to arrive in the workplace. Employers have often complained about their cost and quality. The survey showed that 74 per cent of employers knew about NVQs, compared with 63 per cent in 1992. Only 33 per cent of employers said they offered them to employees. Four out of five of these employers were satisfied with the qualifications on offer. The main reason for not offering NVQs was a lack of detailed knowledge of what they involved.

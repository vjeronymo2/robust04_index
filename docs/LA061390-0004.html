			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS PROPOSE GERMAN LINK TO BOTH EAST, WEST  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, trying to assure the Soviet Union's security in  a Europe that he sees likely to be dominated by Germany once it is reunified,  proposed Tuesday that the new German state become an associate member of both  NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said that such a dual status could be the first step toward ending  the Cold War division of Europe into rival military blocs and the formation of  a new all-European security system.  </P> <P> Although Western diplomats saw new flexibility in the Soviet position,  Gorbachev's proposal was quickly rejected by President Bush in Washington and  West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.  </P> <P> "This is not a proposal we consider realistic," Kohl declared. "We reject it."  </P> <P> Bush, who had discussed the suggestion with Gorbachev during their summit  meeting in Washington this month, told reporters, "Our position is well-known  to him -- a unified Germany should be in NATO with no conditions."  </P> <P> But Gorbachev, reporting on his talks with Bush to the Supreme Soviet, the  country's legislature, was more thinking aloud and attempting to bring forth  new ideas from the West than outlining a hard-and-fast Kremlin position.  </P> <P> "As a hypothesis, I could suggest some form of associated membership of the new  Germany in the two alliances, at least while they still exist," he said. "Such  dual membership could become a new form of unifying element, a kind of  forerunner of new European (security) structures."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, suggesting that the two alliances transform themselves into  political groupings, said changes in North Atlantic Treaty Organization  military doctrine would ease Soviet concerns about German membership in the  Western alliance. "Within such a framework, a new solution could be found for  ensuring security for a united Germany," he said.  </P> <P> Setting out yet another idea, Gorbachev proposed a transition during which the  present West German army would remain under the NATO command, the East German  army would be under the new German government and Soviet and U.S. troops would  remain there to ensure stability.  </P> <P> Later in his speech, Gorbachev said he had told Bush that the Soviet Union  "could agree to a united Germany's NATO membership if the United States  accepted the idea of associate membership and the principle of the convergence  of (military) blocs in combination with the German reunification process,"  apparently dropping the condition of membership in the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> International talks on the military status of the future German state enter a  crucial phase in 10 days, when the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the  Soviet Union and the United States, the victorious Allied powers of World War  II, meet in Berlin with their counterparts from East and West Germany.  </P> <P> "We are not yet there, but there is a lot of movement," a Western ambassador  said, appraising Gorbachev's speech. "The important thing is not to look at  each idea, each proposal, each 'hypothesis,' if you will, but at the direction,  the trend, the underlying shifts.  </P> <P> "Saying that Germany could be a member of NATO under certain conditions is a  long journey from insisting that it be neutral."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, after accepting the idea of German reunification after years  of opposition, had originally proposed neutrality for a unified Germany and,  when that was rejected, put forward a series of other ideas, including full  membership in both alliances, a new security grouping for Europe to replace  NATO and the Warsaw Pact -- and even Soviet membership in NATO.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's lengthy discussion of German reunification Tuesday reflected the  great sensitivity the question has for the Soviet Union, which lost about 27  million people in World War II, as well as Moscow's search for a new balance of  power in Europe after the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> "I told President Bush that, instead of developing a fixation on the membership  of a unified Germany in NATO, would it not be much better to think about how to  bring closer to each other the alliances that still divide Europe?" Gorbachev  said.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev, reminding the West of Soviet sensitivity on German  reunification, also warned that, unless Moscow is satisfied that its security  is assured, it will rethink its entire foreign policy if the West forces the  issue of German membership in NATO.  </P> <P> "If we develop the feeling that our interests are being neglected in the  process of German reunification, then developments in Europe will be seriously  jeopardized," he said. "This is not a bluff. We would be forced by the  fundamental interests of our people to pause and take a close look at the  situation. Needless to say, we would not like to do this."  </P> <P> West German government officials in Bonn saw Gorbachev's proposal as a sign  that Moscow is still searching for a clear position on the issue.  </P> <P> "We're looking at six or seven different formulas on the NATO issue from  Gorbachev alone in recent months," commented one official. "If you include  (Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze and others, the number is  larger still. Today's speech only makes it clear there is no fixed idea, but  Gorbachev wants to impress the public that he's working hard on it."  </P> <P> The officials in Bonn interpreted Gorbachev's remarks as being intended mostly  for Soviet domestic consumption.  </P> <P> "We have to give him room to deal with his own public opinion," commented one  official.  </P> <P> In Washington, a senior Bush Administration official echoed that theme: "I  think we very clearly are seeing an evolution in Soviet views . . . as they  deal with the domestic problems that a unified Germany in NATO creates for  them."  </P> <P> The Administration continues to believe that over time, Gorbachev will move  toward acceptance of the U.S. position, the official said. But, he added, the  Soviet president must move slowly to prepare his citizens for the idea.  </P> <P> The German officials said they expect little give on the delicate NATO issue by  Gorbachev before next month's Soviet Communist Party Congress or the NATO  summit scheduled for the following week. That summit is likely to emphasize the  growing political character of the Western alliance, a development that would  make NATO membership for a united Germany easier for Moscow to swallow.  </P> <P> As the Bush Administration official put it, changes will be proposed to NATO  designed "to reassure Gorbachev and the Soviets that NATO is not necessarily  only pointed at them anymore."  </P> <P> Despite the Western recognition of Soviet sensitivities reflected in such  comments, some Kremlin officials are already beginning to express unhappiness  with what they regard as a lack of response from the West.  </P> <P> Oleg Baklanov, the Communist Party secretary in charge of the defense industry,  told the Novosti Press Agency in an interview published Tuesday that the West  is trying to gain unilateral advantages in Europe and tip the balance of power  in its favor.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Tyler Marshall, in West Berlin, and David Lauter, in  Washington, contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front has  put a damper on expectations that he could accept a cabinet  post, saying that his real job is to be with his people and to  find a land area for Afrikaners who choose to be together.  However, Gen. Viljoen said that he would have to discuss the  issue with Mr. Nelson Mandela before deciding finally. Last  night, Mr. Mandela praised Gen. Viljoen, describing him as a  worthy South African who would make a contribution to the  government of national unity. It was later rumored that he  could even be appointed Minister of Defense. Projections for the  National Assembly at this stage show the Freedom Front taking 13  seats, seven short of the 20 required for a cabinet post.</p>

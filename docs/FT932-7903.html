			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Banks 'may not meet loan demand' UK BANKS are unlikely to be able to meet any significant increase in demand for loans over the coming few years, IBCA, Europe's leading credit rating agency, warned yesterday, Robert Peston writes. An IBCA report on the seven biggest UK banks warns of a limited form of 'credit crunch' when the UK economy starts to grow, unless banks' profitability exceeds what most have achieved since 1985. The report says banks need to earn annual post-tax profits equal to 12 per cent of equity if they are to make normal dividend payments and increase their assets, mostly loans, by 2 per cent a year after adjusting for inflation. A 2 per cent growth rate would be low by recent historical stan-dards. The seven leading UK banks have earned only a 7 per cent annual return on equity over the past seven years. Only Lloyds and Bank of Scotland have consistently earned more than 12 per cent in the period. UK Banks - The Good News and the Bad. IBCA, 071 247-5761.</p>

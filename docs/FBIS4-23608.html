			<p>BFN     [Text] Heavy fighting broke out once again this morning in  several districts of Kigali. According to UN representatives on  the ground, cease-fire talks are getting nowhere and the airport  remains closed. We spoke yesterday evening of the latest  massacre which had targeted at a group of Tutsi children. Two  clergymen, Fathers Blanchard and Mayer, had taken in hundreds of  people, mostly Tutsis, into their church. On 10 June Hutu  militiamen broke into the church. The UN's Canadian military  spokesman, Major Plante, spoke with Florence Mavic.    [Begin recording] [Plante] Approximately 10 armed men, in  civilian clothes but well armed, entered the church and asked  Father Blanchard and Father Otto Mayer not to intervene,  because, as they said, they had come to evacuate--I repeat,  evacuate--the people who had taken refuge in the church, about  250 in total. One of the armed men then told Father Blanchard:  Father, we are very serious, and we want to prove this to  you--and then he shot into the crowd and a dozen people were  killed on the spot at that moment. At the same time, another of  the armed men threw a tear-gas grenade into the church,  provoking total panic. At this point, more armed men turned up,  with several trucks and they picked up all those in the church,  all those they could find, and they took them away.    [Mavic] Could the blue helmets have intervened?    [Plante] We cannot intervene for the simple reason that it  is  too dangerous, and that we have nowhere near enough men or  equipment to go and help or to evacuate these people. [end  recording]</p>

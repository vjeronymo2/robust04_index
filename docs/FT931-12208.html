			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Call for improved road to pit areas THE government was yesterday urged to build a dual carriageway through the Peak District National Park between Sheffield and Manchester to ease the problems of pit closures in South Yorkshire. The call came from the Yorkshire and Humberside Partnership, which comprises the region's offshoots of the Trades Union Congress and Confederation of British Industry as well as 14 chambers of commerce, Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association and the regional association of local authorities. The partnership wants the present A-road route over the Woodhead pass upgraded to a dual carriageway. Such a fast, all-weather road - dual-carriageways are more easily cleared of snow - would improve access between the coalfield closure areas and Manchester Airport, boosting prospects for inward investment and easing congestion on the trans-Pennine M62. Present direct routes between Sheffield and Manchester are single-carriageway A roads over the Woodhead or Snake passes, both of which are often closed by snow. The cities are less than 40 miles apart but the journey can sometimes take up to two hours at peak periods, making it slightly quicker to travel twice the mileage using the M62 and M1.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an institution is aware that a student has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled or applied for financial assistance after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application date has passed to receive State grant assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that year in that State, it must simply inform the student that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> he or she is not eligible for those funds, and may apply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following year prior to the deadline. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution will then process the student's aid package with no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of State grant funds for that award year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not understand how this requirement could have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse affect on an institution. In fact, it is the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding that many institutions already publish State grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application information in their catalogs or disseminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information through their financial aid offices. Regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students from other States, institutions are indeed required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform them of State grant assistance available to them from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own State; however, the institutions are not expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experts on this information, but rather to be sources of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from which students may learn who to contact in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State to apply for assistance. The Secretary does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement is unduly burdensome on institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large group of commenters was concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring newly participating institutions or institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have changed ownership to implement a default management plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal to Appendix D, for two years, was overly restrictive. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that institutions be allowed to submit an alternate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan to the Secretary for approval. Many of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that in the case of ownership changes, institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with default rates under a certain percentage (10% or 20%) should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be exempt from the requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary's proposal that newly participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions and institutions that have changed ownership use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D as a default management plan was made only after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> careful review by the Department showed that Appendix D is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective in helping reduce student defaults. Moreover, Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D is simply a basic default management plan. There is nothing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute or regulations that would preclude an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from adding elements. In fact, the Secretary applauds such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creative efforts and believes they may help to further reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student defaults. The Secretary believes institutions with low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rates should not be exempted because there is no reason  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to believe under different ownership the rates would remain as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters want to expand the regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include Social Security Administration, Immigration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement Agencies and Direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lending Contractors as parties that are authorized to share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information pertaining to an institution's Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility or participation, or pertaining to fraud and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not have authority to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these organizations in the regulations as they do not appear in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters argued that the provisions in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section governing an institution's ability to employ or contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with individuals or organizations to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs or the receipt of funds under those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs go far beyond the scope of section 487(a)(16) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA. These commenters pointed out that the statute referred only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to individuals or organizations that have been convicted, have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or guilty to a crime, or that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judicially determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program funds and not to administrative determinations, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material violations of law, or misuse of State, local, or Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government funds (other than Title IV, HEA program funds) with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to an institution's ability to employ an individual or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions. Five commenters were concerned that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be penalized for hiring or contracting with a party convicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fraud involving government funds or a party that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated from participation under the HEA for an infraction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving government funds, even if they were unaware of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conviction or termination. One commenter was concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may be penalized if it hired or contracted with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a party, even if that person's job was to cut grass or collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garbage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that the provisions in this section restricting an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's ability to employ or contract with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals or organizations go beyond the authority of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 487(a)(4) expressly requires an institution to agree in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its program participation agreement to comply with financial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal responsibility requirements established by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These requirements are part of the financial responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions found in &sect;668.15(c). In proposing the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions in the NPRM, the Secretary provided justification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these additional safeguards were necessary to protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs and institutions participating in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The Secretary still believes those justifications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be valid. The regulations state in regard to a participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's responsibility, it will not ``knowingly'' employ or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with an individual, agency, organization, etc. which has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violated any laws involving any government funds. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes the regulations are clear that an institution will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be penalized for information of which it is not aware.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, in safeguarding Federal funds, the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> parties that may have previously violated a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law involving government funds, even if these parties now perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> janitorial or maintenance duties. By the provision, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment or contract relationship with such a party is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, and by ``knowingly'' entering into such a relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution may well jeopardize its continued participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations make this clear as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters recommended that the regulations be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to prohibit contracts with institutions or third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers that have been terminated for any reason, not just for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reason involving government funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this provision is to safeguard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal funds, not to punish institutions or servicers that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been terminated. For that reason, the Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provision is adequate in its present form to satisfy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters advised that requiring institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete surveys conducted as part of the Integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS) in a timely manner and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the satisfaction of the Secretary could be burdensome to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, especially if the school did not have a large staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or computer systems capable of collecting information. Three of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the five commenters recommended that the Secretary design forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or specify formats to make data collection easier. One of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five commenters suggested that the Secretary accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions not yet computerized with more time to complete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Ministers demand early reshuffle The prime minister faces growing pressure from senior ministers to bring his planned cabinet reshuffle forward to next week. Mr Major is believed to favour postponing the reshuffle until mid-July to minimise the scope for Commons statements by dismissed ministers before the House rises for the summer recess. However, ministers say that departmental decision-making has been virtually paralysed by uncertainty about the scope and extent of the reshuffle since Mr Major disclosed his intentions at a Downing Street press conference two weeks ago. As reshuffle fever spread at Westminster, MPs pointed to the careful wording of Mr Major's comments - which explicitly ruled out only the following two weeks - as evidence of an impending announcement. Downing Street officials added to the growing expectations by refusing to rule out a reshuffle next week. However, a senior official was careful to keep open the option of a later date. There was renewed speculation that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will replace Sir Norman Fowler as Conservative party chairman. Mr Heseltine has made clear that he wants to remain at the trade and industry department, which he believes has suffered from too many changes of senior ministers. However, he attended a secret meeting of the rightwing No Turning Back group on Thursday at which he is believed to have been pressed to accept the chairmanship in the party interest. Such an appointment would be popular with rank-and-file MPs, who believe that Mr Heseltine is one of the few cabinet ministers with the political skills to dent the image of Mr Tony Blair, the likely winner of Labour's leadership election. The government's fear of Mr Blair was underlined by a concerted attack on the shadow home secretary by a raft of cabinet ministers including Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary. Mr Redwood, in an acidic statement distributed at Westminster, said Mr Blair was a 'snappy dresser' whose personal manifesto issued on Thursday mixed 'the bland and the obvious with the ambiguous'.</p>

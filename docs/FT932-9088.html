			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / More than their job's worth: Peter Martin examines the irresistible rise of UK executives' pay and its effect on the morale of middle managers Money is the Pleistocene layer of British business, the rich, deep mineral deposit that lies buried under the top dressing of corporate strategy, mission statements and quality circles. Once a year, at annual report time, the surface layers give way, and the secret bursts into view - for some people, business is a way of keeping body and soul together; for others, it is a way of getting rich. This year we learnt, for example, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, received Pounds 769,000 last year in salary, pension contribution and shares. Lord Wolfson, part-time chairman of Next, had a 68 per cent pay rise, to Pounds 168,000. Mr Peter Wood, who has created the Direct Line insurance business for Royal Bank of Scotland, is likely to earn more than Pounds 10m. Sir Anthony Tennant, retiring chairman of Guinness, won a 24 per cent salary rise in his last year, to Pounds 777,000, plus an annual top-up payment to take his pension to about Pounds 500,000, and two years of consultancy at Pounds 50,000 a year. Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, got an 84 per cent pay rise, to Pounds 520,000. These are the annual purse-baring rituals of spring. This year, however, there has been a special edge to the public reaction, honed by low general pay rises and some unusual, one-off arrangements. If current share prices hold good, for example, 44 managers at LWT stand to make Pounds 55m between them this autumn, thanks to a share purchase scheme designed to keep them in their jobs during the television franchise round. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of about-to-be-sundered ICI, will celebrate a 31 per cent cut in the size of the company he runs with a 25 per cent rise in his salary, to Pounds 425,000, and a bonus of between 50 and 100 per cent of final salary when he retires in 1995. And Mr Gerald Ronson, the man responsible for the rise and fall of Heron International, has persuaded the banks to let him have a five-year contract at an annual index-linked salary of Pounds 500,000 for sorting out the mess he's stuck them with. A couple of decades ago, this surge of personal enrichment would have provoked a left-versus-right political controversy - the working class versus the toffs. This time, the political and trade union response has been muted. Instead, there has been a distant rumbling from the nameless, respectable legions of middle managers and small shareholders, faithfully reflected in the columns of the broadsheet press. There is a statistical underpinning for this wailing from the suburbs. Over the past 10 years, an FT survey shows, the boards of those companies which have stayed in the FT-SE 100 index throughout the period have raised their collective salaries by an average of 14 1/2 per cent a year, outstripping the rise in the cost of living, the average salary, and their companies' profits by a handsome margin (see chart). Even when the economy has slowed, and the white-collar salariat has suffered its first serious recession, the surge in directors' incomes has continued, buoyed in part by the reporting this spring of bonuses paid in 1992 for achievements in 1991 in meeting targets set as long ago as 1990. So far, 76 of the current FT-SE 100 members have published their salary and profits details for financial years ending in 1992. Overall, they raised directors' pay by 13 per cent during a period when profits fell by 7 per cent, the cost of living rose by about 5 per cent and average earnings increased by roughly 7 per cent. Mr Stefan Szymanski, assistant professor of economics at the London Business School, has confirmed this trend in a broader, more statistically thorough, study. During the boom, he says, there was a definite relationship between rapidly increasing profits, and rises in board pay. During the recession, however, this relationship broke down. Profits fell, but earnings stayed the same - or kept on rising. The rise in board salaries is starting to unsettle some of the people whose studies are partly responsible for it - remuneration consultants such as Mr Anthony Williams of Hay Management Consultants. Mr Williams thinks this year's pay packets - to be reported next year - will at last start to show the impact of the recession. In the meantime, though, he understands a middle-manager's frustration. 'His differential over the people below him hasn't increased as fast as the directors' differential over him,' says Mr Williams. 'If you look at before-tax - and, even more, after-tax - figures, the gap has widened quite significantly over the past decade.' The Institute of Directors, normally the most ardent advocate of management's right to call the shots, is also perturbed. An audible note of irritation creeps into the voice of Mr Blenyth Jenkins, the institute's director of corporate affairs, when he talks about the subject. Partly he is irritated at journalists for failing to recognise the delayed nature of bonus payments and annual reports. But mainly, he is exasperated that companies make too little effort to spell out their remuneration policies, pay top people cost-of-living increases which are not justified by performance, and cling to three-year rolling service contracts which produce high pay-offs when an executive is asked to leave. Directors in small and medium-sized companies (average salary: Pounds 46,000) 'are at a loss to understand why these enormous salaries are paid', says Mr Jenkins. 'The other source of irritation is when an individual runs a company into the ground and is removed - and goes out leading the parade with an enormous cheque.' A new set of institute guidelines on pay, addressing these points, is due to be approved by its policy committee next week. Underlying the issue of executive pay lies one important trend. Much lower marginal tax rates have made it worth paying higher salaries, because executives, not the taxman, now reap the benefit. That has gone hand in hand with a shift of perceptions. After a decade of Thatcherism, says Hay's Mr Williams, people believe 'it's OK to make a lot of money'. This has led to a general widening of differentials and an attempt to link pay more closely to performance in every industry, at every level - and in the public service as well. So why does the link seem to have broken down in large companies, at least when it comes to a period of poor performance? There are a number of possible reasons. One is the argument about lags mentioned earlier; the second is that big British companies, by and large, have managed to protect shareholders against the impact of recession remarkably well; perhaps directors deserve extra pay for preventing a much bigger profits slide? The snag with this explanation is that it also applies to lower-level workers. After all, in many companies, staff cuts have increased the remaining employees' workload - yet they do not get director-sized pay rises. And though the lags argument is also valid, the recession has gone on so long that bosses' pay packets should surely be showing some impact by now. More convincing explanations revolve around a set of boardroom beliefs which create irresistible upwards pressure on directors' pay: The arithmetic fallacy. Every company wishes to be above average in the terms and conditions it offers its top executives, to be sure of attracting the best talent. Yet if everyone seeks to be above average, the average spirals ever higher. 'I have only ever had one company say it wanted to pay below the median,' says Hay's Mr Williams, who is frequently hired by boards to recommend directors' pay. The 'global manager'. There is a growing tendency to use international comparisons as a benchmark for setting directors' pay, on the grounds executives can now hop easily from one country to another in search of higher pay. Yet only a tiny proportion of UK executives are capable of building careers abroad. 'The chairman of one of the newly privatised water companies isn't very quickly going to get a job in America,' says the Institute of Directors' Blenyth Jenkins. Process versus substance. Companies are increasingly setting up elaborate structures for assessing directors' pay, spurred on by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance and by shareholder pressure. Though these are often rigorous and independent, it is not clear how effective they can be in this sensitive area. BAT Industries ('We were carrying out Cadbury before Cadbury had even, er, melted') sets its directors' pay in a committee composed entirely of non-executive directors. It gives each director a number of performance targets, some of them 'hard' ones based on financial performance (price/earnings ratio relative to rivals, market share, profitability), and some of them softer and more judgmental. Directors' salaries and bonuses are set in accordance with how well each has done against his targets. Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman, earned Pounds 609,000 in pay and bonus in 1989, and Pounds 638,000 in 1991. Last year, his salary and bonus rose 54 per cent, to Pounds 980,000 - an accompaniment, says BAT's Michael Prideaux, to the group's 68 per cent rise in pre-tax profits that year. Yet BAT's profits in 1992 were still below the level reached in 1989, when Sir Patrick's pay was 38 per cent lower than last year. Shareholders have benefited in the meantime, of course, by the group's actions to spin off assets and raise the dividend - but arguably Sir James Goldsmith, with his aborted raid on the company's shares, deserves to share the credit there. Mr Tony Greener, Guinness's new chairman, is one of the few bosses willing to speak on the record about top pay policy. As with BAT, he stresses the objectivity of the non-executive directors who set pay at Guinness. Directors' bonuses are tied to 'hard' criteria, such as earnings-per-share growth. The management commissions an outside survey and makes recommendations, but there is then 'a very straightforward and open discussion - they do not rubber-stamp anything. It's a dialogue rather than a set of take-it-or-leave-it recommendations.' Institutional shareholders are starting to take executive pay as an issue, worried perhaps by the example of the US, where total board remuneration is a significant figure in the profit and loss account of some companies. In Britain, though the individual sums are large by comparison with average wages - even average white-collar earnings - the total is not big enough to worry shareholders directly. It risks becoming so, however, if directors' pay drifts so far out of line with ordinary managers' pay and with profitability as to damage morale and performance inside the company. Deep in the Pleistocene layer, something stirs . . .</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 SIDES IN VOTING-RIGHTS CASE CAUTIONED  </P> <P> A federal judge Friday cautioned attorneys for the Chicano Federation and the  city of San Diego not to allow the two sides' differences over attorneys' fees  to scuttle a tentative settlement in a minority voting rights lawsuit.  </P> <P> In a hastily called hearing, U. S. District Judge John S. Rhoades told the  lawyers that case law gives him the power to set fees using certain formulas if  the two sides cannot agree, a statement that mirrors the Chicano Federation's  position.  </P> <P> "What I'm saying, basically is, if you can't agree, if the council particularly  won't agree to the fee question, that you let me do it," Rhoades said from the  bench.  </P> <P> The two sides announced a tentative settlement of the 20-month-old lawsuit in  Rhoades' courtroom Wednesday. The agreement calls for voters to decide a June,  1990, ballot measure on whether to expand the council from its current eight  seats to 10 and mandates a redrawing of district boundaries by Oct. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preliminary Census Data  </P> <P> The reapportionment will use preliminary U. S. Census data that Chicano  Federation lawyers contend will most accurately reflect the growth in the  city's Latino population. The final decision on redistricting will belong to  the council, however, and not the independent commission originally sought by  the federation.  </P> <P> The federation achieved one major goal of its lawsuit last November, when  voters approved a ballot measure changing the city's electoral system so that  council members are elected only by members of their districts. Previously,  council candidates ran in primaries within their districts, followed by  citywide runoffs between the two top vote-getters.  </P> <P> The deal will not be final until the council votes to approve it Monday. At  least one council member has expressed reservations over a provision that calls  for the city to pay $20,000 in fees to federation attorneys Patricia Meyer and  Mike Aguirre.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the two sides huddled in a lengthy closed-door session after  Friday's hearing. They said later that they were negotiating language of the  settlement agreement.  </P></p>

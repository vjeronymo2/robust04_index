			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MISSION THAT GAVE HIM SHELTER  </P> <P> The Rev. Wayne Teuerle had worked in the rescue missions of downtown Los  Angeles. He knew their image: smelly places with ragged furniture, gray  linoleum and pale green walls.  </P> <P> He wanted his Long Beach Rescue Mission to look more like a well-maintained  apartment building than a homeless shelter.  </P> <P> The result of that ambition is readily apparent at the earth-toned, two-story  mission buildings on either side of Pacific Avenue, north of Anaheim Street.  </P> <P> Both the two-story Samaritan House, a men's 100-bed facility with a chapel and  dining hall, and Lydia House, a 33-bed temporary home for women and children,  were built specifically as mission buildings. Teuerle said that allowed him to  incorporate many of his ideas.  </P> <P> "One of the things we wanted to do was change the image," said Teuerle, who  started the mission in 1972 with his wife, Janet. "You don't have to have a  mission that looks like a mission."  </P> <P> In the men's building, for instance, the walls are painted cheery shades of  orange and baby blue. The bathrooms, dining areas and bedrooms appear as  spotless as rooms in a well-maintained private house. The furniture is new. And  the rooms are pleasant and airy, lacking the rank odor of disinfectant found in  some downtown Los Angeles missions.  </P> <P> The women's facility has private showers and a plush living-room-style lounge.  </P> <P> Wayne Teuerle said he helped design both the men's and women's quarters. "I got  a little creative and I wanted to build something and decorate it," the  49-year-old evangelical Christian minister said.  </P> <P> Unlike some of the missions in Los Angeles, the Long Beach facility was laid  out so that the homeless and hungry would not have to loiter on the sidewalk to  await the nightly meal and church service. Instead of waiting outside, the  crowd comes inside to a large outdoor atrium or a waiting room lined with  chairs.  </P> <P> The Long Beach mission has been so successful that the Teuerles want to expand.  They plan to raise about $500,000 for an addition that will include about 20  new beds, more office space and two staff apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began on Broadway  </P> <P> Teuerle, a finance manager before becoming a minister, started the mission in  an old building on Broadway in downtown Long Beach. He said they served 27  meals the first day and 16 homeless people attended the church service and  stayed the night.  </P> <P> After a few years of seven-day weeks, the Teuerles built their new mission for  men and the chapel in 1983. It was followed two years later by the women's  facility. Wayne Teuerle said no one in need of a bed is ever turned away at the  mission. On average, 68% of the beds are filled annually; the high was 82% one  month. Nevertheless, he said the mission needs to expand to keep pace with its  projected growth. The new beds and offices are needed "as a hedge for the  future."  </P> <P> Teuerle said the $440,000-a-year operation employs 14 paid staff members. It is  self-supporting, depending entirely on contributions from individuals and 85  churches.  </P> <P> Although the mission served 107,000 meals last year, Teuerle said that total  food costs ran about $400 -- mostly for spices. Virtually all of the food  consumed at the mission is donated.  </P></p>

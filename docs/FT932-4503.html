			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Pounds 38m premium paid on Gulf war charters BRITAIN PAID a premium of about Pounds 38m above normal commercial charter rates to ship military supplies to the Gulf during the conflict of 1990-91, according to a National Audit Office report published today. The report, which coincides with a police investigation into alleged fraud in the contract arrangements, also finds that some of the commissions paid were unusually high. The watchdog body says the special shipping committee set up by the Ministry of Defence failed to keep records showing how it decided which ships to charter. The National Audit Office, which reports to parliament on the way taxpayers' money is spent, says that because of the fraud inquiry it was unable to find out why only five of the 162 ships used were British. A decision on possible prosecutions is in the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service following investigations by the Ministry of Defence police. The ministry said yesterday, however, that there was no evidence of fraudulent activity by its military or civilian employees. The ministry paid 55 per cent to 70 per cent above market rates for outward voyages by general cargo ships and 160 per cent to 200 per cent above the going rate for roll-on-roll-off vessels, the report says. It ascribes this mainly to limited availability of the types of ship specified by the ministry, and notes that a 'wartime premium' will always be payable. A total of Pounds 143m was spent on ship charters and Pounds 69m on aircraft charters. Brokerage fees for 56 charters arranged through Hogg Robinson, the government freight agent, are being questioned by the MoD as a result of an internal audit. The audit office says fees ranged up to 8.5 per cent compared with normal levels of up to 5 per cent. It also notes that Hogg Robinson, whose contract is under review, used only four brokers for 87 per cent of its charters. In addition, the report reveals that 228 aircraft pallets - metal platforms on rollers used to load freight on to transport aircraft - went astray in the operation. The loss is valued at Pounds 680,000. It says that 'despite exhaustive searches', not enough pallets were sent back from the Gulf. The RAF transport base at Lyneham, Wiltshire, was 'within two hours of grinding to a halt' and pallets had to be borrowed from the US Air Force. Eighty containers, out of 7,000 used, were also unaccounted for. 'In addition to not always knowing where the containers were,' the report says, 'the department were not always aware of what was in them.'

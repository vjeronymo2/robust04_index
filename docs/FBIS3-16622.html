We do not  set any pre-conditions. I do not think this is a renunciation  of our position," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  told journalists at the close of his talks with U.S. Secretary  of Defence William Perry on Friday morning.    The two countries' cooperation in the conversion of the  Russian Defence Ministry to civilan production and matters  connected with nuclear disarmament, including that of Ukraine,  were discussd, Chernomyrdin said.    Mr Perry pointed out that Russia would declare its joining  NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the end of March.  "This will be a major event in NATO", because its programme will  be virtually realised, he said, adding that "Russia is a great  nuclear power and it will play a very special role in the  Partnership for Peace".    The supply of technology to Russia for the manufacture of  prefabricated houses for servicemen and for the elimination of  chemical weapons was also discussed during the talks with the  U.S. defence secretary, Chernomyrdin said. "We have approached  closely the problem of eliminating biological weapons as well,"  the premier noted.    Chernomyrdin called for more active cooperation between the  two countries under the auspices of the Russian-U.S. Economic,  Scientific and Technical Cooperation Commission which is  co-chaired by the Russian premier and U.S. Vice-President Albert  Gore. The premier said the commission's regular session is to  be held in the U.S. in May.</p>

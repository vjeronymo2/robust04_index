			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Focus on stores prospects The first whispers of Christmas high street sales figures seeped into the stock market yesterday, with retailers in general said to have seen some useful increases. In spite of a slow early December, the week before Christmas seems to have seen shoppers flocking back. However, the picture is still patchy. Clothes sales appear to have been strong, as were jewellery and other giftware. But some computer games were dull, although small electrical appliances were said to be in demand. Analysts said the full picture would become clearer over the next 10 days as some of the leading stores groups put out trading statements. However, while sales may be stronger, analysts said the key to improved revenues will be those companies which held margins. Next is one which has been attracting the most bullish comments in this respect, its shares adding 6 1/2 at 238p yesterday. Austin Reed gained 9 at 195p. Jeweller Signet Group, which will make a sales statement next week, moved up 2 1/4 to 26 1/4 p. Talk of strong book sales lifted WH Smith 'A' 7 1/2 to 517 1/2 p, while Pentos firmed 2 to 27. Boots, which will issue a report by the end of this week, slipped 5 to 593p.</p>

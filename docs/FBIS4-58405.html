			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Midhat al-Zahid, Sami Fahmi, and Hazim Munir] </F>   [Text] AL-AHALI has obtained important information that  explains the background of the attempt to involve Egypt's Copts  in a conference on minorities in the Arab world and also exposes  the schemes behind such conferences.    An informed Egyptian source has confirmed that U.S.  diplomats  have been persistently exerting pressure over the past few  months during several meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo  and Washington to form a new committee in the People's Assembly  to deal with human rights. The source said that the discussions  revealed that the notion goes beyond the concept of human rights  to what the Americans term the protection of the minorities'  right to hold religious rites and to protect religious freedom  in Egypt.    Egyptian officials rejected the U.S. ideas because of their  inherent dangers threatening the Egyptian people's single  national fabric and the sectarian seditions they might inflame,  particularly since religious rights in Egypt are already  protected and waves of terrorism and bigotry are threatening all  Egyptians without exception.    Groups in the United States have tried to exploit the Dayr  al- Muharraq incident in an attempt to incite international  public opinion against what they termed the persecution campaign  against Copts in Egypt and to demand international protection  for the Copts on the pretext that the government is not  protecting them and not bringing those who attack them to trial.  Coptic leaders in Egypt have rejected these attempts and His  Holiness Pope Shanudah III issued a statement stressing that  Egypt's Copts are not a minority and he does not want any party  to label them as such. He said that the Copts are part of  Egypt's national fabric. In an interview with AL-AHALI, the  pope stressed that the cohesiveness of the homeland's sons is a  guarantee of stability against terrorism.    The crisis resulting from the minority rights conference --  which the Ibn-Khaldun Center for Development Studies is  organizing in cooperation with the London-based International  Society for the Protection of Minorities' Rights -- continues to  create problems. The Sudanese and Iraqi governments have told  the Arab League, through private channels, that they are opposed  to discussing the problems of the Kurds and south Sudan at the  international conference scheduled to be held in Cairo next  month while the international coalition forces are undertaking  what they term the protection of Kurds in northern Iraq. This  undertaking in fact threatens Iraq's territorial integrity,  while the Iraqi people remain under siege.    Khartoum has also protested the presence of John Garang in  Cairo and the discussion of the south Sudan issue at an  international conference.    In a last attempt to save the minority rights conference,  Dr.  Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim announced that the issue of Egypt's Copts  has been removed from the agenda and that the conference will be  amended by adding peoples' rights to minority rights.    According to AL-AHALI's information, UN Secretary General  Dr.  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd- al-Majid, and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa will  not, as previously announced, attend the conference or send  messages to it. AL-AHALI's information also confirms that many  of those invited to attend have turned down invitations to  attend, send papers, or participate in its sessions.</p>

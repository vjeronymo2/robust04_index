			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Euro Disney's prince has come - bearing cash Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi prince who is one of the Middle East's most aggressive investors, yesterday came to the rescue of Euro Disney, the leisure group, by announcing plans to buy up to 24.5 per cent of the company on the eve of its emergency financial restructuring. The prince, who is also prepared to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) to build a second conference centre at the EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris, has been negotiating for six weeks with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, to thrash out the terms of a deal. Prince Al-Waleed, 37, a nephew of King Fahd, first surfaced on the international investment scene in 1991 by buying a 14.88 per cent stake in Citicorp, the US banking group. He has interests in finance, media and construction and recently joined with Accor, the French hotel group, in its bid to buy the Meridien luxury hotel chain from Air France. The prince, together with United Saudi Commercial Bank, of which he is chairman, has negotiated a complex deal with Walt Disney whereby he can buy between 13 per cent and 24 per cent of Euro Disney's shares after the completion of its forthcoming FFr13bn (Pounds 1.53bn) emergency financial restructuring. He has offered to buy any shares left on the market after Euro Disney's imminent FFr6bn rights issue. He will be allowed to retain only up to 24.5 per cent of the group, so that his holding is no more than 50 per cent of that of Walt Disney's 49 per cent stake. If the rights issue is heavily subscribed, which is considered to be unlikely given the gravity of Euro Disney's recent financial difficulties and the steep fall in its share price, Prince Al-Waleed will be able to acquire a stake of up to 13 per cent from Disney. The US group, which has already suffered heavy losses on its Euro Disney holding, is willing to reduce its investment to 36 per cent, providing the prince's stake is worth no more than half that. The prince's emergence comes only a few days before Euro Disney's extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday when the terms of the rights issue are expected to be announced. In a statement yesterday Prince Al-Waleed said: 'I believe the long-term prospects for Euro Disney are bright. The quality of what has been constructed at Euro Disneyland Paris makes me optimistic about the future.' A Disney official in Los Angeles said: 'The prince came to us . . . We had already done the financial restructuring with the banks and other interested parties. He then approached us.' Dash of drama in theme park saga, Page 27</p>

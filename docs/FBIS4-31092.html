			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The congress has elected Gyula Horn as its  candidate for the post of prime minister. Kata Peli Nagy  reports:    [Nagy] Gyula Horn is the official MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party] candidate for the post of prime minister. [passage  omitted] Gyula Horn commented on his victory by saying: It was  not I who applied for this post; I was nominated. In his  closing speech, he said among other things that the party would  have to maintain its current profile; the MSZP should remain a  people's party, the party of Aunt Mary and Uncle Joe.    The congress unanimously decided to call on the SZDSZ  [Alliance of Free Democrats] to start coalition negotiations  with them. The letter containing this request has already been  sent to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe. [passage omitted] The letter  also states that the similarities of the programs of the two  parties offer favorable conditions for the establishment of the  coalition. The letter contains those subjects which the MSZP  would wish to negotiate; they would assess the economic  situation, negotiate the strengthening of democratic  institutions, discuss the urgent measures of the new government,  talk about the personnel composition of the government and its  mode of operation, and discuss political and legal guarantees.  Gyula Horn announced that they were ready for a compromise on  all the essential issues.    The delegates, in their contributions earlier, called on the  party and the party chairman to show greater tolerance and  readiness to compromise. Gyula Horn too agreed with this. As  he said: We cry and laugh together, we take the rap together,  comrades.    Should the MSZP receive a favorable reply from the SZDSZ,  coalition negotiations could begin at the start of next week.</p>

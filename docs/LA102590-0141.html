			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No  rating.  </P> <P> A spoof of those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot and  get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the hatches. And this time it's  Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. M.F.  </P></p>

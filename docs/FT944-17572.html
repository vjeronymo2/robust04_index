			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No plunge Sir, Subscriptions to Which? magazine have hardly 'plunged', as you claim in your profile of the newly appointed director of Consumers' Association, Sheila McKechnie ('Consumers' champion to leave her Shelter', September 21). Current subscriptions stand at 684,000, calculated on the moving average basis - the equivalent figure on the same basis in March 1988 would have been 854,000.

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / New man may tilt 'goodwill' decision The Accounting Standards Board has appointed a new member who could tilt its decision on the controversial treatment of goodwill. The Financial Reporting Council, the parent body of the board, said yesterday that Mr Ray Hinton, a partner with accountants Arthur Andersen, had been appointed as the ninth member. Goodwill - the difference between the price paid for a company and its net assets - is likely to be one of the biggest tests for the board in the coming months. On Monday the board unveiled two alternative proposals on the topic after admitting that it was unable to agree a common line. Its members were divided 4-4, with one vacant seat caused by the recent resignation of Mr Roger Munson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr Hinton, whose appointment is for two years, has been an outspoken critic of one of the suggestions - that goodwill should be capitalised on the balance sheet and depreciated. He believes that goodwill should be written off directly to reserves and not pass through the profit and loss account.</p>

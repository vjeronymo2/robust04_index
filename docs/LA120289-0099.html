			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOST COUPLES SOON ADJUST TO RETIREMENT, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> Retirement won't destroy a good marriage nor will it salvage a bad one, say two  researchers who interviewed more than 200 couples to determine the effect of  retirement on marriage.  </P> <P> As time goes by, Mature Outlook magazine reports, more couples will be leaving  their jobs.  </P> <P> "Retirement neither ruins nor resurrects marriage," said Barbara Vinick. An  assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health and a research  sociologist at the Veterans Administration in Boston, Vinick conducted the  three-year study with David Ekerdt, associate director of the University of  Kansas Center on Aging.  </P> <P> The researchers interviewed two groups of married couples. In one group, the  men were in their first year of retirement. In the other, the men were still  working and were on the average two years younger.  </P> <P> "We found that a lot of people approaching retirement wonder how they'll get  along after retirement and whether they'll get in each other's hair," Vinick  said. "There's some natural apprehension."  </P> <P> But most couples make the adjustment fairly easily, the study suggests. While  many of the retired husbands acknowledged that they initially missed the  camaraderie of their workplaces, most said they adjusted within a couple of  months and were enjoying the opportunity to do projects they had been saving  for years.  </P> <P> Although many of the wives had worried about having their husbands underfoot,  they said they enjoyed spending more time with the men in a relaxed atmosphere.  </P> <P> Everyone doesn't react the same way to retirement, Vinick and Ekerdt said. But  they found several common reactions to life style changes that retirement can  bring. For example, many women in the study felt a loss of privacy in the first  months after the husband retired. And husbands gained a new understanding of  their wive's daily routine.  </P> <P> Overall, the positive aspects of retirement outweighed the negative ones, the  study found. About 60% of the retired couples said their quality of life  improved upon retirement.  </P> <P> "Before retirement, one spouse or the other was often worried about some aspect  of the change," Vinick said. "After retirement, most couples said they got  along better than they expected."  </P></p>

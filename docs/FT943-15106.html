			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Coffee prices set to soar after second Brazil frost Coffee futures prices yesterday leapt by 30 per cent to their highest level in more than eight years, after a second severe frost in Brazil in as many weeks raised fears of a serious shortage of beans in the next couple of years. The surge in futures prices, which have climbed by 220 per cent this year, increases the likelihood of further rises in retail coffee prices of at least 15 per cent this year, according to manufacturers. Sainsbury, the leading UK supermarket group, yesterday announced an increase of 10p to 99p in the price of its own label instant coffee. A spokesman for Nestle, which raised the price of Nescafe by 12 1/2 per cent in January, said the rises in world bean prices would 'work their way through to the supermarkets'. The weekend frost prompted Brazil, which accounts for a quarter of world output, to suspend exports until it has assessed the damage. According to initial estimates, it could lose up to half next year's crop as a result of the two frosts, with temperatures falling to about minus 3 degrees celsius with ice in some places. The freeze is not thought to have done much damage to this year's crop which is being harvested. However, the coffee trees hit by the freeze as a result will produce fewer beans next year. Both frosts affected southern parts of Minas Gerais, the most important coffee-producing state. Accu-Weather, an independent forecasting organisation, said the frost two weeks ago damaged 30 to 40 per cent of next year's crop, which was originally estimated at between 25m and 30m bags. Saturday's frost hit a further 10-15 per cent of the crop. Ms Judith Ganes, soft commodities analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said coffee futures prices could regain the all-time highs of 1977, which followed the devastating Brazilian frost of 1975. Prices then reached the equivalent of Dollars 7,000 (Pounds 4,600) a tonne, compared with yesterday's peak in London of Dollars 4,000 a tonne for coffee for delivery in three months. 'We're looking at a situation where higher prices are needed to ration demand,' said Ms Ganes. At the close in New York, September futures prices for arabica coffee, which accounts for the bulk of Brazil's production, were up 47 cents at 235.35 cents a pound, or 25 per cent. The September contract in London closed Dollars 759 higher at Dollars 3,835. The frost season can run through until early September, and cool weather is forecast for next weekend.

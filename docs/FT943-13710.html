			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (37): Symbol of liberation - The new flag is here to stay The shock and disapproval when South Africa's new flag was first displayed was palpable and widespread. 'An exotic tea towel' and 'Dayglo Y-fronts' were two of the more charitable comments about the patterned, six-colour emblem that was unveiled at the end of last year. Such was the attachment of whites to their old 'oranje blanje blou', and most blacks to the African National Congress's black, green and gold colours, that the new banner seemed to be representative of continued tension in a still divided society rather than any common ground. By the time the poll was over, however, the flag had been taken up by black and white alike as the symbol of liberation, a tangible demonstration of commitment to the new South Africa. After an emotional flag-raising ceremony on the first night of the elections, the country awoke to find the multi-hued banner flying proudly over city halls, police stations and government buildings throughout the land. And when, at President Mandela's inauguration, flag-patterned T-shirts and banners littered the lawns of the union buildings and the air force thundered overhead trailing its colours, the apotheosis was complete. The new flag, originally regarded as a temporary compromise until a final one could be agreed upon, is undoubtedly here to stay. It has been a curious phenomenon, both for the speed with which it happened and the genuine feelings which it appears to evoke. While the debate over the national anthem was solved by allowing both the stirring Afrikaans 'Die Stem' and the hauntingly beautiful liberation anthem 'Nkosi Sikel' Afrika,' no similar deal was possible over the flag issue. Following the failure of a nationwide competition to come up with an acceptable alternative, the matter was handed over to a private agency which produced the current design and immediately came under fire for its ridiculous result. Now, however, it is difficult to find anyone with an unkind word to say about the emblem, and most people are rushing to buy their own. Flagpoles are sprouting in both white suburbia and black townships, flag bumper stickers are becoming ubiquitous, the emblem features on new airmail stamps and the Springbok rugby team has had it embroidered on their shorts. Even the corporate sector, not in the past known for its displays of enthusiastic patriotism, have been striving to outdo each other in the size and number of flags at their disposal. One big company outside Johannesburg can be seen flying no fewer than 10 of the new banners above its office buildings and executives have been known to fight over little designer flag pins for their jacket lapels. In short, the flag has become the symbol of the euphoria that has gripped the country for the past two months following the remarkably successful transition to democracy, and it seems destined to remain the touchstone of a new-found patriotism. As a result, in addition to the traditional goods and trinkets hawked on South Africa's streets, any shopper is now just as likely to be offered a selection of flag key-rings, coffee cups, table-cloths and, yes, even tea-towels. But they're tea-towels that can be used with pride.</p>

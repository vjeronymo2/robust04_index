			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: Lindsays and Friends - Concert The Lindsay Quartet's 'French Connection' Festival at the Wigmore Hall, now just past the halfway mark, testifies not only to the strength of the entente cordiale but also to the continuing vitality of the chamber-musical medium itself. The bill of fare places side by side French and British masterworks and new works: Ravel's single String Quartet and Geoffrey Poole's Second Quartet, say, or - in Tuesday's recital by the excellent piano-quartet group Domus - the Faure C minor Piano Quartet and John Casken's 1990 Piano Quartet (first London performance). In no didactic fashion, and also because these players have themselves sustained a policy of commissioning new works for their repertory, the nightly mixtures make their point with pleasing, salient simplicity. The Domus programme was a particularly winning one. Casken, whose leading position among British composers of middle years is emphasised by each new work of his that appears, wrote the Piano Quartet for Domus's tenth birthday season. It is 'real' chamber music - that is to say, its musical ideas seem irremovable from the intimate performing circumstances that brought them into existence, and there is a 'conversational' distinctness in their exchange that characterises both the ensemble and each invidual strand. The idiom is highly personal - with pianistic arabesques in tiny, chattery flourishes against static, consonant strings, and sudden group stirrings into dance-like rhythmic energy - yet always strictly logical, and beautifully clear in the balance of parts. The Domus violinist, Krysia Osostowicz, told us in advance that Casken's quartet was 'the most difficult work we've played', but from the performance it seemed clear that the technical challenges had been comprehensively and exhilaratingly met. The previous evening the Lindsay Quartet had devoted the first half of their recital to the second London performance of Michael Tippett's most recent chamber-music opus - the Fifth Quartet, a quirky, loose-limbed, sometimes buoyantly appealing compendium of late-Tippettian sounds and ideas - and then the London premiere of the Poole Second. A Manchester don who has spent fruitful time in Africa mastering drumming and other instrumental techniques, the composer has found atmospheric, enjoyable ways of re-creating and developing them within the string-quartet format. Like the South African-born Kevin Volans in his string-quartet 'hit' of the 1980s, White Man Sleeps - if perhaps with less 'native' economy - Poole sends out a compliment to the strength and wholeness of African music which is elegantly returned.</p>

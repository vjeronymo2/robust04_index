			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / High street banks cut private-sector loans PROLONGED recession, loan write-offs and increased caution about the risks of lending contributed to a Pounds 4.8bn fall in lending by the big high street banks to private-sector companies last year, it emerged yesterday. The British Bankers' Association disclosed in its annual abstract that the loans outstanding to industrial and commercial companies totalled Pounds 65.6bn at the end of December, compared with Pounds 70.4bn at the same time in 1991. The lending by the banks - Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, National Westminster, Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB Group - was largely reduced through a fall in overdrafts. Overdrafts to industrial and commercial companies fell by Pounds 3.8bn to Pounds 23.6bn. The fall in lending to private-sector companies came despite an increase in lending to individuals and households from Pounds 117.5bn in 1991 to Pounds 123.6bn last year. The BBA said the fall in lending reflected 'serious attempts' by private-sector companies to reduce their indebtedness, both by running down their deposits and by transferring debt into equity. The high street banks - which account for 70 per cent of British sterling lending - also closed some 700 branches and cut 18,500 staff as they struggled to cut over-capacity in their branch and distribution networks. The BBA disclosed that the banks cut the total number of branches by 5.7 per cent and the total number of staff by 5.6 per cent during 1992. The cuts in the banks' 11,600-branch network have been continuing this year and are expected to last at least until 1995. The report said that lending figures had been distorted by loan write-offs totalling Pounds 4.5bn. Most of the write-offs were on troubled loans to property, construction and manufacturing companies. The banks increased the share of their lending allocated to mortgages. House-purchase loans increased to 33.2 per cent of total sterling lending of Pounds 272.5bn, compared with 31.3 per cent of total lending of Pounds 268.2bn in 1991. They also achieved a substantial increase in their share of the mortgage market. While net lending for house purchases from building societies fell to Pounds 13.7bn last year from Pounds 20.9bn in 1991, that of banks rose to Pounds 5.9bn from Pounds 4.7bn. The fall in the number of bank branches was partly offset by an increase of 600 in the number of automated teller machines in high streets. Total cash withdrawn from the 15,000 bank cash machines rose 8.6 per cent. The average credit outstanding on Mastercard and Visa credit cards continued to rise, from Pounds 407 in 1991 to Pounds 419 last year, although it grew more slowly than in previous years.</p>

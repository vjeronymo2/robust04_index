			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Qantas climbs into the black with last figures before float Increased passenger loads and a large reduction in abnormal items helped Qantas, the government-controlled Australian airline in which British Airways holds a 25 per cent interest, climb back into the black for the year to June. The carrier said that profits after tax and abnormals stood at ADollars 155.9m (USDollars 114.6m), compared with a loss of ADollars 377.2m last time. Revenues were up by 13.2 per cent at ADollars 6.6bn, although this was partly due to the inclusion of the domestic operations of the former Australian Airlines for 12 months (compared with 10 months previously). Earnings before interest and tax more than doubled to ADollars 480m. This is the last set of full-year figures which Qantas will produce before the government floats its remaining 75 per cent interest in the airline on the stock market in the first half of 1995. Precise timing of the float - expected to raise more than ADollars 2bn for the government - is undecided. Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman, said the prospectus would contain a profits forecast for 1994-95 and possibly for 1995-96. The increase in operating profits during the past financial year was attributed to increased passenger loads both in Australia and overseas. The company said total revenue passenger kilometres on international routes rose by just over 10 per cent, and load factors increased from 67.9 per cent to 70.6 per cent. However, yields - revenue per passenger kilometre - were merely stable, due to continued fare discounting. Mr James Strong, chief executive, added that the Pacific routes, which have long been lossmaking, became 'marginally profitable'. A number of big US airlines, such as Continental and Northwest, have abandoned these routes and fares have risen significantly. Revenue from domestic operations increased on the back of a 15.7 per cent rise in capacity, and yields showed 'a slight improvement'. Costs overall rose, but by less than capacity. Fuel costs for the year were 'down marginally, net of hedges,' according to Mr Pemberton. Interest charges were ADollars 178.2m, compared with ADollars 197.4m previously. Abnormal items amounted to ADollars 64.9m before tax, made up of redundancy provisions, asset writedowns, and a provision for under-recovery of rentals. A year ago, Qantas was hit by a massive ADollars 446.4m abnormal charge. Qantas said that 'with no strengthening of yield in prospect, further reductions in overall unit cost levels will continue to be a major priority'. However, Mr Pemberton said that the carrier had been 'quite happy with the first couple of months' of the current trading year,' although he also warned that 'future prospects will depend to a considerable extent on trends in the aviation market particularly a continued strengthening in market demand and maintenance of reasonable yields'. Qantas said later that it was in the process of organising a ADollars 750m five-year standby facility, to replace a USDollars 400m note issue facility and separate USDollars 300m multi-option facil-ity.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> OPRAH GIFT AIDS BATTERED WOMEN  </P> <P> A $20,000 donation from talk show host Oprah Winfrey will help open a new  shelter for battered women.  </P> <P> The B. Robert Lewis House, a private agency headquartered in Eagan, will open  its second shelter in an abandoned convent, director Mary Ajax said. The  convent is being leased for 20 cents a year from church officials who wished to  remain anonymous, she said.  </P> <P> The windfall came last November when Winfrey held a benefit performance in  Minneapolis and offered to give half of the proceeds to the shelter.  </P> <P> Ajax said the donation was so large that it took several months for the shelter  to find other sources to match it.  </P></p>

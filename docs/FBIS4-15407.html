			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- Russian privatisation chief  Anatoliy Chubays said that 70 per cent of trading, public  catering and every-day service facilities have been already  privatised in Russia. Chubays believes that by the end of the  year this figure will reach 85-90 per cent. Also 80 per cent of  20,000 large industrial enterprises subject to privatisation  have changed hands, he said.    Speaking at a closed-door session of the Russian Government  Presidium on Thursday, the vice-premier said that the  privatisation voucher has already paid off. As of April 1, 1994  105 million privatisation vouchers had been collected. That  leaves about 45 million vouchers to be still collected. A total  of 650 voucher investment funds have been set up in the country.  The major result of privatisation is that joint stock companies  and privatised enterprises remain open to foreign and domestic  investors, Chubays said.    Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the Russian  Government will not backtrack on the course of reforms, adding,  however, that "we must be sure that we are going the right way.  Particularly, we must make sure that privatisation does not turn  out to be a sham."</p>

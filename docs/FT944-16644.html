			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Losses at oil and gas unit hit Kvaerner Kvaerner, Norway's second- largest stock market listed company, warned yesterday that losses on a project by the oil and gas division, along with restructuring costs, would damage profits for the first eight months of this year. Profits for the full year would also decline, it said. It expects the oil and gas division to incur a loss of about NKr200m (Dollars 29.8m) for the first eight months, and losses of the same order for 1994, because of losses on deliveries to the Troll oil project and restructuring costs of the division. 'This result partly reflects a substantial loss already reported by the group on its deliveries to the Troll oil platform in the Norwegian North Sea,' it said. Kvaerner said this implied a weaker 1994 result for the group as a whole. Last time, profits before unrealised foreign currency items and tax reached NKr1.5bn. The company had earlier forecast profits for 1994 at the same level as the year before.</p>

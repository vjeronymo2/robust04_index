			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [No video available] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA] has issued a  statement that says, in particular: "While none of the Crimean  separatists have been made liable for violating Ukrainian laws,  attempting to separate the Ukrainian lands and kindling  interethnic enmity, some Ukrainian patriots are in prison." The  statement points to a repeated arrest of Valeriy Bobrovych, a  leading member of the UNSO [Ukrainian National Self-Defense--the  paramilitary wing of the UNA] territorial command in Lvov, who  had arrived in Kiev for an operation after sustaining an injury  in Abkhazia.</p>

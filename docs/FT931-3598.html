			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due UNITED Biscuits' full-year results on Thursday will be heavily scarred by the profits collapse at Keebler, its US subsidiary, and a consequent restructuring charge. With margins still under pressure, analysts forecast group pre-tax profits of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m last time. The McVitie's division is thought to have benefited from a stronger year-end, as well as from contributions from European acquisitions. A small improvement is forecast for the Ross Young's frozen foods business, though KP Foods' results fell back slightly. Annual profits from English China Clays, due today, will reflect the problems of the paper industry, its major customer. Paper makers have been trying to share their pain with suppliers while ECC is also suffering competition from the US. Analysts are looking for a fall in profits from 1991's Pounds 115.4m pre-tax to Pounds 85m-Pounds 95m. However, under FRS 3 the numbers should look better, with a rise to around Pounds 100m from Pounds 79.3m. The end of the UK-quoted banks reporting round comes today with results from HSBC Holdings. HSBC, which acquired Midland Bank last summer, is expected to announce pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.8bn for 1992. Guinness, on Thursday, is expected to report a 17 per cent decline in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m, with an exceptional charge of Pounds 125m for the reorganisation of the group's Scotch whisky operations and Spanish brewing business accounting for most of the shortfall on 1991's Pounds 956m. Spirits' trading profits will reflect the impact of difficult conditions in the UK, Japan, and some European markets. A 1.5 per cent rise to Pounds 760m is expected. Brewing profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 244m to Pounds 265m. The contribution from LVMH, the French cognac and champagne group, is likely to be about Pounds 23m lower at Pounds 100m. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the papermaker, is likely to report on Thursday a drop in pre-tax profits of around one-third to Pounds 160m. It is suffering from the slowdown in the continental economies and excess capacity. Laporte, the UK chemicals group, reports its full-year results today. During the takeover of Evode earlier this year, the company predicted that its pre-tax profits would fall from Pounds 97.2m to Pounds 86m. Analysts expect the full-year dividend to rise from 18.9p a share to between 19.3p and 19.7p per share. Analysts will be more interested in the group's forecasts for the remainder of the year. More than a third of Laporte's sales are in north America. Rentokil, the pest control, plant hire and environmental services group, is expected to report on Thursday another big jump in pre-tax profits for 1992. Analysts are expecting profits of about Pounds 115m-Pounds 122m (Pounds 94.6m). A full-year dividend of 2p-2.5p (1.7p) is forecast. Pre-tax profits at IMI, the Birmingham engineer reporting today, were running 9 per cent down on 1991 at the halfway stage. That trend looks likely to have continued for the full year as the problems of the UK economy and the particular problems of the titanium market outweigh the strength of the building products business in Germany and the drinks dispense division. A likely outcome is taxable profits of about Pounds 64m for 1992 with a maintained final dividend of 5.8p.</p>

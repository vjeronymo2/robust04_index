			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Bond weakness slows property upswing The sharp upswing in commercial property values over the past year has been brought to a halt as a result of weakness in the bond market and a lack of growth of property rents. Total returns from the property investment market for the year to May were 29 per cent, down on April's figure of 29.3 per cent, according to a monthly index published by Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. 'Capital growth due to significant movements in investment yields have temporarily come to an end, yet the anticipated rental growth has not yet started to appear,' according to Richard Ellis. Most participants in the property market expect the setback to property prices to be slight. Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, said the market's cooling was a symptom of balance emerging between numbers of buyers and sellers. 'The froth has blown off the market,' he said. Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, believes that average property yields, the ratio of income to capital, have been stable over the last month at 7.2 per cent. Mr Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker believes they are likely to edge up by one percentage point over the coming month. The principal reason for the slight setback to the commercial property market is the behaviour of the bond market. The movements in bond prices had a heavy influence on property value last year since - in the absence of rental growth - property's long-term, secure income stream tends to be valued like a bond. This year, the link between property and bonds has loosened, as investors have become more optimistic about prospects for rental growth. A few months ago, property yields fell below gilt yields as investors became convinced that rental growth would soon re-emerge. The gap between property and gilts yields is now more than one percentage point. Some investors are nervous about the size of this reverse yield gap until bond yields settle down or there is firm evidence of rental growth. 'There is great uncertainty in the market as to what is happening', in the view of Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs. If gilt yields were to move out to say, 9 per cent, he would expect property values to fall in the short term. Investors' nerves are also being tested by the paucity of evidence of rising rents, except in a few markets such as prime Central London office space. Richard Ellis reports that rents fell in May, after stabilising in previous months. Mr Andrew Walker of Institutional Property Forecasting Services, a subsidiary of Erdman Lewis, has cut its estimate of total returns for this year from 18.3 per cent to 10.7 per cent as a result of downgrading rental forecasts. Properties most affected by the weakness of the bond market are those let at above-market rents and so have the least prospect of rental growth. Agents estimate that around Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m of over-rented property for sale in the City is having difficulty in attracting buyers. However, demand is still strong for certain parts of the market, particularly shopping centres and prime high street shops. Agents believe that several billion pounds of institutional funds are allocated to the property sector. In particular, unit trust managers have raised significant sums to invest in property.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: Peru's twin paths to terror SHINING PATH by Simon Strong HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 274 pages PERU UNDER FIRE Americas Watch Yale Pounds 12.95, 169 pages THOSE who believe that the collapse of the Soviet Union means the end of communism should read Simon Strong's book. A ruthless group of revolutionary communists at this moment threatens the state in Peru. According to Strong, its influence will spread, not only to Peru's neighbours but also to rich countries, where it will fill a vacuum and provide a focus for the disaffected and violently-inclined political left. The group is Sendero Luminoso - Shining Path - or, to give it its full name, 'The Communist Party of Peru by the Shining Path of Carlos Mariategui and Marxism, Leninism, Maoism and the Thoughts of Chairman Gonzalo'. It sounds like a parody, but Shining Path is deadly serious, responsible for thousands of killings in Peru since its campaign of terror began in 1980. It is led by a shadowy former philosophy lecturer, Abimael Guzman, the Chairman Gonzalo of the group's title. Guzman, a disciple of Mariategui, founder of the Peruvian socialist party, sees himself as the torch bearer of the true revolution. He has described Cuba's President Castro as a 'revisionist' and Che Guevara as a 'chorus girl'. Guzman has succeeded in combining revolutionary rhetoric with an appeal to the Andean mythical tradition, in which the white man is believed to live off the Indian's fat and blood. In trying to explain why Shining Path has proved so durable, Strong does not shy away from the conflict's racial roots. To many of Peru's upper class, made up of the 15 per cent of the population that is of European extraction, poverty is seen as the result of a racial flaw. These upper income groups dominate the officer classes of the armed forces; they are deeply alienated from the Indians who populate the zones influenced by Shining Path. The army acts like an occupying rather than a protective force, as terrifying to the peasants as Sendero itself. Indeed, one conclusion from Peru Under Fire, a brave and painstakingly-researched book by Americas Watch, is that the army is as much the problem as the solution. It estimates the repressive policy has killed 23,000 and has displaced 200,000. Sendero is not having it entirely its own way. Peasant self-help groups, the rondas, armed by the government, often are effective against the guerrillas  -but are also often used to settle scores and perpetrate further human rights abuses. According to Strong - who was the Independent's stringer in Lima - evangelical protestants are also a source of frustration for the terrorist: 'The dogmatic belief that they will go to heaven if killed maddens Shining Path.' The growing power of the protestants was demonstrated when they helped President Alberto Fujimori to power in his surprise victory over the the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 presidential elections. Fujimori was to abandon them soon after his victory. The relevance of these books is enhanced rather than lessened by Fujimori's suspension of constitutional order in April, even though both were written before it happened. The president justified his action in part by the supposed extra freedom it allowed for dealing with Shining Path. But giving the army an even freer hand is unlikely to prove a solution and risks further polarisation of society. As Americas Watch concludes: 'It is difficult to be hopeful about Peru. Sendero enjoys a mystique of discipline and cruelty, while the state appears at best a leaky boat, at worst a shipwreck.'</p>

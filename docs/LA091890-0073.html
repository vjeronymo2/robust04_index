			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NO PICTURES, PLEASE: The bitter custody battle between surrogate mother Anna L.  Johnson and the couple who hired her is about to take another unusual turn. . .  . Fearing a flood of paparazzi, the lawyer representing the unborn boy today  will ask an Orange County court to control who takes -- and who profits from --  photographs of the baby. Lawyer Harold LaFlamme says he wants no pictures taken  without court approval and all profits reserved in trust for the child: "I'm  trying to keep this child from becoming a media star along the lines of the  Elephant Man."

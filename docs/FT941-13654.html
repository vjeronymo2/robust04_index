			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Employers' worries 'hamper NVQs' Concern over both the costs and the content of the new competence-based National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications remain reasons for the failure of employers to introduce them into the workplace, according to a survey published today. NVQs and SVQs are intended by the government to be a main plank of its strategy to improve vocational training. But academics have criticised NVQs because the qualifications are based on what people can do, with little examination of what is known or understood about a subject. The survey, carried out by the Institute of Management Studies for the Department of Employment, was the first big assessment of NVQs and SVQs. It estimated that, for the UK as a whole, about 5 per cent of companies were using NVQs and SVQs. The survey found that large companies made greater use of the qualifications than small companies. The institute added: 'While the majority of employers in the survey had heard of NVQs/SVQs, only a relatively small number had started using them.'

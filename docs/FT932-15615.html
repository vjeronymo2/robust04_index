			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: Soothing luxury of the 'real' Bali THERE is a type of travel writer who is always rushing about, harum-scarum, in search of 'reality' - the 'real' France, the 'real' Mexico, the 'real' Indonesian island. As a rule, they distrust and dislike anything remotely modern. So they consult their guidebooks feverishly, leap into their Budget hire-cars and roar off in search of something old or rustic or quaint. Something tucked away. Preferably hard to get to. Understandably forgotten. This they call 'reality.' Occasionally, of course, they do find something interesting. But often - have you noticed? - the sum of their intrepidity is a visit to a temple, or a ruin, or a wood-carving factory. Or a farm that ploughs with horses. Or a little-known museum. Or a dull person's home - 'real' home, 'real' people, sitting at a 'real' kitchen table. On a recent flying visit to Indonesia I was in no danger of discovering the 'real' Bali - if it exists. My flight lasted 24 hours. I was severely jet-smacked. Could barely sleep or eat. By the time I had gathered my wits, my visit was over. But I enjoyed my stay at Bali's Grand Hyatt resort, one of a number of ultra-comfortable, expensively well-equipped and well-planned resort-hotels that Bali now boasts at the top end of its tourist market. And it set me thinking. To the harum-scarum brigade, these resort-hotels have little to do with Bali. They are not 'Balinese.' They are debased and impure. They are interlopers, cuckoos in the Balinese nest. They are bland and unreal - indistinguishable, in fact, from all the other up-market resort-hotels in hot and exotic places everywhere. At best, they offer a bastardized version of the 'real' Bali as it exists beyond the compound gates. But this strikes me as outright snobbery. These resorts are real. They were built in deadly earnest. They are part of one of the most important forces in Bali's history - 20th century tourism. And the version of Bali they offer their well-heeled customers is not just agreeable and soothing, but interesting in its own right. Or so I would maintain. According to a booklet I picked up: 'Over the centuries, Chinese theatre, Indian pageantry, Dutch pomp and Javanese court intrigue have worked their way into the indigenous fibre of the island: the resulting culture is a celebration of life through art and spectacle, ceremony and dance-offerings.' Which is all very well, but is only part of the truth, for the modern-day culture of Bali is predominantly a celebration of - and a hustle for - the tourist dollar. As the booklet admits: 'The concept of Art with a capital 'A' was introduced by Europeans . . . By now, every home on Earth must have at least one Balinese wood carving.' Alongside the tourist Bali, there is agriculture. So if the harum-scarum brigade wanted to write about an alternative Bali that was genuinely distinguishable from its tourism, they would have to interview farmers and write about - wet-rice cultivation. Which could be rather boring. Naturally, a resort like the Bali Grand Hyatt is a place for achievers. You don't just stumble there by accident. Double rooms cost from Dollars 170 (Pounds 120) to Dollars 250 per night. One-bedroom suites cost from Dollars 450 to Dollars 1,200 per night. And two-bedroom suites cost up to Dollars 1,450 per night. There are also two villas, at Dollars 1,750 (two bedrooms) and Dollars 2,000 (three bedrooms) per night. Food is expensive: American breakfast costs Dollars 12.75, and the table d'hote lunch and the table d'hote dinner cost Dollars 48.50 per day. On top of all this you will be hit by a 10 per cent service charge and a government tax of 7.5 per cent. What do you get in return? Well, everything you would expect: six swimming pools, a third of a mile of excellent beachfront, a great many water-sports, 40 acres of landscaped gardens and lagoons, pretty waterfalls, tasteful guestrooms, good food, a fitness and health centre, whirlpools, massage centre, hair and beauty salon, predictably expensive shops, squash courts and floodlit tennis courts, jogging trail, putting and chipping green, a special club for children, a self-contained convention centre, and plenty of treks and tours beyond the compound gates. The Bali Grand Hyatt is large - 750 rooms, organised in a cluster of four 'ethnic' villages - but you never feel crowded, mainly because of the skill of the landscaping and the excellence of the design. The concept is said to be that of a Balinese water-palace reminiscent of the legendary palace of Tirta Gangga, in Karangasem. Works of art - paintings, sculpture, masks, furniture, pottery, textiles, even a transplanted Hindu temple from the village of Bualu - are dotted all about. I especially liked this quote from the resort's management: 'The many ponds and lagoons surrounding the hotel are kept crystal clear by a biological filtering system using fish. The right number and mixture of fish ensure that they not only decorate the lagoons but in turn eat up the algae formed during the natural photosynthesis process.' All cutting-edge stuff. The harum-scarum brigade will probably argue that I am wrong: that there is a 'real' Bali beyond the resort gates that is worth looking into - 'real' people living 'real' lives in ways unchanged since before the end of the last Ice Age, when, says my booklet: 'Bali was 'Land's End' for the Chinese mainland, a sort of prehistoric California for the 'beautiful people' of the earliest migrations from the North.' Don't you believe it. Today, all the 'real' Balinese are lifeguards, cocktail waitresses, gardeners, tennis coaches, taxi-drivers, wood-carvers, hairdressers, room maids, rave-dancers, tattooed beach-boys, PR hustlers and other service-providers. The 'real' Bali is what you find in the landscaped grounds of resorts like the Grand Hyatt. The stuff outside the gates is just local colour. Michael Thompson-Noel was a guest of the Grand Hyatt, Bali, PO Box 53, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, tel: (62)-(361)-71188, fax: (62)-(361)-72038. Nusa Dua is 20 minutes from Denpasar airport. In addition to the room rates quoted above, there is a high-season supplement this year of Dollars 20 per room per night during August and on December 20-31. Internationally, there are 164 Hyatt hotels and resorts, with more under construction. Getting to Bali can be tedious or even health-threatening: try and avoid Garuda, the Indonesia state airline, which operates tiresome magical mystery tours, stopping everywhere you have ever heard of. Check that your airline, travel agent or tour company is selling you the swiftest possible flights. You may have to shout. Hyatt's UK reservations - London: 071-580-8197; non-London: 0345-581666.

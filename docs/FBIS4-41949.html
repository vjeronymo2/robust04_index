			<p>BFN     [Text] As is known, President Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia has  announced that he will not promulgate the citizenship law which  now, according to the Constitution, must be debated again at a  plenary sitting of the Saeima. Today at his residence, Ulmanis  held a news conference at which he explained the reasons for his  decision.    I cannot sign a law that as a result of which Latvia will  clearly be isolating itself, said Ulmanis. Besides, the  president also objects to the fact that no law has yet been  adopted regulating the status of stateless persons and  foreigners. As already reported, international experts'  recommendations do not correspond to Article 14 in the law on  citizenship, which provides an annual naturalization quota of  0.1 percent of the number of Latvian citizens in the previous  year, starting from the year 2000. Many foreign envoys, too,  have tried to convince Latvian politicians that the citizenship  law does not correspond to the requirements adopted in Europe.  Letters about it have been sent by the governments of the  United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France. In Ulmanis'  opinion, the citizenship law cannot be ideal, as it is resolving  the consequences of the occupation of Latvia; however, the  president still favors the law balancing the survival of the  Latvian nation and civic harmony. He also predicted that the  changes to the citizenship law will after all be two contentious  points. Evidently the Saeima's plenary session on it will take  place after the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Latvia.  Ulmanis noted the possibility that the visit could leave a  positive impression for the solution of this issue. At the news  conference Ulmanis also reproached the Latvian Government and  parliament because these institutions had placed the  responsibility on him of settling, in place of these  institutions, important political issues that exceed the duties  of the president provided in the Constitution of the Republic of  Latvia. The Constitution does not provide political  responsibility to the state president for his activity.</p>

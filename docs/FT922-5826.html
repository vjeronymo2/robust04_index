			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Low-tech risks for high finance: The pressures placed on the banking system by difficulties in the commercial property market If you had asked a central banker five years ago to identify the most worrying threats to the banking system, he would probably have talked at length about the accelerating pace of financial innovation and the proliferation of complex new financial instruments that were beyond the capacity of most bankers over the age of 40 to understand. How ironic that the chief threat in the 1990s comes from that most low-tech and comprehensible of assets, commercial property. The collapse of the UK property group Mountleigh, with outstanding debts of more than Pounds  1/2 bn, and now the likelihood of receivership or administration for the UK operations of Olympia and York of Canary Wharf fame, are just the latest in a series of items of bad news for the banks in property. The Canadian-based Olympia and York is admittedly in a category of its own, in view of its size and the complexity of its international financial arrangements. Yet the decision of the banks to retreat into receivership or administration at these two troubled groups demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining support operations where the agreement of numerous creditors is required. At the same time both these concerns have notably obvious things in common with other troubled property companies such as Heron International and Speyhawk, that are the subject of continuing discussions with their bankers, namely the presence of Barclays and Citicorp. For the battle-weary in the City, it is tempting to respond to this latest disaster with a rhetorical question: so what's new? It is now common ground that the commercial banks vetted individual risks in property lending without considering the implications for the whole portfolio of loans. It may seem hard today to grasp how Barclays' outgoing chairman, Sir John Quinton, could have shared responsibility for an unsustainable 35 per cent compound growth in the bank's property loan book in the six years to 1991, far faster than the other clearing banks, given that he had played a central role in running the clearing banks' lifeboat operation in the fringe banking and property crisis of the mid-1970s (see chart). Yet it has to be seen, say the apologists, in the context of the heady climate of the late 1980s. Nor was Barclays out on its own. Citicorp, once the world's biggest bank, operated even more impressively in the boom years as a kind of gigantic corporate centipede. If it shot itself in the foot, it consoled itself with the thought that there were ever so many feet to go. Alas, by last year it was down to four feet and the Bank for International Settlements had decreed that it must have eight to maintain the present volume of lending. Back to the gun room for further inspiration. As for the problems of the property market, the existence of a huge oversupply of space and of the related overhang of Pounds 40bn-plus of bank debt - three times the level, in real terms, of the last crisis in 1974 - has been discussed ad nauseam for two years or more. Why should the banking system suddenly be regarded as subject to an increased threat when its troubles have been so widely predicted? The answer is that some things have changed for the worse and not simply because the British clearing banks have yet to make substantial provisions against a new round of dud property loans. The banks are engaged in a debt work-out, similar to the one they conducted in the second half of the 1970s. Yet the economics of the work-out, in which property companies are nursed along under the best available management until the market turns up and property becomes saleable again at worthwhile prices, are very different this time round. Barclays provides an interesting case study. At the end of 1991 it had property and construction loans of Pounds 8.5bn in Britain and more than Pounds 11bn worldwide, compared with capital of Pounds 9.1bn. That may be modest by the standards of Japanese city banks, many of which have property exposure equivalent to two times their capital. But by any other yardstick it looks high. Sir John Quinton is nonetheless sanguine about his bank's ability to weather the property storm and argues that: at least 70 per cent of the bank's property loans are for completed, income-producing properties where the tenants have no problem in meeting debt service; all the bank's property loans were made at a discount to conservative valuations and many were made before the peak of the boom; a total of Pounds 40bn of bank debt is not large in relation to the property market's estimated overall value of around Pounds 180bn; the risk in the outstanding debt of the larger troubled property companies is widely spread around the whole international banking community, so the individual provisions and write-offs will be less than the size of the corporate collapses might seem to indicate; and when economic recovery restimulates tenant demand, institutional and other investors will readily provide Pounds 10bn of equity to refinance one quarter of the debt overhang. On that basis Barclays expects overall provisions not to exceed those in 1991 and possibly to emerge somewhat lower. And yet these seemingly reassuring points may not be quite as comforting as they appear at first sight. One fundamental difference between today's property collapse and the earlier one in the mid-1970s is the extent of the oversupply, not least in London offices. There is now 32.4m sq ft of empty office space in the capital, equivalent to 18 per cent of the total office stock, according to property advisers Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. Investment Property Databank, a leading independent source of property market intelligence, estimates that central London office rents were plunging in the six months to March at an annualised rate of 32 per cent. Corporate landlords, including Britain's biggest, Land Securities, are increasingly finding that properties are let at rents that exceed today's increasingly depressed market values. The outcome is a radical shift in the balance of power in favour of the tenant. Oversupply, according to Mr Norman Bowie, a doyen of the chartered surveying profession, means that tenants are seeking to use their new bargaining power to win greater flexibility in the terms of leases. The market answer to this demand, says Mr Bowie, is shorter leases or leases with break clauses. In other words, the 25-year lease with upward only rent reviews - an inflationary ratchet if ever there was one - is no longer accepted without demur by tenants. So the lease structure that provided UK property with so much of its attraction as an institutional investment and a form of bank collateral is no longer uniform across the market. The banks' interest cover is thus under threat. Property let at rents above the prevailing market rate may deliver a lower rental income as leases fall in. And the changing pattern of leases may ultimately make the banks' collateral a less attractive asset to the institutional investors which Barclays expects to help refinance the Pounds 40bn debt overhang. In the meantime anecdotal evidence from the chartered surveying fraternity suggests that the valuations on which the banks placed so much faith in the boom are proving to have been far less conservative than the banks thought. Prospects on the revenue side of the work-out equation are thus becoming worse rather than better. And the problem is compounded by a fundamental change in the way the cost side now operates. Back in the mid-1970s, real rates of interest were negative at the most stressful point for property companies. Debt was eroding in real terms and inflation was providing some help for asset values. This time real rates are positive and the debt burden is actually increasing. So heavily indebted property companies are caught in a double bind, with London office rents plunging in nominal terms and the debt servicing burden rolling up remorselessly in real terms. It becomes harder with time to close the shortfall of revenue against income, as compound interest applies its punitive calculus to the figures. In the absence of a spectacular economic recovery to reactivate the property market, this means that things will probably get a great deal worse for the banks before they get better. The work-out will be a far more protracted affair than in the 1970s and the opportunity cost of putting more money into rescues will be higher. And there is still no sign that the insurance companies and pension funds will be ready to take the banks off the hook by rediscovering their appetite for commercial property. While Scandinavian-style bank nationalisations are not in question, there must be some doubt about the ability of the banking system to finance recovery. The problem is the huge degree of leverage in bank balance sheets. At Barclays, capital last year was equivalent to 8.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets, based on the guidelines of the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. That 0.7 per cent surplus over the regulatory floor of 8 per cent is equivalent to Pounds 730m of retained profits. Just to put that in context, Barclays' dividend last year was uncovered and retained profits were negative to the tune of Pounds 96m after making provisions against property and construction in the UK alone of Pounds 245m  -this, before the latest rash of announcements about Olympia &amp; York and the rest. Barclays also wrote off more than Pounds 300m against the value of its own properties to reserves. Looked at from another perspective, Pounds 730m is equivalent to less than 7 per cent of the value of the total property and construction loan book. This implies that the capital safety net contains remarkably little slack. Such figures clearly raise questions about the ability of the banking system to finance an economic recovery, especially now that Japanese banks have been withdrawing from international markets. But provisions and write-offs are a notoriously impressionistic area of accounting; and the figures above assume that other things are equal, which may not be the case. With known losses in the rest of the corporate sector already substantially provided for and huge losses in overseas subsidiaries now running down, the underlying profitability of the clearing banks is potentially much healthier. Yet their capital ratios remain vulnerable to unexpected shocks. And the process of recovery will be slower and more painful than any clearing banker would wish. The British clearers can count themselves luckier than the Japanese city banks in that they have not been hit by a collapsing stock market as well as a collapsing property market. But that does not mean that the latest bout of trouble in property should give the authorities no cause for concern. Tomorrow: how doubtful property loans are causing strains in Japan's financial system.  --------------------------------------------------------------------           BRITISH CLEARING BANKS' UK PROPERTY LENDING  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds m           NatWest       Barclays    Midland     Lloyds  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986                   997        1,197          632     unknown 1987                 1,394        2,140          733     unknown 1988                 1,931        3,195        1,301     unknown 1989                 2,633        4,493        1,859       3,900 1990                 2,813        5,265        1,880       4,300 1991                 2,478        5,397        1,630       4,100 Compound growth   20 per cent  35 per cent  21 per cent  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IBCA  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

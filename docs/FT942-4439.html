			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat production in Australia expected to fall Australian wheat production is expected to fall in 1994-95, because of the lack of rainfall in major growing areas, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Australian Wheat Forecasters estimated yesterday that output in 1994-95 would reach about 16.7m tonnes, compared with 17.52m tonnes in the previous season. Sowing has progressed slowly because of the conditions, with no wheat growing areas being sown early, and only some areas in Western Australia being sown in sufficient time to allow for a long growing season. The lack of rainfall has been particularly severe in parts of Queensland.</p>

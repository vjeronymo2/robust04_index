			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: Tormented poet - Goethe's view of Torquato Tasso / As the Edinburgh Festival gets into its stride, our critics review mainstream opera, theatre and ballet The poet Tasso's last years were clouded by his delusion that the sister of the Duke of Ferrara, an unimpeachably respectable lady who recoiled at the very idea, returned his passion. Confinement as a lunatic resulted. A regret for lost innocence and nostalgia for some distant golden age can be discerned in his greatest works, the pastoral play Aminta and the epic Gerusalemme Liberata - crassly characterised in the Royal Lyceum programme notes to Goethe's Torquato Tasso as 'old-fashioned and unattractive', words perhaps more suitable to Robert David MacDonald's translation of Goethe's play. A more modestly-resourced production some four years ago by a fringe touring company was rather a lively affair. Now a sumptuous-looking performance directed by MacDonald himself continues the Edinburgh Festival's official theatre programme; but the Lyceum's offering is no jollier than the turgid Seven Streams at Meadowbank. Despite a combination of talent and an unhappy life, Tasso is not really romantic hero material. Inward-looking, self-destructive, chronically unable to deal with relationships, he seems to have given Goethe cause for reflection during the writing of the play: the author identifies with the pragmatic statesman whom Tasso sees as an enemy as much as with the fraught artist. The old joke, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean people aren't against you, rang true in Renaissance Italy, heaven knows, but Tasso is too confused - dare one say silly? - for a tragic protagonist. His genius for alienating his most loyal supporters irresistibly recalls the famous description of the destitute Mrs Patrick Campbell as a sinking ship firing on her rescuers. The image lingers, thanks to this version's updating to the 1920s. The girls bounce in looking like Erte fashion plates. The Duke is dapper in spats. And here one feels the same reservations as in Jonathan Miller's modernisation of a neighbouring ducal court in the ENO Rigoletto: the power of life and death, political absolutism, the authority of the state - none of them ring true when the boss is simply a 20th-century playboy. The modernisation belittles the tragedy. Julian McGowan's set is handsome: black railings, white columns, a high gallery overlooking the stage. If you expect the company to burst into Coward you are soon undeceived. The piece is static, much of the opening a discussion on the nature of poetry. It might work better as a radio conversation piece. The translation's unremitting pentameters and unremarkable vocabulary, with no sense of character to distinguish most of the dramatis personae, cast a somnolent spell. The production boasts a sizeable input from the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, so its emergence as worthy, well-acted and dull is surprising given the Citz' speciality in the louche, the coarsely-acted and the entertaining. The play's emotional and philosophical opposites, perhaps also those of Goethe's own character, are finely embodied. As the bureaucrat perceived by Tasso to be maliciously engineering his downfall, the morning-suited Mark Lewis combines visual elements of Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden and Oswald Moseley. The aloofness and chill superiority easily explain Tasso's fears, while hinting at the practicalities of power in the hands of the well-meaning - the archetypal politician wearily fending off fanatics and idealists; Creon in Antigone, say. As Tasso, Henry Ian Cusick paints a marvellous picture of hysterical insecurity combined with real charm and presumed talent. One can understand why the court put up with its troublesome pet poet. I suppose the Duke's contemporaries considered artistic status symbols important; and the uppity ones were cut down to size by the contempt (a nice touch in this production) of the silent footmen whose disdain one has seen in countless commissionaires, doormen and head waiters.</p>

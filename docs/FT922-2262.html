			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Big stride away from megadeath: Assessing the US-Russian nuclear arms pact EVERY time a major nuclear arms control agreement is reached, it tends to be described as a 'landmark' in the history of disarmament. That was so in July last year when US President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced in London that, after nearly 10 years of tough negotiations, they had agreed on substantial cuts in their strategic arsenals. But, if the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) was important as the first-ever agreement to reduce, rather than just limit strategic weapons, it is a pale version of the accord to which Mr Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin put their signature in Washington on Tuesday. Under Start (yet to be ratified) each country was due to cut the number of strategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal by about 30 per cent. The US was to have reduced its number of nuclear warheads and bombs from 12,000 to about 9,000; the Soviet Union undertook to cut its nuclear warheads from 11,000 to 7,000. The latest agreement, however, goes much further than that. It provides for reductions, in two stages, to less than half the Start totals. By the year 2003, each country will be left with only 3,000 to 3,500 - a reduction of some two-thirds in present arsenals. However, Russia, already finding it difficult to meet its commitments under the Start treaty to destroy nuclear weapons, will require much more US help to achieve the new targets. Mr Yeltsin, probably with an eye on the quid pro quo he hopes to obtain from the US and other western countries in the form of economic aid, made very substantial concessions which were opposed by Russia's military establishment. The agreement provides for the scrapping of all heavy land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, notably more than 300 of Russia's SS-18 multiple-headed missiles, which the US has always considered as the most dangerous and most destabilising strategic weapon. Russia's agreement to the elimination of those weapons, in which it had a clear advantage over the US, has been matched only in part by Washington's concession in the main area of overriding US superiority, that of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Yet the compromise on a matter on which the US had adopted a remarkably rigid position, was by no means insignificant. The number of nuclear warheads on US submarines will be reduced to 1,750 - a cut of 50 per cent on the limits laid down in Start. As both Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin emphasised, the fact that an armed conflict between the two countries is now considered inconceivable made agreement much easier. The prohibitive cost of large nuclear arsenals, particularly for a country in such dire economic straits as Russia, also contributed to a rapid accord. 'We cannot afford it,' the Russian leader said bluntly. 'Therefore we must have a minimum security level.' The unanswered question, however, is what that minimum level is. Why did Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin stop at 3,000 to 3,500 nuclear warheads each, more than enough to destroy their countries and populations several times over? Even if it is accepted that nuclear deterrence has proved its worth by giving the world nearly 50 years of peace, most experts believe that the same result could be achieved at a much lower level of nuclear weapons than those just agreed. The other side of the coin is that the US and Russia are not concerned only with each other's nuclear forces. They have to plan for crises in which other nuclear powers - such as China, India and Israel - might be involved. The US-Russian agreement also again raises the question of when other nuclear powers - such as Britain, France and China - should join negotiations on the reduction of nuclear weapons. The UK and France have refused to say exactly when that might be, stating merely that their forces are still insignificant compared to those of the US and Russia, even after the latest reductions. However, the new US-Soviet agreement will put added pressure on Britain and France to follow suit in the field of strategic weapons.</p>

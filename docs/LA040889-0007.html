			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES  </P> <P> Regarding the increases in wholesale gasoline prices charged by the oil  companies as a direct result of the Alaskan oil spill, I am impressed with how  quickly these companies can now respond to fluctuations in the marketplace:  mere days!  </P> <P> Why, just three years ago, when crude oil dropped below $10 a barrel, it took  up to six months before those suddenly lowered costs were passed on to  consumers. At that time, the oil companies stated that this delay was due to  gasoline prices being dependent on outstanding contracts that were based on  older higher oil prices.  </P> <P> My hearty congratulations to these companies for increasing their efficiency so  as to ensure that consumers are paying pump prices that accurately reflect the  fair-market price of oil in effect at that time. I'll be looking forward to  instantaneous drops in gasoline prices once oil tankers can resume shipments  from Alaska.  </P> <P> TIM WARREN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

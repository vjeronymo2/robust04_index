			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Aircraft group to receive Dollars 280m THE ISRAELI government has agreed to provide a Dollars 280m (Pounds 185m) restructuring package to Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest company, in the latest move by the state to bolster its struggling defence sector. IAI, which says it will report a loss for 1992 of between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m, will use the package to pay for the dismissal of 1,500 of its 17,400 workers and to invest in a new generation of civilian products in an attempt further to decrease its traditional reliance on defence markets. The defence sector, hit hard in recent years by declining world markets for military equipment, has become one of the biggest burdens on the Labour-led government as it tries to reduce the state's involvement in industry. In December, the government pumped more than Dollars 280m into Israel Military Industries to back a recovery plan which will cost 2,500 jobs out of its 7,500-strong workforce. That followed an earlier injection of Dollars 100m in state funds for IMI. IAI said it had been hit by a Dollars 100m shortfall in expected sales in 1992 - ironically, mainly because of the recession in the civilian aircraft sector in Europe and the US. Under the terms of the government package, it will receive Dollars 50m in cash, will convert a Dollars 30m state loan into cash and equity capital and will receive Dollars 200m in state loan guarantees. It will get a further Dollars 3m in research and development grants. The company said it expected to break even in 1993 on sales of Dollars 1.5bn and planned to return to profits in 1994.</p>

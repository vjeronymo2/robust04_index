			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: McNamara calls for aid to be linked to cuts in arms spending AID TO developing countries should be made conditional on their reducing military spending, Mr Robert McNamara, former head of the World Bank, said yesterday. In a wide-ranging speech on the consequences of the end of the Cold War on military spending, Mr McNamara strongly urged the linking of financial assistance to movement 'toward optimal levels of military expenditures'. These optimal levels should take into account any external threat being faced by a country. When decisions concerning allocations of foreign aid were made, 'special consideration should be given to countries spending less than 2 per cent of their gross national product in the security sector'. Speaking at a World Bank annual conference on development economics in Washington, he said that the huge savings thus made could be used to address pressing economic and social needs. 'I am conscious that application of such conditionality will be difficult and contentious,' said Mr McNamara, a former US defence secretary. 'Nevertheless, it is, I believe, an essential part of the solution to the waste represented by excessive military spending in poor countries.' Military spending in the Third World totalled Dollars 170bn a year, 4.3 per cent of aggregate gross national product. If that were to be reduced by half over the next decade, it would free up savings equivalent to half current Third World spending on health and education and more than twice the amount of development assistance received from industrialised countries and multilateral financial institutions, he said. By comparison, the US spent 6 per cent of GNP on the military. This proportion could be reduced by half within six to eight years, at a saving of Dollars 150bn a year in 1989 dollars, Mr McNamara said. Between 1978 and 1988, the Third World imported Dollars 371bn of arms, three-quarters of the arms traded internationally. Mr McNamara linked a reduction of demand for arms in the Third World to a system of collective security - guarantees by the United Nations Security Council and regional organisations of territorial integrity. Governments producing arms should also sharply reduce the availability of finance for arms. He noted that some countries spent a lot on security for internal rather than external reasons.</p>

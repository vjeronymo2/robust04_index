			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Bian Hongwei: "Market </F> Takes State Firms on Roller Coaster Ride"]    [Text] Domestic enterprises are mushrooming throughout  China, driven by double-digit economic growth during the past  two years.    But many inefficient enterprises have been forced out of  operation by the heat of market competition, according to the  State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).    By the end of 1993, the total number of domestic enterprises  had reached 7.3 million, up by 25.2 per cent from the previous  year.    It's purely the survival of the fittest. Some 341,000 firms  went under last year, an increase of 32.2 percent over 1992, a  SAIC report says.    Undoubtedly, the strong economy has formed the fundamental  impetus for the growing number of new domestic enterprises.    The SAIC's drive to simplify startup procedures for new  firms, launched at the end of 1990, has also contributed to the  increase, said Liu Junchen, in charge of enterprise registration  under the SAIC.    To date, all provincial-level local branches of the  administration have been authorized to register local  enterprises.    However, those involving the pillar industries or concerning  the nation's long-term interests such as military, cigarette  production and transportation, still must wait for green lights  from SAIC to open their own businesses, Liu added.    The increase of new firms in 1993, whether State-owned or  privately-funded, is also eye-catching. An astonishing 113.3  per cent increase over the previous year created 552,000 new  companies.    Economic reform in the past decade led to a flexible system  for free flowing property rights. This is vital to break  through the rigid criteria defining enterprises according to  their ownership. That is to say, State-owned, collective-run, or  privately-funded ones, Liu said.    The central government has started about 100 large and  medium- sized State enterprises as pilots for their shareholding  reforms. At the same time, local Governments selected pilot  projects in their own areas. State, collective and individual  businesses enjoy the same rights if they hold the same number of  shares in the pilot firm.    In line with this trend, experts say it is better to use the  term "State economy" rather than State-owned enterprises,  leaving market forces to determine the fate of State or  privately-funded businesses.    Recently, private businesses experienced marked growth.  Furthermore, the recent National People's Congress session has  also underlined the importance of a buoyant private sector.    Traditionally, the country carried out a pyramidal approval  system for registering enterprises with the State Council and  NPC at the top.    Under the rigid rubber-stamp system, it was very hard to  open  a new firm. And even when government finally approved a  business, many found it difficult to survive, let alone make a  profit, because they could not get their products to market  quick enough. When this happened, it was the responsibility of  the government to make up the economic losses.    Fortunately, it realized the problem and decentralized power  for registering enterprises to local branches.    With the simplified procedure, it is much easier to access  the market economy. This will lift the economy in the long run,  said Liu.    Many firms are borrowing money when they apply for  registration to look like "fat cat."    Ironically, once they finish registration, the enterprises  immediately return the money they have borrowed, leaving a  nearly empty bank account to run the business.    To reverse the situation, the SAIC decided to set up a  nationwide supervision system to carry out random checks on  firms' registered capital to guarantee the money is being used  in the operation of the firms, the SAIC official said.    Liu said the market system had played an important role  through wielding its "invisible hand," causing many firms to go  belly up last year.    Since all enterprises are equal in market competition, only  fit firms can survive.    Without financial support, many unprofitable State  enterprises find it difficult to make ends meet.    And those who failed to transfer their management mechanism  in time have to face the music--bankruptcy or be taken-over by a  more efficient business.    Both the government and enterprises in red usually choose  the  latter, said Liu, as it is easier to continue using facilities  of merged firms and to settle down employees of the once  money-loosing industries.    As the central government took measures last year to  safeguard sustained, healthy and speedy economic growth, many  financial businesses with poor management were ordered to close.    With the intensified anti-corruption campaign, many  enterprises run by the government were ferreted out and ordered  to stop their operation.    To ensure a healthy real estate market, the central  government checked businesses within the sector and closed those  deemed to be substandard.    Futures markets are another important aspect that the  central  government decided to reign in.    To achieve its goal, the central government campaigned at  the  end of last year to get businesses involved in futures markets  for reregistration. Those who failed to observe the rules were  ordered to stop operation.    Recently, the government announced that no new businesses on  the futures market would be registered this year, so as to focus  their work on rectifying the order of the present futures market.</p>

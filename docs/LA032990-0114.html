			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4TH-QUARTER GNP REVISED UPWARD TO 1.1% ANNUAL RATE  </P> <P> The economy grew at a 1.1% annual rate in the final three months of 1989,  better than the 0.9% rate estimated a month ago but still the weakest quarterly  performance in more than three years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.  </P> <P> In its second and final revision of fourth-quarter gross national product, or  GNP, the department said consumer spending was slightly higher than earlier  estimated and the buildup in stocks of unsold goods was less than previously  reported.  </P> <P> But the fourth-quarter rate of growth was the weakest GNP expansion since the  third quarter of 1986, when the economy expanded at a weak 0.8% annual rate.  </P> <P> The department said corporate profits after taxes, which had fallen in each of  the three preceding quarters, rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  $156.7 billion in the final three months of 1989 from $152.4 billion in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> But corporate profits for the full year fell 4.7% to $160.9 billion after  taxes, from the 1988 total of $168.9 billion. In 1988, after-tax profits had  risen 18.9%.  </P> <P> Economists had expected GNP would be unrevised at a seasonally adjusted 0.9%  rate. The preliminary estimate of economic growth for the fourth quarter, made  in January, showed only a 0.5% rate of expansion. But that figure was revised  upward in February to 0.9% before Wednesday's final 1.1% figure.  </P> <P> For the full year 1989, total goods and services output increased at an  inflation-adjusted rate of 3.0%, compared to 4.4% in 1988 and 3.7% in 1987. It  was the weakest annual growth rate since 1986, when the economy grew by only  2.7%.  </P> <P> The increase in the implicit price deflator, a broad gauge of inflation that  measures price changes on a basket of goods and services, rose 3.2% in the  fourth quarter, the same as previously estimated and the same as in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> The economy slowed sharply late in 1989 as the industrial sector slumped under  the impact of weak auto sales and a softening of new orders.  </P> <P> Most forecasts for 1990 anticipate sluggish economic growth in the first half  of the year, with the rate of activity picking up in the final six months. In a  joint report to Congress published this week, the Treasury Department and the  U.S. trade representative's office predicted real GNP expansion of 2.4% in 1990  and 3.2% in 1991.  </P> <P> But weaker corporate profits are a worrisome sign of economic stress for  policy-makers, because they can adversely affect business spending and  investment decisions.  </P> <P> The rate of consumer price increases slowed to 0.5% in February from an  exceptionally high 1.1% in January but remains high enough that the Fed has  given no indication it intends to loosen its restraining grip on interest  rates.  </P> <P> In a sign of slower economic growth, the department said business investment  during the fourth quarter last year fell at a 5.4% rate compared to an increase  of 5.2% in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of demand for the  economy's goods and services, rose by a slim 0.5% in the fourth quarter after  expanding by 5.6% in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The department said personal consumption spending rose $3.6 billion in the  final three months last year, a revision upward from the $2.5-billion gain  estimated previously, but down from a $36.4-billion increase in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> The department said real spending on long-lasting durable goods decreased by  $16.1 billion in the quarter after rising by $11.5 billion in the third  quarter, mainly because of reduced motor vehicle sales at the end of 1989.  </P> <P> Non-durable goods purchases increased by $300 million after a rise of $11.1  billion in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The department said business inventories during the fourth quarter grew by  $22.2 billion, down from $26.2 billion estimated a month ago but up from $21.9  billion in the third quarter last year.  </P> <P> GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT  </P> <P> Percent change from previous quarter at annual rate  </P> <P> 4th Quarter (revised): $4.17 trillion annual rate, up 1.1%  </P></p>

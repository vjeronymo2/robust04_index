			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MOORPARK'S DOW SETTLES FOR 1-HITTER IN 7-0 WIN  </P> <P> De Dow couldn't have gotten much closer to perfection Friday.  </P> <P> With two out in the seventh inning, Valley College's Julie Knoop beat out an  infield single, spoiling Dow's bid for her first perfect game of the season.  Dow (23-7), who has pitched two no-hitters this year, pitched two perfect games  last season.  </P> <P> Despite the hit, there was no further damage, however, and Moorpark cruised to  an easy 7-0 Western State Conference softball win in its last home game of the  season.  </P> <P> The victory boosted the Lady Raiders' home win streak against conference  opponents to 41 games and ensured them of at least a share of the conference  title. In addition, Moorpark (31-10, 12-1) broke the previous school record for  wins in a season.  </P> <P> Rusty Stevens hit a two-run home run, walked twice, was hit by a pitch and  scored three times. Mary Cress had three hits, drove in a run and scored twice.  </P> <P> Kelly Kauffman and Rosa Jimenez each added a run batted in.  </P> <P> In another WSC softball game:  </P> <P> College of the Canyons 10, Cuesta 1 -- Freshman right-hander Michelle Ruffner  pitched a two-hitter, and Jill Greenwood and Michele Wood each hit two-run  triples for the Lady Cougars at Canyons. Debbie Rendall had three hits and one  RBI for Canyons, which has won four in a row.  </P> <P> Ruffner walked one and improved to 25-13. With one game remaining, second-place  Canyons (25-14, 11-2) trails Moorpark by a game.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 1-1, Canyons scored eight times in the fourth on triples  by Greenwood and Wood.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Cal Baptist 9, The Master's 2 -- Mustang starter John March allowed six runs in  four innings and took the loss in the NAIA District 3 game at Cal Baptist.  </P> <P> March also gave up three home runs before Ray Cartagena relieved him in the  fifth. Darren Beck tripled and doubled for Master's.  </P></p>

The prime minister believes that China can play an important  role in opening up Siberia and the Far East. The possibility of  Russia participating in the reconstruction and modernization of  industrial enterprises built with the help of the USSR in the  1950's was discussed, along with the building of the "three  gorge" hydroscheme power installations. The sides agreed to  lift obstacles hindering joint enterprise, investment  cooperation, and other forms of direct partnership. [passage  omitted]    The exchange of views during the talks and meetings with the  Chinese leadership on the main issues in the world showed that  the views of China and Russia on the main international issues  coincide, or are close, the Russian prime minister said.  Constructive inter- relations in regional and world affairs, he  said, are an important factor for stability and security in Asia  and general improvement of the situation in the world as a whole.</p>

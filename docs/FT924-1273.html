			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery after stock clearance Wall Street IN SPITE of more bad corporate news, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday after the big sell-off during the previous day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.05 at 3,269.23, resting at its high for the day thanks to a late surge of buying. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 3.91 ahead at 435.43, the American SE composite improved 1.12 to 390.42 and the Nasdaq composite rose 8.83 to 658.46. Turnover on the New York SE came to 250m shares and rises outnumbered declines by a ratio of almost two-to-one. The near 30-point decline in the Dow on Wednesday was seen by analysts as a welcome, and possibly final, clear-out of stocks before the end of the year. Consequently, prices were expected to begin climbing back up again yesterday, which they did in spite of unfavourable economic and corporate news. The economic news was mixed: the Labor Department reported a 22,000 rise in weekly jobless claims, reversing the recent improving trend in the labour market, and the Commerce Department announced a narrowing in the October trade deficit from the previous month's Dollars 8.6bn to Dollars 7.0bn. The most promising aspect of the trade figures was a sharp rise in exports, although analysts cautioned that exports will continue to be held back by the slump in the European and Japanese economies. On the corporate front, the opening of trading in Minnesota Manufacturing and Mining, known as 3M, was delayed after broking house Prudential Securities lowered its 1992 earnings estimate for 3M from Dollars 5.70 a share to Dollars 5.60 because of the slowdown in the company's overseas markets. When trading started, 3M's shares dropped more than Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 99, but later recovered to end Dollars 2 1/8 down at Dollars 100 1/2 in active trading after the company said it backed Prudential's new forecast. Two days of heavy selling in IBM ended. The stock recovered Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 in turnover of almost 6m shares as bargain hunters helped IBM recover from losses linked to Tuesday's announced restructuring. Storage Technology declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 20 3/4 in turnover of 1.6m shares after warning that fourth-quarter earnings would come in below analysts' estimates. Procter &amp; Gamble rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 on news of its pact with a Bombay-based company to sell detergents, soaps and other consumer products in India. Canada TORONTO stocks extended Wednesday's gains in further heavy trading as the big Canadian banks lowered their prime lending rates for the third time this week. The TSE 300 index added 8.2 at 3,304.3 and advancing issues led declines by 356 to 321. Volume amounted to 44.7m shares valued at Cdollars 375.7m.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Observer: Royal reception Mohammed Ben Madani, editor of the Maghreb Review, is not best pleased with the Moroccan authorities. Returning to his native land on January 3 to see his ailing mother, after 25 years' self-imposed exile in London, Ben Madani was subjected to a less than rapturous welcome. To whit, he was detained at the pleasure of the Casablancan police for four long days. He was not allowed to contact a lawyer, nor were his family informed of his whereabouts. Nor, although interrogated at length about every period of his past life, was he offered any explanation. 'They hinted it was something to do with a broadcast I made on the BBC World Service, about Moroccan foreign policy and the nomination of a Moroccan ambassador to Algiers,' he said yesterday, safe home in Bloomsbury. 'It was part of a series by Patrick Keatley on the importance of monarchs.' Sharing with six other people a cell just three metres square (and making do on a loaf of bread a day between four), he was eventually released without charge, and still without explanation. Morocco's ambassador in London, Khalil Haddaoui, is investigating.</p>

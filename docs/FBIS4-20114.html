			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "For a Social Europe"] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday [27 April] the Federal Executive  Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (OeGB) decided  to recommend to the working people, "while fully respecting  other opinions," to vote affirmatively on Austria's accession to  the European Union [EU] in the 12 June referendum.    "After concluding a long process of deliberation and after  all the results of the negotiations have been presented, the  OeGB is convinced that Austria's accession to the EU is to be  assessed positively after weighing all prospects and risks," a  resolution entitled "Austria as a Business Location -- Europe as  a Business Location," which was adopted by the Federal Executive  committee, says.    The OeGB sees "the participation in the referendum and the  yes to the EU as a first step toward participating in the  shaping of Europe's future and, at the same time, toward  consolidating and expanding Austria as a business location. And  it sees it as a chance for a peaceful, democratic, and social  Europe, a Europe of the working people, which has the goal of  work and prosperity for all."    "Austria's trade unions are committed to a democratic,  peaceful, and social Europe. Our goal is work for all,  coexistence in peace and democratic freedom. This is the basic  premise of the answer to the question whether the Austrian  people are to decide for or against accession to the EU," the  OeGB states in its resolution.    The OeGB calls on the Austrian Government to play an active  role in shaping the "social area of Europe." This involves  jointly raising social standards, a common active employment  policy, more intensive efforts in the field of basic and  advanced training, and the active role of the EU in the fields  of environmental and consumer policy, as well as solidarity with  the weaker groups inside and outside the EU.    In its resolution the OeGB points to the economic advantages  of EU membership, but, at the same time, stresses that a purely  economic point of view is not enough. "Our goal must also be  the establishment of a social Europe. Only if the concerns of  the working people are taken into account and social framework  conditions are developed accordingly, can the single market have  a beneficial effect for all strata of the population."    Important concerns of the OeGB, such as safeguarding  neutrality, preserving our social standards, or maintaining the  ecological goals of the Transit Treaty, have been successfully  pushed through in the membership negotiations. The government  and the political parties now have the task of implementing  accompanying measures so as to make sure that the problems  arising from accession to the EU for the economic sectors and  the regions as well as for the working people employed there can  be overcome.    The OeGB expects the Austrian Government to tackle labor's  problems quickly and effectively. For this purpose labor  foundations and other active employment measures are to be  implemented as a priority measure. The financial means  necessary for this purpose must also be ensureds. Furthermore,  the OeGB expects that social standards will not be reduced with  the justification of increasing competitiveness. In addition,  the OeGB calls for a more effective struggle against illegal  employment. OeGB President Fritz Verzetnitsch sees the  recommendation to vote "yes" in the EU referendum not as  patronizing but as an aid for orientation.</p>

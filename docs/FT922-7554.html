			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / HK Bank may sweeten Midland bid HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation is working on plans to improve the terms of its takeover offer for Midland Bank by providing Midland's shareholders with cash rather than bonds. It is understood HSBC is at an advanced stage of talks with leading US investment banks which would involve those banks buying the new bonds and then placing them with their investment clients. The funds raised could then be distributed to Midland's shareholders, many of whom have complained to Hongkong Bank that they want cash in place of the bonds. Hongkong Bank's bid terms are one new share and 100p of new bonds for each Midland share. If the bid goes through, it would issue Pounds 703m of the new bonds. Although Midland shareholders do not want the bonds, US investment banks believe investment institutions on the Continent and the US would buy them. Meanwhile, it emerged that Hongkong Bank has formulated a 'nuclear option' to prevent Midland being bought by Lloyds Bank, which also says it wants to buy the UK clearing bank. If Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, became convinced Midland's shareholders were prepared to sit out a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of Lloyds' proposed takeover before deciding whether to accept his bid or Lloyds' terms, he could announce that Hongkong Bank would never sell its 15 per cent stake in Midland. Lloyds would then never be able to buy more than 90 per cent of Midland's shares and would not achieve complete integration of its operations with Midland. It needs at least 90 per cent to meld the two businesses completely. In those circumstances, Mr Purves believes Midland's shareholders would be under intense pressure to back his takeover, bankers with a close knowledge of his intentions say. The next 10 days will be crucial to the battle for Midland between Hongkong Bank and Lloyds. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, is expected to follow the advice of the Office of Fair Trading that the Lloyds bid should be referred to the MMC, but not that of Hongkong Bank. Lloyds would then have to decide whether to drop its pre-condition not to bid if there is an MMC investigation.</p>

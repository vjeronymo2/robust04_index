			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 10 May.    The Mexican mining industry has suffered a 12 percent drop  in  production over the past four years, according to the Trade  Union of Miners. The union also reported that 30,000 workers  have been laid off during this period. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 4 May 94)    The price of domestic raw materials rose 3.1 percent in the  first quarter of 1994, according to an EL FINANCIERO study based  on figures from the Bank of Mexico. The newspaper's analysts  point out that this rate of inflation was below the inflation  rate recorded by raw materials on the international market,  which rose 8.6 percent in the same period. Nevertheless, the  study points out that in 1990-93, Mexican consumer prices rose  annually at 26.7, 22.7, 15.5, and 9.8 percent, while domestic  raw materials rose only 23.6, 8.3, 5.7, and 1.7 percent,  respectively. The difference lies in the price of imported  materials, which are usually higher. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 5 May 94 p 3A)    Higher inflation and less economic growth are now the  government's projections for 1994. Following the murder of  presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the events  surrounding the investigation and the election process, the  government has adjusted the targets in its economic plan. Now,  inflation is expected to reach 7-8 percent, and GNP growth has  been revised downward and is expected to range between 1.5 and 2  percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 May 94 p 24)    Unemployment in the 37 largest metropolitan areas rose to  3.8  percent in January, the highest January figure since 1992 and  the third highest within the past 24 months. The National  Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information (INEGI)  reported that 1.286 million people are out of work. Some  180,000 of these people are teens and young adults with no  previous job experience, who were forced into the labor market  and have not yet found work. INEGI monitors this figure on a  weekly basis. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 5 May 94 pp  60, 48)    An EL FINANCIERO study based on INEGI statistics indicates  that the number of new jobs offered during the first quarter of  1994 showed a negligible increase of 0.1 percent. Only 11,000  new jobs were made available, which means that the government  will reach its goal of 500,000 new jobs a year over a four-year  period. The report concludes by saying the private sector has  reported layoffs and closures in most major areas of production,  which in turn makes it poor source of new jobs. (Mexico City EL  FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 3A)    The Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce  (Concanaco) has reported that the private sector's contribution  to the nation's GNP dropped 1.2 percent in 1993. This is the  largest fall since 1986. According to a Concanaco study, this  had a negative effect on jobs and sales. The report projects,  however, that there will be some recovery during the first  quarter of 1994, although this recovery will be modest. (Mexico  City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 28)    The Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic  Resources (SARH) has reported that the agricultural trade  deficit declined 84 percent in 1993 from the previous year.  SARH noted that the 1992 trade deficit topped $761.47 million,  while in 1993 the deficit reached $121.45 million. The report  added that Mexico basically continues to sell raw coffee, fresh  vegetables, and fruit, except for cantaloupe and watermelon, and  is still purchasing soybeans, sorghum, and wheat. (Mexico City  LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 p 57)    It has been reported that 68 of the 213 nonfinancial  business  enterprises on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) registered net  losses during the first three months of 1994. On the other  hand, 79 consortiums reported their profits dropped by 23.2  percent, while 66 enterprises registered increases. (Mexico  City LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 pp 72, 58)    The depreciation of the peso and the increase in interest  rates, particularly 28-day Treasury Notes, have prompted  financial middlemen to record losses in their net earnings in  the first three months of the year. At least eight trading  companies reported losses, 10 percent of the customers from 154  investment societies withdrew, and more than eight banks  reported heavy losses. In addition, 60 companies in the BMV  registered exchange losses worth more than 4.352 billion new  pesos. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 6)    In view of the increasing debts of corporations and  individuals, less financing from national banks, and the  uncertainty prevailing in the economy with regard to the lack of  growth, consumer prices continued to drop in the first three  months of the year. According to reports from 17 businesses  working with the BMV, their net sales amounted to 12.343 billion  new pesos from January to March 1994. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 9 May 94 p 3A)    The federal and state governments have invested  approximately  179 million new pesos in Chiapas State to be used in emergency  programs in the areas of electrification, potable water works,  and productive programs. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9  May 94 p 3)    Juan Ramon Jimenez, an economist from the Technological  Institute of Monterrey who is conducting a study on the  concentration of wealth, has concluded that 60 percent of the  revenue generated in the country is being earned by 10 percent  of the population, while 10 percent of the overall annual income  is being distributed among 60 percent of the population.  Jimenez says this "gap between the rich and poor" is the result  of the fact the Mexican economy is highly monopolized. For  example, the value of the shares owned by eight companies in the  BMV is equivalent to one-fourth of the GDP. (Mexico City LA  JORNADA in Spanish 9 May 94 p 48)    On 9 May, the Bank of Mexico reported that Mexico registered  an inflation rate of 0.5 percent during April, and that the  annual inflation rate so far this year amounts to 2.31 percent,  which is lower than the inflation rate for the same period in  1993, which amounted to 3.27 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish  0045 GMT 10 May 94)    Given the weakness in the world fuel market, which has been  generated by an excessive supply of petroleum products and the  fall in international prices, Mexican petroleum exports declined  at an annual rate of 16.6 percent in the first two months of  1994. Overseas sales of crude, its by-products, and  petrochemical products totaled $986.6 million in the first two  months of the year. This represents 19.5 percent of the  nation's total exports, without taking into account assembly  plant exports in this same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 2 May 94 p 3A)    During the first two months of the year, Mexican public  sector exports, without taking into account assembly plants,  only grew 11.9 percent over the same period last year when they  registered a growth rate of 21.5 percent. Nevertheless, the  exports by the Mexican private sector in this same period grew  21.5 percent. Sales to various international markets totaled  $5.58 billion, of which $3.70 billion was for semi-finished  goods, $1.502 billion for consumer goods, and $484.8 million for  capital goods. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p  21)    A Bank of Mexico report indicates that the nation's current  accounts deficit has grown more than 700 percent during this  administration. According to the report, the trade exchange of  merchandise was one of the factors that influenced the increase  the most, with imports outpacing exports. The current accounts  balance in tourism registered a $605.2 million surplus, while  revenues from travelers totalled $6.167 billion. (Mexico City  UNOMASUNO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 16)    Factors affecting administration, customs, handling, and  dredging work, as well as the increase in maritime traffic in  local waters and a lack of infrastructure for port facilities,  have resulted in a decrease in services to foreign trade since  the implementation of NAFTA. Moreover, extended delays for  ships in Mexican ports have created huge increases in operating  costs, which are estimated to run as much as $5,000 a day for a  ship in port. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p  24)    A Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development study  indicates that Mexican sales to the United States increased 22.6  percent over the first two months of the year "as a result of  the implementation of NAFTA." The study also notes that the  Mexican farming sector has a dynamic role in exports to the  United States in terms of peeled citrus, dried melons, prepared  potatoes, prepared tomatoes, dehydrated onions, nuts, canned  vegetables and fruits, melons, watermelons, papayas, and  sunflower seeds.

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Thank you for "Special Report: The Quality of L.A. Life," by Kevin Roderick and  Stephen Braun (April 2). It's time Angelenos stopped patting themselves on the  back for all of the city's recent "progress" and acknowledged what a truly  miserable place this is to live. You did, however, omit the single most  annoying factor in L.A. life: The attitude, apparently shared by most Los  Angeles residents, that "My time is more important than yours." Witness drivers  cutting each other off on the freeway; people cutting in line at restaurants,  grocery stores and movie theaters; drivers endangering the lives of pedestrians  by speeding through yellow and red traffic lights -- and my personal favorite,  the car horn. Los Angeles drivers have a belief bordering on the mystic that  honking their horns will make everything better.  </P> <P> After enduring L.A.'s constant assault on my senses for three years, I am  returning to San Diego. My message to L.A. residents who have also considered  this move, however, is: "Don't do it. Stay here."  </P> <P> LESLIE A. HATTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

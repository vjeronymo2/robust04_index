Iran's  Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi told journalists in Tehran  today that his country originally should have paid 3 billion  German marks [DM] by 21 March. During his visit to Bonn this  week, agreement was reached to repay a total of DM4.5 billion by  the year 2000, beginning 1996.    "This is the most comprehensive agreement Iran has ever  concluded for rescheduling its foreign debts," Va'ezi stated.  The deputy foreign minister headed an Iranian delegation that  paid a three-day visit to Germany. He met with Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel during the visit.    According to information from Bonn, Iran is to be granted a  DM2.5-billion loan by German banks on the basis of commercial  conditions, which is to be covered by Hermes guarantees. The  Finance Ministry pointed out Iran's "good values" as far as the  payment of debts is concerned. The country is currently facing  liquidity problems because of lower oil prices.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS-STRICKEN WOMEN: VICTIMS TRY TO CARRY ON  </P> <P> Terri, 25, went to the doctor because she was running out of breath climbing  the short flight of stairs to her apartment.  </P> <P> Half a dozen specialists and two months later, the diagnosis was shocking.  Terri had AIDS.  </P> <P> Rosa Maria, 44, lost her husband to AIDS eight months ago. Now, the mother of  two is HIV positive. Although she has not been diagnosed as having AIDS, she is  infected with the virus and one day will develop symptoms of the disease.  </P> <P> Terri, a white college graduate, was raised in an affluent Orange County  suburb. Rosa Maria, a native of El Salvador, lives in Los Angeles on $800 a  month in Social Security benefits.  </P> <P> Neither fits the typical high-risk profile. Both are female. Neither has used  intravenous drugs. And neither has had a blood transfusion.  </P> <P> But they are among a growing number of women nationwide who have contracted the  AIDS virus from sex with an infected partner. Both women, whose names have been  changed to protect their privacy, are among the silent victims of an epidemic,  forgotten among the sheer numbers of gay men afflicted with the disease.  </P> <P> The AIDS Services Foundation recently announced plans to form a counseling  group for women in Laguna Beach that would be the first of its kind in Orange  County. Response, however, has been poor.  </P> <P> Unlike more than 100,000 men with AIDS, women make up a significantly smaller  group scattered over a large geographical area. They are often too ill to leave  their homes and have no transportation or child care. Moreover, many women who  contracted AIDS through heterosexual contact do not want to attend group  sessions with intravenous drug users.  </P> <P> "There's not that many females out there" who have AIDS but don't use  intravenous drugs, Terri says. "It's not like cancer or something. People are  too afraid of it and their attitude is, 'Why risk daily contact?' "  </P> <P> Although most women contract AIDS as a result of IV drug use, about 30% get the  disease from sex with an AIDS carrier -- a man who is an IV drug user, bisexual  or member of another high-risk group. Thousands more become infected with the  HIV virus, eventually developing full-blown AIDS.  </P> <P> They come from a cross-section of racial and economic groups, ranging from  single women to wives infected by their husbands. Once diagnosed, many isolate  themselves from friends and family, afraid of the stigma associated with the  disease.  </P> <P> "These women are not prostitutes or IV drug users," says Virginia Garzon, who  runs the Milagros AIDS project, a support group for Latino AIDS sufferers in  Los Angeles. "A lot of them are housewives leading quiet lives. They don't want  the neighbors to know. They don't even want their mothers to know."  </P> <P> They are women who suddenly find themselves victims of a terminal illness  brought on by the infidelities of a husband or lover. Or, they have had more  than one sexual partner and do not know how they contracted the virus because  AIDS can take as long as 11 years to manifest itself.  </P> <P> "I think there are a lot of women out there who have it (virus), but it hasn't  been diagnosed," says Irene Briggs, a licensed marriage and family counselor  who runs a support group for mothers of AIDS victims in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Typically, a 25-year-old woman isn't going to rush out and have an HIV test  unless she has some reason to."  </P> <P> Terri had just graduated from college when she came down with a type of  pneumonia commonly associated with AIDS.  </P> <P> "It was a total blow that came out of nowhere," she said. "It's not like I'm a  gay man who decided to get an AIDS test. One day I got sick and the next thing,  boom, I've got a killer disease."  </P> <P> Terri believes she got AIDS from a former boyfriend. However, none has admitted  to being HIV positive.  </P> <P> Until two years ago, when she was diagnosed as having AIDS, Terri said she  occasionally used condoms during sex but only as a means of birth control.  </P> <P> During sex, the HIV virus, present in the semen of an infected man, enters a  woman's system through cuts in the vagina, according to medical experts.  </P> <P> "Certain things like genital herpes and sores increase the chance of  transmission to a woman," says Dr. Sudhir Gupta, an AIDS researcher at UC  Irvine. "But they are not necessary. In sexual activity, the woman always gets  some sore -- even microscopic tears -- but that is enough, because the virus is  so small."  </P> <P> Yet many heterosexuals underestimate the risks of contracting the virus through  sex.  </P> <P> "People in the straight community are so ignorant they think they are never  going to get it (AIDS)," Terri says. "My doctor told me I probably got it  before I even knew what it was."  </P> <P> Terri has been more fortunate than most. Two years after being diagnosed, she  has not suffered the severe, debilitating effects of the disease, such as  dramatic weight loss and skin discoloration.  </P> <P> She can still work at her job as a supermarket checker. Her parents have  steered her to the best medical treatment available. For the moment,  pentamadine, a drug commonly used to treat AIDS patients, is keeping the  pneumonia at bay. She stopped taking AZT several months ago because it was  making her anemic.  </P> <P> Like others with AIDS, Terri saw her life change overnight. Plans for a career,  marriage and children suddenly became pipe dreams.  </P> <P> "I think about it all day long -- how can you not?" she says. "My body is  changing. My skin is drier, my hair is coarser. My body is dying inside."  </P> <P> A year after being diagnosed with AIDS, Terri met her current boyfriend. For  months, she agonized over how to break the news to him.  </P> <P> "I didn't tell him right off the bat, but I could tell he was falling in love,  and I couldn't keep leading him on," she said. "The first thing he asked is  what it would do to us. He's behind me all the way."  </P> <P> She has told two other close friends about her illness.  </P> <P> "It totally breaks my heart that others can't know," she says, "but I don't  want them to feel different and worry about me. I want things to be as normal  as possible."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Terri is bound to her job in a grocery store because she needs the  health insurance to pay her rising medical bills. She fears that if she changed  jobs, she would have trouble getting insured because she has AIDS.  </P> <P> "That's probably the worst thing," she says. "I can't live where I want to  live, I can't work where I want to work. I just feel I am so much more  ambitious and have so much more to me. This isn't me."  </P> <P> Rosa Maria, a dark-haired woman who seems older than her 44 years, is relaxing  at the offices of the Milagros AIDS project, handing toys to her young  daughter.  </P> <P> Rosa Maria stays awake nights worrying what will become of her children when  she dies. She has no family in the United States and has little contact with  her relatives in El Salvador. They do not know that she has the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> "I don't care about my life anymore," she says, gently touching her child's  forehead. "I just care about what will happen to my children."  </P> <P> She recently hired a lawyer to draft a document that will enable her son, 16,  to raise her 2-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> "The lawyer's making arrangements now so the baby won't be given up for  adoption," Rosa Maria says. "I have some friends who will help him raise her so  she won't be taken away from him."  </P> <P> She describes how for more than a year she watched her 37-year-old husband die  from a disease that his doctors could not diagnose.  </P> <P> "I got mad and kept asking them why they couldn't tell me what was wrong with  him, because he was getting sicker and sicker," she said. "By the time they  found out he had AIDS, it was already too late."  </P> <P> Last month, Rosa Maria applied for citizenship under the government amnesty  program. She wanted to get a green card so she could find work to support  herself and her two children.  </P> <P> "They wrote me back saying that I was a danger to the United States," she said.  "I cried and cried and said, 'Why?' because I know that I got the virus here."  </P> <P> Before he died, Rosa Maria's American-born husband told her he had contracted  AIDS by having sex with prostitutes.  </P> <P> But she says she's not bitter.  </P> <P> "I trust in God," she says. "All I want is for my children to have a better  life than I had."  </P> <P> WOMEN WITH AIDS  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.96IN:1.78IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Orange  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Category  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> County  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Nationwide  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adult females diagnosed with AIDS since 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10,369  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Deaths  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,662  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TRANSMISSION CATEGORIES  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Heterosexual contact  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,224  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Transfusion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,044  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> IV drug use  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,378  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Unknown  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 693  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> MALE &amp; FEMALE, ALL AGES  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total AIDS cases since 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,244  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 115,158  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total AIDS deaths since 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 765  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 70,312  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Sources: Orange County health department; Centers for Disease Control in  Atlanta  </P> <P> </P></p>

To improve  management over recruitment of migrant workers, the circular  stipulates the following:    First, until the end of March this year, no unit is allowed  to recruit new migrant workers from outside the province. In  cases where a unit really needs to employ migrant workers, it  must report this to the provincial employment service center for  approval; if a unit employs migrant workers from outside the  province without approval, the provincial labor supervisory  organization will, in accordance with the provincial  government's Decree No. 4, impose a fine of 2,000 yuan on the  employing unit per one migrant worker employed.    Second, the employing unit must register with the local  labor  department by the end of March for the migrant workers already  working in the unit and must obtain approval for migrant  workers' entry into Hainan for employment. As of 1 April, all  levels of labor supervisory organizations in the province will  conduct overall inspections. Migrant workers who do not possess  employment approval certificates will be fined according to the  regulations.    Third, in accordance with the Document No. 15, issued  jointly  by the provincial personnel and labor department and the  provincial public security department this year, after migrant  workers' employment approval certificates come into effect the  previous employment approval certificates issued by the  provincial personnel and labor department will be revoked on 24  February.</p>

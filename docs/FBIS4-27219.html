			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's three long-term  credit banks are likely to lower their long-term prime lending  rate on June 10 for the first cut in six months, banking sources  said Monday [30 May].    The sources said the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the  long- term credit bank, and Nippon Credit Bank are expected to  cut the rate charged on loans to most-creditworthy customers by  around 0.2 percentage point from the current 4.4 percent per  annum.    They said the cut in the rate, which affects capital  spending, may help underpin the economy.    The rate was boosted in February and March due to the slump  of bond prices, but the market recovered thereafter, with the  yield falling, buttressed by the Bank of Japan's eased credit  stance.    The yield of the May issue of bank debentures issued by the  IBJ, the basis for the long-term prime rate, dropped to 3.24  percent Monday, against its coupon rate of 3.5 percent.    The coupon rate of the bank debentures is revised when the  gap between it and the yield widens more than 0.2 point.    The long-term prime rate is set 0.9 point above the coupon  rate of the debentures.    The sources also said the housing loan rate charged by  private banks, linked to the long-term prime rate, will be left  unchanged, however, due to the small scale of the cut.</p>

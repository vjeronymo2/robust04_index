			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bad debt crisis worsens at Japanese banks Bad loans overshadowing Japan's 11 leading commercial banks are growing faster than they can be written off, on the evidence of the industry's annual results, published yesterday. The 11, which provide just under one third of lending to Japan's sluggish economy, took drastic action to reduce their non-performing loans last year. But the signs are that it was not enough to improve their balance sheets. They wrote off Y2,480bn (Dollars 24bn) of bad loans in the 12 months to March, two-and-a-half times more than the previous year. On top of this, the commercial banks made provisions worth Y2,102bn, a 44 per cent rise on last year's provisions of Y1,459bn, and sold Y1,325bn of bad debts to the Co-Operative Credit Purchasing Company, a jointly-owned debt buying organisation set up in January last year. As a result of these hefty charges, pre-tax profits fell for the fifth year running, by an average of 41.6 per cent. This collective attempt to clean up their the balance sheets is a belated response to the central bank's campaign to persuade the industry to break with its tradition of sitting on bad debts indefinitely. Yet, despite their efforts, the commercial banks' published bad debts rose both in absolute terms - from Y8,435bn last year to Y8,948bn by the end of March - and as a proportion of total lending - from 3.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent over the same period. The published bad debt total is down 3 per cent from the balance half-way through the year, at the end of September, prompting bank officials to suggest that the worst is over. But as in previous years, the published figures understate the size of the problem, because they only include loans to bankrupt companies or loans where no interest has been received for six months. They exclude restructured loans, where interest has been shaved to almost nil to keep a weak customer alive, or loans by non-bank affiliates for which the parents are responsible. Together, these could nearly double the published figure according to the most pess-imistic independent est-imates. The disturbing message behind this is that Japan's deep recession is adding a new tier of debt problems, loans to ailing small companies, on top of the dud property-backed loans inherited from the post-bubble collapse in property prices. Equally worrying, the commercial banks covered between one third and half of those write-offs by selling and repurchasing securities, so as to record a capital gain. This is bound to increase their dependence on low-yielding assets, warns Ms Alicia Ogawa, equities analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia. Within this, however, the commercial banks yesterday demonstrated wide differences in their state of health and the aggressiveness with which they are tackling their loans. This is a sign that Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan is making continued progress in his campaign to persuade the industry to break with its 'convoy' tradition, whereby banks reported similar results in an attempt to buoy public confidence. Mitsubishi Bank, the strongest, revealed non-performing loans worth just 1.84 per cent of total lending, while Hokkaido Takushoku, declared 6.85 per cent and Sakura Bank 4.03 per cent. The impression the banks aimed to give yesterday is that they have got to grips with their weaknesses and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. In a symbolic act of penitence, board directors of three banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Hokkaido Takushoku and Sumitomo, are to forego bonuses this year because of their institutions' poor earnings. Most predicted flat profits in the coming year, though again there were significant differences between banks. Mitsubishi, which surprised the market with a 15.7 per cent decline in its core business (or operating) profits - far below than the average 5.3 per cent decline - said it did not expect profits to rise this year. Sumitomo, with business profits down 11.5 per cent, forecast stable earnings. Sakura, by contrast, forecast a recovery from its 23.5 per cent profits decline, to the bafflement of several analysts. 'I just can't see where it's going to come from,' said Mr Brian Waterhouse, banking analyst at James Capel in Tokyo. Generally, the industry outlook is tough. Demand for loans remains very weak, as shown by a 1.5 per cent in total lending last year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the market for creditworthy customers is aggressive. Salomon's Ms Ogawa estimates that 17 per cent of the commercial banks' liabilities are linked to the record low official discount rate and pay less than 1 per cent. If the central bank succumbs to pressure to cut the official rate, this will hardly help banks' profit margins.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              Japanese commercial banks: Year to March 1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                 Net profit   Change       Business   Change                          (Y bn)      (%)  profit (Y bn)      (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sakura                     34.8    -23.2          207.4    -23.5 Fuji                       26.7    -13.9          362.1    +15.6 DKB                        32.4    -38.9          235.5     -0.8 Sumitomo                   33.3   +137.8          302.3    -11.5 Mitsubishi                 29.4    -37.4          283.5    -15.7 Sanwa                      52.3    -22.1          358.0     -3.3 Tokai                      20.7     -0.5          180.2     -3.4 Asahi                      20.7     -1.3          165.4    +13.1 Daiwa                      13.0    -22.6           70.2     -2.3 Hokkaido Takushoku          4.1    -46.9           32.0    -17.7 Tokyo                      50.4    +17.0          185.1     -8.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BALDWIN PARK HIGH SCHOOL ROOMS DAMAGED BY FIRE; ARSON SUSPECTED  </P> <P> An apparent arson Saturday night at Baldwin Park High School caused $170,000 in  damages to three classrooms, according to Los Angeles County fire officials,  who said one of the rooms was ransacked before the blaze was set.  </P> <P> Firefighters arrived about 9:20 p.m. to find smoke and flames billowing from  several windows of a classroom wing of the school at 3900 Puente Ave., about 15  miles east of downtown Los Angeles, county fire Capt. Darrold Swanson said.  </P> <P> "The building had been ransacked before the fire was started," he said. "There  were desks knocked over, things like that. It's probable that somebody broke in  and vandalized the place, then set the fire."  </P> <P> Swanson estimated damage to the structure at $130,000, with an additional  $40,000 to contents at the school, which has an enrollment of about 3,000  students.  </P> <P> School officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. But fire officials  said suspicious blazes are becoming more common at high schools in the county.  </P> <P> "From my experience, it doesn't take much provocation to start a fire like  this, whether it's getting an extra day off for a holiday or just getting a bad  grade," Swanson said. "But we're 95% sure somebody was trying to make a point  here."  </P></p>

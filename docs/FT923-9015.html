			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Olympic News in Brief: Lewis wins third long jump gold Carl Lewis exacted revenge over rival Mike Powell with a jump of 8.67m to win his third straight Olympic long jump title and seventh gold medal. Powell managed 8.64m - just three centimetres short of Lewis's mark. The pair embraced, but Powell must have been feeling the same sense of misery Lewis had experienced in the world championships in Tokyo last year when he produced the greatest series of leaps of all-time, and still lost to Powell's world record 8.95m.</p>

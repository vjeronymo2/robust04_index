			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Kinkel urges practical assistance for Russia MR KLAUS Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday called for a direct programme of practical measures to support the Russian reform programme of Mr Boris Yeltsin, and floated the idea of Russia being formally admitted to the Group of Seven industrialised states. Such membership would depend on Russia 'resolutely pursuing' its reform programme, he said. But it was clear that in terms of 'human and material resources' Russia fulfilled the necessary preconditions to join the club. He also suggested that inviting Mr Yeltsin to attend the G7 summit in Tokyo in July would demonstrate 'the unchanged political importance of the Russian federation, and the world-wide reputation of its president.' German officials are concerned that any programme of western assistance for Russia, which could be drawn up by finance and foreign ministers meeting in Japan on April 18, should do nothing to encourage Mr Yeltsin's opponents in accusing him of being a 'lackey of the west.' Such a programme should now be focused on direct practical assistance for the population, including a significant element to improve living conditions for officers in the Russian army, they believe. They want other members of the G7 to contribute towards housing for the military, for which Germany is already paying DM12bn (Pounds 5bn), to head off any cause for military unrest. They also suggest direct involvement in the Russian government's privatisation programme, and aid to relieve desperate shortages of drugs in hospitals, and food in old people's homes, as ways of bringing relevant western assistance to the Russian people. Mr Yeltsin has sought to reassure western leaders, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that he has the support of the army in his constitutional struggle for power with the Russian Congress of People's Deputies. There are fears in Bonn, however, that regional commanders in areas such as Georgia and Moldova are acting like 'independent warlords' over whom neither the Russian president, nor his Moscow army commanders, have real control. The German military housing programme is building 36,000 apartments for officers returning from the occupying force in east Germany. However there are no comparable programmes to help those coming back from Poland and Hungary, the Baltic republics, or other former Soviet republics. 'We must show that co-operation is worthwhile, and that confrontation brings nothing to Russia,' a senior German official said.</p>

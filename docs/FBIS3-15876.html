Out of 36 electoral blocs, a mere 17  have succeeded in passing through the pre-election sieve by  collecting 35,000 signatures each. One of them, the  Russian-Baltic "Common Sense" bloc, was disqualified at the  start: 3,000 of the signatures supporting it were deemed  invalid. Certain individuals demonstrated enviable initiative  by subscribing to various electoral blocs and putting forward  their candidacy in several districts at once.    The City Assembly will probably be an all-male club: There  are just 90 women among those hungry for power in the Northern  Palmira. The overwhelming majority of candidates are civil  servants, businessmen, and teachers from higher educational  establishments and schools. Representatives of the creative  intelligentsia and the mass media have expressed no particular  enthusiasm.    As the election date draws closer, so the third estate's  troubles increase. Legal wrangles between Federation Council  Deputy Aleksandr Belyayev and Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak continue.  The mayor has conceded and repealed the restriction on  Federation Council members in the Statute on Elections to the  City Assembly. The senator did not turn up for the most recent  court hearing, so it was postponed once again.    Rudolf Kagramanov, chairman of the officially registered  anti-bureaucratic party, continues to amuse the public. He  brought an action against the Electoral Commission because not  all of his 13 offices and titles were entered on the  subscription list. One of these titles, for instance, is doctor  of sensationalist sciences. The chief campaigner against  bureaucracy collected just one signature in support of his bloc  -- his own. The suspicion is that Kagramanov's party and the  electoral bloc combined have the same number of members. The  only thing that is unclear is what can be going through the  minds of the earnest people who are allowing this entire farce  into the elections.    At times, the election campaign on the banks of the Neva  River assumes criminal overtones. Unknown persons savagely beat  up Petr Soshenko, leader of the group supporting Vice Mayor  Vyacheslav Shcherbakov. The activist received repeated  telephone calls and demands to stop campaigning. Local  detectives are still looking for the culprits.    A sensational report was disseminated by the Federal  Counterintelligence Service St. Petersburg Directorate Press  Service. Staffers at the department for combating terrorism  together with criminal investigation workers have detained four  people suspected of murder. Among them is Nikolay Bondarik,  chairman of the local branch of the Russian Party. He is  running for election to the City Assembly on behalf of the  "Great Russia" bloc, which unites national-patriotic  organizations.    Observers predict that the main struggle for seats in the  City Assembly will unfold between the "Democratic Unity of  Petersburg" bloc, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation,  and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Let me  remind you that in December's Federal Assembly elections the  liberal democrats won fewer votes in the city on the Neva than  in other regions of Russia. Commenting upon this fact during  his recent visit to St. Petersburg, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated  that here, apart from the homeless and the mafia, under which  category he classed scientists, lawyers, and artists, nobody  voted for "Russia's Choice." As for voters worthy of the LDPR,  they are few and far between in the northern capital.    Data from the St. Petersburg Sociological Scientific  Research  Center is interesting in this connection. In December the LDPR  won 17 percent of the electorate's votes on the banks of the  Neva. But according to the results of a city-wide telephone  sample poll conducted at the end of January, only 9 percent of  respondents gave an affirmative answer to the following  question: "Will the success of Zhirinovskiy's party at the  parliamentary elections help to improve matters in Russia?"  Admittedly, it is still too early to conclude from this that  the voters are starting to rid themselves of the liberal  democratic charms. However, sociologists do record certain  improvements in the public consciousness. So it is that,  according to information produced by the poll, only  three-fourths of the electorate would vote today as they did 12  December. Of those polled, 10 percent are not sure that they  would make the same choice as before. And 7 percent would vote  differently.</p>

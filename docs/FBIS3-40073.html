			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liaoning Finance Department Vice Director Yu </F> Jianxun (0060 1696 8113): "Answers Reporter's Questions  Concerning Agricultural Taxes"]    [Excerpt] At present, Liaoning Province has entered the  peak season for agricultural tax collection, this reporter  therefore interviewed Liaoning Finance Department Vice Director  Yu Jianxun on questions of concern to all cadres and masses in  rural areas.    [Question] Director Yu, what kind of taxes are included in  the so-called agricultural taxes?    [Answer] Agricultural taxes generally refer to farming tax,  special product tax, contract tax and farmland user tax which  finance departments at every level of government are responsible  for collecting. [passage omitted]    [Question] Since it is a legitimate responsibility of  peasants to pay agricultural taxes, is the burden of  agricultural taxes in Liaoning considered to be heavy?    [Answer] In taxation, China adheres to the principle of  "collecting taxes based on set rates, and reducing or waiving  taxes according to law." On this basis, the government has  carried out a taxation policy of "collecting only taxes which  constitute reasonable and stable burdens." For many years, the  agricultural tax burden in Liaoning has been very light; take  the farming tax and special product tax as examples, at present  the Liaoning's agricultural tax is still calculated on the basis  of production quantity set in 1961, and the average tax for the  whole province is only 82 kilo per mu which is far below the  actual production level; in 1992, the Liaoning's average taxes  per mu are: 3.85 yuan for dry field, 11.3 yuan for paddy field,  20.64 yuan for vegetables field, and the actual tax burden is  3.3 percent, far below the nominal tax rate of 12.5 percent.  This level of taxes is not only the lightest in historic terms,  but also very much lower than the 12.2 percent actual tax level  in the 1950-60s. The actual rate of special product tax in  Liaoning is not even 4 percent, far below the 11 percent  prescribed by government regulations as being a reasonable tax  burden.    [Question] Since the actual burden of the special product  tax  is very low, why has the State Council decided this year to  lower the tax rates on some of the products subject to the  special product tax?    [Answer] The reason the State Council has decided to lower  the tax rates on some special products represents a major policy  decision to strengthen the work in rural areas and to provide  overall stability to agricultural production. The policy has two  major objectives: First, to close the gap between the nominal  tax rate and the actual tax burden. Because the collection of  special product taxes has run into rather serious problems of  avoidance, cheating, under-reporting and falsifying or  concealing the products, there are great discrepancies between  the nominal tax rates and the actual taxes collected on some of  the special products. For example, on apples, the government-set  tax rate is 15 percent, but the actual tax paid nationally is  only 7 percent; on prawns, the government-set rate is 10  percent, while the actual tax rate does not amount to 3 percent,  and so on. Therefore, the government's main objective in  lowering the tax rates on apples, aquatic products from rivers  and lakes, logs, fruits and melons, etc., is to lower their  nominal tax rates so they match more closely with the actual  taxes collected. Second, to correct the imbalance of tax burdens  and to mobilize enthusiasm for production not only among the  large agricultural and special products production enterprises  but also among the state-owned collective production  organizations.    [Question] In addition to what you have described above,  what  are some other policies based on agricultural taxes that benefit  the peasants?    [Answer] Our party and government have always looked after  the benefits of the broad masses, and in agricultural taxes we  have prescribed a series of beneficial policies; for example,  rural households that owe more than 50 percent of taxes as a  consequence of some disaster can apply for tax relief;  households in dire poverty, households of military martyrs, and  five-guarantee households can apply for tax waiver; households  which use the area in front and back of their houses to grow  various miscellaneous crops not for commercial sales can be  exempted from the special product taxes; and peasants who build  their homes on contract farmland can pay one-half of the  farmland user tax, and so on.    [Question] According to current laws and regulations, what  punishments are prescribed for evading, owing or delaying  payment of taxes and actively resisting paying any taxes?    [Answer] According to the "Law on Management of Tax  Collections in the People's Republic of China" and  "Supplementary Regulations by the PRC National People's Congress  Standing Committee on Punishments for Evading and Resisting Tax  Collections," in addition to imposing a penalty of 2 percent per  day on the amounts of taxes evaded, delayed, owed, or refused,  the following punishments may be handed down.    1. Any taxpayer who evades taxes through fraud, fabrication  and concealment, and the evaded amount exceeds 10 percent of the  amount due or more than 10,000 yuan, or who still evaded taxes  after given two administrative warnings by the revenue  collecting unit, will be required to pay the evaded amount and  in addition be punished by a prison sentence of three years or  less and fined an amount not exceeding five times the amount of  tax evaded. In the case of a taxpayer who evaded less than  10,000 yuan or the evaded amount evaded is less than 10 percent  of the tax due, the revenue collection unit will be responsible  for collecting the evaded amount and levying a fine not  exceeding five times the amount of tax evaded.    2. The revenue collection unit will be responsible for  collecting from any taxpayer who owes 10,000 yuan or more; for  those owing less than 100,000 yuan, also levying a prison  sentence not exceeding three years and a fine not exceeding five  times the amount of tax owed; for those owing more than 100,000  yuan, also levying a prison terms of at least three but not  exceeding seven years, and a fine equal to or less than five  times the amount of tax owed; revenue collection unit will be  responsible for collecting any amount owed under 10,000 yuan,  and levying a fine not exceeding five times the amount of taxes  owed.    3. Resisting collection of taxes is defined as refusal to  pay  tax by force or threat of force. In such cases, the revenue  collection unit will be responsible for tracking down the  delinquent taxpayer to collect the amount of tax due, levying a  prison term of three years or less, and a fine equal to five  times the amount of tax due; for the more serious cases, levying  a prison term of more than three and under seven years, and a  fine equal to five times the amount of tax due; for taxpayers  who owe rather small amounts and who have not engaged in any  criminal behaviors, the revenue collection unit will be  responsible for collecting the amounts owed and imposing a fine  equal to less than five times the amount of taxes owed.</p>

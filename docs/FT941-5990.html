			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Incentives help lift orders at Peugeot French government and industry measures to stimulate the depressed car market have prompted a sharp increase in orders, according to Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen. He said that last month's measures, which included a payment from the government of FFr5,000 (Dollars 861) for car owners who trade in vehicles more than 10 years old to buy a new one and which were matched by incentive schemes by the car companies. This resulted in almost 50,000 extra orders in the French market. Total orders for the month were about 200,000. 'It seems there was a strong effect,' said Mr Calvet. But he warned that the increase could be temporary as consumers may have hurried to take advantage of the schemes. The company has not revised its forecast made at the start of the year of a 7 per cent increase in total car sales in the French market to 1.85m, as it had anticipated stimulatory measures. Mr Calvet also repeated his claim that Renault, Peugeot-Citroen's state-owned rival, should repay about FFr8bn to the government following the failure of its merger with Volvo of Sweden. He said that the creation of the industrial alliance between the two groups and the decision to unwind their cross-shareholdings could have increased Renault's capital, and this should be reimbursed. Renault said that any increase in capital had come from Volvo, not the French state. Peugeot was continuing to cut costs and increase productivity, said Mr Calvet. The company plans to cut about 7,000 jobs this year, from a total workforce of 143,900. Productivity, which rose 12 per cent last year, is targeted to increase by a similar amount in 1994. Mr Calvet described BMW's acquisition of Rover of the UK as 'a courageous and intelligent move, but with risks'.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES WOOING MINORITY STUDENTS YOUNGER AND YOUNGER  </P> <P> David Billups is the kind of high school student that the outreach staff of UC  San Diego administrator Victoria Valle Staples works so hard to lure to the La  Jolla campus.  </P> <P> Billups, who graduates next month from Castle Park High in Chula Vista, has a  solid grade point average and test scores, plays the snare drums for the  school's marching band and plans a career in electrical engineering.  </P> <P> He is also black, and UCSD -- through Valle Staple's recruitment office --  targeted Billups early in his senior year to receive special phone calls,  letters and tours designed to sell him on UCSD over other universities also  eager to have him.  </P> <P> Billups is one of several hundred black and Latino students throughout  California that UCSD flagged last fall for red-carpet treatment, and, in his  case, the effort paid off by the May 1 deadline for students to decide where  they would go. Billups will enroll in UCSD's Warren College in September.  </P> <P> But, in their attempts to attract more non-whites and non-Asians to the  University of California, UCSD and the system's seven other undergraduate  campuses find they must aggressively compete against each other annually for  what is a very small pool of only a couple thousand eligible students. They buy  computer lists of eligible students, throw lunches and schedule special  lectures, distribute fancy brochures and encourage personal contacts from  minority undergraduates.  </P> <P> Although the number of black and Latino UC students has grown during the last  five years, the percentages still lag considerably behind their representation  in California's school-age population.  </P> <P> UC recruitment counselors, as well as those from the California State  University system, have moved to expand programs that tell their story -- and  that of higher education in general -- earlier in the high- school lives of  students, and even at the junior-high level. Such programs include writing  seminars, campus tours and summer enrichment sessions. Some have been in place  several years, especially in the San Diego area. But their effects have been  only gradual in expanding the number of UC-eligible students each year.  </P> <P> Increasingly, university officials say they must offer curriculum and other  assistance as early as the primary school grades as a way to acculturate Latino  and black children to the benefits of doing well, to expose them to science and  other potential academic majors and to encourage them to view post-secondary  education as a common and reachable goal if planned early enough.  </P> <P> For example, officials at UCSD's Third College and San Diego State University  have jointly applied to the National Science Foundation for $1.6 million to set  up a countywide resource center to promote and sustain math, science and  engineering courses for students, beginning at elementary levels.  </P> <P> Already, a smaller foundation grant has been given to San Diego State to  operate after-school math enrichment for second- and third-graders in the San  Diego city school district. San Diego State President Tom Day has put his  prestige behind parenting seminars being offered at several inner-city schools  to promote parent or guardian involvement in their child's education. Several  UCSD professors spend their own time working with county secondary schools  across a variety of academic areas.  </P> <P> "We have an obligation to serve San Diego and Imperial counties with outreach  because that is our service area," Joseph W. Watson, UCSD vice chancellor for  undergraduate affairs, said.  </P> <P> The 1988 freshman class at UCSD was 68% white, 20% Asian, 8.2% Latino and 3.1%  black. Those figures compare to all UC freshmen, who were 57% white, 26% Asian,  9.3% Latino and 5.3% black. The trend over several years shows a modest  increase in Latino students but very little increase in blacks.  </P> <P> "None of us (college campuses) are overwhelmed with under-represented  students," Watson said.  </P> <P> Valle Staples, who heads student outreach and recruitment, has already begun  planning her strategy for the fall, 1990, freshman class even though she is  still tallying up the number of affirmative-action students, known as SAA  students, who chose UCSD for this fall.  </P> <P> She will compile lists of names of Latino and black seniors-to-be whose  academic records, received through counselors and through a countywide  consortium that helps identify these students, may meet UC admission  requirements. Other students come to her attention through the UCSD Early  Outreach program, which works with several hundred students targeted for  special tutoring, lectures and summer enrichment as early as the ninth grade.  </P> <P> Valle Staples will also send letters to students enrolled in AVID (Advancement  Via Individual Determination) that most county high schools now offer, a  program providing promising minority students with extra tutoring, counseling  and encouragement to overcome socioeconomic or other barriers to entering  college.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At a Premium  </P> <P> Although many of the early outreach programs are carried out only in San Diego  County, UCSD recruiters go after potential senior Latino and black applicants  in Orange and Los Angeles counties as well, because of the larger numbers who  live in those urban areas.  </P> <P> "Even so, we end up only with a couple hundred applying who definitely can meet  requirements, and they are at a premium because every other major university is  going after them as well," Valle Staples said. Because most Latino and black  students who are in college-preparatory classes find themselves able to meet UC  admissions standards, they usually opt for major universities and leave the Cal  State schools struggling even harder to meet their own affirmative-action  goals.  </P> <P> The major universities competing with UCSD, in particular UCLA, Stanford and UC  Berkeley, have several attractions that UCSD must work hard to counter,  including their location in larger urban areas, longer traditions, and major  college sports teams.  </P> <P> "UCSD is seen by students as very different," Valle Staples said. "We have a  real challenge to let students know of not only the academic quality here but  of campus life as well. And it helps if we can have that message delivered by a  person or a student who looks like they do."  </P> <P> Vanessa May, now a UCSD sophomore from San Fernando, originally thought she  would attend Cal State Fullerton but came to the La Jolla campus "just to take  a look" during her senior year and found herself "impressed by a black young  man" who told her both the good and bad points about attending the university.  </P> <P> Billups of Castle Park High said that a campus tour arranged through his school  "caught my interest . . . it was the first time I had ever been here and I  found the people I talked to were sort of friendly, easier to communicate with  than I thought. And having someone I could call with questions about my  application, that was really helpful."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multiple Acceptances  </P> <P> Billups' counselor at Castle Park, Willie Lassiter, said universities "spend an  awful lot of time with students individually and in groups, especially in  getting them the opportunity to see what a college campus is like."  </P> <P> Many students receive multiple university acceptances, and only in the spring  do they begin to focus on where they will go. UCSD increases its contacts  during that period, and it holds a two-day open-house in mid-April, during  which students are paired with undergraduates and spend the night on campus and  attend classes with them.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to scare anyone, but we want the students to know that the  university is a serious business and, by going to as many classes as possible,  they learn now that they must continue to work hard," Michael Kane, academic  adviser for UCSD's Third College, said.  </P> <P> "Also, we get that connection going with other undergraduates, because they are  our biggest support group."  </P> <P> The effort is also intended to show students that counseling and academic  assistance is available even after they get to campus, should they run into  problems with studies or social adjustment, Kane said.  </P> <P> Cesar Vallecillo, a senior at Tribuco Hills High in Orange County, made up his  mind during the two-day open-house. Vallecillo was impressed, in part, because  non-SAA students with solid academic backgrounds whom UCSD also wanted as  freshmen were invited as well by Valle Staples.  </P> <P> "The mixing is deliberate," Valle Staples said. "All these kids have the same  aspirations and, in all of my recruiting, I am careful not to reinforce  stereotypes" of students not being qualified. "So I won't have a reception just  for affirmative-action or non-affirmative action students."  </P> <P> Vallecillo said he realizes he is a role model for Latinos. "If more Hispanics  like myself can go to college, fulfill my dreams and goals, then maybe we won't  be such a minority. If I can make my mark, we won't be on the bottom of the  list."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Narrowest Way'  </P> <P> Because so few Latino and black students are at UCSD, Third College Provost  Cecil Lytle said the stereotype of being unqualified is hard to break.  </P> <P> "There's a feeling that you've gotten in somehow unfairly," said Lytle, "and it  is always drawn in the narrowest way so as to not see that ability and  motivation can be measured in a variety of ways."  </P> <P> In addition to campus perception of minorities at UCSD, Vice-Chancellor Watson  said that, until recently, UCSD had fewer academic offerings than Berkeley or  UCLA and was still seen largely as science-oriented and with unappealing  extracurricular offerings to ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> "Now perhaps a black student may still be the only black in a class but not the  only one in a department, and I would call that a hopeful sign," Watson said.  </P> <P> UCSD, as do all UC campuses, admits 6% of its freshman class on the basis of  individual talent or special criteria, which can encompass athletes or  musically talented students or ethnic minorities whom counselors say have the  potential to succeed in college even though they started too late in high  school to meet all admissions requirements.  </P> <P> "By no means is every (minority) student a special admit," Watson said. "But  let's be honest, if we are going to have reasonable numbers of certain ethnic  groups on our campuses, for the next decade we are going to have to admit  students who do not meet all the eligibility requirements.  </P> <P> "But I also want to say that we are still admitting relatively good students .  . . to not admit these people would be justified only if the view of their  lower eligibility is seen purely as personal consequences of student actions  and not reflecting at all the circumstances outside of the family" such as the  poorer state of inner-city schools and neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "I think to just have the university cut out a generation of people and prolong  a problem would not be the way to act."  </P> <P> But, because Watson and others are uncomfortable with prolonging special  admissions, they are pushing the university in the direction of a more active  role in public schools to prepare more Latino and black students. They make no  promises of instant success, conceding that many individual programs have  existed over the past decade, seemingly doing little to increase overall  numbers.  </P> <P> For example, recently established programs to guarantee students admission to  UCSD as juniors if they take a prescribed two-year course load at community  colleges have led to more white and Asians transfering than blacks and Latinos,  Watson said.  </P> <P> "The major thing to improve matters is really going to be getting students the  right study habits to achieve, beginning at the primary school level," Watson  said.  </P> <P> "We run into somewhat of a dilemma here," said Lytle of Third College, who  helped prepare the math-science grant proposal to the National Science  Foundation. "Our normal function is not to teach math in the fifth grade, but  we do have an obligation to share our resources. So, while we can't go out and  do the curricula at the (kindergarten) through 12th grade, we can take  initiatives in setting forth ideas and showing that we care in a broad sense."  </P> <P> Watson said that, for example, although the chemistry department at UCSD has no  inherent responsibility to interact with elementary schools, the university  teacher education program "can serve as the vehicle for bringing in teachers  from chemistry."  </P> <P> NO PLACE LIKE HOME  </P> <P> Quality Quinn Sharp is launching a project to steer as many of San Marcos'  minority students as possible to college, without leaving home.

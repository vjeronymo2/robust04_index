			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA JITTERS CUT LAND PRICE IN HONG KONG  </P> <P> The government on Wednesday sold the last prominent vacant plot in Hong Kong's  financial district, a prime office development site, for $346 million. While  the government claimed the sale was a significant indicator of confidence in  Hong Kong, the purchase price was well below predictions made before the  crackdown on student protest in China.  </P> <P> The bid for the land was originally expected to set a record before the  rocketing property boom took a knock last month as the events in Tian An Men  Square in Beijing seriously shook Hong Kong, which is destined to return to  Chinese control in 1997.  </P> <P> Early estimates for the property were about $500 million. After the Beijing  crisis, however, the government, which put the site on the market, had lowered  its aim to about $400 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considered Good  </P> <P> Great Eagle, a local property and construction company, bid in the name of  Shinea Hill Development, a wholly owned subsidiary. It is setting up a  consortium that includes C. Itoh, a Japanese trading house.  </P> <P> Local bankers and analysts said Wednesday that the Great Eagle price was good  given the prevailing political circumstances. They argued that it was in line  with what could have been expected a year or so ago.  </P> <P> Bob Pope, the government's acting director of building and lands, said he was  "satisfied" with the winning bid. He said development of the site, which  includes two office towers of 53 and 39 stories, would cost more than $600  million, and was a "vote of confidence in the future."  </P> <P> The winning bid was the highest of five, which ranged upwards from about $250  million, in a public tender for the 92,000-squate-foot site, adjacent to a new  Bank of China building.  </P> <P> Most bids indicated a substantially greater slide in property market prices  than the 20% fall forecast in recent weeks. Earlier indications of the price  falls had come in an auction of smaller government-owned plots on Tuesday,  which showed prices down by 20% to 25% on earlier predictions.  </P></p>

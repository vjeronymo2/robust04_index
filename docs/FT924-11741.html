			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Fraud to be handled by special unit THE BANK of England yesterday announced a reform of the way in which it supervises banks. The reform is intended to strengthen its response to fraud and malpractice and ensure that it uses the full range of its legal powers. It will remove primary responsibility for the investigation of fraud from the Bank's banking supervision division. Instead, malpractice inquiries will be handled by a new special investigations unit. Under the reform, backed by Lord Justice Bingham, the heads of the investigations unit and a new legal unit will have direct access to the Bank's governor and deputy governor. They will attend meetings of the Bank's board of banking supervision, its supervision oversight body. The investigations unit will be headed by Mr Ian Watt, a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. Mr Peter Peddie, formerly a partner in Freshfields, the solicitors, will head the legal unit. Both men will rank as advisers to the governor, with seniority equivalent to the Bank's four executive directors. They will work with Mr Brian Quinn, executive director for banking supervision, and Mr Tony Coleby, executive director for wholesale market supervision. Staff in the supervision department will be required to pass on any suspicions of fraud to the investigations unit, which will then handle any inquiry. The reform moves the Bank's approach to supervision closer to US regulators, which use a corps of professional examiners to supervise banks. The unit may employ a set of accountants and inspectors specialising in fraud. Although Mr Watt and Mr Quinn will work together in monitoring fraud investigations, the reform narrows the primary responsibility of the banking supervision department to supervisory issues, and standard forms of supervision. The reform is in response to two criticisms in the Bingham report: that the Bank failed to react quickly and aggressively enough to fraud at BCCI, and that it underestimated its legal powers to deal with the bank. Lord Bingham said the Bank's traditional techniques of supervision based on trust, frankness and a willingness to co-operate worked well in most cases, but 'a quite different approach' was needed in cases when trust was lacking. The Bank has accepted that it will have to alter its approach to supervision so that in cases where it loses trust in the managers of supervised banks or suspects fraud, it will 'change gear' to more aggressive supervision. The investigations unit is likely to employ some inspectors with outside experience. It will deal with cases referred from both the banking and wholesale markets supervision divisions. The legal unit will take responsibility for legal advice on supervisory issues from the Bank's solicitors. It will try to ensure that the Bank exploits all legal routes to detect and combat fraud and malpractice.</p>

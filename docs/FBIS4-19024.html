			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Taxes Would Kill Recovery, </F> CONFINDUSTRIA Warns"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- A tax squeeze to correct the  budget overshoot and stay in line with debt-curbing targets  would kill off Italy's weak recovery, according to the latest  economic analysis from the employers' association CONFINDUSTRIA  [General Confederation of Italian Industry].    Instead, CONFINDUSTRIA called for spending cuts, public  sector wage rise caps, and a push to the privatisation process  by lining up more Treasury-controlled banks like San Paolo di  Torino and Banco di Napoli.    The report cited a string of encouraging pointers: moderate  growth in output in February and March; domestic orders and  sales rising since the end of last year; a slowdown in domestic  turnover in November; a 6 percent rise in retail sales against  November 1992; and warehouse stocks falling below normal levels.    Investment and business confidence was therefore on the  rise,  it said, but warned that it would be a "serious mistake" to try  to correct public finances by using the tax lever, in the light  of the almost 2 percent rise in fiscal pressure as a proportion  of GDP in 1993 alone.    Immediate corrective action must come on the spending front,  the employers say: a curb on current account spending by reining  in intermediate consumption of public administrations as well as  funding for private social and cultural institutions and  publicly owned firms, where "cutbacks have been modest thus far."    Then, "there can be no discussion" of the need to hold firm  to ceilings for public sector wage rises, despite recent  "worrying" declarations by the Agency for Wage Bargaining.  Finally, the cash tap of privatisations must be opened still  further, the report said.    It said that the borrowing requirement target can be met by  pressing ahead with sell-offs of Treasury activities, especially  banks like San Paolo, corporate finance institute IMI [Italian  Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property] (a third of  which has already been offered) and Banco di Napoli, the  insurance concern INA [National Insurance Institute] (already  lined up), industrial groups like electricity company ENEL  [National Electric Power Board] (slated to go next year), and  real estate agencies like Immobiliare Italia.    In this last area, Immobiliare Italiana's convention with  the  state to manage public property and common land was "unfrozen"  today after eight months of stalemate. The move was hailed by  Immobiliare managing director Luigi Scimia as signalling a real  will to exploit the agency in possible sell-offs.</p>

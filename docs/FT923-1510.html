			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Letter: Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue Sir, Both John Plender ('Theory of bond investment culture comes unstuck', September 19) and Lex on the same day, worry that the UK's exit from the ERM will lead to higher inflation. It won't. Henry Kaufman (quoted in Anthony Harris's column, September 21) gives the reason: 'Devaluations would probably be inflationary if European economies were pushing against capacity constraints. However, the reality is the opposite.' Short-term rates in the US have fallen to 3 per cent and long-term rates in the US have fallen to 7.3 per cent and US inflation continues to fall. Worldwide lay-offs continue, with General Motors, Siemens Medical and Swissair recently announcing cuts. Dr Kaufman again: 'The Fed (read: any central bank ex-Germany) continued to maintain. . .vigilance against inflation. . .in the context of a dispirited economy. . . .This took on some of the aspects of fighting the last war.' Cut rates. Come back inflation (when and if you can), all is forgiven] L W Harris III, deputy chairman of equity strategy, Lombard Odier International Portfolio Management, 13 Southampton Place, London WC1A 2AJ</p>

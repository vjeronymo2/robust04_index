			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Apple moves to cut manufacturing costs APPLE COMPUTER is to restructure its worldwide manufacturing operations with the loss of 345 jobs. The US personal computer manufacturer will take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m against earnings in the current quarter to cover the costs of the changes. In order to lower its manufacturing costs and deliver products quicker to customers, Apple will shift some manufacturing operations closer to the markets they serve. 'By combining our manufacturing and distribution activities, we will be able to respond to customer needs quickly and efficiently, while significantly reducing our manufacturing costs,' said Michael Spindler, Apple president. In Europe, Apple will cut about 45 jobs at its plant in Cork, Ireland, as a result of 'cost efficiency measures'. This is despite plans to shift some assembly work currently performed at Apple's Singapore plant to Cork. Apple said it will also open a new facility in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, in December 1992, to provide system configuration and direct shipping services for the European market. In the US, Apple will close its manufacturing plant in Freemont, California, and shift part of this operation north to Sacramento, where it plans to open a distribution facility. Singapore will become a final assembly operation for Japan, Australia, and Asia. Apple will transfer final assembly for the US and Europe to those regions.</p>

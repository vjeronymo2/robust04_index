			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (5): Anxiety over drought - Threat to vegetable crops FARMING in West Norfolk is facing a potential crisis. Producers are warning of deteriorating output and fear their livelihoods are at risk because they can no longer rely on a basic natural resource - water. A succession of hot summers and dry winters has led to one of the longest droughts this century, and some farms in East Anglia - the so-called 'breadbasket of England' - may not survive without heavy and sustained rainfall. Farmers in the region have now endured 45 months of drought, forcing them to revise production plans and install costly irrigation equipment. They are now contemplating another difficult year following a winter in which average rainfall has fallen by almost 30 per cent. The main victims of this shortfall are not the farmers practising prairie-style cereal production, although that too has been affected, but the vegetable growers who depend on careful irrigation of their crops. More than 16,000 hectares of West Norfolk are used for growing crops such as potatoes, carrots and salad vegetables. The farmers working this land warn that yields could be halved if water supplies run dry, and they fear the quality of their produce may fail to meet the rigorous standards set by their leading customers - the supermarkets. For many of these farmers the 'villain of the piece' is the National Rivers Authority (NRA). It controls water supplies through irrigation licences and can impose restrictions and a total ban in times of shortage. Last summer the NRA banned crop irrigation is some areas and producers fear a similar move this year could threaten their businesses. Concern over water restrictions increased last month when the NRA announced more than 40 areas of eastern England where farmers using spray irrigators could face restrictions. Mr Roger Hyde, the NRA's regional general manager, warns: 'We face a very difficult year and we have already told more than 3,000 abstractors (farmers who use surface and ground water reserves) of the need to conserve water. 'Despite recent rainfall, underground resources remain at low levels and it is here that the risk factor has increased since last year.' Anxious to avoid restrictions on irrigation, the larger vegetable producers have invested heavily to install reservoirs enabling them to store water for summer use. John Shropshire &amp; Sons, one of East Anglia's largest vegetable producers, has spent about Pounds 100,000 on reservoirs. A spokesman for the company, which covers several farms including one at Southery near King's Lynn, describes the reservoirs as an 'insurance policy' for the group's Pounds 32m turnover. Many smaller farms, however, cannot afford such an outlay and they could be hit hard by NRA limits on water use - 'those who can't invest in reservoirs may have to give up growing vegetables,' according to the John Shropshire spokesman, who adds: 'There might be a switch of vegetable production out of East Anglia to other areas where they have more water.' The prospect of lasting water shortages has already encouraged some farmers to diversify into non-production activities such as field sports - clay pigeon shooting and fishing - and conversion of farm buildings for light industrial and residential use. Ironically, vegetable production could cease to be lucrative for all but the richest producers just at the time when farmers in other sectors - cereals and livestock - are considering it as an alternative source of income. Crops such as potatoes and peas look an attractive option to some farmers because they are not subject to quotas or levies imposed in Brussels. In the EC there is already a free market in vegetables, so producers will not face the upheaval expected in other sectors following the proposed withdrawal of subsidies when the Common Agricultural Policy is reformed. Existing vegetable producers, however, warn that newcomers could exhaust limited water supplies and lead to cut-throat competition. Other farmers, meanwhile, have diversified into livestock which can be farmed extensively and at low cost. East Anglia is not an area well-known for sheep but there are more than 28,000 in west Norfolk alone, and sales at the livestock market in King's Lynn have grown fivefold in recent years. 'We are now selling about 1,000 sheep a week,' says Mr Barry Hawkins of Lynn Market. Pig sales, he adds, have doubled in the past year. Livestock farms, however, are relatively unimportant to the west Norfolk economy compared with crop production. There are 46 farms relying on sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry, compared with more than 450 holdings involved in general cropping and vegetables, according to figures from the Ministry of Agriculture. It is these farmers who are facing serious problems caused by water shortages. The National Farmers' Union, which represents about 2,000 members in Norfolk, is anxious to reach an agreement with the NRA over irrigation which will safeguard production. The union is proposing a deal in which the region will be divided into designated areas where farmers agree to use only half the water allowed to them under their irrigation licences. In return, the NRA has been asked to guarantee no restrictions on that reduced supply. Although one group of west Norfolk farmers has agreed such a deal in the River Lark catchment area, NRA officials remain dubious about whether there will be many other agreements. If the drought continues, the NRA says it will have no alternative but to impose restrictions on supplies, and officials warn: 'If farmers ignore restrictions, they will be prosecuted.' In the worst scenario, producers who cannot afford to install reservoirs and then flout NRA limits in order to save their crops could face heavy fines and may have to abandon the business altogether. That threat has already encouraged some farms to amalgamate in a bid to cut overheads by sharing equipment and resources. The drought has left farmers facing increased costs and the likelihood of produce which cannot command top prices. The future for those who are not able to farm on an industrial scale may be bleak. Mr John Biles, regional director for the NFU in East Anglia, says: 'We know that we're going to be worse off. Farmers will have to accept further losses or combine or sell.'</p>

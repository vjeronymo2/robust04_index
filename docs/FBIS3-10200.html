During his visit to the region, the ombudsman personally  learned about the threats that Belizean soldiers issued against  35 families who live at the border town of Rio Blanco, Dolores,  Peten Department. The high-ranking official met with peasants  of the aforementioned town and the mayor of Dolores who gave a  detailed account of the threats issued by the Belizean military.    Sebastian Tux, a peasant, asked the ombudsman to clearly  demarcate the boundary with Belize, because last year Belizean  soldiers also forced them to abandon their land, where they left  behind a crop of approximately 2,500 quintals of beans and 2,000  quintals of corn. He added: If necessary we, the peasants,  offer our labor to build a boundary along the border. We have  looked for another place to relocate, but have not found one.  He said they would rather stay than emigrate from the lands  they have tilled for many years.    Moreover, Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia said it all began when  former President Jorge Serrano accepted Belize's independence  and established diplomatic relations with its government, an  unconstitutional act that would have never been accepted by the  Guatemalans if a referendum had been held on the issue.    However, he added, two key institutions have to intervene:  the Army and the Foreign Ministry. Besides, the Armed Forces  are duty bound to maintain strict control of the border, which  it has apparently neglected; and the Foreign Ministry has to  mediate with the Belizean Government through diplomatic channels  to prevent these actions. Referring to this, he asked the Army  to permanently protect the border zone and guarantee Guatemalan  rights; and he asked the Foreign Ministry to mediate  diplomatically to put an end to hostilities and provide  guarantees to the Guatemalan citizens, so they may live in their  country and exercise their rights.</p>

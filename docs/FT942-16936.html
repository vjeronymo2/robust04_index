			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Judge hits at AT&amp;T's McCaw takeover A US Federal judge has raised objections to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's planned Dollars 12.6bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications, though he left open the door to eventual approval of the deal. The ruling came from district judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the 1982 anti-trust legal settlement under which long-distance phone operator AT&amp;T spun off its seven local telephone companies into separate businesses, known collectively as the 'Baby Bells'. Judge Greene, who still monitors the settlement, ruled on Tuesday that AT&amp;T's plans to buy McCaw, the largest cellular telephone service company in the US, violated the 1982 pact, since this prevented AT&amp;T from buying the 'stock or assets' of any Baby Bell company. McCaw jointly owns with Baby Bells cellular networks in several large cities. However, Judge Greene left open the possibility that he would eventually approve the deal, saying the 1982 agreement could be modified to permit this  -provided AT&amp;T showed it was in the public interest. Analysts said the ruling was unlikely to derail the takeover, but it could delay its completion, due over the summer. AT&amp;T said it would move quickly to state its case and was confident it could win a waiver and complete the merger on schedule. Analysts pointed out that as a last resort, AT&amp;T and McCaw could choose to sell their interests in the cellular networks which prompted this week's ruling. Judge Greene was responding to objections to the McCaw deal raised by BellSouth, the largest of the Baby Bells, which is a partner with McCaw in some cellular licences. BellSouth is using the case not so much to block the McCaw deal as to argue before Judge Greene that the Baby Bells should be allowed to enter the long-distance telecommunications market, in view of changes in the communications industry over the past decade. They were barred from this area when they were spun off from AT&amp;T. Legislation before Congress would allow them into long-distance after a delay of several years. Mr Joseph Nacchio, president of AT&amp;T's consumer long distance business, said his units, True Rewards and True USA Savings, were winning back customers at a rate which was above internal expectations, Reuter reports from New York. Mr Nacchio told the agency that AT&amp;T's first-quarter earnings would have favourable news from the consumer long distance unit. Last September, shortly after becoming president of the consumer long distance unit, Mr Nacchio said his first goal would be to stop the loss of market share.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / CBI sales survey points to decline in demand: Retail figures highlight 'patchy' recovery Consumer spending may already be weakening, even though pay packets have yet to feel the effects of April's tax increases, according to the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey, published today. It shows that UK retail sales in January were below expectations. The balance of CBI respondents reporting an increase in sales compared with the same month last year, at plus 15 per cent, was lower than at any time since January 1993. The same balance reported that sales were lower than expected for the time of year. The evidence of weakening consumer demand was accompanied by official figures showing that manufacturers have been unable to raise prices substantially in the past year. The CBI figures 'highlight the patchy nature of recovery from month to month', said Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel. December's report was far more upbeat, with a balance of 34 per cent of stores reporting a sales increase. That survey, though, was quickly followed by disappointing official figures for December retail sales. The Central Statistical Office is to publish details of January's retail sales tomorrow. According to the survey, large stores are enjoying sales growth while small groups are suffering a decline. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, said reports from members suggested that trading in January had been strong, but sales tended to favour larger stores. However, the British Shops and Stores Association, which represents 3,000 companies and 15,000 retail outlets, said it believed that sales had started strongly in January, but fallen off towards the end of the month. Mr Allan Sayers, chief executive, said he thought publicity about the tax increases had dampened confidence. Meanwhile, figures for January producer prices appear to show that inflation is under control. The prices of UK manufactured goods at the factory gate rose by 0.3 per cent between December and January, for an annual increase of 3.7 per cent, down from 4 per cent in December. If food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum prices are excluded, then 'underlying' inflation rose by just 2.6 per cent over the year. Manufacturers' costs actually fell by 2.5 per cent in the year to January. Lower rise in producer prices, Page 9</p>

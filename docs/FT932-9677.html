			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: Security services 'have not been bugging the royal family' Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, acknowledged that private conversations among members of the royal family had probably been bugged but categorically rejected reports that the security services had been involved. His comments followed the latest controversy over the publication of an alleged conversation between the Prince and Princess of Wales, supposed to have taken place at Highgrove, the prince's Gloucestershire home, at a time when the couple's children were also there. Mr Clarke, responding to concern from MPs, said he would not set up an inquiry into the allegations. Last night Buckingham Palace threw doubt on the alleged Highgrove conversation. A spokesman said a check on the royal diaries had shown the couple and their children were at no stage together there at the time in question.</p>

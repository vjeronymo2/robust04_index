			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Cable and Wireless Cable and Wireless has traditionally enjoyed a premium rating. Investors have been impressed with its strategy of taking cash from its enormously profitable Hongkong Telecom subsidiary and reinvesting it in start-up ventures elsewhere. Yesterday's bad news from Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's largest such investment by far, raises doubts over whether the premium is justified any longer. The cost cutting announced yesterday is certainly necessary to revive Mercury's fortunes; any regulatory relief on the fees it pays BT for channelling calls over the larger company's network would also be a bonus. But neither will be sufficient to raise Mercury's return on capital, which fell to around 11.5 per cent on an annualised basis in the half year to end-September, to an adequate level. While Mercury puts its house in order, BT is also cutting costs and new competitors are entering the market targeting Mercury's best customers. If C&amp;W is unable to earn good returns on cash recycled from Hongkong Telecom, a central factor in preserving its premium rating will be the possibility of breaking up the group. Once the market value of C&amp;W's 57.5 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom is subtracted, there is little value left in the rest of the group's operations. The snag with this argument is not simply that C&amp;W's management has set its face firmly against such unbundling. Any attempt to off-load the Hongkong Telecom stake might so depress its price as to defeat the purpose of the exercise.</p>

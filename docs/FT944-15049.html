			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Commons body chairman elected Sir Thomas Arnold, Tory MP for Hazel Grove and a former vice-chairman of the Conservative party, was yesterday elected chairman of the influential Treasury and civil service committee of MPs. The move was seen as a boost for the body's independence from government. Mr Nigel Forman, the MP for Carshalton and Wallington, is understood to have been the preferred candidate of government business managers. The vacancy arose because of the appointment of Mr John Watts, the previous incumbent, as transport minister. Sir Thomas said that he would regard his first duty as upholding the independence and integrity of the committee. He said he would wish to consult members regularly. It was 'very important that the chairman makes a conscious effort to talk to members individually to address any concerns and to seek their advice.' Sir Thomas faces a delicate task balancing the views of members ranging from Labour's Ms Diane Abbott on the left to the Tories' Mr Barry Legg on the right.</p>

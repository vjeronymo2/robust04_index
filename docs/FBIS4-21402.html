			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Almut Jandel: "When Experts Fertilize the Soil, </F> the Drinking Water Remains Pure"]    [Text]  <H5>  For the Fourth Time, the VDI Regional Association of </H5> Osnabruck Organizes the Technical Conference "Environmentally  Friendly Agriculture"  <H5>  Ground-water protection requires new thinking in agriculture </H5>   Obtaining drinking water in rural areas is impaired to a  considerable degree by agriculture. Can pesticide and fertilizer  consulting, a water tax, or ecological cultivation methods  provide lasting protection for ground water? This question was  examined by the Regional Association of Osnabruck.    The requirements of healthy conditions for life include  clean  air, unpolluted soil and pure water. In most regions, however,  the environment has been disturbed by the far-reaching actions  of mankind. A matter of concern for the working group on process  technology of the VDI Regional Association of Osnabruck is to  discuss environmental problems in their own region and to list  solution approaches. The conference series of "Environmentally  Friendly Agriculture" was initiated from these considerations.  The VDI Regional Association, with the Center for the  Environment and Technology, and the Osnabruck City Department of  Works organized this series for the fourth time. The topic of  protecting the ground water was the central theme of the last  conference.    Obtaining water in rural areas, e.g., even in the area of  Osnabruck, is impaired to a great degree by agriculture. To  increase yield, large quantities of nitrate and pesticides are  applied to the fields. After a time delay, some of these  materials appear in the ground water and must be removed by the  water treatment plants at great expense to be able to supply  drinking water with the prescribed quality.    What can be done to reduce the introduction of nitrates and  pesticides into the ground water? Horst Wieligmann, from the  Osnabruck City Department of Works, presented an initiative. The  Osnabruck City Department of Works has now purchased fields,  stopped the intensive agriculture there and leased the land with  a great amount of support for ecological cultivation.  "Unfortunately, the market situation for grain, fruit and  vegetables cultivated ecologically is so poor that no farmer can  be advised to do this," complains Horst Wieligmann about the  current situation. Ecological agriculture makes do without  pesticides. However, the harvest is poorer than in conventional  agriculture, and soil cultivation must be more intensive and  incurs greater expense. For the use of fertilizer, balance  sheets are drawn up. In these sheets, the quantity of fertilizer  used, e.g., liquid manure, is correlated with the consumption of  the individual types of grain or plants.    "On a biofarm, nitrogen is always scarce and costs the  farmer  5 to 10 Deutsche marks per kg," calculates the farmer Dipl.-Ing.  agr. Rudolf Joost-Meyer zu Bakum. He was of the opinion that a  reduction of nitrate could be achieved in conventional  agriculture if, first, the use of fertilizer was optimized and,  second, mineral nitrogen would become more expensive by 300 to  700%. "Use of nitrogen must be controlled on a market  economy  basis." Important prerequisites for converting conventional  farms are motivation of the farm management, capital for  additional technology, market desire, and comprehensive  specialized advice.    In Baden-Wurttemberg, a regulation applying uniformly over  the entire Land was enacted for the utilization of agricultural  fields to protect the ground water. In this way, a legal  instrument was created that made it possible to enact  regulations based on scientific knowledge as minimum  requirements for agriculture and to facilitate the conversion  without incurring financial penalties and by means of intensive  consultation. Problems that occur can be solved in research  projects, model tests and pilot projects. A series of  requirements and bans is contained in the regulation. For  example, these include a plowing ban for permanent meadowland,  restrictions on fertilization and irrigation, and even the  restriction of soil cultivation. Only pesticides specified in a  positive list may be used.  <H5>  Conversion of cultivation methods without financial penalties </H5>   Jochen Mund is the construction director in Ministry for the  Environment of Baden-Wurttemberg. He placed special emphasis on  the fact that converting the cultivation methods must occur  without economic disadvantages. The regulation ensures a  financial compensation of 310.00 Deutsche marks per hectare or a  lump sum. The water intake fee (0.10 Deutsche  marks/m[.sup]3[/]), that the Land demands of the water-supply  and distribution system, is used for the compensation payments.    Mund says that initial experience with the regulation shows  that reducing nitrogen fertilization alone is not sufficient.  Additional measures, e.g., reduced soil cultivation, sodding, no  fallow land, restrictions in problem areas and culture, are  required. Reactions in the ground water, even with this, are not  to be expected in the short term. The interplay of many measures  and the elimination of many traditional methods will, in the  opinion of Jochen Mund, help the regulation achieve the  necessary success. "If experts fertilize the corn, the drinking  water will remain pure." His motto clearly shows that a great  need of optimization exists. Sufficient consultation, controlled  tests, optimization of the cultivation method and soil tests  before fertilizer is used can lead to a minimization of the  nitrate pollution in the ground water over the long term.    In the area of Osnabruck, a cooperative project between  agriculture and the water-supply and distribution system,  supported by the Land of Lower Saxony, was started in 1991. The  goal of this project was to make provisions for ground water  protection by advising farmers. This project is being run by the  Weser-Ems Chamber of Agriculture and it is being supported  financially by the Osnabruck City Department of Works. Ulrich  Wordemann is the agricultural director for the Weser-Ems Chamber  of Agriculture. He presented the project. As the starting point,  utilization and cultivation conditions were determined on a  voluntary basis to make possible optimization of fertilizer use.  At the same time, demonstration fields with fertilization  appropriate for the need were cultivated so as to show the  results of this cultivation to the farmers. Until now, only a  few farmers who are regularly keeping field impact card files  are participating in this project. These card files are  evaluated on a scale greater than a single farm to be able to  follow the nutrient cycle. The quick determination of the  ammonia concentration in liquid manure that shows the farmer how  much fertilizer he has applied has proven to be an important  instrument in this project. The object of all these measures is  to make the farmer an expert who views ground water protection  as a matter of concern to him personally.</p>

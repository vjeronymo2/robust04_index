			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters have argued that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (``AEA''), mandates NRC support of education, and that accordingly the NRC must restore the educational exemption to conform to that mandate. In this regard, some commenters made the point that their facilities were originally funded or provided to them by the AEC or other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission acknowledges its longstanding policy of supporting education, and believes that such support has been vital to the success of nuclear and nuclear-related education. That notwithstanding, the Commission does not view its education policy, or the exhortatory language of the AEA, as mandating that colleges and universities be exempt from NRC fees. The Commission has decided to restore the fee exemption as a policy matter, not a matter of legal compulsion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many educational institutions commented that it made little sense to charge them annual fees when much of their nuclear-education funding was derived from Federal agencies such as the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. Another commenter argued that State agencies were nonprofit in nature and should be exempted in the same manner as colleges and universities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission for reasons discussed above decided to reinstate the exemption for nonprofit educational institutions. The fact that a number of these institutions received funding from Federal agencies was not a factor in the final decision. The Commission's decision was based primarily on who received the benefits of the services rendered, rather than who funded the underlying activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also notes that it charges fees to other governmental licensees, including both Federal and State agencies. (Virtually no Federal agencies are charged user fees under part 170 due to a prohibition against such fees in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, see 31 U.S.C. 9701.) It finds no basis for changing its historical policy with respect to these entities in this rulemaking. This issue is addressed in the Commission's Report to Congress on fee policy, cited earlier in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some educational commenters stated that they should fall under the category of small entities, and asked whether the definition of ``small entity'' could be broadened to include a greater number of institutions than currently fall within the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission intends to re-examine the size standards it uses to define small entities within the context of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Commission will conduct this review within the context of the proposed revisions of small business size standards proposed by the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') (58 FR 46573; September 2, 1993). The Commission will not complete its review until the SBA promulgates a final rule containing the revised size standards. Until these activities are completed, it would be premature to address this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Action_Changes Included in Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made only one change to its FY 1993 final rule establishing annual and user fee schedules for that fiscal year. As it proposed, the Commission has amended &sect;171.11 to exempt nonprofit educational institutions from annual fees. The new exemption provision is identical to that contained in the FY 1991 and 1992 final fee rules. Because the final fee schedule for FY 1993 has already been issued, the Commission will not be charging any other licensees for the fees that would have been paid for FY 1993 by the newly exempt group of licensees. For that reason, no new fee schedule is being published at this time. A revised NRC fee schedule incorporating these changes and billing other licensees for the FY 1994 exemption's costs will be included in the FY 1994 proposed fee rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

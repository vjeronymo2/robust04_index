			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / McDonald's hit by Mississippi River A McDonald's billboard in West Quincy, Illinois, submerged at the weekend after the Mississippi River broke through a levee protecting the only passable bridge along a 200-mile stretch of river from St Louis to Burlington, Iowa. Volunteers had struggled day and night for six weeks to maintain a sandbag barrier that was keeping open the Bayview Bridge to Quincy. But on Friday night the barrier gave way, and rushing water covered up to 14,000 acres including the entrance to the bridge. As rain again drenched the region yesterday, rising waters drove more people from their homes, swamped towns and severed road and rail links. The crest of the floods reached St Louis and meteorologists said the weather patterns causing heavy rain could continue for several weeks. The floods, among the Mississippi's worst on record, have inundated hundreds of thousands of acres, driven at least 30,000 people from their homes and created what Vice-President Al Gore compared to a sixth Great Lake.</p>

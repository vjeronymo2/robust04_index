			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAURIE SHIELDS; FORMED WOMEN'S LEAGUE  </P> <P> Laurie Shields, one of two California women who organized the national Older  Women's League in 1981, died Friday.  </P> <P> She was 68 and died at her home in Oakland of breast cancer, said league  spokeswoman Mary Gardner Jones in a statement issued in Washington.  </P> <P> "Laurie Shields was an indomitable woman who was fired by concern for displaced  homemakers and older women -- women confronted by widowhood, divorce and sex  and age discrimination," said Lou Glasse, president of the Older Women's  League.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Team Effort  </P> <P> "Women all across the country have lost a powerful force," Glasse said. "She  will be missed."  </P> <P> With Tish Sommers, who died in 1985, Ms. Shields started a grass-roots movement  for older women's rights which now is a Washington-based organization with  17,000 members and 120 chapters nationwide. Earlier, in 1975, they had founded  the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers Among the league's many targets are  inequities facing older women in the job market, in pension plans, Social  Security and insurance benefits.  </P> <P> Using the slogan "Don't Agonize -- Organize," the two women helped inspire  federal legislation that set up job training and counseling centers for what  they called "displaced homemakers" -- housewives whose lives changed  drastically in middle-age because of a divorce or death of a husband.  </P> <P> Ms. Shields had painful personal knowledge of the problems of older women.  After her husband died in 1970, "she found herself unable to get a job because  of age discrimination," the league said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Book Published  </P> <P> Ms. Shields and Ms. Sommers wrote a book called, "Women Take Care," about the  experience of care givers. It was published after Ms. Sommers' death.  </P> <P> During a national book tour, Ms. Shields said that the care-giving movement  should support those who choose not to be care givers as well as those who do.  </P> <P> "Although I chose to be a care giver twice . . . it's not a role that is  everyone's cup of tea," she said. "We must work together to prevent society  from force-feeding it to the women simply because it is perceived to be a  woman's role."  </P> <P> Born in Chicago, Ms. Shields worked in merchandise and advertising before  marrying. She is survived by a daughter.  </P></p>

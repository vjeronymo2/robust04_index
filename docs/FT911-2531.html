			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / US personal consumption spending up in March US SPENDING on personal consumption rose modestly in March, for the second month in succession, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Separate figures showed a small increase in the sales of new houses - another sign that the US housing market is recovering slowly. After allowing for inflation, personal consumption rose 0.5 per cent in March over February. This followed a 0.8 per cent increase in February and a fall of 1 per cent in January. The increase partly reflected lower personal saving in recent months. Real personal incomes rose only 0.2 per cent last month, having fallen 0.8 per cent in January and remained flat in February. The small increase in incomes and spending is contrasted with continuing falls in production and employment. For the first quarter as a whole, real gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent. Sales of new houses rose 1 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000. This followed an 18.5 per cent jump in sales in February over January. The market, however, remains relatively weak.</p>

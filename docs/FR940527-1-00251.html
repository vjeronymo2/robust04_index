			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under many health reform proposals, including the President's plan, most individuals would obtain their health coverage from a health plan that participates in local purchasing alliance. Under some proposals, persons eligible for Medicaid, along with Medicare enrollees who choose to obtain coverage through the risk program, also would receive coverage and health services from a health plan that competes in the local alliance. Therefore, the ability to establish equitable premium payments among competing plans will be important for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees, as well as for all other citizens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes payment equity among competing health plans will be critical to preserving the long-term viability of competition within each purchasing alliance. In addition, equitable payment is necessary to promote and maintain equal access to health services among different population groups, including Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accurate adjustment of plan premiums to reflect the risk composition of plan enrollment is essential to achieve payment equity among competing health plans. Fair risk adjustment methods are important for two reasons. First, risk adjustment would ensure that all plans are able to provide a comparable quantity and mix of health services to enrollees with comparable needs. In the absence of effective risk adjustment, plans that enroll high-risk persons would be forced to limit access to needed services or take a financial loss. Moreover, such plans would be unable to offer competitive premium rates over the long run. Conversely, plans that enroll low-risk persons would be able to provide a richer mix of services or make windfall financial gains. Consequently, these plans would be able to offer favorable premium rates, thereby securing a competitive advantage. Second, without effective risk adjustment, competing health plans would have a strong incentive to try to attract a favorable selection of enrollees while avoiding high-risk persons. This could lead to unequal access to care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current methods of risk adjustment appear to have serious deficiencies. Risk adjustment involves using information about individuals' demographic characteristics, health status, or recent use of health services to predict future expenditures for health care. Research suggests that even the best combination of available risk indicators accounts for only a small proportion of the variability in subsequent expenditures among individuals. Therefore, substantial improvements in these methods and the data to support them are urgently needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until improved risk adjustment methods can be developed, the financial risks and undesirable incentives associated with unfavorable selection could be limited in other ways. This goal could be accomplished by compensating plans for a portion of any large losses they experience in providing care to enrollees with extraordinary medical expenses. This could be done using the traditional reinsurance mechanisms of the private insurance industry. In this case, health plans could choose to purchase insurance against the occurrence of an adverse claims experience that results in spending that is much higher than expected. Such insurance would relieve some of the undesirable consequences of ineffective risk adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, plans' financial risks could be reduced by a mandatory outlier policy analogous to the outlier payment policy under PPS. Under this policy, all plans' premium revenues would be taxed to provide an outlier payment fund. This fund would be used to make additional payments to any plan that experiences large losses in providing care to individual enrollees with extraordinary expenses. Such payments would cover a high proportion of the loss in excess of a fixed loss threshold. Consequently, this mechanism also would limit plans' losses to the extent that they were attributable to unfavorable selection. Therefore, it also would mitigate the unwanted effects of inadequate risk adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 7: Controlling Medicare Spending Across All Sites of Care <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Medicare should continue to develop policies to monitor and control total expenditure growth across all sites of care. Payment methods should not unduly favor the choice of one site over another. They should also provide consistent incentives to constrain increases in volume and service intensity across physicians and other providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission endorses the development of prospective payment methods for all services across all sites. These methods should be designed to offer uniform incentives for efficiency as well as make payments across sites more comparable. This is particularly important because many services are available in alternative settings. Prospective methods alone, however, will not address one of the major reasons for expenditure growth: increased volume and intensity of services. Medicare's physician payment method incorporates such incentives through its volume performance standards by adjusting fees to reflect the relationship between actual expenditures and an expenditure target. Other providers are not subject to such direct volume control measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Premium caps in the President's proposal provide incentives for health plans to constrain price and service volume across all settings for non-Medicare enrollees. The modifications to Medicare policies included in the Health Security Act do not incorporate similar incentives. While the Medicare provisions of the President's plan generally would reduce the growth in per service payments, spending increases likely would persist due to accelerating volume. The Medicare program, therefore, should continue to develop volume control methods for all sites of care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The contribution of expanding utilization to expenditure growth is well-illustrated by Medicare's home health program. Home health agency charges per visit increased only 4.7 percent annually between 1988 and 1991, yet Medicare expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 10.8 percent. As another example, the Medicare payment rate for dialysis services has not risen since 1985, yet expenditures increased at an annual rate of 12.4 percent through 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several strategies for constraining volume have been identified. One approach is to combine, or bundle, separately billable services into a single payment unit. A volume performance standard like the one implemented for physician payment is another method. Finally, managed care arrangements have the potential to control utilization and encourage care in the most appropriate setting. From a policy standpoint, each of these methods provides certain advantages and disadvantages. Each also presents different implementation issues. The Medicare program should develop the most appropriate ways to achieve volume and price control across all services and sites of care. The approaches selected should create consistent incentives for all providers in all settings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare benefit and payment policies are fragmented and at times inconsistent across sites and providers. Improvements in these policies are needed to ensure stable incentives to slow the growth in spending. These changes should reward efficient resource use while improving the continuum of care for Medicare beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 8: Strengthening Medicare's Risk Contracting Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recommends that the Secretary improve Medicare's risk-based, managed care program to give more Medicare beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans. To increase plan participation, deficiencies related to the risk adjustment formula and local differences in payments need to be corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare's risk-based, managed care program has been shown to improve access and, in some cases, to provide a broader array of services to Medicare beneficiaries. The program also may have the potential to be cost effective for Medicare, particularly if evaluated over several years.Furthermore, increased emphasis on risk-based, managed care is consistent with the President's health care reform proposal. Despite these advantages and the growth of managed care in the private sector, only 5 percent of all Medicare enrollees participate in Medicare's managed care program. One reason for the low participation may be the limited availability of managed care options. Health plans have been reluctant to participate in Medicare's risk-based program because of concerns related to Medicare's payment method. The Commission recommends that HCFA step up its efforts to improve the methods for determining payments to risk-based, managed care plans, thereby making this option more available to Medicare beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

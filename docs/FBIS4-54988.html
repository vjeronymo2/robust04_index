			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The 30th international meeting of  tourism journalists has begun in Makarska. The meeting is  attended by about 150 journalists, including as many as 100  foreign reporters. The meeting was opened by Minister of  Tourism Niko Bulic. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and Ivica  Mudrinic, minister of maritime affairs, transport and  communications also attended. Jadran Marinkovic reports from  Makarska:    [Marinkovic] Tourism is Croatia's main branch of the  economy.  That is our commitment and economic priority, Prime Minister  Nikica Valentic said in Makarska today. Last year we earned 1  billion German marks [DM] from tourism, and this year we will  double that figure. However, our final goal is for that sum to  reach 5 or 6 billion marks in the near future. There will be no  more war on Croatian territory, Prime Minister Valentic said  resolutely. Many questions by journalists from 12 European  countries focused on the safety of our coast and relations with  the local Serbs, that is, the occupied areas. Mr. Valentic had  the following to say about this:    [Begin Valentic recording] Croatia has done and is still  doing everything to solve the problem of the occupied areas and  the reintegration of those Croatian areas into Croatia's  constitutional and legal system by peaceful means, without war.  I can assure you that Croatia has enough economic power and  military might to liberate those area by military means. The  Croatian Government and the Croatian state will not resort to  those methods. We will do everything -- although that takes  more time and stirs certain unrest among our population -- in  order to reintegrate those areas exclusively by peaceful means.    We have the world's support in doing this. On behalf of the  Croatian Government, I guarantee you that there will be no war  on the Croatian territory because the Croatian Government will  not resort to force to solve that problem.

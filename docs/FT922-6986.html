			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Soccer it and see WHILE the British parliament yesterday debated the pros and cons of European integration, the streets of London assumed a continental air. Baking sun, waving flags and the sing-song accents of Spanish and Italian football fans added to the cosmopolitan feel. The European cup final was in town. But the British were only spectators, a fitting finale to the dismal standard of football in this year's English football league. Last Sunday against Brazil, England's national team was made to look leaden, prompting from the manager an uncharacteristic footballing understatement, that his squad 'lacks individual flair'. Yet while Europe's politicians ponder and prevaricate, the people's sport is pushing out to new borders. Yesterday the European Football Union (UEFA) decided that clubs from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia can enter European competitions; the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine and Georgia are knocking on the door. European integration is the key to English football's salvation. The trend towards big clubs and European competition is commercially unstoppable. That the contract to televise English football has apparently been awarded to a European-based satellite company is a sign of things to come. Europe may not have a single currency by the end of the decade, but it certainly should have a European soccer league. The top few English clubs will then have to emulate the skills of continental Europeans, or get beaten by them every week.</p>

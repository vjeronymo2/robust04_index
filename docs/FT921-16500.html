			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: The word is out on silent trucks The Austrians started it all. Tired of hearing its citizens grumble about the noise from trucks rumbling along their roads at night on the transit routes between Italy and Germany, the government decided to act. For two years, lorries passing through Austria after dark have had to conform to noise levels in advance of EC standards. Only vehicles that do not exceed 80 decibels (A) - the A denotes a measurement based on the human ear - are allowed on Austria's motorways between 10pm and 5am. This level, roughly that of normal traffic heard from 10m away, compares with 60dB for conversation at a distance of one metre and 100dB or more for discotheque noise. The generally accepted threshold of pain is 130dB. Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, so a reduction of 4dB means a 60 per cent drop in noise. For the truckmakers, the tighter Austrian rules posed problems, and the manufacturers did not have much time to adjust their designs. 'Austria was very much the forerunner,' says Klaus Schubert, technical director of German truckmaker MAN Nutzfahrzeuge. The EC, which currently insists on 84dB for new trucks compared with 88dB before October 1990, will not reach 80dB until 1995, though this will apply to both day and night driving. MAN trucks, part of the MAN engineering group, has researched vehicle noise since 1965 and reckons it has a head start, though its rivals are also working hard. However, there is no single obvious solution to the noise problem. 'Getting down to 80dB means lots of small steps in development,' says Karl Feitzelmeyer, head of testing at MAN trucks. Progress has come from improvements in components such as gearboxes, use of more rigid engine blocks, more efficient fuel-burning and the partial enclosure of noise-producing areas, such as engines and transmission equipment, with sound-absorbent plastics. Propeller shaft vibration has been largely eliminated through better design, while air suspension reduces mechanical rattling. In 1989, the company introduced its MAN Silent range, which performs better in noise tests than conventional trucks. The range incorporates all the above features and costs 5 to 10 per cent more than standard trucks. So far, MAN has sold around 4,000 Silent trucks for the Austrian market. Other markets are opening up: the Netherlands, for example, provides special tax incentives for purchases of quieter trucks. On a test track in Munich, two trucks from the Silent range were recently put through their paces against a standard vehicle. All three gave full acceleration from a speed of around 40kph (25mph) past a microphone and sound measuring apparatus. The Silent trucks were definitely quieter, the ear's impression backed up by the evidence on the graph. This showed that the Silent vehicles recorded 80dB and 79dB, with the standard truck clocking up 84dB. At higher speeds, the difference was less marked. Above 60kph, the noise from tyres and road surface predominates, so that manufacturers can achieve nothing on their own - although the MAN Silent trucks are fitted with specially quiet tyres. Schubert hopes future tyre standards will cover noise as well as maximum speed, load and air pressure, making it easier to integrate them with truck manufacture. Further progress on noise will be difficult; as Schubert notes, 'we are near the limits'. MAN's present range of standard trucks dates from 1986 and is one-third of the way through its lifecycle. It can retro-fit its non-Silent trucks to meet Austrian requirements. Noise-related improvements increase the weight of the vehicle and make servicing and repairs more awkward. There is also a conflict between making trucks easier on the ear and maintaining traction and drive qualities. Yet the time will come, reckons Schubert, when most of MAN's output consists of noise-reduced trucks. Owners are waking up to the evils of noise, but only because the laws are making them do so.</p>

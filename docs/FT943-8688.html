			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / After the party, it's back to basics: Advertising agencies, wiser after the 1980s' binge, have turned the corner Maurice Saatchi may not know it, but in the past few days there are those in the City of London who have bestowed on him a symbolic significance as the first cuckoo of the advertising industry's spring. For much of the wintry 1990s, the chairman of the world's highest-profile advertising group (though these days far from its largest), has delegated to his henchmen the task of briefing City observers on the group's relentlessly poor performance. Last week, at briefings on the group's interim results, Maurice Saatchi took centre stage, flashing up slides showing impressive upward-rising trend lines. 'His appearance is as good an indicator as any of an upturn in the sector,' said one industry expert. Apart from this personal appearance there are other, more conventional, signs that advertising - which paid with a huge hangover for its excesses in the 1980s - is getting ready to party again. Zenith, the media-buying company owned by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, sees worldwide advertising expenditure growing, at current prices, by 5.5 per cent this year, compared with 3.4 per cent in 1993. In December, Zenith forecast that 1995 advertising expenditure would grow by 6.5 per cent; its latest estimate is 7.4 per cent growth. Similarly, the forecast for 1996 was uprated this month from 7.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. This growth level will not be geographically uniform, however: Europe is expected to see 8.1 per cent growth in 1995 and 9.7 per cent in 1996; the US, 4.1 per cent next year and 4.4 per cent in 1996; and Japan, 1.4 per cent for 1995 and 2.4 per cent the following year. Saatchi set the trend in March, when it announced it had returned to the black, for the first time since 1988, in its full-year results for 1993; last week's first-half figures showed pre-tax profits up 68 per cent to Pounds 15.3m. At WPP, the agency which supplanted Saatchi as the biggest in the world and which also announced its interim results last week, pre-tax profits rose 50 per cent to Pounds 36.2m. But not everyone is getting excited. Mr Martin Sorrell, the ex-Saatchi finance director who now heads WPP, flatly refuses to exaggerate the industry's prospects. He says if the company's performance for the first six months of this year is examined, there has been 'continued significant growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, in the UK, and a small pick-up in continental Europe. The bottom line is it's better than it has been.' As Mr Sorrell says, advertising spending has lagged the wider upturn in the economy. The advertising cycle is an exaggeration of the economic cycle, says Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst with S G Warburg Securities, the investment bank. 'It always grows faster than the economy at the top and always falls further than the economy at the bottom,' mainly because it is a variable, rather than a fixed cost. Before the last recession took hold in the early 1990s, the industry believed it had gained immunity from malaises afflicting the wider economy. It was the 1981 recession, which was largely confined to manufacturing rather than service industry, which gave rise to this belief. According to Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, in the 1980s many in the industry believed that companies had 'understood the defensive imperative of continuing to advertise through the recession in order to protect market share'. From the early 1980s until 1989, Ms Tilbian says the advertising industry was 'one big jamboree. It was acquisitions every month and all in different geographical areas and in different related services'. WPP and Saatchi paid inflated prices for US agencies, acquiring huge debts to fund the acquisitions. The event that sums up the era was Saatchi's abortive bid for Midland Bank in 1987. 'Everybody talks about the bid as the time when the business was at its maddest,' says one industry observer. 'Its delusions of grandeur were such that, as a simple service business, it could bid for one of the clearing banks, and actually expect to be taken seriously. And for a moment it was.' Midland, roughly twice as big as Saatchi, rejected the idea out of hand. Unlike the recession of a decade ago, the 1990s downturn sank many in the sector. Saatchi and WPP are only now getting debts down to manageable proportions. From having operating margins of a high of more than 13 per cent in the peak year of 1988, Saatchi reached a trough of 2.3 per cent three years later. The broad thrust of the restructuring at both Saatchi and WPP has been to cut jobs, reduce costs and sell non-core businesses acquired during the jamboree. These moves combined with the more recent increases in revenes should bring margins at both groups back up to 10 per cent by 1996. Given these signs of advertising's recovery, could the whole giddy process of boom and bust start again? No chance, is the consensus. For a start, advertisers have learnt certain lessons during the lean times which they will want to continue to apply. For example, a recent survey conducted jointly by the Financial Times and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, among chief executives and finance and marketing directors, found a sharper scrutiny of budgets and a greater demand for accountability from advertising agencies. Perhaps the most significant change of all, which will prevent the windfall profits that advertising saw during the last boom, is the change in the way agencies are remunerated. Commission of 15 per cent on a client's media spending used to be the norm. A survey by specialist UK advertising accountants Willott Kingston Smith recently found that agencies are now about as likely to get their income from fees as commission in the UK, and the picture is likely to be much the same in continental Europe and north America. Overall, the move from fees to commission is seen as a stabilising factor by Andrew Brown, director-general of the UK's Advertising Association, the industry umbrella organisation. 'The commission system has swings and roundabouts. Agencies do well on the commission system when the business is doing well. In times of recession, agencies would prefer to be on fees,' he says. Some way has to be found to allow agencies to run themselves more sensibly, avoiding the huge ups and downs, he adds. Finally, Ms Tilbian of S G Warburg Securities, argues that, this time round, agencies will be forced to 'stick to the knitting'. No more will they be able to persuade the City that the dreaded word 'synergy' has any meaning in the sector. It was synergy which was supposed to have justified the binge of acquisitions by agencies of management consultancies, public relations firms, recruitment agencies - and even Saatchi's assault on banking. The synergies proved illusory and many of the businesses have since been sold off. 'At the end of the day you're as strong as your weakest link when you try to sell all your services to your clients,' says Ms Tilbian. 'If one of them botches up, then you could lose your most valued business. For advertising, it's back to basics.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------ World advertising expenditure  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Current price (year on year % change)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                   1992/93      1993/94      1994/95      1995/96  ------------------------------------------------------------------ North America         2.9          3.1          4.1          4.4 Europe                2.3          5.4          8.1          9.7 Asia/Pacific          0.3          7.5          9.7         13.0 Latin America        26.1         13.3         16.1         14.9 Rest of World        11.8         14.6         11.3         10.5  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                 3.4          5.5          7.4          8.8  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Zenith  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Cookery: A fine kettle of turbot - A dinner party treat ON JULY 14 the Earl of Bradford announced plans to storm the culinary bastions of Paris: in October ten master chefs of Great Britain will descend on the George V hotel to cook for French food writers, chefs and gourmets. The idea is to show the French that there is more to British foods than smoked salmon, oysters, roast beef and steamed treacle pudding. The menu they have chosen comprises clear oxtail soup with parsley dumplings; a platter of fish including potted crab, soused mackerel, jellied eel and marinated haddock; pot roast partridge with caraway flavoured cabbage; blackberry and apple crumble with mead ice-cream; and British farmhouse cheeses. May a good time be had by all. Meanwhile, as October is a long way off, I have had fun working out a summer menu of good British foods that eschew the stereotype choices of asparagus, salmon, lamb and strawberries. This meal might begin with a selection of cold cured meats, Welsh salt duck, Macon (mutton ham), Lincolnshire chine and York or Bradenham ham, among them. For the main course there would be turbot, arguably Britain's finest fish and an old fashioned favourite but all too rarely served these days. The fish would be cooked whole and served in the time-honoured British way, not with a butter-rich sauce, but with one that is delicately creamy, lightly thickened with flour and laced with shrimps. Braised cucumber and garden peas would make choice accompaniments. Finally, for pudding, I suggest a puff pastry gooseberry pie, the fruit sweetened with splash of elderflower syrup, served with crinkle-skinned clotted cream. TURBOT WITH SHRIMP SAUCE serves 6 Whole turbot, which can weigh 20 lb or more and was once the great dish of grand dinners, is not something you will find on many fishmongers' slabs these days. Yet a small turbot, or chicken turbot as it is charmingly called, remains a fine choice for a special occasion and is well worth ordering for a small dinner party. The traditional way to cook turbot is to poach it in a diamond shaped kettle. More junk shops than kitchen shops stock turbot kettles now but they can still be picked up cheaply at country house sales: useful for cooking hams as well as fish. In the absence of a suitable kettle, bake turbot, wrapping it in buttered foil with sea salt, pepper, bay leaves and slices of lemon. Lay the baggy parcel on a large baking tray and cook for about 45 minutes at 350'F-375'F (180'C-190'C) gas mark 4-5. 1 chicken turbot weighing 3 1/2 -4 lb; 1-2 pt milk; 2 bay leaves; 2 lemons; a bunch of parsley. For the sauce:  1/2 lb cooked prawns in the shell; 4 oz potted shrimps;  1/2 oz each butter and flour;  1/2 - 3/4 pt creamy milk; 1/4 pt cream; 1 slice of onion, 1 bay leaf and half a dozen lightly bruised black peppercorns tied in a piece of buttermuslin. Make the sauce first as it can be prepared ahead and reheated in a double-boiler when needed. Shell the prawns, reserving the flesh to garnish the turbot. Put the shells into a saucepan with the buttermuslin bag of flavourings and  1/2 pt milk. Bring to simmering point, cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for 10 minutes. Remove the buttermuslin bag and whizz the remaining contents of the pan in a food processor for 10 seconds only. Strain the pink shellfish-flavoured liquid through a fine sieve, pressing to extract every flavoursome drop. Measure and top up with extra milk to bring the level back to half a pint or just over. Make a roux with the butter and flour (using the spiced butter that seals the potted shrimps, if liked) and cook for a couple of minutes. Blend in the milk away from the heat, then let the sauce simmer very gently for 5 minutes or so stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt, pepper, maybe a little lemon juice, and thin with the cream. Stir in the potted shrimps and heat through gently. Make an incision down the length of the turbot's backbone on the dark skinned side to prevent curling during cooking. Lay the fish in the kettle, dark side down. Add slices of lemon, a couple of bay leaves, a few peppercorns and a mixture of milk and water to cover. Bring to a bare simmer and cook very gently indeed for 12-15 minutes or so until the flesh is no longer transparent and comes clean from the bone. Drain the fish well, saving the milky liquor for soups. Lay it on a handsome dish, garnish with the peeled prawns, little bouquets of parsley and wedges of lemon. Hand round the sauce separately.</p>

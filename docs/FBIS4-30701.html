			<p>CSO     [Text] According to performance such as major petrochemical  product production in May announced on 16 June by the  Petrochemical Industry Association (Chairman Hajime Murata),  production of the four major resins such as polyethylene each  increased compared to the same month of the previous year. The  increase rate, starting with high-density polyethylene (HDPE)  which was 8 percent, was 6 percent for both low-density  polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), and 3 percent for  polypropylene (PP). The four resins all have exceeded the same  month of the previous year since November 1991.    Production increased "because previously sluggish domestic  demand recovered" (Petrochemical Industry Association). Viewing  domestic shipment amounts, LDPE and HDPE each were the same as  the same month of the previous year; PP increased 2 percent and  PS increased 1 percent. That for electrical machinery, VTR's  [video tape recorders], and others slumped, but that for  television and air conditioners increased. In addition, that for  wrapping material and sundries also increased.    In exports, on the other hand, PS for Southeast Asia was  favorable, but overall it leveled off, affected by the high yen.  As a result, the total amount of shipments was at about the same  level as the previous year for the four resins. Inventory is  piling, up with regularly scheduled repairs to production  facilities drawing close.    Production of ethylene, which is the basic raw material of  petrochemicals, was 519,700 tons, an increase of 6 percent  compared to the same month of the previous year.</p>

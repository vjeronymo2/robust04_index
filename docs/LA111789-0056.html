			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Matt Mullican's "Untitled (Bath Stone)" is a vast, low-lying swath of limestone  slabs carved with the plan of a model city, a metaphysical construct that has  preoccupied the artist throughout this decade. (The title refers to the English  city in which the piece was carved.)  </P> <P> Two oval areas on this plan contain incised clusters of images. One group  consists of familiar pictographs from the international sign system the artist  incorporates into most of his works -- the little images that announce nearby  amenities (telephone, restaurant) and indicate proper social behavior (a figure  throwing litter in a basket). Carved into the other "image bank" are rows of  generic insects, plants and animals.  </P> <P> Mullican's use of such images hinges on the viewer's easy recognition of these  signs. By grouping them in mind-boggling arrays, he calls into question their  seemingly fixed meanings and invites the viewer to devise personal  alternatives. What is the relationship between the food chain represented in  one image bank and the human imagery and consumer goods crammed together in the  other? The answers seem to be entirely up to the whims of the imagination.  </P> <P> Other, two-dimensional work on view includes "Untitled (Round House)," a large  acrylic and oil stick grisaille painting of the interior of a circular building  used to switch locomotives. An incongruous billboard in this space repeats the  city plan image, teasing the mind with a competing "fictional reality." The  blurred, grainy quality of the painting makes it look like a second-generation  copy of an original we don't get to see. It seems of a piece with Mullican's  musings on the way the language systems we use reconstruct the world at a  second remove.

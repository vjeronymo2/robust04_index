			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEATING OF O.C. GIRL COMPARED TO BENSONHURST  </P> <P> Outraged over the Aug. 6 attack on a Garden Grove cheerleader that they believe  was racially motivated, black activists Friday condemned the handling of the  case by local auhorities and warned that it could become a "Bensonhurst West."  </P> <P> Fifteen-year-old Amber Jefferson, who is black, should have been at her first  cheerleading performance Friday. Instead, with her jaw wired shut and the side  of her face stitched together, she sat silently in a Yorba Linda church,  surrounded by black activists and the growing racial storm that her attack has  ignited.  </P> <P> Calling the criticism premature, authorities on Friday repeated pledges to  fully explore allegations that the girl was badly beaten by several whites  wielding bats and shouting racial slurs. But the black activists nonetheless  promised candlelight vigils, church meetings and a possible appeal to the state  for an independent investigation in coming weeks to vent their frustration.  </P> <P> "The sheriff's handling of this case is tantamount to tolerating racial  violence, which could very well lead to even worse incidents," said Mark  Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference of Greater Los Angeles at a press conference at Friendship Baptist  Church.  </P> <P> "Southern California does not need, nor should it invite, a situation that  would be branded nothing less than 'Bensonhurst West,' " Ridley-Thomas said,  flanked by local and state officials from the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union  and other groups involved in black civic affairs.  </P> <P> Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood, became a symbol of racial violence last  year after a black teen-ager, shopping for a used car, was attacked and killed  there by a white gang.  </P> <P> In the Orange County case, the racial elements in the attack are still in  dispute, with criminal charges recommended but not yet filed against anyone.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that (the critics) would prejudge this case," Dist. Atty.  Michael R. Capizzi said Friday. "What happened to Amber is obviously tragic,  but it's our responsibility to deal with it in a professional manner, not an  emotional one, and this case has got our attention at our highest levels."  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff Dennis LaDucer said of the critics: "We would hope that as  the facts of this case become known in the appropriate setting -- the courtroom  -- they will develop confidence in the intensity and thoroughness of our  efforts."  </P> <P> What is known so far is that Amber was badly beaten and slashed with a piece of  broken glass outside a Stanton apartment complex during a midnight brawl that  involved more than a dozen people -- on one side, mostly white teen-agers and a  42-year-old man; on the other, Amber and several black, white and Latino  teen-agers.  </P> <P> Some among the white group under investigation maintain that the fight was not  about race but was prompted by a jilted girl. Amber, by all accounts, was not  involved in the argument that triggered the fight. But somehow, in the end, she  was slashed with a piece of glass that left a deep gash on the side of her  face, and her jaw was broken, allegedly by a bat-wielding participant.  </P> <P> One 19-year-old woman at the center of the dispute acknowledged in an interview  this week that she shouted "nigger" in the midst of the fighting. But she said  her words were directed not at Jefferson, whose father is black and mother is  white, but at a white teen-ager whom she considered "stupid."  </P> <P> Earl Wimberly of Stanton, a 42-year-old construction worker whose role in the  attack is under investigation, watched television news reports of the  coalition's press conference and declared afterward, "Those people lie."  </P> <P> "I just don't think it's right," he said. "Why are they pushing this so far to  make it a racial thing?"  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's Department said initially that it was not  investigating the incident as a racial attack.  </P> <P> But under intense criticism from local activists, the department on Tuesday  recommended to the district attorney's office that it use a three-year old  state "hate-crime" law, for racially motivated attacks, against three of  Amber's alleged assailants. It also recommended a host of other assault and  criminal charges against up to a dozen participants on both sides of the fight.  </P> <P> But the activists, responding specifically to the Sheriff's Department's  recommendations, said they were not satisfied. At the press conference, they  questioned why some "victims" among Jefferson's group are under investigation,  and charged that authorities have effectively set up a "smoke screen" because  of the victim's race. Several also said they feared that the district  attorney's office would "dump" the case on a grand jury in order to further  stall prosecution, a prospect that Capizzi would not discuss.  </P> <P> "What I can't understand is how a 15-year-old girl could have her face slashed  so bad by someone so vicious," Amber's father, William, said as he fought back  tears. "If this is not a crime or an attack on a minority race, why did she  have to get hurt so bad?"  </P> <P> The father also suggested that if the victim in the attack had been white and  her attackers black, "someone would be in jail."  </P> <P> Declared Jose DeSosa, state president of the NAACP: "Racial hatred was there."  </P> <P> Press conference organizers declined a request from among the more than two  dozen media representatives to talk with Amber, who leaned occasionally on her  mother for support as she watched the speakers in silence.  </P> <P> Even with surgery, it could be months before Amber returns to school and years  before she regains full movement on the left side of her face, her family says.  For now, said her mother, Cody Donnelly, she takes food through a straw and  tries to cope with the emotional trauma of an attack that she does not fully  remember.  </P> <P> "The nightmares are the worst," her mother said Friday. "But we hope what these  people were doing for us today will do some good."  </P></p>

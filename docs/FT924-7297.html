			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: CFTC opens way for catastrophe contract dealing THE Chicago Board of Trade yesterday received regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for a range of new catastrophe insurance futures and options, allowing trading to begin on December 11. The catastrophe insurance futures contracts, originally announced in August this year, are designed to allow insurers to hedge underwriting risk associated with unexpected disasters. Mr William O'Connor, CBOT chairman, said the contracts 'will be the first in a new complex for a vital industry in need of efficient risk-management tools'. The futures contracts are to be based on figures for quarterly insured catastrophe losses nationwide and in three regions (eastern, midwestern and western) of the US. Trading of a contract based on figures for the US as a whole and the eastern region begins in December. There is no date set for trading for the contract based on midwestern and western figures. The catastrophe losses figures will be based on a large sample of reported incurred losses for a quarter caused by wind, hail, earthquake, riot or flood, as appropriate for each applicable property line. The data will be collat-ed by the Insurance Services Office, which collects claims-loss data for companies representing about 85 per cent of the US insurance industry. The price of a contract will reflect the market's expectation of a quarter's catastrophe loss in relation to that same quarter's estimated property premium. As severe catastrophes occur, or as frequency increases, the futures price is likely to increase. Alternatively as the loss quarter progresses with fewer than expected catastrophe losses the futures price could decline.</p>

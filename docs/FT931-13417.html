			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Branson to meet Marshall next week SIR Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive and deputy chairman, will meet Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, next week in a final attempt to end the conflict triggered by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. The meeting is expected to take place as early as Monday, amid growing indications that both sides are anxious to improve relations which have continued strained, in spite of BA's two public apologies and a Pounds 610,000 libel settlement. Virgin indicated last night that it wanted the issue resolved by the middle of next week, although it still threatens further legal action against BA in the US courts. BA is also keen to settle the damaging affair without further delay, but it is uncertain about the scale of Virgin's likely demands. Mr Branson is expected to insist on cash compensation for lost revenue arising out of its rival's campaign, as well as a legally binding agreement preventing any future abuse of Virgin's computer reservation information. Virgin also wants access again to BA's maintenance facilities for its aircraft. This access was withdrawn five years ago. Sir Colin emphasised this week he was anxious to establish better relations with Virgin, while Mr Branson has indicated he wants to avoid taking further legal action. Although BA's executive management is continuing its investigation into its marketing, public affairs and legal departments in the aftermath of the 'dirty tricks' campaign, no sackings or resignations have so far emerged. Shareholders are concerned that if BA fails to react forcefully and publicly, it could be vulnerable to adverse commercial circumstances.</p>

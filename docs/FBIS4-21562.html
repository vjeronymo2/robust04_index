			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Firm Stand"] </F>   [Text] If U.S. Senator Larry Pressler is quoting Indian  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao correctly and if the prime minister  is not refuting his claims, then Rao's assertions on defense  policy can be described as the most important statement of his  term -- the most important because the statement is directly  related to India's nuclear policy. Since the prime minister has  explained his viewpoint to Pressler and spoken on the  controversy currently raging in the United States on the  Pressler Amendment, there can be no other meaning to his alleged  statement. After assuming the reins of power, the Clinton  administration has tilted so much toward Pakistan that the  President -- restless to resume military aid to Pakistan --  considers the Pressler Amendment as a thorn in his way. The  amendment provides that Pakistan will not be eligible to receive  U.S. military aid unless and until the U.S. President certifies  that Islamabad is not pursuing its program to manufacture an  atom bomb. It was on this very ground that the former President  George Bush had stopped military aid to Pakistan. It will now  be difficult for Clinton to certify, contrary to his  predecessor's decision, that Pakistan is not pursuing a nuclear  bomb program. In the meantime, contrary to the above, many  facts have come to light that dispel any doubts about Pakistan's  ability and intention to manufacture a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile,  the Lockheed company is increasing pressure on President Clinton  to allow the supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. This proves  that, after failing in its bid to repeal the Pressler Amendment,  the Clinton administration has now thought of formulating the  policy of a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment to allow  the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and later making the  amendment operative again.    I is apparent that with the help of this policy, a sheer  humbuggery, the Clinton administration wants to make Pakistan  stronger than India by getting rid of the Pressler Amendment,  which will only result in the revival of the arms race in the  Indian Subcontinent. The policy also tacitly encourages  Pakistan to manufacture an atom bomb. India has thus far  adopted the policy of not making any nuclear weapon. In spite  of this, India has not yet signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] because it thinks NPT is unfair to the nonnuclear  states. However, if the United States chooses to patronize  Islamabad's nuclear policy on the pretext of supplying F-16  aircraft to Pakistan, then India will be forced to review its  nuclear options, and this is the very meaning of Prime Minister  Rao's alleged statement. If read in the context of our  government's disinterestedness in Raphel's planned visit to  India, the home minister's two warnings to the United States in  parliament, and the successful role played by the Indian  delegation at Geneva, one can derive the message that India's  future attitude toward the U.S. can be firm and admonitory.  Anything contrary will depend solely on the U.S. behavior.</p>

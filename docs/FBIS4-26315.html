			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister  Chien Fu has ended his American tour and flown to the Vatican  for a visit, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said Tuesday  [21 June].    Chien is the first Republic of China [ROC] foreign minister  to visit the Vatican in more than 10 years. The Vatican is the  only European country that maintains diplomatic relations with  the ROC.    During his stay in the city-state, Chien will chair an  annual  meeting of ROC officials stationed in Europe to review their  work over the past year and to chart new courses for future  work. Chien will then visit several European countries with  which the ROC does not have formal ties, the official said. He,  however, declined to reveal Chien's itinerary and with which  European officials Chien plans to meet. "Chien will brief the  press on his European tour after he returns on July 4," said the  official, who requested anonymity.    Chien left for the U.S. on June 15 to attend a seminar in  Beaver Creek, Colorado on major international concerns at the  invitation of former U.S. President Gerald Ford. After the  meeting, Chien visited his married daughter, who lives in the  United States. He left for the Vatican Monday (American time).</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Blair puts 'national renewal' at top of agenda for Labour: Favourite in leadership contest sets out strategy to fight next election Mr Tony Blair staked his claim to the Labour leadership yesterday by setting out a new economic and social agenda to redefine the ground on which the party will fight the next general election. In an interview with the Financial Times on the eve of his campaign's official launch later today, the favourite to succeed the late John Smith underlined his commitment to continue modernising the party. But mindful of the need to win support among trade unions and constituency activists, Mr Blair insisted that changing the party's policies did not mean uprooting its traditional values. Labour would retain its pledges to full employment and a minimum wage. But the party's links with the unions would be 'based on fairness and not on favours'. His prospectus for a programme of 'national renewal for the new millennium' came as Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the leader, announced formally that they would join the contest. Mr Prescott, a standard bearer for the party's traditionalists, said he would base his campaign on a commitment to full employment as an 'essential part of socialism'. Mrs Beckett, who like Mr Prescott will also contest the deputy leadership, said she offered continuity and stability. But as Mr Blair quickly gathered the overwhelming support of the shadow cabinet, even before his appearance this morning in his Sedgefield constituency, friends of the 41-year-old shadow home secretary were confident of a comfortable victory. Speaking in his constituency home Mr Blair said his ambition for Labour was to end 15 years in which it had been a party of protest. To do that it had to be capable of 'building a new coalition of support in the country that reaches out beyond its traditional boundaries of support'. Calling for an end to ideological battles over the respective roles of the market and the state, over public and private ownership and over regulation versus deregulation, Mr Blair said Labour must now define its own programme social justice. Labour would develop an economic strategy designed to extend opportunity through enhanced education and training, a co-operative rather than coercive industrial strategy, and a commitment to economic growth. 'The key to whether Britain succeeds in my view lies first of all in developing individual potential through education and skills. It is absolutely central.' But amid concern among some of the shadow cabinet's leftwingers about the direction of policy, Mr Blair stressed that he would continue with Mr Smith's 'inclusive' style of leadership. Walking a tightrope between his own strong convictions and the need to maintain party unity, he said the commitment to build a modern set of policies on which to fight the general election was 'not part of some desire to open up rifts or disunity within the Labour party'. Nor did his belief in the need for a 'dynamic market economy' represent a move to fight the Conservatives on their own ground. Instead, Labour would show itself as the only party willing to use the 'power of society' to enhance opportunity for ordinary citizens. Mr Blair explicitly rejected the idea of any electoral pact with Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. He said he would maintain Mr Smith's policy of offering the voters a referendum on proportional representation.

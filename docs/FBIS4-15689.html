			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 474] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 8, ELTA -- Seimas [parliament]  opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis commented a statement  signed by five factions of opposition "On tensions in national  defence structures".    Authors of the statement -- elders of the Motherland's  Union,  Christian Democratic, Lithuanian Nationalists, Democratic and  Freedom factions -- have said that various facts including  searches in flats of military officers violating the  Constitution are showing artificially created tensions.    The document said that "one of basic sources of the tension  is the present activity of Seimas National security committee  and its leading group, the wrong way chosen to exceed powers of  parliamentary control and to take on functions of executive  power." That is why "distrust in the chairman of the committee  grew up as well as the necessity to change the composition of  the committee," the opposition said.    Landsbergis told the news conference the committee, instead  of preparing documents for the programme "Partnership for  Peace," national security concept and other strategic documents,  was seeking to take over the management of the whole national  defence system.    Asked by journalists Landsbergis said the Motherland's Union  was not approving the procedure of non-confidence in the present  government launched by social-democrats. "We are for moral and  political interpellation to the ruling Democratic Labour Party  (LDDP) but not to the government of Adolfas Slezevicius", he  explained.    He also said he did not see any "reserves for ruling party  to  form a better government". He hinted that "Motherland's Union  plans to make a very clear and concrete step concerning  political future of Lithuania next week."</p>

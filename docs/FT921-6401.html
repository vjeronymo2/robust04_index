			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Pleasing durable goods orders help to lift Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices climbed to set a record Dow high yesterday, buoyed by a bigger than expected rise in January durable goods orders, positive comments about lower interest rates from the US Treasury Secretary and a sharp fall in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.49 at 3,283.32, slightly above the previous all-time peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 4.90 to 415.35, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which has taken a beating from profit-takers in recent sessions, roared back with a gain of 11.00 to 632.40. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 241m shares. The morning report that durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent in January provided a firm foundation for the market at the opening. Analysts had forecast an increase of only 1 per cent. Although the difference was not huge, any sign of economic progress is eagerly welcomed by the market in its current uncertain mood. Comments from Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, that real interest rates should be lower aided sentiment, as did a sharp cut in bond yields. Wal-Mart advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 after the world's biggest retailer announced a 34 per cent increase in sales and a 25 per cent rise in profits to Dollars 1.6bn in 1991. ITT jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 65 in turnover of 1.8m shares in the wake of a Financial Times report that included hints from the chairman about possible strategic moves by the company. Glenfed dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 7 1/8 in heavy trading after the Florida-based savings and insurance group restated its fiscal second-quarter profits downwards and warned that its third-quarter profitability was in question. Harley-Davidson rose Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 56 1/2 after Ms Jill Krutick, analyst at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, raised her rating on the stock to 'outperform'. The upgrade follows a recent meeting between analysts and the company, which persuaded the analyst that capacity problems at the motorcycle maker would soon be sorted out, leading to earnings for the year that should exceed market estimates. Telefonos de Mexico, one of the biggest stars of 1991, gained Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 after the recently privatised Mexican telecommunications giant said that net income last year rose by almost 80 per cent. There was strong demand for the initial public offering of Dollars 16m of shares in Musicland Stores. Floated at Dollars 14 1/2 , it closed at Dollars 16 on 4.18m traded. On the over-the-counter market, Microsoft forged ahead Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 122 in active trading after Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the broking house, reinstated its 'buy' recommendation on the stock. Amgen climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 on news that the company will repurchase up to Dollars 50m of its own common stock. Autotrol plunged Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the company, which manufactures water treatment control systems, announced that talks leading to a possible takeover by the utility group Wicor (up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 25 7/8 ) had been terminated. Canada TORONTO recorded its sharpest gain since mid-January after Tuesday's release of the Federal Budget relinquished pent-up demand. Better than expected results from two leading Canadian banks helped the banking sector score the largest advance. Hefty gains in the US and Canadian bond markets, after US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan said long-term rates are too high, lent support to the stock market. The composite index ended 35.5 up at 3,580.5. Rises led declines by 352 to 234 after volume of 26.8m shares.</p>

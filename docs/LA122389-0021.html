EXECUTIVE  </P> <P> A memorial Mass will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at Our Lady Queen of Angels  Catholic Church in Newport Beach for Michael L. Lewis, a Koll Co. executive who  died Tuesday at his Laguna Beach home after an illness. He was 39.  </P> <P> Lewis was a senior vice president of development for the Newport Beach division  of the Koll Co. responsible for operations in Orange, Riverside and San  Bernardino counties.

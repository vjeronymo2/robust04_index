Fujii expressed his views on the current state of the  country's economy, plagued by the longest recession in the  postwar period, during a speech in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture,  north of Tokyo.    Fujii also expressed strong hope to raise taxes designed to  fund welfare programs by increasing the current 3 percent  consumption tax.    He said that financing Japan's increasingly aging society  with income tax revenues has reached its limits.    Fujii said that while in office he wants to lay the  groundwork for setting up a tax system to finance pension funds  and a care system for the elderly.</p>

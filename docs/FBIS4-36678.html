			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jeddah, 11 Jun -- Yemeni sources here expected  the arrival of the southern Yemeni official, Abu Bakr al-'Attas,  to Jeddah to meet the UN envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, who  arrived in Saudi Arabia late last night from Amman with a  mission aimed at ending the current crisis in Yemen.    Diplomatic sources told KUNA that Brahimi would hold talks  with Saudi officials here to acquaint them with the latest  developments in Yemen, particularly after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  welcome of a Saudi role to settle the Yemeni crisis completely.  [passage omitted]    In contact with KUNA, Yemeni sources said that Haydar Abu  Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen, which was recently proclaimed, and its foreign affairs  minister, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, would arrive in Jeddah at a later  time to start talks with the UN envoy, which would be completed  in Mukkala if a real cease-fire agreement was reached.    It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia has so far not  officially announced that it was hosting these talks. However,  according to Yemeni sources, it is not unlikely that Saudi  Arabia "would host these talks if al-'Attar and al-Asnaj arrived  in the presence of a Gulf desire for immediate cease-fire."</p>

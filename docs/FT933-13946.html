			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Welsh Water gains 12.5% but doubles Acer write-off WELSH Water, the privatised water company, yesterday reported increases in profits and dividends in line with expectations and a withdrawal from an ill-received diversification into hotels. The company has extricated itself from its hotels business by signing a 15-year lease for four of its properties with Resort Hotels, which will also manage the fifth. But five months after acquiring Acer Group, the engineering consultancy group, for Pounds 21m in cash and the assumption of Pounds 27m of debt, Welsh Water has more than doubled the goodwill write-off. The group said the write-off would now be Pounds 40.4m, as opposed to the Pounds 17m figure anticipated at the time of the purchase. The additional goodwill write-off has raised the question of whether Welsh Water paid too much for Acer. Mr Iain Evan, chairman, remains convinced it was the correct strategic move for the group. In spite of yesterday's widely welcomed withdrawal from hotels, Welsh Water's experience with Acer will renew concern about the manner in which water companies are diversifying into business not regulated by the Office of Water Services. The main increase in the goodwill write-off relates to a change in strategy that led to disagreements within the group and the departure last week of three of Acer's directors. According to Mr Evans, Welsh Water has taken a Pounds 12m write-down based on a 'more prudent and cautious accounting policy' regarding when profits on five-year contracts are recognised. Welsh Water initially expected this figure to be about Pounds 7m. The unanticipated restructuring to integrate Acer, following the disagreement over strategy with Acer's now departed directors, has led to a Pounds 7m provision. The hotels deal entailed a write-down of Pounds 2.2m in the value of assets in Welsh Water's books. The company's pre-tax profits rose 12.5 per cent to Pounds 155.5m on sales up 11.8 per cent at Pounds 382.4m in the year to March 31. The group is to pay a final dividend of 15.7p, giving a total for the year of 23.5p, an increase over last year of 9.8 per cent. Earnings per share rose 17.8 per cent to 104.1p. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at a banquet in Phnom </F> Penh on 2 April -- recorded]    [Text] Your excellencies the first and second prime  ministers, ladies, and gentlemen: On behalf of the SRV  Government delegation, I would like to thank their excellencies  the first and second prime ministers for inviting me to pay an  official friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia, a  beautiful country with a brilliant Angkor civilization and a  diligent and creative population. I would like to thank the  co-prime ministers and the Cambodian people for extending us a  warm welcome and showing the hospitality and sentiment of a  close neighbor. I would also like to thank you for your kind  words on the Vietnamese nation and people, our traditional  friendship and cooperation, and the good-neighborly relations  between our two nations and peoples.    On this occasion, we would like to share our pleasure at  learning that the king of Cambodia has recovered from his  illness and will return to Cambodia -- together with his sons,  daughters, nieces, and nephews -- to celebrate the upcoming  Cambodian traditional new year. I would also like to share my  pleasure in noting the achievements made by the Cambodian  people, under the clear-sighted leadership of King Norodom  Sihanouk and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, on  the path toward attaining peace, national reconciliation, and a  prosperous and happy life.    I am convinced that these encouraging achievements will open  new and favorable conditions for the Cambodian people to build  their country into a peaceful, independent, neutral, unified,  nonaligned, and prosperous nation, thereby meeting the earnest  aspiration of the Cambodian people and their friends around the  world, including the Vietnamese people.    Vietnam and Cambodia are two close and neighboring  countries.  Our nations share a longstanding traditional friendship. We  have shared weal and woe over the past several decades. The  Vietnamese people have consistently and highly valued the fine  sentiment and wholehearted support and assistance extended to  them by King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodia people. We  always consider the consolidation and development of our  relations of friendship and cooperation with the Cambodian  people a major policy of our nation. We are very pleased to note  that our fine and proven relationship has satisfactorily  developed in the new situation through various lively events,  such as exchanges of visits by high-level delegations from the  two countries in the recent past.    On this occasion, I would like to assert the aspiration and  unswerving determination of the Vietnamese Government and people  to do their best in strengthening and developing relations of  friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the  Kingdom of Cambodia.    We are convinced that with goodwill and effort by both  sides,  Vietnamese-Cambodian relations -- built on the basis of  respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity; and of equality and mutual interest --  will be further consolidated and developed for the happiness and  prosperity of the people in each country and for regional peace,  stability, cooperation, and development.    On the occasion of the Cambodian traditional new year, Chol  Chhnam Thmei, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government and people  I would like to convey my best wishes to King Norodom Sihanouk,  Queen Monique, and the Royal Cambodian Government and people.  [applause]    At this happy moment, in the spirit of our fraternal  friendship, I would like to propose a toast to the good health  of King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monique and to the good  health of the co-prime ministers and the Vietnamese and  Cambodian leaders. I wish the Cambodian people even greater  achievements in their cause of building Cambodia into a peaceful  and prosperous nation; I hope the traditional relations of  friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness between Vietnam  and Cambodia are further consolidated and developed; and I wish  good health to all of the distinguished guests here. [applause]</p>

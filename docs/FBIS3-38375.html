			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "Del Turco Takes Sides; New </F> Socialist Party Rejects Intini"]    [Text] Rome -- "Today sees the birth of the new Socialist  Party," [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Ottaviano Del  Turco announced to the constituent assembly of the PSI at which  the Carnation crossed over to the Rose [old and new party  symbols]. Now it is possible: "Heads up." Italian Socialists  are rediscovering the left. As in the rest of the world, they  are aligning with the progressive forces, against the  conservative forces, from [Italian Popular Party (PPI)  Secretary] Martinazzoli to [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi.  There was an atmosphere of euphoria at this new beginning.  Having set aside the much-brandished Italian flag, the lost  International has returned, and tears were shed at the  appropriate moment. Moreover, there was a blessing from  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, whose  arrival drew loud applause right at the start of Del Turco's  speech. It prompted the angry departure of Ugo Intini, amid a  chorus of catcalls. But that is another story.    The old PSI and the new stood side by side in a hall at  Rome's exhibition center. There were at least 7,000 people  there, divided into regional battalions. In the front row on  the stage some representatives of the nomenclature made a  reappearance. There was no longer a presidium platform, for  several reasons -- in order to avert impossible attempts at  diplomacy and to mark a sharp break with the past. In any case,  it was only an official christening. The congress takes place in  May. Del Turco sat waiting in the audience. On the stage a  plain table was provided for Gino Giugni and Enrico Boselli.  Panseca no longer featured at this exciting working-class  "opening night." It was an occasion for old friends to renew  their acquaintance and for acknowledging old affinities. There  was something of all this (a return to humanism; nobody now  would take the old diktats seriously) with, in addition, some  judicious asperity in Del Turco's remarks to his men. The  battle is won, but the internal war goes on. This is why the  name "Craxi" was never mentioned, and neither was the word  "Tangentopoli" [Bribesville].    Break with the past -- He was hoping for the "spontaneous  departure" of the investigatees that had "compromised" the  party. However, there was no such "spontaneous generosity." Now  there is "no turning back. Our path diverges from those who  refuse to identify with the new symbol" (already approved by the  Socialist International), "and who presume to dictate  conditions." It is an "irreversible option" [no opening quotes  as published] for a renewal that is "clear, open, and evident.  Woe betide us if we hesitate. We will not allow ourselves to  be intimidated." This was set against the defeated apparatus  (who were also absent -- Craxi, Martelli, De Michelis, Ando,  Conte). It was to them perhaps that Del Turco was referring  when he said that it is "difficult to show affection and  gratitude to those who think only of doing us harm." Intini was  there, however, next to Alma Cappiello.    Catcalls for Intini -- Almost heroically (he was suffering  from a high fever), Gino Giugni had just finished recalling the  "destructive moral pollution" of the old leadership group, when  a chorus of catcalls came from the back of the hall. "Out,  traitor, throw him out." Everyone looked toward the second row,  where Ugo Intini -- having been wrested away from his  appearances on any and every television channel -- was speaking.  Craxi's former spokesman fell silent and sat down, with a  grimace. He got up suddenly to leave when he saw Occhetto come  in. It was like a historical revenge, 10 years after Verona and  the catcalls reserved for Berlinguer. A few hours later he  issued this exaggerated accusation: "Occhetto ordered Giugni  and Del Turco to expel the independent socialists as a  precondition for belated admission to the left-wing negotiating  table."    PCI [Italian Communist Party], Berlusconi, [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi -- The new PSI has reversed Craxi's affinities.  It dismissed Forza Italia -- it is right-wing -- and also the  "preaching of egoism of Bossi and Fini." Del Turco silenced one  lady senator who perceived in Berlusconi "the advent of the  alignment for freedoms." What did she mean? "The freedom not  to pay taxes, to expel all colored people from our country, to  hand over to private enterprise all that functions and is  efficient. What does all this have to do with the history of  socialism?" He cited "the pictures emerging from Arcore" [where  Berlusconi lives] with the following "clear language: Let the  poor take care of themselves; the prosperous will survive."    PSI and the left -- Meanwhile, there must be "equal status"  for all. With the AD [Democratic Alliance] "the prospects are  increasingly substantial" thanks to "common roots"; and the same  goes for the "Christian-Social" group (Carniti was in the  audience). There is no obligation to engage in controversy with  the PDS, and there must be mutual autonomy. If possible, a  joint battle must be waged; otherwise, there must be separate  lists in order to avert "humiliating compromises." This was a  tribute to the delegates' wounded sense of patriotism. But  relations are good. Everything is fine with the Greens, less so  with Communist Renaissance. Bertinotti (formerly of the Lombardo  faction) received the tribute of a verse which Pasolini  dedicated to [founder of PSI] Nenni: "Struggle without victories  brings aridity." As for Rete, "I have nothing to say to [Rete  Secretary] Leoluca Orlando," who is seeking a "grim,  disputatious, and counterreformist left." But if it is his  ideas that guide the progressive forces, "we will opt for  freedom of action."    PSI and the center -- "Esteem and respect for Martinazzoli,"  less so for [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who "propounds the  theory of indifference to alliances." After the elections there  must be a constituent period. "Let it not be believed that all  this can be achieved by means of an agreement between the major  forces above the heads of the minority forces."    The curtain fell, to the strains of Elsor's March. In the  front row, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri listened and applauded.  He was Craxi's shadow during his years of glory. So is  everything fine now, too? He pondered. He asked a reporter to  hand him his notebook, and wrote: "No embarrassment. The option  taken is consistent with my own political and personal career.  There are times when you have to opt for ideas rather than  individuals."</p>

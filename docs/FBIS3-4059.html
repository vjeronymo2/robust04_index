Qian made the remark during a meeting with visiting Yemeni  Vice- Foreign Minister Abdul Kadir.    Qian said he was satisfied that the long friendly ties and  cooperation between China and Yemen had been developed in a  concrete way after the reunification of the South Yemen and  North Yemen.    He added: "We are very much concerned about the Yemen's  domestic situation, hoping that the country will realize its  social stability and enjoy a good environment for its  construction.    "We believe that the Yemeni people will solve their own  problems by themselves."    China and the Yemen, Qian said, share many common points on  international issues, and their relationship will grow by  mutually supporting and cooperating with each other.    Abdul Kadir said he had come here for the main purpose of  having political consultations with Chinese colleagues.    The Yemen was also satisfied with the growth of traditional  friendship between the two countries and hoped that such  relationship would keep growing.    Yesterday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei  exchanged views with Abdul Kadir on bilateral ties and regional  and international issues of common concern.    The two agreed that the political consultations between the  two Foreign Ministries will be beneficial not only to  strengthening their cooperation, but also to pushing forward  bilateral ties.    Abdul Kadir arrived here on March 22.</p>

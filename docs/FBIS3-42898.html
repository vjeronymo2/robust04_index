			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Bogomolov, academician: "Reforms after </F> Gaydar: The Road To Breakdown, or a Way Out of the Impasse?"]    [Text]  <H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>   The failure of the Gaydar reforms and the inevitable change  in economic policy gave rise to numerous comments in the Western  press that amaze me in their ideological direction. The  beginning of the abandonment of the ideals of American  liberalism is deplored with undisguised distress. It is  complained that the West did not help its heroes enough--Gaydar,  Fedorov, Chubays--and I am not even talking about the president  of Russia. Correspondents writing from Moscow have no desire to  look into the face of tragic Russian reality. The arguments of  the critics of shock therapy are disregarded, and their  proposals for correcting policy and the resignation of the main  architects of failed reforms are interpreted almost unanimously  as a return to the old ways. Appeals to save Russian reforms are  appearing in newspapers and journals. To do everything in order  to continue the policy that received the approval of the  International Monetary Fund and the "Big Seven." They speak  freely of a wish to have an influence in accordance with their  own views on the internal development of Russia, as if  interference in the internal affairs of others in international  relations has become the natural right of the rich and powerful.    Articles in recent issues of the American journal TIME and  the English ECONOMIST are full of mournful intonations: "A  gigantic step backward," "the road to breakdown." True, TIME  still tries to explain to Americans why Russians are  disappointed in reforms according to the Western formula.  "Imagine," the journal writes, "that the monthly rate of  inflation in the United States is 20 percent, the output of  industrial products is reduced by 15 percent annually,  unemployment is growing everywhere, and the government has  obviously turned out to be insolvent." "Imagine," it states  further on, "that California and Texas have seceded, foreign  communists are giving advice on how to reorganize the American  Government... This is the equivalent of what Russia is  encountering." This is something, of course, that Americans are  not in a condition to imagine, because this is simply impossible  in their country. And it is stupid to guess how they would  behave in a similar situation, but they have taken to giving  advice to we who are in such a situation.    It would seem that the dramatic effect of Russian reality  should prompt Western observers and analysts to give us advice  that is somewhat more constructive than a simple toughening of  that policy that led us into the impasse. But, alas, the  faith-healing power of the monetarist drug is so great that no  matter how convincing and well-reasoned the proposals are to  select a unique Russian path to reform, they are immediately  rejected as a return to the old ways, and their authors fall  into the ranks of antireformers. In leading Western newspapers  and journals, and even in Russian publications that have a  pro-president orientation, market and democratic reforms are not  thought of in some variant that is different from "shock  therapy" and authoritarian presidential power. The idea is  stubbornly taking hold that this variant has no alternatives.    Perhaps it was out of naivete, but I supposed that in view  of  the catastrophic economic situation it was especially important  in the traditions of serious science to analyze deeply and  thoroughly the reasons for our troubles and, proceeding from the  established diagnosis, to recommend methods of treatment.  Unfortunately, the assessments and conclusions from the  experience of Russian reforms were turned over to the control of  journalists. In their propagandistic chorus, the voice of the  objective researchers is barely distinguishable. During the past  year Russian academic science has already twice come out with  detailed reports that proposed an alternative strategy of  reforms on the basis of a critical analysis of our experience.  The failure of the purely monetarist policy of the stabilization  of the economy and the market transition was disclosed in a  number of reports and books of important Western economists.  However, not only scientific data but also the real everyday  experience are ignored by the authors of propagandistic stock  phrases and myths, among whom are members of Gaydar's team as  well.    Thus, an official analyst in a governmental semiofficial  organ proves that there was no shock therapy in Russia. I agree  that the policy the authors themselves at first compared with  Polish shock therapy has little in common with therapy; that is,  with improving the health of the economy, and with Polish  reform. But the shock that the population experienced from it  did take place, and it was truly monstrous. And it cannot be  covered up with any kind of literary stratagems. In a year and a  half the real monetary income of the population was cut by  almost a factor of three, and the quality of life was thrown  back by 20-25 years.    It is more and more difficult for supporters of the Gaydar  reforms to conceal their failure in the Russian and Western mass  media. And searches for those responsible are thereby being  conducted more intensively. Jeffrey Sachs damns the Western  powers for inadequate monetary assistance to the reformers.  Others reproach the Russian reformers for insufficient toughness  in limiting the consumption of the population and for budget  expenditures. But all agree in accusing the chief banker of the  country--V. Gerashchenko--who, it is said, did not keep credit  and monetary emissions in check.    At first glance, there are grounds for such accusations: The  monetary and credit mass in circulation is growing, and so  prices are also increasing. But many of the specialists in our  country and abroad do not agree with this explanation. They cite  the fact that galloping inflation is not caused by surplus  effective demand, which has been suppressed, but by an increase  in costs and the behavior of monopolist producers who shift  continuously increasing expenses and taxes to prices, and also  by inflated prices that are under the influence of inflationary  expectations. According to their estimates, in its real  purchasing power, the credit-monetary mass in Russia (i.e., with  a correction for price increases) was reduced up to 30 percent  from the initial level of January 1991. The excess money (the  monetary overhang) was eliminated in this way. People's real  monetary income fell to one-third, they were deprived of their  savings, and enterprises were deprived of working capital and  development funds. All this was supposed to cause the  inflationary wave to recede. But the opposite happened. And all  of this despite the fact that commodities that in the past were  never an object of trade began additionally to be included in  market turnover: apartments, land plots, enterprises, etc.    In a word, before calling for a further toughening of  credit-monetary emission, there should be a comparison of the  physical-material and monetary components of the market that has  evolved. Such a comparison, more than anything else, will  confirm the correctness of the findings of academic science: In  the current situation of cost inflation, anti-inflationary  measures directed at limiting the monetary mass and reducing the  budget deficit deprive the entire national economy of the  possibility of implementing decisive structural changes and lead  to an intensification in the drop in production. By limiting  demand and contracting the market, they reduce taxes and other  budget receipts and thereby intensify inflation.    As you can see, the reasons for inflation are not as  elementary as is interpreted by the adherents of liberal-radical  reforms. Should we not moderate propagandistic passions and turn  to the facts? Then, perhaps, even proposals to select another  trajectory of the movement to the market will not seem like "a  gigantic step backward."    What is especially disturbing is the radical liberal idea of  intensifying the state's regulatory interference in order to  stop the collapse of production, prevent social cataclysms,  chaos, and the further criminalization of the economy, and  support entrepreneurship. A cry can be immediately heard here  about a return to the administrative command system and a  concession to the conservative director corps in industry and  "the red barons" in agriculture. Meanwhile, world experience  (especially in the period of the last war and after it)  indicates that when destructive processes in the economy and  society go as far as they have in our country, it is unrealistic  to stop them by means of market self-regulation alone. In the  period of the postwar restoration of West Europe, foreign trade,  the currency rate of exchange, and the movement of capital were  regulated by the states, but the transition to a freely  convertible currency in current trade operations took more than  10 years. State price control over key commodities, and also  subsidies for their support, were continued just as long, and  they have remained in agriculture and the power industry to this  day. The state sector played an important role in industry, and  only now, it seems, is its broader privatization maturing. I  will add that the successes of the Japanese economy, and  recently also of the new industrial countries, are in many ways  tied to the guiding influence of the state on market relations  and the gradualness of reforms.    It seems that in the so-called "deregulation," that is, the  elimination of the state from the sphere of regulation of the  economy, Russia, under the influence of liberal theory, went  further in many spheres than the experience of capitalist  countries suggests. Hurrying to abolish the instruments of state  regulation inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian  reformers began to rely on the invisible hand of the market. The  calculation did not justify itself: It is now much more  complicated to recreate a capable state administrative mechanism  that is not infected by corruption and bureaucracy, and to  recreate one not as a counterbalance to the market but precisely  for the sake of creating a civilized and socially oriented  market.    I cannot comprehend why the Western press refrains from  reproaching China, where market reorganization is not being  implemented according to an IMF formula but by means of a  gradual displacement of state regulation by market regulation  (and then by no means everywhere), and why so much indignation  is aroused in it by the proposals of some members of the Russian  Government to cope with inflation and the drop in production by  using the same experience. Well, after all, the new American  administration is also sending Reaganomics, with its ideas of  deregulation, to the archives.    In conclusion, I would like to repeat: The best support for  our democratic market reorganizations is rejection of the  imposition of schemes that are foreign to Russian conditions,  calm businesslike analysis of problems that face us, and respect  for the abilities of Russian scientists and politicians to find  a way out of the impasse by themselves. Attempts to condition  assistance to Russia with the implementation of recommendations  of the IMF and the "Big Seven," while not hiding the sympathies  of the West for those who follow this advice in spite of real  results--all this is capable only of stirring up the  anti-Western mood in Russian society.</p>

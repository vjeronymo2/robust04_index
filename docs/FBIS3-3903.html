The task should serve  to help all personnel to have a profound understanding of  historical responsibility and the glorious mission of our army  under the new situation; further play the role of the enthusiasm  of officers and soldiers of the whole army; and strengthen the  overall work of army building, continue to enhance combat  readiness, and make contributions to the reform, development,  and stability of the state under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics and his ideology concerning the army building in  the new period as well as in the light of the requirement put  forward by Chairman Jiang Zemin -- "The PLA must be qualified  politically and competent militarily. It must have a fine work  style, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate  logistical support."    The circular urges party committees and political  organizations at all levels to make an overall arrangement for  integrating the work of conveying and studying the Second  Session of the Eighth NPC's guiding spirit with the troops'  theoretical and political education. It is necessary to study  in a thoroughgoing manner the meeting's guiding spirit by  integrating the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping with that of the basic viewpoints of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which  is currently conducted at the grass-roots level.</p>

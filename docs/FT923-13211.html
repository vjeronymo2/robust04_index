			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Leading Article: South Africa at the UN THE COLLAPSE of constitutional talks in South Africa, rising political violence, an impending general strike and the growing antagonism between President FW de Klerk and the African National Congress (ANC) leader, Mr Nelson Mandela, are a dangerous and volatile combination. What lies in store for the republic may well be a painful and protracted confrontation between white and black nationalism that outsiders are helpless to avert. But if today's emergency meeting of the UN Security Council can help curb the violence that led the ANC to break off talks, thus assisting the parties to return to the negotiating table once more, the opportunity to do so should be seized. Such an opportunity may, in fact, exist. Mr de Klerk's offer to accept the presence of international observers as part of a fresh multi-party initiative to combat violence falls far short of Mr Mandela's call for a UN monitoring force. But it is welcome, nevertheless. The offer will be more credible if Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, makes a convincing case when he sets out the government's position on violence and the constitutional negotiations before the Security Council. The government has the means to quell most of the violence; it must demonstrate it also has the will. On its own, a group of international observers, backed by military and police advisers - which is what Mr de Klerk may have in mind and the Commonwealth secretariat has already proposed - will probably be ineffectual. But there already exists a framework in which such observers could operate as facilitators of the peace process, providing support and advice to local institutions, all the while reminding the warring parties that they are coming under increasing international scrutiny. Sensible agreement Part of that framework is the National Peace Accord signed last September by all leading parties, including the ANC, the government and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This document has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Yet it remains an eminently sen-sible agreement which, given political will on all sides, could form the basis for resolution of the conflict in South Africa. Among other elements, it contains a code of conduct for the security forces and political parties. It also provides for local and regional committees to resolve political disputes. Its work would be enhanced by the advice of international observers. International inquiry Such a group would also be able to draw on the investigations of a judicial inquiry into township violence under Mr Justice Goldstone, whose integrity and independence are not in question. The commission has started an investigation of last month's massacre at Boipatong, in which 42 people died. Two international legal experts have joined the commission, which goes some way towards meeting the ANC call for an international inquiry into the massacre. If Mr de Klerk genuinely wants to resolve his country's crisis, he needs to do more. The South African government must tell the UN today that security force units notorious for their brutality, such as 32 Battalion, will be disbanded, as will police units consisting of former members of Koevoet, the counter-insurgency force that once operated in Namibia; that carrying of dangerous weapons in public will be banned and the law enforced; and that hostels, the source of much of the friction in the Johannesburg region, will be upgraded and properly policed. This is merely to put into effect proposals previously advanced by Justice Goldstone's commission, which began sitting last year and recently condemned the government's inadequate response in terms amounting to an indictment of Mr de Klerk's handling of the violence wracking South Africa. To ignore the commission's recommendations, Justice Goldstone said, 'can only be calculated to diminish if not destroy the credibility and effectiveness not only of the commission but also of the government'. If President de Klerk can satisfy an international observer group that he is taking heed of this warning, then South Africa's peace process could be put back on track.</p>

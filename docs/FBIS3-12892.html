			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 5 Mar (INA) -- The AL-'IRAQ newspaper has  denounced the rabid, malicious, and tendentious media and  diplomatic campaign launched by the Clinton administration  against Iraq.    In its editorial today, the paper notes the periodic report  sent by the U.S. President on 3 March to Congress. The report  was primarily targeted against Iraq. It employed a long series  of deliberate false arguments, disregarded facts, and was  blindly carried away by Zionist desires.    The paper says the Clinton administration is entertaining a  great illusion and falling into the abyss of cheap lies and  blatant deception if it thinks that it can succeed through its  octopus and diabolical media machine. This machine excels in  telling lies and fabricating accusations to influence world  public opinion in favor of U.S. stupidities when the question of  lifting the embargo is discussed.    AL-'IRAQ further argues that the position of the Clinton  administration, reflected in its spiteful report to Congress,  reveals to the whole world the extent of the involvement of the  U.S. President and his Zionist advisers, such as Tony Lake and  Martin Indyk, in a plot to turn the Security Council and the  international family against Iraq. They are doing this in the  hope of maintaining the savage embargo, after it has lost all  its justifications.    The paper asserts that by continuing to antagonize the  unyielding Iraqi people, going to extremes to have more unjust  resolutions issued, and relentlessly seeking to maintain current  resolutions against Iraq, the Clinton administration will only  reap failure, humiliation, and hatred.    The paper adds: The criminal Bush wagered on starving the  Iraqi people and defeating it eventually through the economic  blockade. However, Bush ended up in the trash can of history.  The Iraqi people have maintained their steadfastness, worked  miracles, and pursued their reconstruction drive. Bush only  reaped disgrace, shame, and eternal damnation. Clinton will  reap the same fruits if he continues his losing wager on the  Iraqis' endurance and steadfastness.</p>

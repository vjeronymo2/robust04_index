			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Student vouchers In the past five years, the proportion of 18-year-olds going into higher education in the UK has doubled, an expansion in student numbers widely seen as essential for improving the country's competitiveness. Yet this enormous expansion has taken place within a framework of higher education largely designed in the last century to educate a much smaller elite. It is not surprising, therefore, that the system is coming under strain. Chief among those pressures is funding, made more acute by the UK tradition that the state pays most of the cost. The government's solution has been to avoid increasing funds to match the rise in student numbers. Universities have been able to improve productivity, but much of the saving has been at the expense of straining university staff and facilities, if not at the expense of quality. A further squeeze is planned. Such measures are inevitably short-term in scope and arbitrary in consequence. University vice-chancellors and principals have become increasingly vocal in their protests over shortage of resources. Their difficulties have been compounded by wild swings in policy. When the government launched the recent expansion drive, it offered enticing incentives to those institutions that were most successful in attracting students. When this worked better than anticipated, the incentives were hastily reduced. Universities cannot so easily change direction. A clear course is needed that allows them to plan development. Their top managers have increasingly recognised that greater stability would come from breaking the dependence on funds allocated by the higher education funding councils. Hence the growing interest in a shift from grants paid by Whitehall to fees paid by or for students. The latest manifestation of this is Monday's report of the Higher Education Quality Council, which monitors the quality of degree courses. Its starting point is the need for changes to encourage greater flexibility in higher education. Much-needed measures are proposed to make it easier for students to move between universities, to work while studying and to re-enter education after breaks. The report examines ways to ensure that such measures do not undermine the quality of higher education. But it goes on to look at how the funding of students can be reformed to encourage flexibility. The answer is to move to a 'credit-based formula', or vouchers. Students would be allowed to buy the education they desire, while universities would be rewarded for their success in responding to student choice. The report finds that there is considerable agreement in principle to such a move. Academic staff are wary of students who make several changes during their degrees, arguing that institutions can suffer destabilisation. But many previously opposed to vouchers have been persuaded of the advantages of a funding system that would be less prey to the judgments of a quango and the whims of ministers. That is welcome. Vouchers would also bring many other advantages, including the opportunity for universities to charge top-up fees. Those that believe they offer something special should be able to charge more. Individual students are best placed to judge whether the additional cost is merited. But the acceptance of the principle of vouchers is only a starting point. Implementing the policy would involve many awkward questions, including the value of the voucher and whether it should be the same for all subjects. Some courses cost more than others - training doctors for example. Then there is the question of whether the voucher should be worth more for courses that are considered national priorities, such as science or engineering. And if students are to pay, a graduate tax would be better than the current loan scheme. Perhaps the most difficult questions to be faced, however, are those confronting the politicians. Free higher education is a highly-valued component of the middle-class welfare state. Reforms to place more of the burden on those who benefit from higher education risks their votes. Both ministers and the opposition have shied away from that prospect. Will they be able to find the courage now to provide those who run higher education with a funding system equal to the task of expanding provision without eroding the quality of one of the UK's most prized assets?</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners take profits in Frankfurt Contrasting stories were seen, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT continued its downward path as more foreign investors decided the time had come to take profits. The DAX index slid a further 23.54 to 2,113.84. After hours trading saw the Ibis indicative index rise to 2,130.34. Turnover was DM9.1bn. The weaker currency and bond markets also contributed to the day's gloom as prospects for a rate cut receded. Porsche dropped DM8 to DM830, in line with the market trend, after the car maker said that it would omit its divided and would see a group loss of up to DM150m in 1993/94, but breaking even in 1994/95. By contrast Continental, the tyre manufacturer, added DM2.50 to DM257.50 helped by dollar strength. ZURICH put in another strong performance, the SMI index adding 26.4 to 3,037.5, with chemicals companies providing the impetus. Roche certificates added SFr115 to SFr6,555 after news that a new anti-aids product had successfully completed its first two trials in the US and was about to begin its third phase of tests. Ciba added SFr17 to SFr725. Among the insurers, Swiss Re put on SFr6 to SFr696 on the view that Monday's mark down, after news of the Los Angeles earthquake, had been overdone. Winterthur continued to benefit from its link with Commerzbank in the German insurance market. The registered shares put on SFr11 to SFr797. SMH saw a further rally, after recent losses, the bearers adding SFr8 to SFr218. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications shed SFr5 to SFr1,370 after it confirmed that the 1993 deficit would be greater than 1992's SFr46m loss. AMSTERDAM improved given good gains in heavyweight stocks such as Unilever, up Fl 3.50 to Fl 227.80, while Hoogovens showed a strong spurt, gaining Fl 2.20 to Fl 56.30, which market sources attributed to a note put out yesterday by Merrill Lynch. The AEX index gained 2.23 to 425.16. PARIS closed the day stronger after a choppy day's trading. The CAC-40 index ended 12.57 higher at 2,247.35 in turnover of FFr5.2bn. Suez was heavily traded, closing down FFr3.70 at FFr345.30, following reports that substantial stakes were being placed. Elf went in the opposite direction, up FFr5 to FFr403.20, on reports that it was to sell stakes in holdings. MILAN was steady after Monday's strong start to the monthly account and the Comit index rose 2.10 to 617.40. James Capel commented that the market's immediate response to the calling of the general election had been favourable on hopes for a clearer outlook for government policy. However, the broker did not expect the election to be a major factor driving the market over the next two months, given the difficulty of assessing the likely composition of the new government. Montedison ran into profit-taking, shedding L7.60 to L954.10, in turnover of 85.5m shares, still high but sharply down from Monday's 155m. Olivetti eased L12 to L2,254 after reaching an accord with union groups late on Monday and showing share price gains earlier in the session. STOCKHOLM fell back modestly following the recent forward surge. The Affarsvarlden general index slipped just 0.8 to 1,545.1. Turnover decreased to SKr3.6bn. Electrolux and Volvo bucked the downward trend with the former's B shares up SKr9 to SKr347 on expectations of an improvement in the white good's market. Volvo B's added SKr2 to SKr665 ahead of today's shareholder's meeting. MADRID posted a record close as gains in bonds and futures inspired late buying by investment funds and foreign investors that pushed the general index 2.20 higher to 338.36. The construction and electrical sectors posted some of the biggest rises. Asland rose Pta140 or 6.7 per cent to Pta2,220 while Endesa added Pta110 to Pta7,580. Sarrio, the paper group, surged Pta60 or 15 per cent to Pta460. ISTANBUL tumbled 6.1 per cent on profit-taking following the market's recent high levels. The composite index lost 1,686.26 to 27,907.01, adding to its decline of some 10 per cent over the last three sessions. Turnover was TL5,300bn. The falls have been exacerbated by last week's downgrading of the country's debt over the worsening budget and trade deficits; but also by worries over the 40 per cent rise in the index since the beginning of the year.

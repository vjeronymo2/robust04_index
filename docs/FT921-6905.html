			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (1): Foundations of the future - On the anniversary of Kuwait's liberation, 'Kuwait for the Kuwaitis' sums up what many Kuwaitis hope will be the most apparent change in the emirate's post-war character. But a number of Kuwaitis are less sure of the benefits of removing at a stroke a core component of the country's educated Arab middle class A PAIR of bumper stickers on a brand new Chevrolet Caprice outside a Kuwait hotel sums up much of the sentiment in the emirate a year after liberation. One reads: 'Kuwait is Free, thank you America]' The other, beneath it, proclaims: 'Kuwait for the Kuwaitis'. Not only do the slogans illuminate Kuwait's determination to present a spirit of post-war assurance; the medium itself says much about how Kuwaitis have striven to package and contain the memories of their ordeal. With Kuwait City now spruced up and tidied, the skies cleared of depressing clouds from the oil fires and the rusting detritus of war visible only on excursions out of the city, Kuwait has sought to render memories of the war in uniting, patriotic colours. Bright, triumphalist murals adorn city walls and a new memorial of a shattered Iraqi tank, surrounded by the flags of members of the coalition of couyntries which evicted the Iraqis, sits beside the Information Ministry. Early tensions between those 200,000 Kuwaitis who endured occupation and the 400,000 who fled have been dissolved in part by a campaign to unite all Kuwaitis around the yellow flags, fluttering across the city, reminding them of the 1,053 Kuwaitis who have yet to return from Iraq. While the past is being taken care of, the foundations of Kuwait's post-war future are also becoming increasingly clear. The slogan 'Kuwait for the Kuwaitis' serves as well as any to sum up what the government, and the greater part of Kuwaitis themselves, hope will be the most apparent change in the emirate's post-war character. From the moment of Kuwait's liberation, the government declared its intention that Kuwaitis, previously a 38 per cent minority in the emirate's pre-war population of 2.2m, should enjoy a majority in their own country. Today, thanks essentially to the banishment of up to 400,000 Palestinians and Jordanians - 'non-preferred nationalities' is the bureaucratic euphemism  -and a determined policy of having no non-Kuwaiti nationality comprise more than 10 per cent of the total population, this intention looks likely to stick. The policy is not without its costs or its critics. Not only has it shorn Kuwait of the best of its technical and managerial expatriate workers, it has also deprived the emirate of nearly 100,000 families who made their home in Kuwait, and in turn made a living for a large body of Kuwaiti merchants. But many Kuwaitis, who have always been suspicious of the Palestinians' political ambitions in the emirate, seem content to pay this price. 'I don't see it as a social cost - more a security gain,' says the Kuwaiti manager of an engineering company who has lost all but a handful of his best trained staff. But a number of Kuwaitis are less sure of the benefits of removing, at a stroke, a core component of the emirate's educated, Arab middle class and replacing it largely with bachelor workers. 'The place of expatriates in this country should be more than just working and sleeping,' says a Kuwaiti banker. Moreover, the resulting shortage of middle-management skills in the emirate implies the need for Kuwaitis to fill jobs they have historically shunned and, for all the jolt caused by the war, show no signs yet of embracing. Nevertheless, Kuwait's ambition to curb its population is one of several the government struggled to achieve before the Iraqi invasion, but which the war suddenly put within reach. Another is the job of clearing the country's banks of the billions of dinars of bad debt which has shackled them since the collapse in 1982 of the rashly speculative Souq al Manakh kerb stock market. In the post-war economic hiatus, the government has seized the chance to propose a massive buy-out of the debt in return for government bonds. The government also looks set to wash its hands of pre-war subsidies for non-oil manufacturing industries in the emirate - a trendy and expensive enterprise undertaken by all Gulf states throughout the 1980s in the name of economic diversification, but one which in Kuwait was sponsored with mixed government feeling and met with indifferent success. As a mark of the post-war shift, the Industrial Bank of Kuwait has stopped granting concessionary lending - the very reason it was established. Manufacturing in Kuwait has lain moribund since liberation and appears about to die. Kuwait's economy will therefore - at least for the next few years - shrink with its population and rely more obviously on its oil revenues alone. These, the oil fires having been quenched with a speed matched by the industry's recovery in output, should be near pre-war levels by the end of 1992. 'In the final analysis,' says a senior official with National Bank of Kuwait by way of an economic precis, 'this is a country which can pump 2m barrels of oil a day. We can rebuild our oil facilities and we know how much that will cost.' However, the loss of much of Kuwait's pre-war investment income, with as much as Dollars 30bn of its 1990 portfolio of about Dollars 65bn in overseas holdings having been liquidated to pay off war-related costs, means the emirate will have to watch its domestic expenditure and perhaps borrow more than the Dollars 5.5bn syndicated international loan signed late last year. The spectre of rising costs and falling revenues alarms some economists. 'The most important thing now is to stop driving the country towards a permanent deficit, both internal and external,' warns Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, a prominent Kuwaiti economist who declares pessimism over the government's attempts to take full control of the economy. But the government hopes that fewer expatriates will mean less spending on public services. Also, the total reconstruction bill, which optimistic foreign contractors put at Dollars 100bn as the war ended, looks certain to settle at a far more modest Dollars 20bn. About half of this will be spent on repairing the oil industry and the greatest part of the remainder will go towards putting Kuwait's armed forces back on their feet. Rebuilding apart, the government's economic priorities will otherwise revolve around spreading what it can afford of Kuwait's oil income as widely and judiciously as possible - a particular priority in this election year, but always at the root of most government thinking in the emirate. 'Economic policy here is not so much about creating the right circumstances for production, more getting the distribution right,' remarks a local economist. Dividing up the pie has always been the central feature of Kuwaiti politics and the war has not changed this. In accomplishing this task, the government has been careful recently to consult closely with the National Council, the interim assembly reconvened after liberation by Sheik Jaber al Sabah, the Emir, as a stop-gap consultative body to tide the country over until the October's elections to the full National Assembly. The Emir suspended the National Assembly in 1986 in the face of its strident opposition to some of his appointed ministers. He created the Council early in 1990 to head off opposition calls for the Assembly's restitution. The Council, decried by opposition groups as unconstitutional in the absence of the full Assembly, is widely seen, not least by some of its own members, as the government's training school for loyalist candidates in the next election. Its 75 members, half of whom are government appointees, will certainly claim credit for prodding the government into the popular decision to raise salaries in the civil service, which employs the vast majority of Kuwaitis, by 25 per cent. Some 42 National Councillors said this month that they would contest the October poll. At least as many opposition candidates will stand, representing the familiar and divergent strands of leftist, liberal and Islamic thinking in Kuwait, united at least in demanding that the new parliament should exercise a limit on the exercise of the al-Sabah family's ruling power - a familiar rallying point which long predates the war. It is too soon properly to assess the likely strength of this opposition challenge at elections in eight months' time, for while stern criticism of the government's indecision and lack of managerial talent is widespread among Kuwaitis, so, too, is the popularity of much of what the government has been seen to achieve. By signing military co-operation pacts with the US and UK, the government has made Kuwaitis feel more secure than they have done for years. Oil revenues are reviving apace and the government has wasted no time in putting a little of this money into most pockets, both through pay rises and by writing off outstanding consumer loans. The post-war arrival of 100,000 new cars in the emirate and countless thousands of brown and white goods testifies to how much Kuwaitis have enjoyed their re-stocking. Indeed, the overriding Kuwaiti concern these days appears to be restoring private and family life. 'Everyone is only concerned with themselves,' says Mr Jasem Qabazard, a National Council member.' Everyone is preoccupied.' If the result is to create a strong and pervasive feeling of introspection and insularity in Kuwait, few Kuwaitis seem worried by that. 'The feeling is, Allah gave us oil and we will enjoy that in peace,' says one western diplomat. 'It is a dream of being outside the world.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- Colombian Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin began a visit to Cuba today at the invitation of the  Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to bolster bilateral relations  and to sign cultural cooperation agreements.    Sanin was greeted at Jose Marti Airport in the capital by  her  Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba  Ricardo Santamaria Salamanca, and Cuban Ambassador to Colombia  Jesus Martinez Beaton.    Just after her arrival in Havana, the chief of Colombian  diplomacy laid a wreath at the monument of Cuban national hero  Jose Marti at Revolution Square, and later she headed to the  headquarters of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to begin  official talks.    Sanin's visit was preceded in the past few weeks by visits  by  the Colombian ministers of health, mines, and agriculture and a  meeting here of a joint intergovernmental commission for  economic and scientific-technical cooperation. This reflects an  intensification in relations between Havana and Santa Fe de  Bogota.    During her visit, Sanin will have a busy schedule of  activities that includes a visit to the National Library to  donate books and to the House of the Americas to donate several  works of art.</p>

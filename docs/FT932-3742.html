			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alvis agrees electro-optics reorganisation ALVIS, the defence contractor, announced a reorganisation of its electro-optics activities, which involves the transfer of three businesses to the group's Avimo Singapore subsidiary. Shares in Alvis, formerly United Scientific Holdings, rose by 6p to 44p. The Singapore-listed subsidiary, in which Alvis has a 51 per cent stake, will acquire the businesses - Helio, Avimo Taunton, and AIO - in a deal worth Pounds 17.1m. Alvis, which makes armoured vehicles, will use the proceeds to pursue other areas of interest, either in defence or specialist engineering. It said grouping the electro-optics companies under a single focused management should increase their market penetration and profitability. Mr Nick Prest, chief executive of Alvis, said: 'The greater resources and flexibility afforded by this reorganisation should substantially strengthen the future development prospects of Alvis.' Helio, based in Kent, produces periscopes and turrets for armoured vehicles. Avimo Taunton makes military sights in Somerset. UIL holds a 49 per cent stake in AIO, which was established as a joint venture with the Egyptian government in 1982 to manufacture electro-optical instruments in Cairo. The payment for the transfer will comprise Pounds 8.2m in cash and the issue to Alvis of 14.9m new ordinary shares in Avimo Singapore at a price of SDollars 1.50. Mr Tony Pearson, Alvis's finance director, said the company would have net cash of about Pounds 13m after the deal was concluded. The transfer would dilute earnings in the short term, but Alvis had no intentions of just sitting on the proceeds. The Singapore company will fund the cash element of the transaction by making a 3-for-8 rights issue to its minority shareholders, underwritten by Morgan Grenfell (Asia). The net effect of will be to increase Alvis's stake in Avimo Singapore from 51 to 51.3 per cent. Alvis yesterday also announced a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.19m in the six months to March 31. Turnover increased from Pounds 42m to Pounds 45.8m. The improvement in pre-tax profit derived from an increase of more than 50 per cent in group operating profit to Pounds 1.26m and a greatly enhanced contribution from AIO, its Egyptian associate. Alvis said the performance at Alvis Industries was disappointing. Group order intake for the first half was Pounds 34m (Pounds 47m). Earnings per share were 0.1p against losses of 0.8p while the interim dividend was held at 0.5p.</p>

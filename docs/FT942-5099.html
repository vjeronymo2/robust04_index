			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Ankara seeks to soothe debt concerns Turkey yesterday sought to reassure foreign bankers that it will meet its international debt obligations, amid tentative signs the government's liquidity crisis is easing. Speaking to a conference in Istanbul, Mr Bulent Ozgun, head of the government's debt department, said the country would meet the Dollars 9.1bn in capital and interest owed on its Dollars 67bn foreign debt this year. The government last week eased its immediate liquidity worries, successfully returning to local debt markets, selling 3-month paper at 50 per cent interest. The tighter monetary conditions helped stabilise the lira, which yesterday was trading at around 33,000 to the dollar compared with 41,000 in mid-April. Turkey's growing foreign debt burden is a function of last year's fiscal strategy, which relied on heavy offshore borrowing in an effort to ease the pressure on domestic interest rates, reduce budget costs and avoid crowding out the private sector. But after pulling a Dollars 900m global issue in March, and repeated credit downgradings by both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the US rating agencies, Turkey will need the help of bilateral and multilateral official creditors if it is to avoid a debt rescheduling. Mr Ozgun yesterday criticised international credit agencies for being too hasty in downgrading Turkey in January, the event which triggered the run on the currency and plunged the country into this five-month crisis. 'We paid our debts during the worst times, and we will continue doing so,' he said. He ruled out an early return to the bond markets, however the government is looking to secure agreement with the International Monetary Fund early next month on a standby facility, in an effort to boost investor sentiment. With an economic slowdown likely and the devaluation, officials expect a cut in imports. With tourism revenues about the same as last year's, officials are projecting a balanced current account in 1994. On the capital account, as long as Turkey is able to roll over existing lines, the government expects zero net borrowings this year. 'We don't think it's in the interests of the foreign lenders to go to a rescheduling instead of keeping their trade lines open,' says Mr Necati Ozfirat, head of the state planning organisation (SPO). With Dollars 4.7bn worth of medium- and long-term principal maturing in 1994, Turkey is looking to some Dollars 3.7bn of new drawings this year. Direct foreign investment is projected at Dollars 600m. Portfolio investment, which includes both privatisation receipts and planned sale of convertible stock in PTT the state-owned telecommunications company, is targeted at Dollars 2.1bn. The SPO is forecasting a Dollars 2.5bn net short-term capital outflow, as Turkish banks and corporations reduce their foreign exchange exposure following the lira's 50 per cent fall against the dollar. The change in official reserves, now at just Dollars 3.4bn, or less than two months' import cover, is projected at Dollars 2bn. Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, announced the Dollars 1.2bn Gulf defence fund - Arab and US funds lodged in the Bank of New York to finance Turkey's F-16 fighter aircraft programme - is to be transferred to the Turkish central bank, boosting reserves. Turkey is also looking at credits from the Council of Europe's social fund, and is calling for the release of the European Union's fourth financial protocol, an aid package for Turkey which Greece is blocking in an attempt to wring concessions on the Cyprus dispute.</p>

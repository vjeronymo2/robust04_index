			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian company leads Russian gold chase A SMALL Australian company is trying this week to complete the first ever deal giving foreigners a direct stake in Russia's closely guarded gold mining industry. Star Technology Systems, a private consortium led by Mr Ian MacNee, is negotiating terms with Lenzoloto, a local Siberian gold producer, to buy a 31 per cent stake in all its operations - including the development of the Sukhoi Log mine, said to be Russia's largest proven hard rock gold deposit. State-owned Lenzoloto holds exclusive government licences for mining operations covering 105,000 sq km (40,000 square miles). It will be a coup in every respect if the deal goes through. Star, with recommendation from the Australian Embassy in Moscow, last month overcame a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles and vested interests to reach this stage of negotiations. The Russian government, which is anxious to attract foreign investment in its effort to introduce a market economy, had to overcome fierce internal wrangling in order to give Lenzoloto the right to negotiate the participation of a foreign partner. For Lenzoloto, this represented a considerable triumph: A local producer, it was able manage its own affairs after decades of tight control from Moscow. That control was exercised through the centralised monopoly organisation, Glavalmazzoloto, which dominated the mining and marketing of gold and precious stones. The organisation, which has since been renamed Rosalmazzoloto to cover only Russia rather than the former Soviet Union, led the resistance to the Star project. Star's achievement so far looks even more impressive considering that standing behind it is Central Mining Corporation - a listed Australian company which is also headed by Mr MacNee and which has an option to buy Star's interest in the joint stock company being set up by Lenzoloto for the purposes of bringing in badly-needed foreign capital. Central, which made losses in 1989, 1990 and 1991, was suspended from the Australian Stock Exchange from November to April for failing to file the quarterly exploration and working capital reports required by the Australian authorities. Its 1991 accounts were delayed because of inquiries which were made by Price Waterhouse, the auditors. And in December 1991, it had working capital of only ADollars 75,000 (Pounds 31,000). These factors do not constitute an argument against Central Mining's involvement in the project, however. When small exploration companies come up with a big project, they simply look for bigger sources of financing. But the fact that such a small company - rather than one of the established giants of the western gold mining industry - is now negotiating the first big gold deal in Russia, reflects the difficulties and risks of trying to do business in Russia. Two years ago, while big mining companies remained on the sidelines, apprehensive about gaps in legislation, continuing political instability and unclear ownership rights, Star began scouring the country for opportunities. It all began when a husband and wife team came over to work on a deal to extract platinum from waste left by Russian miners. Through a combination of luck and coincidence, they also became acquainted with Mr Boris Yeltsin, who said he would support them if they could find a partner in the gold business. It was a bold challenge at a time when Mr Yeltsin, who was still chairman of the Russian parliament, had not even wrested control of Russian gold resources from the Soviet leadership. Two years on, Mr Yeltsin is president and the country's supreme master. His young government of economic reformers is actively seeking foreign capitalists in order to underpin its market reforms. But even now, it is still unclear whether or not the deal will be allowed too go through. A government official said legal questions remained over whether it could go ahead. He also suggested that there could be problems with the price Star was prepared to pay for the stake, which he put at Dollars 50m. Part of the problem he explained, was the secrecy that traditionally surrounded the Russian gold mining industry, which meant that it was 'not quite clear what Star would be getting 31 per cent of'. He said Star had managed to get close to the deal because the big companies had not shown any interest - 'They usually prefer to have a controlling interest' - while Lenzoloto needed money quickly. He said the government had not done 'much digging' into Star's background. Mr Greme Ellis, Central's company secretary said last week that it was too early to predict the cost of developing the project, but that the deal would be financed through a mixture of equity and debt. Central has a shareholder agreement allowing it to expand its capital from 100m shares of 2 cents each to 500m. This implies the ability to raise some ADollars 80m at last Wednesday's market price of 21 cents, which compares with the 6 cents at which they were relisted last month. Mr MacNee said capital increase by Central was one of the options being considered, if the company was to be involved at all. 'Money is not the problem, the main issue now is getting the documentation right,' he said.</p>

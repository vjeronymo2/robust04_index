			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: France urged to block shipyard pact French shipbuilders yesterday condemned the weekend agreement on eliminating subsidies in the shipbuilding industry, claiming their competitors would benefit from indirect subsidies that would be left intact. Shipbuilders also urged the French government to try to block the accord. 'It is a very bad agreement,' said Mr Fabrice Theobald, general secretary of the Chambre Syndicale des Constructeurs de Navires, the French shipbuilders' association. He compared it to the Blair House agreement on agricultural trade between the European Union and the US, which reduced farm subsidies and was bitterly opposed by French farmers. The French government was alone in rejecting the agreement reached after a week of negotiations at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. France said it wanted negotiations to continue - to reach a consensus 'which respects the interests of all parties'. According to Mr Theobald, the principal French industry objections relate to indirect subsidies which, he says, are left intact under the agreement. He cited home credit schemes, under which shipowners get preferential interest rates for ordering ships at domestic yards and development and research grants. The French industry also opposes the Jones Act, under which US coastal trade is restricted to vessels built in US yards. 'We see no reason why this act should receive a blessing in the agreement,' said Mr Theobald. The CSCN said that the French government could and should block the OECD agreement by invoking vital national interests. Mr Theobald said that the French industry had restructured as far as possible and that, over the past 10 years, the number of big shipyards had been reduced from seven to two, while the number of shipyard workers had fallen from 20,000 to 5,000. 'We have no more fat left, only nerves and muscle,' he said. France yesterday played down suggestions that it would invoke special powers to protect subsidies paid to its ailing shipyards which have come under threat from the new international agreement. At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the French reiterated their opposition to the deal between the US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden to end direct and indirect subsidies to shipyards in these countries. The French argued that the agreement would not ensure fair competition because it allowed certain countries - notably Spain, Portugal and Belgium - to continue paying subsidies linked to existing programmes. France was offered a similar deal but turned it down, preferring to hold out for total exemption. Suggestions that France would evoke the so-called Luxembourg compromise  - which allows a country to veto an agreement - were dismissed as premature. The matter is likely to be discussed again at the next foreign ministers' council meeting. The agreement must be ratified by all participants and is due to take effect at the beginning of 1996.</p>

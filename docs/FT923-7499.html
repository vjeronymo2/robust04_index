			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Berlin's 'man with red scarf' quits THE star of Mr Walter Momper, who shot to international prominence as mayor of Berlin during Germany's unification celebrations, slumped below the horizon yesterday morning. 'The man with the red scarf' resigned as chairman of the city-state's Social Democrat party after a short, sharp clash over his new job as general manager of Ellinghaus, a building and property company with ambitions in the east. Complaining of attacks 'bordering on vilification', Mr Momper, 47, said he had been surprised by the vigour of the assault and claimed enemies had seized on his new job as an excuse to get rid of him. His political leadership had not been brought into question and there were no candidates for his job, he said yesterday. He had recognised the possibility of a conflict of interests between his new business commitments and his lifelong political vocation, and had undertaken not to do business personally in Berlin. But to no purpose. A week after his new appointment became known, Mr Momper was out. He gained local fame in 1989 after rallying quarrelsome SPD factions and leading the party to a surprise parliamentary victory over the CDU. For a brief 20 months, as unification loomed, came and went, Mayor Momper enjoyed popular support and shared the international limelight - never without his red scarf - in company with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other Bonn notables. But off-stage, his wobbly coalition with the anti-establishment Greens was unpopular with many SPD stalwarts. Combined with the surge of support for the CDU which followed the fall of the wall, the internal unrest led to the SPD suffering its worst-ever result in Berlin at the first pan-German election in December 1990. Although the CDU formed a government with the Social Democrats, there was no place in it for Mr Momper. Holding on as party chairman, he took a back seat in parliament. Resentments simmered and rivals waited for him to make a mistake. In the end, he made two. While Ellinghaus is above reproach, the Berlin property and construction business is no stranger to scandal and corruption charges. Second, and possibly worse, Mr Momper's new boss, Mr Gert Ellinghaus, is a member of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats. A surprise offer by Germany's DAG white-collar trade union to accept longer working hours and less pay was revealed yesterday after Sunday's preliminary pay talks for the 60,000 employees of Lufthansa. The loss-making state airline, will shortly announce a dramatic cost-cutting programme, expected to include up to 10,000 job losses. DAG, said its aim was to help restore Luthansa's fortunes.</p>

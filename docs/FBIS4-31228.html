			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)  [PD(FSN)] today issued a declaration which states, among other  things, that together with the entire Romanian public opinion,  the members of that political party who participated in the 1989  December revolution express their resolute protest and condemn  with all the strength lent to them by their faith in the values  of liberty and democracy the slanderous assertions by Corneliu  Vadim Tudor [senator and chairman of the Greater Romania Party  -- PRM], combined with a language lacking any trace of decency,  and addressed to the persons who, by their exemplary courage and  spirit of sacrifice, defying death, fought to remove the  totalitarian communist regime and to forge a new destiny for the  Romanian nation.    The PD(FSN) declaration continues by saying: With  indignation we reject the diversion with respect to the  so-called plot for the toppling by use of force of the current  regime, President Ion Iliescu, and the installing of King Mihai  before 17 June 1994. Mr. Ion Iliescu was among us during the  revolution, in the struggle fought for its victory, and,  regardless of our political stances, which may vary, his merits  cannot be denied, as no one can deny the legality and legitimacy  of his having been elected as head of our state.    The declaration in conclusion requests that the Romanian  Senate withdraw parliamentary status both from Corneliu Vadim  Tudor and, quote, from all people who, by their deeds, promote  views that are particularly dangerous for the country, the  law-governed state, and the opus of national reconstruction,  unquote. The declaration is signed by the PD(FSN) Steering  Collegium.</p>

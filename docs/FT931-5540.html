			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Mozart on the Fringe - Music Theatre Figaro starts the opera by mapping out his new room: 'TV . . . Video . . . Hi-fi . . . CD . . .' Leporello keeps the list of Giovanni's conquests on his pocket computer. Susanna wants to know if Figaro likes the new colour in her hair. Rosina summons her maid with a bleeper. Ottavio (rhymes with 'gravy-oh') calls Anna 'Kitten' and 'Precious.' Cherubino gets sent to the Brecon Beacons for a fortnight with the OTC. Don Giovanni (call me Don) launches the finale with a paean to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. This up-to-date modernity is just the top layer of Music Theatre London's versions of Figaro and Giovanni, which come to London after a triumphant tour of Germany and Austria. But there are other revelations. The best comes, I think, in casting both operas with skilled actors, who never place vocal effect above communicative singing. Put the words first and you hear how natural Mozart makes the voices sound - how far from high-art plush exclusivity he was. The only people who should stay away are canary-fanciers and Ur-text purists. It is Music Theatre London style to take more cuts than is usual in the opera house and to replace almost all recitative with speech. Figaro takes one cut too many - the great second-act trio - but it glides along. (Though Giovanni sags slightly at two points - the Commendatore's, sorry, Colonel's, death scene, and the coloratura of Anna's second aria - its general pace is, if anything, livelier.) The singers bring off the speech-song alternation with a naturalness that makes Figaro and Giovanni work like musicals (without the laborious elocution that so often bogs down the spoken bits in operas like The Magic Flute). Another joy is the sheer musical and dramatic wit with which these versions adapt Mozart to the 1990s. It is, of course, a hoot to see Rosina sing her first aria on an Exercycle, but when her pedalling changes tempo with the music, and as her singing never falters, the episode actually takes you deeper into Figaro. The farcically misdelivered kiss and slap in the Act Four finale work as well as I have seen them, but better yet is the moment that follows: Cherubino, escaping, bumps into both Figaro and Susanna and looks fleetingly aghast as he takes in a realm of adult intrigue beyond his comprehension. Amid an excellent ensemble, the performers who best exemplify Music Theatre London style are Liza Sadovy (Susanna and Zerlina) and William Relton (Ottavio and Basilio). These two are the most natural actor-singers of all, wonderful in their characterful underplaying; and the way Relton/Basilio says 'Sounds like a bud in need of nipping, Sir' is among the classic line-deliveries I have ever heard. Gerard Casey (Don G. and Sir Cecil ie the Count) is almost as good, though he grievously over-extends every pregnant pause. Simon Butteriss is both Masetto and Marcellina - yes - which may be the most remarkable role-swapping since Lynn Seymour switched from Carabosse to Aurora overnight in 1977; though he pulls faces too much, he is a marvellously amusing clown. The Britten/Broadhurst translation is so unfailingly good that I hope to return just to catch more of its passing felicities. It has only one tiny bit of translationese ("no tank from the window came down"). The way it never goes in for smart-alec rhymestering is part of its stylishness. And it misses only one target. Surely the modern Elvira does not join a convent? She joins a women's group, or becomes a lesbian, or starts a Ph. D. on the phallocentricity of Eurocentric culture. Last week you could also catch a more conventional Don Giovanni - period togs and all - at the Hackney Empire. The thrill here was hearing how well this theatre suits Mozart. Sitting way back, I loved both the ease with which the voices projected through the packed house and the absorption with which a largely Eastender audience followed most of the show. The company was Opera Box; its singers offer no new treats to those who know this opera, and the cast veered away from Fraser Goulding's baton too often. But this beautiful Matcham Theatre is the best venue for Mozart in London I have discovered. How appalling to find that it is battling for its continued existence. Music Theatre London's season at the Drill Hall, WC1, continues until March 21</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move to fixed terms is ruled out A MOVE to fixed-term parliaments and the ending of the prime minister's right to choose the date of general elections was rejected by Mr John Major yesterday. He firmly rebuffed a suggestion by a Labour MP that pre-determined general election dates would increase democracy. There was a five-year limit to the length of parliaments, Mr Major said, but the element of flexibility was 'part of our constitution'. 'It is right, it is helpful and it is not going to be changed,' he added at prime minister's questions. The Labour party backs fixed-term parliaments, and Mr Major's comments will disappoint MPs who had hoped his commitment to reforming the Commons procedures would extend to the calling of general election dates. Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, told Mr Major that 'the capacity of any prime minister to manipulate the decision-making process, and choose a time to create a window of opportunity, is wholly undemocratic and betrays your bogus reforming credentials'.</p>

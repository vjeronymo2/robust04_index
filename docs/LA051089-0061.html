			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS EXTENSION OF SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AGENCY  </P> <P> The state Senate Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday approved a bill to give  the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, now scheduled to go out of business in  July, 1990, a new lease on life.  </P> <P> The measure, by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), would extend the  existence of the agency to Dec. 31, 1995. Without discussion, the committee  approved the bill on a 9-0 vote and sent it to the Senate Appropriations  Committee.  </P> <P> Rosenthal said he was "a little surprised" that the bill sailed through the  Natural Resources Committee without opposition because critics in previous  years have questioned the need for the conservancy. He suggested that the  conservancy now is accepted by lawmakers as a "motherhood" issue.  </P> <P> "I think that the environment and open space concepts have taken on greater  importance in people's minds," Rosenthal said.  </P> <P> Supporters saw the unopposed vote as a hopeful sign for the bill's eventual  passage.  </P> <P> Since the conservancy was established in 1979, it has purchased or helped pay  for the acquisition of about 10,000 acres of open space and parkland at a cost  of about $38 million, according to Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's  executive director.  </P> <P> When the conservancy was created, backers overcame objections that there were  already sufficient state and local agencies to handle purchases of private  property in the mountains.  </P> <P> In 1981, the Legislature extended the conservancy's life to July, 1986, but as  that date approached, prospects for further extension were uncertain because  Gov. George Deukmejian was not a strong supporter of the agency. In 1985, for  example, Deukmejian dealt it a setback by vetoing $6 million in the budget for  the conservancy to buy additional land. Later that year, however, Deukmejian  signed legislation extending the conservancy to 1990.  </P> <P> The agency has increasingly attracted bipartisan support, with Republicans now  carrying bills for an agency that was established with heavy Democratic  backing.  </P></p>

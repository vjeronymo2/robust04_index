			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW UP 11.18, BOOSTED BY DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> Stock prices advanced broadly today, aided by new declines in interest rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.18 to 2,493.77, cutting its  loss for the week to 7.33 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 1,025 up, 412 down and 513 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 143.12 million shares, against 154.47 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained 1.26 to 179.31.  </P> <P> Activity tapered off through the day as many traders got an early start on the  long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday.  </P> <P> Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds  rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the  8.6%-8.65% range.  </P> <P> Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent downturn in  rates might have further to go, with encouragement from the Federal Reserve.  </P> <P> The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as Fed policy makers have  intended. Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to ease  credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in foreign  exchange.  </P> <P> Bond prices were higher in early trading today, rebounding from an earlier  decline on the strength of the rising dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 17/32 point, or about $5.30 for every  $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite  direction to its price, had declined to 8.62% from 8.67% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Early trading was thin.  </P> <P> Analysts said bond prices were knocked down earlier today by the government  report on consumer spending, which fueled the market's fears of inflation. Bond  prices recovered later, however, as the dollar strengthened against major  foreign currencies, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Basically, it looks like we're just shrugging off some of the economic data  recently and focusing on the foreign exchange market," said Kevin Flanagan, a  money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secondary Market  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues were up 1/16 point to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities had  gained 3/16 point to 5/16 point and long-term issues had jumped about 1/2  point, according to figures provided by the Telerate Inc. financial information  service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  had risen 2.40 to 1,150.95.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrial bonds were lower. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80  corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, had slipped 0.16 to  313.42.  </P></p>

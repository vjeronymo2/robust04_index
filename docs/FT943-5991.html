			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Doctors fear 'death blow' of local pay deals Prospects for a better relationship between the government and doctors would be dealt an 'ideological death blow' if ministers went ahead with plans for local performance-related pay, the British Medical Association warned yesterday. Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the association's council, told a BMA national conference in London that he believed Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, had responded positively to BMA calls for changes to the 1991 reforms to the NHS. The 'fragile but precious prospect' this offered of finding a 'new consensus to restore equity, integrity and sanity' to healthcare could be wrecked if the government tried to force local pay machinery on the NHS. Ministers intend to start shifting the NHS's national pay structure to local arrangements next year. Hospital managers have been told to have local pay machinery in place by February. Conference delegates brought the BMA into direct conflict with these plans, with hundreds of doctors from throughout the country declaring that locally determined pay was 'not compatible with a national health service'. The BMA fears that, in the market-based NHS created by the 1991 reforms, local pay arrangements would force doctors to concentrate on their hospitals' business priorities at the expense of medical ones. Because some hospitals and medical specialties are more financially viable than others, it believes local pay would undermine the even spread of specialist skills throughout the country. Dr Anthony Toft, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, told the conference there was a 'certain inevitability' that managers would offer the greatest rewards to individuals, units or hospitals generating the greatest incomes. The conference demonstrated the extent to which the doctors' vocal opposition to local pay is seen as spearheading wider concerns in the NHS and elsewhere in the public sector. Although the BMA is not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, Mr John Monks, general secretary, sent a message of support to the conference.</p>

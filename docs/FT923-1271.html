			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Thailand's new premier finalising his cabinet MR Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat party, became prime minister of Thailand yesterday, 10 days after the general election in which the Democrats won the largest number of parliamentary seats. The appointment of Mr Chuan, 54, a mild-mannered career politician admired for his integrity, follows two years of political instability embracing the military coup d'etat of February 1991 and the killing of at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators by troops in May this year. Foreign investors and local businessmen have welcomed Mr Chuan's victory, but few political commentators believe his fragile parliamentary coalition will heed his calls for unity and survive intact until the end of the government's four-year term. The Democrats and three allied political parties opposed to the armed forces' action in May won only a slim majority in the election, forcing Mr Chuan to bring in the pro-military Social Action party as a fifth coalition partner. 'I fully realise that, from this minute, the task facing me is great and limitless,' Mr Chuan said after receiving a royal decree naming him prime minister. Negotiations were continuing last night on the final shape of Mr Chuan's cabinet. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, president of Siam Commercial Bank, said he had agreed to become finance minister. Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the anti-corruption campaigner who led the street protests in May and heads the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party, has so far declined to accept the proffered portfolio of transport and communications, a notorious source of corrupt earnings for politicians in previous administrations.</p>

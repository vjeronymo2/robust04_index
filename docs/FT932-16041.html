			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lord Boardman to head Heron HERON International, the property and trading group that is in the final stages of a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring, has appointed Lord Boardman as non-executive chairman. Lord Boardman, a former chairman of National Westminster Bank - which is a member of Heron's five-bank creditors steering committee - will take up his post once the restructuring is complete. The appointment of a new chairman to replace Mr Gerald Ronson, the company's founder, was heralded last October when the company announced its outline restructuring proposals. Mr Ronson, who will remain as chief executive, said: 'I have worked with Lord Boardman in the past and I am delighted that someone of his obvious stature and experience will be joining the board as chairman.' Heron said it would shortly be making an announcement to bondholders about its refinancing. 'The restructuring process continues to proceed well,' it said. Final proposals on the restructuring, which involve the conversion of debt to equity, were sent to the company's bankers in February. The company also plans to appoint two new non-executive directors, who are acceptable to the banks' steering committee and to bondholder representatives. The two existing non-executive directors, Mr Tony Royle and Mrs Gail Ronson, will retire on completion of the restructuring. Heron's restructuring talks originally began in March 1992, after a downturn in its property portfolio and losses in its trading operations eroded its assets to a deficit of some Pounds 225m at March 31 1992.</p>

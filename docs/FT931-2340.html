			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dedicated followers of fashion - The growing popularity of emerging markets THE investment industry is always prone to fashion. With three investment trusts currently attempting to raise money to invest in emerging markets, it is clear what is the fashion of the moment. There is no precise definition of what constitutes an emerging market but the general idea is that they can be found in developing countries, which are either converting to capitalism or significantly liberalising their financial systems. Templeton, one of the management groups which specialises in the area, says that more than 75 per cent of the world's population lives in such countries. Countries in south east Asia, Latin America and parts of southern Europe are obvious candidates. Robert Fleming, which manages the Fleming Emerging Markets Investment Trust, breaks countries down into three categories: emerging, incubating and dormant. The first includes countries such as Argentina, Korea and Venezuela and consists of markets which Fleming will consider backing at the moment. Incubating markets are ones which might be interesting in the future, such as Cyprus, Egypt or Zimbabwe. Dormant markets cover nations such as Cuba and Tunisia, which could be interesting if policies changed. The primary reason for emerging markets being so enticing is the expectation of higher economic growth. The World Bank predicts 3.6 per cent per annum in the 1990s, compared with 2.1 per cent for industrialised countries. The reasons for their faster growth include improving literacy rates, creating both a more educated workforce and a downward pressure on the birth rate. In the long run, this economic growth should feed through, via higher corporate profits, into better stock market returns. That, argues Fleming, was the experience of the 1980s, as Taiwan, Thailand and south Korea enjoyed growth of more than 8 per cent in gross domestic product and more than 15 per cent in stock market returns. A further factor is economic liberalisation. Examples include the opening up of eastern Europe, the prospect of a free trade grouping including the US and Mexico, and the easing of restrictions on overseas investments in countries such as Taiwan and Brazil. In most emerging markets, stock markets constitute a much smaller percentage of GDP than in developed countries. The very nature of these countries' underdevelopment makes them risky. Stock markets are illiquid with the bulk of a market's capitalisation centred on a few stocks, Accounting practices may not conform to the standards of the industrialised world. Political regimes are often unstable and economies prone to problems such as hyperinflation. The result can be enormous volatility. Turkey fell by more than 40 per cent in 1992, while Peru was up by 120 per cent. But enthusiasts see these risks as opportunities. For a start, they say that underdeveloped markets are inefficient and create more scope for seeking undervalued stocks than the much-monitored exchanges of London and Wall Street. Furthermore, the very difficulty of investing in these markets is a reason for both institutions and private investors to use the specialist services of a fund manager, such as the three currently trying to raise finance: Fleming, Genesis (via an offshore-based fund) and Templeton. In addition, the enthusiasts argue that emerging markets have very low correlation with each other or with the main stock markets. Thus a diversified fund can offer a significant reduction in risk. Cynics would argue, however, that whenever a fashion appears, it must be the top of the market. The five investment trusts in the field with a two year record produced an average return of 80.3 per cent over the two years to March 1 (mid-market to mid-market with net income reinvested). That was the best performance of any investment trust sector over the period. But despite these increases, both Templeton and Fleming argue that valuations in many markets are still attractive and trade on price/earnings ratios lower than those in the US, UK and Japanese markets. Furthermore, it is argued that these markets are being neglected by large investors at the moment. Fleming quotes figures from the World Bank showing that foreign institutional investment, as a percentage of total assets, was only 0.2 per cent at the end of 1989. Even though that is forecast to grow to 0.5 per cent by the year 2000, it may still represent a substantially underweight position. Mr Mark Mobius, investment manager at Templeton Emerging, points out that the emerging stock markets have a capitalisation greater than that of the French and German markets combined. The limited number of funds in this area has created the scope for the managers to raise new money. The Fleming and Templeton funds have frequently been able to trade at premiums to net asset values, a sign that demand for shares exceeds supply. Fleming is seeking to raise about Pounds 50m in total, having conditionally placed Pounds 37m of stock already. Templeton is looking for more than Pounds 20m. The Genesis details are yet to be confirmed. It seems that emerging markets are emerging from a backwater into the mainstream of investment.</p>

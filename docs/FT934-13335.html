			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Saudi backing for new BBC service BBC WORLD Service Television's new Arabic service for the Middle East and north Africa is being financed by the Mawarid investment and industrial group of Saudi Arabia, Raymond Snoddy writes. The deal, agreed in principle, would see WSTV signing a 10-year programme supply agreement for about Pounds 200m. The actual agreement is with Orbit Communications, a Rome-based subsidiary of Mawarid, which has shown a growing interest in all forms of communications. Orbit's name appeared in legal documents in the dispute between WSTV and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The BBC yesterday won an undertaking in the High Court that it will remain part of the Star Television service in Asia until the full hearing of a contract dispute. News Corporation, which controls Star, threatened to terminate the BBC's 10-year contract because of the planned Arabic news service. Star threatened the action because although the television services involved are very different there is an overlap in the areas served by the satellites involved. Mr Chris Irwin, chief executive of WSTV, expressed satisfaction at the undertaking.</p>

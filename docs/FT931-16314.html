			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: UK merchant bank loses sell-off role MORGAN GRENFELL has lost the mandate to sell MEH, the state-owned Hungarian recycling company. The State Property Agency, Hungary's privatisation authority, announced it had been unable to reach agreement with the UK merchant bank on fees and was therefore not renewing the mandate. The SPA expressed disappointment that two years of work on MEH had produced no results. Mr Lajos Csepi, SPA managing director, described another Morgan Grenfell transaction, the privatisation of Nagykanizsa Brewery, as 'a complete failure.' Morgan Grenfell confirmed yesterday the two sides had failed to agree, but blamed conflicts within the Hungarian government for delays in transactions. Morgan Grenfell's departure comes one month after a similar incident involving Barclays de Zoete Wedd, another UK investment bank. The SPA sacked BZW as adviser on the privatisation of Kobanya Brewery, alleging BZW had ignored important instructions. Tensions between the Hungarian authorities and western advisers have grown as privatisation transactions have dragged on. SPA officials feel costs are out of proportion to the proceeds, while western investment banks are increasingly unwilling to work for uncertain success fees.</p>

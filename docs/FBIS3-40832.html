The Indo UAE joint commission, in a pressnote on Thursday,  said that technical discussions were held between the two sides  and these would be continued in Abu Dhabi at an early date. The  seventh meeting of the commission was cochaired by Secretary  (West) in the External Affairs Ministry K. Srinivasan and  Director in the Department of Economic Relations and  International Cooperation of the UAE Foreign Ministry Mohammed  Khalifa Bin Yousef Al-Suwaidi.    Mr Al-Suwaidi, who later called on External Affairs Minister  Dinesh Singh, conveyed to him that conclusion of an extradition  treaty would be held in combatting the menace of terrorism.    Mr Al-Suwaidi expressed satisfaction at the recommencement  of  Indo-Pakistan dialogue and hoped that this would continue with  patience and flexibility.    Mr Dinesh Singh noted that the just concluded three-day  meeting of the joint commission had taken substantial decisions  and assured the UAE leader that India would pursue various  specific initiatives vigorously.    Mr Al-Suwaidi said his country was looking forward to Prime  Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit this year. He also met  Ministers of State R.L. Bhatia and Salman Khursheed.    The joint commission discussed a wide range of issues  relating to investment, trade, economic and industrial  cooperation, justice, security, consular and man-power matters  and interaction in the areas of water resources, power  generation, agriculture, fisheries, post and telecommunications,  banking, education and information and media exchanges.    An agreement to counter trafficking in narcotic drug and the  cultural exchange programme for 1994-96 were also signed by the  two sides. The narcotics agreement, which provides for exchange  of information and other cooperation between the designated  agencies of the two sides, is the first which India signed with  any Arab country.    Technical discussions were held and considerable headway was  made on a bilateral treaty dealing with extradition as well as  other aspects of judicial cooperation.    India will organise an exclusive `India exhibition' in  Dubayy  in September this year. In addition visits are planned this year  by delegations from the Federal Chambers of Commerce and  Industry [FICCI] of the UAE to India and by delegations from the  Assocham [Associated Chamber of Commerce] and FICCI to the UAE.    The UAE Agriculture Minister is to pay a visit to India this  year.    The eighth meeting of the joint commission, it has been  decided, would be held in Abu Dhabi in the middle of this year.</p>

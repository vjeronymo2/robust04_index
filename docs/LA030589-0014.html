			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: BEAUTY AND THE MD;  </P> <P> DOCTORS VENTURE INTO THE COSMETICS BUSINESS WITH IN-OFFICE SALES  </P> <P> TODAY MANY doctors have entered the cosmetics business, selling  non-prescription skin-care products right in their offices. Like beauty  advisers in department stores, dermatologists and plastic surgeons are now  recommending lines of cleansers, astringents and moisturizers. Some physicians  formulate their products, others add their labels to existing generics, and  still others sell brand-name items designed specifically for sale in doctors'  offices.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills dermatologist Letantia Bussell created her product line, Beverly  Hills Proform, because "my patients always asked me what to use, and I didn't  find any one line that addressed all their needs." Originally sold only in her  office to patients with complexion problems, Proform is now sold in selected  stores across the country and will soon be available in selected J. C. Penney  stores in Southern California.  </P> <P> RejuvenAge, which was developed for use with the prescription drug Retin-A, is  a brand-name line sold in a number of doctors' offices. The six-item collection  was tested by dermatologist Albert Kligman, the professor at the University of  Pennsylvania School of Medicine who invented Retin-A and first reported its  anti-aging effects. The line features a facial cleanser, four moisturizers (two  with a sun-protection factor of 6 and two with an SPF of 15) and a nighttime  emollient.  </P> <P> Robert Kotler, a Century City cosmetic surgeon, sells RejuvenAge to patients  who use Retin-A as part of what he calls "a complete program to treat  wrinkles." Kotler, a clinical instructor of surgery at the UCLA School of  Medicine, says he chose to sell the line because Kligman's name is associated  with it. "He's the dean of dermatology today, so his name is a very important  credential to be attached to the product," Kotler explains.  </P> <P> The question of medical ethics is bound to arise when doctors begin to sell  cosmetic products. The American Academy of Dermatologists has taken the  official stand that "selling products is permissible as long as it is in the  best interest of the patient," according to J. Richard Allison Jr. of Columbia,  S.C., chairman of the academy's ethics committee. But he and Eugene P. Schoch  Jr. of Austin, Tex., another member of the committee, agree that patients  become a captive audience for doctors eager to make a profit. "There's  something psychological that happens when a doctor puts something in your hand  and says, 'This is my product,' " says Allison. "It's a one-to-one relationship  that can be exploited," Schoch adds.  </P> <P> "I never tell patients they must use my products -- no reputable dermatologist  would do that." Bussell says. "But I recommend them because I know exactly  what's in them. I know I can stand behind them."  </P> <P> Kligman says that although he suggests that his patients use a moisturizer with  Retin-A, he does not single out RejuvenAge. In fact, Kligman says, he does not  endorse RejuvenAge or any other cosmetic product.  </P> <P> Are the products physicians sell really any better than the skin-care  preparations sold in department stores and pharmacies? Obviously, the doctors  who sell them think so. But ethics-committee member Schoch says: "They are  absolutely not inherently better. Dermatologists are not pharmaceutical  chemists, and they shouldn't try to be." On the other hand, Allison counters,  some of the products may have value. "Some physicians started out as  pharmacists -- they know what they're doing. Sometimes these products are the  same things you can buy in a store, and other times they are not."  </P></p>

In his words, 5,833  candidates were registered as of 2 March, a figure which cannot  increase but only be reduced for a number of objective reasons.  Yemets informed journalists that on the average across Ukraine,  13 individuals were registered per district, although there is  one district in Kiev in which 31 candidates have been nominated,  and there are three districts in all of Ukraine in which just  two persons each have been nominated.    Some 62.3 percent of all candidates were nominated by the  voters, 26.7 percent--by labor collectives, and only 11  percent--by political parties. Among the parties that have  nominated candidates, the Communists are in the lead with 6.7  percent. People's Rukh of Ukraine has 4.1 percent, the  Socialists--3.1 percent, the Ukrainian Republicans--2.4 percent,  the Liberals--1.4 percent, and the Democrats--1.3 percent. Ivan  Yemets states that these data pertain to "pure" party  candidates, while the actual number of party nominees is far  greater, many candidates simply not desiring to link their names  with unpopular parties. Representatives of 22 nationalities  residing in Ukraine are registered as candidates for people's  deputy of Ukraine. There are more Ukrainians than any other  ethnic group--87 percent. Russians comprise 18.6 percent. Within  the entire field of candidates, 24.6 percent are engineers or  representatives of other technical specialties; 15.6 percent are  employees of various backgrounds; 10.4 percent are lawyers; 8.5  percent--economists; 6.3 percent--physicians; 7  percent--agricultural workers; 3 percent--journalists; 2.2  percent--military servicemen. With respect to academic  qualifications, 98.4 percent of the candidates have higher  education, secondary, or secondary specialized education; 89.6  percent have attained the higher level of education. Of this  number, 6.8 percent are academicians and corresponding members,  and about 3 percent are doctors of science. According to the  candidate applications, 43.2 percent of them have a command of  foreign languages.    The Central Electoral Commission chairman made special note  of the increase in number of lawyers and economists among the  candidates, who comprise only about 3 percent of the present  parliament. Some 145 members of the present body of deputies are  registered as candidates, Yemets stated. But this is not the  final figure, since not all the official documents of district  electoral commissions have yet been processed.    The occupational composition of the candidates for people's  deputy is interesting. Despairing of having to wait for official  Kiev to adopt an intelligible policy of reforms, businessmen and  representatives of commercial and entrepreneurial structures  have aspired to the position of people's deputy. More of them  are registered as candidates than any other group--13.2 percent.  After them come state enterprise employees--10.3 percent,  employees of state administrations--5.4 percent, chairmen and  functionaries of councils at all levels--6.2 percent, directors  of state enterprises--4.6 percent, and employees of law  enforcement organs--5.7 percent. We can add to these figures the  fact that Acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyy,  four deputy prime ministers, and 37 ministers or deputy  ministers of the current government have been registered as  candidates for people's deputy. These data provide eloquent  testimony to the intensity of the struggle for power that is  under way between representatives of council structures and the  structures of executive authority. Neither the "council" nor  "presidential" side has abandoned hope of being victorious in  the parliamentary election and winning power over to its side  through legitimate means.    Age-wise, the field of registered candidates includes most  people from 41 to 50 years old--39 percent; candidates 31 to 40  years old comprise 27.2 percent, 51 to 60--24.3 percent, and  over 60--4 percent. Yemets made special note of the fact that  for the first time the election will take place with an age  requirement: A candidate must be over 25 years old. All the  same, more than 5 percent are young people from 25 to 30 years  old.    The new parliament of Ukraine promises to be predominantly  male (just 7.4 percent of the candidates are women) and urban  (just 14.5 percent of the candidates are from rural localities).    Ivan Yemets refused to comment on the election programs of  the candidates, and assured those present that his commission  would act in strict compliance with the law. He noted, however:  "I did have occasion to hear a television broadcast of candidate  presentations and what they were telling people. Let me say  quite frankly that I feel sorry for our voters."    I. Yemets stated in conclusion that his commission would  also  conduct second rounds of voting and repeat elections in those  districts where the election was null, as well as the June  election of the president of Ukraine. Yemets called upon the  citizens of Ukraine to turn out for the election on 27 March. In  his words, the election, which has not yet even taken place, has  already "eaten up" more than 1 trillion karbovantsy, money that  could have been used to help the disabled and the needy. In this  regard, Yemets stated that if a certain district failed twice to  elect a people's deputy over the course of a year, no further  elections would be held. As to how to escape the constitutional  crisis that could arise if this occurs in the majority of  districts, the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission  provided no explanation, and only stated: "There is no need to  create unforeseen situations."</p>

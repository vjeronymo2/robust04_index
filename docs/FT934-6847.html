			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Just say No to the pros Professionals must be slapped about a bit from time to time. Whenever we consumers neglect this solemn duty, our lawyers, doctors, accountants, architects, engineers, chemists and so on become idle, complacent and greedy. They bury their mistakes and, too often, one of us. I learned how to handle such predatory beasts early in life, after returning a solicitor's invoice with the words 'Are you joking?' scrawled at the foot of the page, near the total. A few weeks' silence ensued. Eventually the bill came back, halved. Everyone should try this. Go on. Question a professional's fee this very morning. What can you lose? Or try going elsewhere. You may have much to gain. Based on years of experience, my first port of call is a 'designer' rather than an architect, a computer program rather than an accountant and anyone rather than a lawyer. This may not be the tone expected by the Royal Institute of British Architects, which gave me a seat, lunch and coffee at its seminar on professionalism last week. The purpose was evidently to make the point that the professions are in 'crisis' and that a bit more respect for them would not only be beneficial to all mankind; it would bathe the earth-mother Gaia herself in a roseate glow. Several speakers, many from the audience, supported this view. The enemy was quickly identified. It is that old devil the free market. Thatcherism, it seems, destroys the professional ethic. People who follow a vocation cannot be expected to sully their hands with commerce. There may be something, although not much, in this. Professor Harold Perkin, author of The Rise of Professional Society: England since 1880, gave as a foundation text the following passage from Adam Smith: 'We trust our health to the physician; our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as may give them that rank in society which so important a trust requires.' Trust is the word. Professor Perkin, who teaches at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, reminded us that when you purchase the services of a professional the familiar caveat emptor, let the buyer beware, becomes, credat emptor, let the buyer believe. What? Believe accountants, not enough of whom are in jail, or doctors, who cover up lethal mistakes made by their fellow practitioners, or lawyers, who practise only to deceive? Well, yes. At the end of the day we have little option. This point was made by Mr Michael Burrage, who lectures at the London School of Economics. He has studied the French, Russian and American revolutions, noting that in each case the professions were destroyed by the new regimes. For a while it was possible to practise law or medicine without any training or qualification, or reference to any rules or set of ethics. The inevitable re-invention of professional associations was not initiated by self-interested professionals, but by the state and public opinion. The re-establishment of the French legal profession was begun by the Jacobin Club when in 1792 it established a 'Committee of Official Defenders of the Friends of Liberty and Equality'. Even Stalin revived the old Russian colleges of advocates. In the US the state governments, spurred by private foundations and the press, sought to reconstitute the medical profession. Legislation to control legal practice came from the west before there were any bar associations. The two ancient professions may survive, but what of the 40 other professional bodies recognised under English law in the 19th century, or the further 120 that have sprung up in the 20th? They cannot all justify self-regulation, barriers to entry, and try-on pricing. According to Sir Gordon Borrie, this was recognised in the late 1970s, when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission tackled restrictions on advertising by accountants and solicitors and fee-rigging by architects. Sir Gordon, who was director-general of Fair Trading from 1976 until last year, smashed the opticians' hold on their trade in 1982. He sees the OFT report of that year as a turning point in attitudes to professionalism. The ending of the solicitors' monopoly over conveyancing was a subsequent triumph. Yet the professions have not been obliterated. The BMA is still with us, fighting a rearguard action against every change, however progressive. Doctors have long resisted handing simple functions, like renewing prescriptions, over to nurses. The lawyers have fought Lord Mackay, the would-be liberaliser of their trade, to a standstill. The top civil servants remain to be tamed: we shall see how they dispose of open competitive advertising for their jobs. Mystique, a hold on the nuts and bolts of procedure, gives them powers beyond reason. Against that, the Treasury has done more to unnerve Britain's professions than any MMC or OFT report. Academics can no longer rely on tenure: they must accept short-term contracts and often have to find their own sponsors to fund them. The National Health Service is a wondrous mechanism for keeping down the remuneration of doctors and nurses. It has now become the state's instrument for placing managerial overlords above professional medical staff. The accountants reign supreme in public services. Legal aid is squeezed. The recession, combined with compulsory competitive tendering, has created a new tribe of formerly-employed architects. Teachers, under the government's latest bill to control their training, may be wholly de-professionalised. Expect untutored young trainees to stand before the blackboards. They are cheaper than the professionals they will replace. This is a pity. Provided that they behave themselves, professional societies could be a better safeguard against malpractice than either regulation by the state or the power of the market. As Professor Perkin points out, in post-industrial society, where knowledge is the principal factor of production, professional skills have become more valuable. Purist proponents of the market will say that where there is transparency consumers will judge which practitioners are safest, or who gives best value. In some instances this is surely correct. When the government gets the mechanics right, testing and league tables may help parents to judge where the best teachers can be found. But only doctors can detect mistakes made by their colleagues. The trick is to insist that they expel bad practitioners. Solicitors, who apparently have to be serial embezzlers to get a slap on the wrist from their peers, should be struck off or fined for bad service. If teachers want to be professionals, they must take similar medicine. Some professions are learning the lesson. Rabbi Julia Neuberger told us that the first 10 days of the course at Harvard Business School is spent on ethics. There is similar insistence in the law and education schools. In the medical school 'values education' is paramount. This makes sense. Without an ethos, special knowledge alone is not enough to justify the benefits of professional exclusivity. As Sir Gordon intimates, associations that accept commercial reality while maintaining a moral purpose are most likely to survive. There is a good reason why they should. The disaggregation of society, its breakdown into self-seeking individuals linked only by cash transactions, is troubling many in the West, notably in Britain where it seems likely to go furthest. However minimalist a state may become, it is better kept in check if it is not the only source of civic authority. Reformed professional associations could be advocates of the public interest. We will have to keep slapping them about until they get the message.</p>

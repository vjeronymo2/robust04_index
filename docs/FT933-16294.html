			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Mickey Mouse squeaks back into Beijing on best behaviour MICKEY MOUSE and Donald Duck are back in China - but their behaviour must be politically and socially correct. Donald's exuberant nephews will not be allowed to set a bad example for Chinese children, says Mr Zhao Wenyi, a senior editor of China's Post and Telecommunications Press, Disney's partner in China. Also excluded from Chinese editions of Disney comics, for example, will be a sequence in which a lad eating an ice cream and leading a dog pursuing a cat becomes entangled in a tree with the ice cream smeared across his face. 'Since, in Chinese cities, it is not allowed to raise a dog, not to mention a dog led by a small boy, we didn't want to run counter to the regulations so we dropped the story,' said Mr Zhao. It would have been 'perfectly all right' if the boy were running after a bee, which would have been 'more like a Chinese situation'. Also banished from Donald Duck's family will be his money-worshipping Uncle Scrooge, whose habit of bathing in piles of dollar bills is not deemed appropriate for a Chinese audience - never mind that people have been told for the past 10 years that 'to get rich is glorious'. In spite of the amendments, Disney executives are excited about returning to China's market of 1.1bn people, after a first attempt to introduce a Chinese-speaking Mickey and Donald in 1987. Disney pulled out in 1990, in protest at counterfeiting of its comics and products. Now, though, with the passage of China's first copyright law, the company has decided to return, lured by the market's enormous potential. The first new edition of Mickey Mouse comics appeared in China on June 1, international children's day, with an initial print run of 60,000 copies. These were snapped up almost overnight, at a price equivalent to about 30 US cents (20p) each. Mr Zhao has no doubt that Mickey and Donald will prove a success and, in the process, provide a welcome change for Chinese children from their regular comic book heroes whose fantasy world is a little heavier and less humorous.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Facilities at London airport A P&amp;O company, BOVIS CONSTRUCTION, has won a Pounds 9m design and construct contract for two lounge buildings, each of three storeys, to be built alongside Pier 7 at Heathrow's Terminal 3 for Heathrow Airport Ltd. The new lounge buildings will provide 86,000 sq ft of space. On the first and second floors there will be 17 CIP (commercially important people) lounges that will be leased to airlines operating out of Terminal 3. The first and second floors will be equipped with duty-free shops and toilets. The ground floor will be reserved for storage, aircraft servicing facilities and security accommodation. The flat roofed buildings, which will be located on the apron 'airside' of the pier, will be steel framed with concrete and pre-cast plank flooring with external cladding panels to match those on the existing Terminal 3. One building will be supported on bored piles and will be completed by the end of this year. The other building spans the route of the tunnel for the proposed Paddington-Heathrow Express and for this reason is to be supported on a concrete raft ring beam.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obvious solution to choice of new Euro-leader Sir, It is unfortunate that your leader, 'How not to pick a Euro-leader' (June 8), stops short of its logical conclusion. While quite rightly criticising the current self-interested machinations of EU governments over the choice of a successor to Jacques Delors, as well as the secrecy and horse trading involved in making the choice and the absence of a clear idea of the qualities required for the job, your leader failed to propose any mechanism through which these failings could be rectified, now or in the future. The solution is obvious. According to the Maastricht treaty, the member states are required to consult the newly-elected European parliament on its nomination for Commission president. However, there is now a real possibility that the European parliament, at its constituent session in July, will be faced with the member governments having failed to make such a nomination. In these circumstances it will be up to the parliament to fill the political vacuum resulting from the (closed) vacillations of the EU's governments. The parliament could provide a forum in which the qualities, policy preferences and independence of candidates would be examined and discussed, in public. And a choice could even be made between candidates which would reflect European public opinion as expressed in EU-wide elections only a month previously.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Thailand to get British university Work has begun in Thailand on the first British university to be built outside the UK. It will be staffed by British academics and award degrees validated by parent universities in the UK. Ministers hope that the project, led by the Department of Trade and Industry's education and training group, will be the first of several British universities throughout the Pacific Rim and the Middle East, following the model of international American universities. Baroness Perry, leader of the group which was set up a year ago to boost UK educational exports, said the project was needed to co-ordinate exports by British universities and to reverse inroads made in the market by higher-education institutions from Germany, the US and Australia. Funding for the university is coming exclusively from Thai financiers. It will be a private institution, with local people paying for tuition. Lady Perry said: 'A British degree has international currency, and Thai people will be more than willing to pay for it.' The university aims to accept its first students in October 1996 and will eventually cater for about 10,000 students. Two campus sites have been designated, one of which will specialise in finance and economics, while the other will concentrate on engineering and technology. The project hopes to win final approval from the Thai government in July, once detailed arrangements on appointments of administrators and lecturers have been finalised. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said there was scope for similar initiatives elsewhere in the Pacific Rim, as several nations, including Korea and Taiwan, have a shortage of university places compared with the numbers that graduate from secondary school. Several British universities are already active in the area although the Thai project is the most ambitious. For example Warwick University, which is not taking part in the new project, has separate manufacturing departments in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur and plans to offer accounting and finance courses from Shanghai. The DTI group also aims to expand British higher education in Latin America, where it has so far made few inroads.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with presidential candidate Leonid </F> Kuchma by Valeriy Pavlenko; place and date not given: "What We  Need Is Self-Confidence and Vigor..."]    [Text] Leonid Kuchma, chairman of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP], has a lot of business  to handle. Having delivered a report at the sixth congress of  the USPP, he set out on the road again. It was an overseas  trip, but only for five days. However, he managed to do a lot  during this trip. The list of U.S. high officials, with whom  Kuchma met, is rather impressive. I would like to decipher this  list by not only listing names, but also reporting on opinions,  assessments, and proposals. Naturally, my first question was  about this trip.    [Kuchma] I was invited to the United States by the  International Fund for Democracy and Development, of which Nixon  was honorary chairman until his death. My first talks were with  P. Rosenblat, acting chairman of the Fund. Next, I met with  U.S. Vice President A. Gore; E. Leica, U.S. presidential  assistant for national security; and N. Burns, U.S. presidential  special assistant for Eurasian affairs. Moreover, there were  meetings with Deputy Secretary of Defense E. Carter and Deputy  Secretary of Finance L. Summers.    There were also meetings with the presidents of  international  funds -- M. Camdessus of the IMF and Z. Brzezinski of the Soros  Foundation. The following must be taken into consideration. The  secretary of finance was quite frank: If financial assistance  continues to be pumped into accounts in foreign banks or sticks  to hands of dodgers, no further aid to Ukraine will be planned.  In his turn, Camdessus stated that he come to Ukraine to help  with our reforms without delay if a strong executive power is  launched along with a realistic program for overcoming economic  crisis.    [Pavlenko] Apart from assistance, can we see any U.S.  readiness to participate in Ukrainian economy on the basis of,  say, new investments?    [Kuchma] There were such proposals. Here is an example.  The president of the Onasisas [name as transliterated] Company,  owner E. Kulukundis, is ready to invest large sums in the  development of our freight fleet. However, a barrier in the way  toward the implementation of this project is the lack of  legislation guaranteeing investments and a clear system of  mutual obligations. The contact with Ukrainian immigrants was  also satisfying -- the immigrants believe that the relations  with Ukraine should be multilateral, in particular, on economic  basis as well.    [Pavlenko] Have you discussed the well-known missile  problems?    [Kuchma] This was the main topic of my conversation with  U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Carter. My opinion about this is  clear: Ukraine alone is not able to deal with the entire complex  of missile problems. Dismantling main parts is only the tip of  the iceberg. In order to carry out the entire project, even  according to modest estimates by U.S. experts, Ukraine needs no  less than $3 billion, whereas only a tenth of this sum was  allotted. Of course, Ukraine does not have such funds. Nor do  we have the technology for using liquid and solid rocket fuel.  I think that even U.S. assistance will not suffice here. We  will apparently be forced to involve the entire world community.  Otherwise, we will not avoid another large-scale environmental  disaster. It is necessary to apportion the allotted funds  taking into account not only the consultations by U.S. experts,  but also the needs of Ukrainian enterprises.    [Pavlenko] Prevailing opinion holds that there are no people  in Ukraine who are capable of working out and implementing an  effective program for leading the economy out of the total  collapse of production. Do you share this opinion?    [Kuchma] The extraordinary fourth congress of the USPP was  convened due to no more than the acute aggravation of the social  and economical situation in Ukraine. During the first quarter,  industrial production decreased by one-third, while in machine  building, light industry, and metallurgy -- by 40-45 percent.  Hundreds of enterprises were halted; over half of the total  number work for only two-three days a week. Construction,  transportation, and communication are in breaking down.  Marketability of the agricultural sector --its grain complex --  is under threat. Reduction of investments in all spheres of  production is fraught with tragic consequences. The same can be  said about the disintegration of science, education, medicine,  and culture. A general indicator of the total disintegration  can be seen in the crisis of payments and paralysis of financial  system. Exports are dwindling, hard currency incoming is  decreasing, whereas domestic and foreign debts of the state have  arisen to an astronomical sum.    The living standard of the majority is well below the  poverty  line, while the wage guaranteed by the state in the amount of  60,000 karbovanetses, equivalent to slightly over $1, is simply  cynical mockery. Logic dictates that the government, beginning  1 January, should have increased the minimum wage and pensions  by at least three or four times. At the same time, corruption,  embezzlement of public funds, violence, bribery, and robbery  have become mass plagues. Central and local state authorities  only pretend that they are fighting this common evil.    I am sure that the main reason for this tragedy is the  inability of current ruling structures to work out and implement  a realistic policy in social and economic sphere. Instead of  clear objectives and mechanisms for their achievement, we have  slogans about market economy, reforms, privatization, farming,  and destatization. In reality, robbing the country and  transferring its wealth abroad by various operators continues.  Official actions are not systematic or adequate to the needs of  today's situation in the economy and community in general.  Everywhere there are a flood of command administration methods  in management and a swelling management apparatus with a low  level of professionalism. Moreover, the central authorities are  trying to evade responsibility by loading it on the shoulders of  regions and producers.    Possibly, I am too harsh, but you know -- it boils not only  within me alone...    [Pavlenko] However, you did not mention ways out of the  crisis...    [Kuchma] During the last six months alone, the USPP, the  Ukrainian Union of Independent Entrepreneurs, and other  organizations, national as well as regional, which represent  various forms of ownership, repeatedly proposed to the president  and Cabinet of Ministers packets of measures regarding this  question. There were among others: changes in hard currency  regulations, taxation, and external economic relations as well  as the determination of the priority of these relations; issues  of utilizing working capital, repaying mutual indebtedness,  restoring ties with CIS countries on a qualitatively new basis;  revision of the scope of ministries and departments with the  purpose of broadening the prerogatives of enterprises;  introduction of state contracts; and many other measures.  However, there was only silence. And they do not even try to  take some measures by themselves...    [Pavlenko] By the way, how are your relations with the  present Cabinet of Ministers and its head?    [Kuchma] I will answer by citing a passage from the  resolution of the USPP sixth congress: "To declare that the  activities of the government and its Acting Prime Minister  Zvyahilskyy caused extremely negative consequences, deepened  chaos and economic ruin, and aggravated tension in the  community, what can bring unforeseen consequences..."    [Pavlenko] While prime minister, you made a threatening  statement that was addressed to those structures mired in  corruption.    [Kuchma] In my time as prime minister, the Cabinet of  Ministers prepared materials for 1,500 cases, which were later  submitted to the General Prosecutor's Office. However, they  have not been instigated. Just as it was with the Black Sea  Steamship Company managers -- our commission worked out and  prepared a document and submitted it to the former Supreme  Council, but the Steamship Company manager was a people's  deputy. And for what? The document got stuck somewhere in the  corridors of the former legislative power.    [Pavlenko] How do you see the present geopolitical and  internal situation of Ukraine from the perspective of the  cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]? What are  the tasks of the Bloc?    [Kuchma] The MBR unites pragmatic people that are apparently  distant from politics. Yet even they have understood that  unless a political course for Ukraine is formulated today, that  is, unless new and, above all, cardinal resolutions are adopted,  it will be impossible to implement any economic reforms or  programs. In essence, Ukraine's economy has become hostage to  politics. What we see is geopolitical bankruptcy with national  romanticism as the pivot of the entire political course. The  lack of pragmatism in the approaches to geopolitics, an  erroneous estimate of geopolitical scenarios, and a bolshevist  desire to raze everything and start anew, have led to a  situation in which Ukraine has become virtually an international  castaway.    In our internal policy, for all practical purposes, we have  anarchy; we see an incompatibility of interests of ruling  central bureaucracy and regions. The creation of an  equalitarian system for every region without taking into account  their characteristics and contribution to the national economy  objectively provokes the development of separatist tendencies  aimed at the disintegration of Ukraine.    I also think it inadmissible if the June elections fail or  be  rescheduled -- due to strategic reasons, first of all. World  practice shows that overcoming a crisis is possible only by  having a rigid and consolidated executive power headed by the  president who possesses the highest level of legitimacy. The  president should be a pragmatic man who is supported by the  majority and who is capable of opposing any influence from  various groups and lobbies.    [Pavlenko] Your presidential candidacy is supported by the  USPP. Do you think that your chances are higher than those of  your rivals?    [Kuchma] All rivals are worthy opponents; every one of them  is good in his own way. Therefore, I do not overestimate my own  chances.    [Pavlenko] Is it prudent to hold presidential elections  simultaneously with local ones?    [Kuchma] I am against the simultaneous elections. If this  happens, then we will elect absolutely independent presidents  for 48,000 settlements, 560 rayons, and 24 oblasts. Ukraine, as  a state, will cease to be. If hamlets become sovereign, then  how will the president govern the state? Unfortunately, it is  too late to change the situation -- the elections must be held.    [Pavlenko] As a journalist, I have been working in Kharkiv  Rayon for a long time. I can say that the people there treat  you ambiguously. You impressed the working collectives when you  were prime minister. However, managers' corps does not support  you fully. Here is one of the objections: You call for  friendship and cooperation with Russia, but you do not back it  with concrete steps. This is not a general opinion, but it  exists...    [Kuchma] Let my colleagues, the managers, strain their  memory and remember that it was in Kharkiv that I signed a  package of documents on customs cooperation at the meeting of  representatives of 10 oblasts on the borders of Russia and  Ukraine in June 1993. And who signed the declaration on the  creation of economic union? And who proposed to lease the Black  Sea Fleet and to pay the earned money for energy resources in  order to get a respite for structural rebuilding? I will say  also this. Today, Ukraine alone is not able to stabilize its  economy, regulate finances, and invigorate investments even  partially. I have said it many times and I repeat: Nobody can  survive on his own. Neither Russia nor Kazakhstan nor Belarus.  This has already been realized by the Balts, too. Only people  in Ukraine seem to be incapable of realizing this in any way. We  propose the creation of a mechanism of mutual assistance and  mutual support with all the CIS countries and, in the first  place, with Russia; we propose to attain common geopolitical and  economic interests with our joint efforts. I emphasize: This  step is expected by all the CIS countries.    Nikolay Ogarev, Hertsen's friend, said once: "What We Need  is Self-Assurance and Vigor, While Despair Leads to Idleness."  These are the very qualities -- self-assurance and vigor --  which we need so badly now! Away with despair!    [Pavlenko] Would you say a few words about yourself? Your  biography is not widely known, because until recently you have  not belonged to the people who were much discussed.    [Kuchma] I was born in the village Chaykyno,  Novgorod-Siverskiy Rayon, Chernigov Oblast in 1928. I am  Ukrainian. My father died defending Leningrad, my mother worked  on a collective farm all her life and died several years ago.  My elder brother was a drift miner who died at the age of 56 of  silicosis, a professional disease. My sister who also worked in  a mine, died at the age of 48.    I conclude my report on the meeting with Leonid Kuchma, a  candidate for the high post of Ukrainian presidency, with a few  brief notes from my notebook. After graduation from  Dnipropetrovsk University, Kuchma worked for 32 years at the  world's largest rocket complex (the Pivdenne design office and  the Pivdennyy Mashzavod production amalgamation), moving through  all the production stages -- from a designer to the general  director of the Pivdenmash production company. By the way, in  the spring of 1966, at the age of 28, he became the youngest  technical supervisor of tests at the Baykonyr launching site in  the whole history of rocket production of the former USSR. His  was lucky -- he worked with such legendary creators of space  technology as Yangel, Glushko, Utkin, Pilyugin, and Sergeyev.  Kuchma is a Lenin prize winner for the creation of space  technology.    He is married. His wife, Lyudmila Mykolayivna, an engineer,  retired after 30 years of work at the Pivdenne design office.  His daughter Olena, an economist, is 24 years old. His  grandson, Roman, is three years old. His daughter and  son-in-law live and work in Simferopol. Kuchma is very fond of  ballads and likes to sing accompanying himself on the guitar.    These are only general features. A full portrait will be  painted by the election campaign, by life itself.</p>

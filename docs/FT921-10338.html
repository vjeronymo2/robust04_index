			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Figurehead at the mercy of the press - The uncertain implications of Paddy Ashdown's public confession THE tabloid press claimed a triumph; Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock offered public sympathy; backbench MPs sniggered behind their hands; and the electoral implications remained uncertain. Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission yesterday of a relationship with his former secretary in 1987 was a severe personal blow. The Liberal Democrat leader is preparing to fight the first general election since 1979 in which the third party can justly claim a real prospect of winning the balance of power. He cannot afford bad publicity. Colleagues rallied round. But the day was a painful reminder of the risk that the Liberal Democrats have taken in building its new political identity around a single individual. It is no accident that newspapers so often refer to 'Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats'. So if his colleagues had judged that Mr Ashdown should consider resignation - and there was no indication of any such feeling - the party would have been left without a credible successor. The circumstances in which news broke - involving the theft of documents from the office of his solicitors and an attempt to sell them to a Sunday newspaper - will fuel the speculation that the approaching election will be the among 'dirtiest' Britain has seen. The Liberal Democrats carefully avoided any claim of a conspiracy by Mr Ashdown's political opponents. His solicitor called it a million-to-one possibility. But, in the wake of the spate of break-ins at the Westminster and constituency offices of all parties and a war of words over smear tactics, the House of Commons was again buzzing with talk of 'dirty tricks' and similar revelations to come. It was harder to get a coherent judgment of the extent to which the affair will influence the outcome of the election. The general assumption among MPs was that it would cost Mr Ashdown some votes - in particular from women and from the religious non-conformists who have long represented an important strand in Liberal support. Beyond that, there was no clear consensus. One senior minister predicted that the damage might be more extensive. The image of decent, honest politics that the Liberal Democrats had so carefully projected before the election had been tarnished. That, he said, might cost them 3 percentage points on election day. Another minister was far less certain. 'It depends on how you boys (the press) play it . . . It could be a one-day wonder.' Then there was always the possibility, he added, that the 'prurience' of the tabloids would generate a backlash in favour of Mr Ashdown. Psephologists agreed that if support for Mr Ashdown were to fall sharply, Labour would benefit in the key Conservative-held marginals on which the election outcome will depend. Mr Ashdown's hope is that now he has admitted to the relationship, the newspapers that have been pursuing the story with such determination this week will tire of it equally quickly. The judgment at Westminster was that he had made the right decision. The contents of the document stolen two weeks ago from his solicitor have been common knowledge among journalists and MPs since the weekend. An injunction against publication of details of the relationship - which lasted five months, ending before Mr Ashdown became party leader - offered little prospect of killing the story. The tabloid newspapers scented a non-existent parallel with the scandal that has engulfed Mr Bill Clinton, a Democrat contender for the US presidency. The combination of sex and politics was irresistible. So they determined to test Mr Ashdown's nerve. The Scotsman, unaffected by the legal constraints operating in England, disclosed the existance of the injunctions. The Daily Mirror told its readers in an opaque front-page editorial that it was possessed of important information that it could not publish. Mr Ashdown realised that the dam was about to burst. Behind the media zeal lay a curious circular logic. A five-year old extramarital relationship was important because it might affect the election. But, of course, it could only become an issue in the election if the newspapers covered it. The unanswered question is whether yesterday's story will be the first or the last before the election. Anyone who has spent more than hour in the bars of Westminster has heard of at least half a dozen other potential scandals. As one MP put it last night: 'Who next'? Mr Ashdown's statement said: 'The document reported to have been stolen from the safe of my solicitors, Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, and subsequently offered by the thief for sale to newspapers, refers to me. 'It contains information supplied in confidence to my solicitors about a brief relationship which I had five years ago, before the 1987 general election, and well before I became leader of my party. 'When the theft was discovered I was advised and believed that I had every right to defend my privacy. 'I was further advised that because its circulation arose from a criminal act, the document would be protected by the full force of the law. In those circumstances, my solicitors obtained an injunction preventing its publication. 'However, it is now clear to me that in this pre-election atmosphere, I, my family, my friends and party colleagues, will not be left alone. I have therefore decided to make this personal statement.'</p>

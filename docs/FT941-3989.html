			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / US crosses swords with China over human rights Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has told Chinese officials that time is running out for China to improve its human rights behaviour or risk losing its preferential trade status in the US. His warning came in a weekend of bruising exchanges over human rights. The wrangle threatens a trading relationship worth more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26.7bn) last year, heavily in China's favour. Chinese leaders dropped diplomatic niceties to tell Mr Christopher to mind his own business on human rights. Premier Li Peng said it was 'futile' to apply pressure over human rights. 'China will never accept the US human rights concept,' he declared. Mr Christopher's mission was in danger of unravelling after sometimes acrimonious encounters with both Mr Li and Mr Qian Qichen, foreign minister. 'I emphasised to China that time is of the essence. . . as we move into the next critical two months before I have to make my recommendation to President Clinton' on the renewal of Most Favoured Nation trading status, Mr Christopher told reporters. Mr Li warned Mr Christopher that the US 'will lose its share of the big Chinese market' if it withdraws China's trading privileges. The arrest of prominent dissidents before Mr Christopher arrived in Beijing cast a pall over his mission. Detention at the weekend of several foreign journalists - who were trying to contact dissidents - further clouded the atmosphere. The US wants the release of jailed dissidents, human rights improvements in Tibet, permission for the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Chinese prisons, and a less rigid attitude to emigration. China appeared ready late last year to respond to US concerns, but fears of civil unrest over rising prices and signs that dissidents were becoming more active appear to have prompted a fresh crackdown. The US business community in Beijing, meanwhile, was openly critical of Washington's approach to China at an American Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting yesterday. 'Choices facing our government are historic - either we engage China as a partner in managing regional security, economic growth and economic stability or we become adversaries,' said the representative in Beijing of AT&amp;T, the telecoms group.</p>

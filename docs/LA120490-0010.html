			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEM: SCARE THE IRAQIS, YOU TERRORIZE THE HOME FOLKS  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein must be confused by the contradictory messages coming from the  United States. The lead story is the historic U.N. Security Council vote  authorizing the use of military force if he does not back down before Jan. 15.  The next news item: Experts testifying before the Senate recommend delaying the  military option for at least another six months to a year. And now, President  Bush says he's willing to talk -- but not to compromise.  </P> <P> Is the U.S. threat to use force credible or not? If Hussein considers the  remarkable U.N. success engineered by President Bush and Secretary of State  James A. Baker III, he cannot but be impressed that the military option is  real. When he watches the hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he  has good reason to doubt that the President has the domestic support needed to  use force.  </P> <P> Bush's gulf policy is trapped in an almost irreconcilable dilemma. For a threat  to work it must be credible. That means that the country being threatened must  be both afraid of what you are going to do and believe that you will actually  do it. Credible threats are scary threats, by definition.  </P> <P> The problem is that scary threats terrify people at home even as they frighten  the enemy. In a democracy, frightened people quickly get attention. Domestic  voices, in this case powerful Democrats in Congress, begin to question the  wisdom of making such a scary threat. Concerned citizens launch protests,  causing public support to drop. Declining public support erodes the credibility  of the threat, making it less effective abroad.  </P> <P> There is one way out of this dilemma: Change public opinion and make the public  more afraid of the enemy than of the threat. This is precisely what the  Administration has been trying to do lately, with its emphasis on Hussein's  quest for nuclear weapons and brutal Iraqi war crimes. But unless Hussein helps  out, doing something provocative and foolish like killing a few hostages or  initiating a military strike on his own, the President will find it tough  going. His own experts dispute the likelihood of an early Iraqi nuclear  capability and public opinion polls indicate that Americans have no stomach for  being global police; sadly, killing Western hostages might be enough to justify  the use of force, but killing Kuwaitis is not.  </P> <P> Bush's proposal for a meeting between Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik  Aziz shows he is capable of a fascinating gamble on the international stage.  But should that fail, it will be ultimately more telling to watch the President  play to his toughest audience: the American people.  </P></p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (4): Area of conflict - Arabs seek economic powers IF NEGOTIATORS at the Middle East peace talks in Washington are to succeed, they will have to include the resolution of an economic conflict which is not much less fraught than the political one. Along with the other levers of power, Israel's military administration in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has, since the occupation began in June 1967, exercised what Mr Hisham Awartani, a prominent Palestinian economist, has described as 'the complete usurpation of control on all facets of economic life in both territories'. It is true that the early years of the occupation saw a dramatic rise in per capita income and living standards in both the West Bank and Gaza. These two former backwaters of the Jordanian and Egyptian economies had suddenly been exposed to a developed Israel. Mainly due to the availability of work in Israel which West Bankers and Gazans had previously not had access to, the two areas grew in prosperity. However, tight Israeli restrictions on indigenous economic development within the territories, for reasons ranging from security policy to suppression of potential competition for Israeli producers, have left them economically fragile. In recent years, this has been exacerbated by the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, against Israeli rule which erupted in late 1987, and subsequently the 1990-91 crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The protest strikes and disruptions of the intifada have damaged many Palestinian businesses; the Gulf crisis hit exports and cut remittances. The West Bank and Gaza have a combined population of some 2m people, compared with Israel's 5m. But the territories' combined GNP is estimated at around only Dollars 2bn compared with more than Dollars 50 bn for Israel. Some 40 per cent of Palestinian GNP is accounted for by employment in Israel, mainly in the construction sector. Services, including tourism, construction and agriculture, make up the bulk of domestic production in the West Bank and Gaza. According to figures compiled in a recent report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, industry comprises only 7.7 per cent of GDP in the West Bank and 13.7 per cent in Gaza. The mainstays are clothing, shoes, pharmaceuticals, furniture and other light industries. Many businesses subcontract on behalf of Israeli companies: only 30 companies are thought to employ more than 50 people. Palestinians complain that the military administration has consistently blocked the issue of manufacturing licences; barred the export of agricultural products to Israel; limited exports to third countries; expropriated and limited land use. Two other sources of complaint are the military's punitive tax collection and restrictive water allocations. The American Academy report says 83 per cent of West Bank ground water is used by Israel or Israeli settlers. In the peace negotiations, the Palestinians are seeking to win control over these tools of economic management. While water and land are especially sensitive, Israel has signalled its willingness to help in the economic development of the territories. It sees benefits for both sides in the growth of the Palestinian economy and wants to reduce its dependence on cheap Arab labour. Aid from the EC and the US to the West Bank and Gaza amounts to more than Dollars 25m a year and much more is anticipated if there is a political settlement. However, there are no significant banking or credit institutions in the West Bank and Gaza to provide a flow of investment capital. Access to Israeli and Jordanian markets and ports would also be vital.</p>

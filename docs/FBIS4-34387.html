			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today" Newscast] </F>   [Text] The abstention rate dropped by 55 percent and voter  turnout increased by more than 1 million compared to the first  round of elections on 29 May.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Abstention was  defeated very early in Santa Fe de Bogota, especially at the  largest polling station, Corferias [exhibition center], where  thousands of people lined up at the 226 voting tables there. A  high percentage of young people decided to break their silence  and vote in this round. However, many voters were turned away  because they were not registered on the electoral lists. The  voting took place in an atmosphere of relative normalcy without  the presence of entertainers [animadores] -- as was permitted in  the elections four years ago -- in keeping with the new  electoral laws banning partying.    In the presence of authorities, electoral information tables  were set up outside Corferias with propaganda of the Liberal  candidate, while the public force closely watched the voting  inside the Santa Fe de Bogota exhibition center.    There were no incidents, and the abstention that marked the  29 May elections suffered a relative defeat today. [end  recording]</p>

"Our experiences show that it is not the question of joint  military exercises or the presence of foreign troops on our  territory but genuine cooperation in the interest of peace,  security, democracy, and economic prosperity which should be  embedded in these treaties," the letter says. To fulfill these  goals "collective consultative mechanisms of all countries  concerned" should be strengthened.    Employees of the U.S. Embassy in Prague told CTK they could  not confirm whether the letter was received by the embassy since  "there were many letters addressed to the President." However,  they said that Clinton would certainly get all the  correspondence addressed to him.    KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek writes in the letter that  communists recall with pleasure Clinton's first informal visit  in Prague in 1970 where he stayed in his friend's house "with  the family of hero of anti-fascist resistance and renowned  left-oriented politician Jan Sverma."    From the position of one of the strongest Czech opposition  parties the communists express their stand on Clinton's  forthcoming talks in Prague and stress that the interests of the  Czech Republic' security, sovereignty, national identity, and  economic prosperity are their prime concern.    However, unlike official representatives, the communists do  not believe that membership of NATO is the road to implementing  these goals. "We have very bad experiences with the Europe of  Cold War and military pacts" the letter stresses.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sharpe &amp; Fisher static at Pounds 658,000 SHARPE &amp; Fisher, the Gloucester-based building supplies and property company, reported pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 little changed at Pounds 658,000, against Pounds 647,000 restated for FRS 3. However the comparable figure was boosted by Pounds 245,000 from the sale of properties and a Pounds 72,000 credit from discontinued activities. Operating profits this time were ahead at Pounds 937,000 (Pounds 723,000) helped by an improved performance from building supplies. The interest charge fell to Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 393,000) as a result of lower interest rates and earlier collection of amounts due from customers. Gearing at the period end was 38 per cent. Earnings per share were 2.1p (2.4p). The interim dividend is being held at 1.5p.</p>

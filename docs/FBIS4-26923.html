			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Political Editor Danny Gittings and Queenie Wang] </F>   [Text] Chris Patten, preparing for the most important week  of his governorship, has been told by Hong Kong people that he  has no useful role to play in the territory's affairs once  Wednesday's crucial vote on his political reforms is over.  While an apathetic public is prepared to let Legislative  Councillors decide the future course of the territory's  constitution, an exclusive SUNDAY MORNING POST poll also reveals  a majority believe Mr Patten's job here is now done... whatever  the outcome of the vote.    Government House last night rejected the poll's findings,  with spokesman Mike Hanson saying: "The Governor has a very  full agenda in the final three years and Mr Patten will be  staying here to see it through." But it is bound to be a blow  to Mr Patten, who today launches a last-minute campaign to swing  wavering legislators round to his political blueprint.    The SUNDAY MORNING POST telephone survey of 1,013 people  reveals 52 per cent of those polled believe Mr Patten no longer  has a useful role to play here. Thirty-two per cent disagree  and the remaining 16 per cent are unsure. It also reveals that  most people believe China will dismantle whatever electoral  model legislators endorse this week, with a small majority  saying Beijing is justified in doing so. But the overwhelming  impression is of a lack of interest in the final chapter to the  two-year-long political reform saga. Few people have any  preference for Mr Patten's bill, or the amendments legislators  have suggested.    Writing in today's Sunday Morning Post, Mr Patten attacks in  particular the Liberal Party's "1994 package" -- the only rival  electoral model considered to have any chance of success. He  accuses the party of putting forward proposals "which, to put it  gently, remove some of the uncertainty from the outcome of the  democratic process". "There are serious doubts about the  fairness of the arrangements proposed by the Liberal Party," he  warns.    The poll, conducted by Hong Kong Polling and Business  Research [PBR] last Wednesday and Thursday, found only 15 per  cent of those surveyed were interested in the outcome of this  week's debate, while 69 per cent were not, with 16 per cent  unsure. The Governor admits, in today's article, that he  "detects a weariness" among the public on the refortms issue.  Most admit the debate matters for Hong Kong's future: 55 per  cent of respondents said it did, while 14 per cent disagreed,  with 31 per cent unsure. But few seem to care which political  model is voted through. Only 14 per cent want to see the  Governor's proposals adopted, while 13 per cent support the  Liberal Party's "1994 package", proposing smaller functional  constituencies and a four-sector election committee, similar to  that contained in the Basic Law. Fifteen per cent backed  independent legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing's bill for a fully  directly elected Legislative Council, while one per cent  supported other models. However they were far outnumbered by  the 56 per cent who had no preference.    An overwhelming 68 per cent are convinced China will carry  out its threat to dismantle the council in 1997, while only 17  per cent disagree, with 15 per cent unsure. More worryingly for  the Governor, 36 per cent believed China would be justified in  doing so, while 35 per cent disagreed, with 29 per cent unsure.    Mr Patten's personal popularity also remained low: with an  average score of 5.6 -- measured on a scale from one to 10 --  lower than that recorded in previous polls. "This shows the  Governor's popularity has yet to bottom out," said PBR managing  director Citi Hung Ching-tin, who conducted the survey, which  had a 54 per cent response rate.    The Liberal Party last night hit back at the Governor's  attack, saying Mr Patten should leave the decision in the hands  of Hong Kong people, rather than entering the political fray.  "Six million people will still be here after Mr Patten has  left." said party spokesman Howard Young, who will propose the  "1994 package" in the council on Wednesday. "I think he  specifically attacked us because our amendment has a better  chance of passing than any other. But he should not be taking  sides. He should remain neutral. "We are seeking to protect  the stability of Hong Kong. We do not want a complete change in  the system in 1995 or 1997," Mr Young added.    In other poll findings, eighty-three per cent said Hong Kong  needed a human rights commission while 10 per cent objected to  its creation, with seven per cent unsure. Sixty-nine per cent  said the Government should lift its ban on formal contacts  between civil servants and members of the Beijing-appointed  Preliminary Working Committee. Only seven per cent wanted to  continue the prohibition, while 24 per cent expressed no  opinion. Fifty-six per cent said they would vote in September's  District Board polls.</p>

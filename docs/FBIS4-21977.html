			<p>BFN     [Text] The security forces this morning arrested about 50  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists  from Gaza city, Rafah, and the Jabalyah refugee camp. The  arrests follow an earlier sweep over the weekend, when more than  50 Hamas activists were also arrested.    [A report by military correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda on Tel  Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 19 April adds: "It  appears that 10 of those arrested are former deportees who  returned to the Gaza Strip from southern Lebanon a few months  ago. Tension in the Strip is high since the arrests were  carried out. Arab sources warned today that retaliatory terror  attacks by Hamas are to be expected in the wake of the arrests  which, according to them, seriously harmed the organization."]    Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Hamas deportees who  returned  from south Lebanon and acts as a spokesman for Hamas in the  Strip, denied the people arrested were senior activists.  Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss, al-Zahhar also puts the number  of those arrested at up to 200: [begin recording]    Al-Zahhar: The number, up to last night, ranged  from 150 up to 200, and the people who were arrested are not  activists. They were previously under detention or sentences.  I think there is no reason for any arrest for any of them  because they are well known as Islamic people. They have no  participation in the process carried on in the area.    Weiss: Do you think this is an Israeli crackdown  following the 'Afula and Hadera bombings?    Al-Zahhar: Do you think the people who were  arrested in the Gaza Strip are involved in what happened in  'Afula and Hadera?    Weiss: An interview was published in Jordan this  morning from Musa Abu-Marzuq, the head of the Hamas politburo,  and he said that Hamas may be willing to make peace with Israel  if Israel pulls out of the occupied territories and dismantles  the settlements. Do you see this as a change in Hamas policy?    Al-Zahhar: I actually until now did not read the  statements thoroughly, and after its discussion, I think after  that I will be ready to give my personal idea.    Weiss: Would you support peace with Israel if  they withdrew from the territories and pulled out of the  settlements?    Al-Zahhar: This actually should be thoroughly  studied, because about what we are going to negotiate? What  will be the relation of the occupied territories, and what will  be the contradiction between this implementation of policy with  the Cairo and Oslo agreements? So, what type of peace Israel  are going to give? If they are ready to give a genuine peace, a  permanent peace, a justice peace, I think nobody will refuse.  [end recording]</p>

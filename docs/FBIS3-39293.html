The meeting lasted one and  a half hours and came about as the result of an IKL initiative.    IKL is one of the two organizations that Russia demanded  information about in a note prior to the first round of the  presidential election. At the meeting the IKL leaders raised  the subject of the note and the border question. The IKL wants  to return to Finland the borders fixed in the Peace of Tartu  [1920].    The IKL leadership was satisfied with the discussion and  described relations between the embassy and the IKL as  businesslike. According to representatives of the organization,  the meeting did not give the impression that Deryabin considers  the IKL to be illegal or that the organization is in any way  contrary to the Paris peace agreement.    The IKL gave Deryabin a clock made of wood, with an image of  Finland with borders from the Peace of Tartu. The IKL  leadership gave assurances that the organization does not  represent a threat to Russia, nor does it intend to harm  relations between Finland and Russia.</p>

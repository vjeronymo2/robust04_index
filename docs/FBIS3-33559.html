			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX)  -- As one of its main proposals for achieving reconciliation in  the region, the self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army  (EZLN) today called for the establishment of a cogovernment with  the Indians in southeastern Chiapas state. During a news  conference with radio reporters before the start of today's  talks, EZLN Subcommander Marcos explained that Indian groups had  to participate in this cogovernment to find adequate solutions  to their problems.    Marcos also proposed the creation of a dialogue verification  commission made up of civilians. Commission members would be  appointed by the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho  Solis. This commission would prevent solutions agreed upon at  the talks from becoming empty promises and, in turn, avert the  risk of another armed conflict.    On 1 January, armed groups from the EZLN seized several  Chiapas communities by force, attacked a garrison, and prompted  the intervention of the Mexican Army. These actions resulted in  nearly 100 deaths, numerous injuries, and the displacement of  about 20,000 people.    "We are aware of the difficulties in meeting our national  demands, such as the reform of Article 27 of the Constitution  (on land tenure)," Marcos stated, admitting that such issues "go  beyond the work agenda agreed upon by both sides."    The EZLN military chief, who was interviewed in San  Cristobal  de las Casas, 1,200 km to the southeast of Mexico City, admitted  that it is not possible to force peace in Chiapas "to get the  country to do what we want." [sentence as received]    According to Marcos, the EZLN is not looking for power.  Instead, it only wants peace with justice. He also added: We  do not want to form a political party, so that later someone can  say that we sold out. "However, we ask for the reform of the  Federal Electoral Law in order that the upcoming elections  (scheduled for 21 August) are observed and supported," he said.    The Zapatist spokesman welcomed the role of Manuel Camacho  Solis, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  who has heard the Indian requests with an open mind conducive to  finding solutions. Subcommander Marcos said two things can  happen in this dialogue: The negotiations can further peace, or  they can break down and engender another war.    When asked whether he believed he was personally upstaging  others involved in the peace process, Marcos explained, "The  movement has utilized me because I am the only one who speaks  Spanish. However, the proposals were ordered by the EZLN  leaders. I simply have a military assignment."</p>

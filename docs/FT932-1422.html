			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nippon Steel buys into NSW mine NIPPON Steel is to take a 10 per cent stake in the Bulga mine, a New South Wales coal operation within the Oakbridge coal mining group, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. Oakbridge said Nippon Steel would bring 'obvious financial strengths' to the venture and is expected to commit to 'significant coal purchases' from the Saxonvale-Bulga mine in the Hunter Valley region. The Australian company said it was holding negotiations with the hope of securing a third equity partner for the Bulga venture. Oakbridge said it is proceeding with an expansion plan at the Saxonvale-Bulga mine aimed at doubling annual coal production to 6m tonnes a year by 1996. Oakbridge is 40 per cent-owned by McIlwraith McEarcharn. Cyprus Minerals of the US took control of McIlwraith earlier this year in a takeover bid which valued McIlwraith at ADollars 82m (USDollars 56m). The price Nippon Steel is paying for its Bulga stake was not disclosed.</p>

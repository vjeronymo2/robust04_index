			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Chinese Issue"] </F>   [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui is making use of  the Chinese New Year break to tour Indonesia and Thailand.  Although the trip is announced as private, the PRC is certain  to react unfavorably because Beijing will try to impose its "One  China" policy on the countries with which it maintains relations.    Indonesia does not appear to pay much attention to China, as  evidenced by the reception accorded by President Suharto to the  Taiwanese president. By contrast, the Thai Government will not  have any official part in the Taiwanese president's visit.    On behalf of the Thai Government, Foreign Minister Squadron  Leader Prasong Sunsiri stated that Thailand firmly maintained  the "One China" policy and that the government had nothing to do  with the Taiwanese president's visit. He said Li's visit  concerned trade and investment matters and did not involve  international political activities. [passage omitted]    Thailand has been a good friend of China. It has graciously  implemented correct policies regarding China and Taiwan.  However, taking into account the national interests, there is  no reason for Thailand to neglect economic relations which could  grow as result of the Taiwanese president's private visit. This  is the way every country in the world operates.    We are confident that the Thai foreign ministry will be able  to explain and gain China's understanding. We also are  confident that China will be broadminded enough to accept the  undeniable reality.</p>

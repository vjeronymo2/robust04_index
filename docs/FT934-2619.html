			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Battle royal looms on health care To anybody unfamiliar with Washington ways, it must seem baffling. In September, the Clintons finally launched their long-awaited healthcare plan. They were treated to standing ovations on Capitol Hill and rave reviews in the press. And then? An embarrassed silence. As analysts waded through the 1,400 pages of text, doubts began to multiply. So did alternative proposals. To Mr Clinton's chagrin, many moderate Democrats (including the reformist Democratic Leadership Council) are backing a rival plan tabled by Mr Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee. Republicans, meanwhile, have put forward at least three different 'market-oriented' proposals, based on the prescriptions of competing conservative think tanks. Some of the deepest misgivings concern the role of the proposed 'health alliances' or regional purchasing co-operatives. The idea is that everybody living in a certain area (except employees of very large companies) would have to buy healthcare through one of these intermediaries. The alliance would collect premiums from companies and individuals and use its market clout to strike advantageous deals with competing private sector 'health plans.' If the alliances simply listed available health plans and acted as a clearing house for premiums, they might not be feared. But under the Clinton plan, these public or quasi public bodies would be local regulators of healthcare. They would be able to ban health plans regarded as too costly, set fee schedules for doctors and impose caps on the growth of insurance premiums. To many Americans, this seems suspiciously like socialised medicine by stealth. Take the Washington DC area. Affluent K Street lawyers would not be amused to find themselves in the same health alliance as welfare mothers, especially as such an alliance would be a monopoly with vastly greater financial muscle than local doctors or hospitals. Whatever the Clintons say, people fear the alliances would give local bureaucrats too much power. Controversy is also raging over the proposed 'employer mandate' - the requirement that employers pay at least 80 per cent of the cost of a standard package of benefits for employees. The Cooper plan and the Republican alternatives are united in opposing such mandates. The White House wants to make employers pay because most of the big increase in health spending would then be 'off-budget'. Yet nobody is fooled: the mandate is a tax by another name and would tend to price workers out of jobs. When the principal goal of Clinton's economic strategy is to create jobs, it seems foolish to increase taxes on employers. A Heath-Robinson system of subsidies would lessen the burden on small companies, but only at the expense of seriously distorting labour markets. Then there is the question of cost. The US already spends 14 per cent of gross domestic product on healthcare, against an average of 7.9 per cent in other industrial countries. Given his rhetoric about the economic strains imposed by galloping healthcare costs, you might have thought Mr Clinton would be trying to reduce spending as a share of GDP or at the very least prevent any further rise. By no means. The White House envisages the share of healthcare rising to a mind-boggling 17.5 per cent of GDP. The much-trumpeted 'savings' are produced by an old Washington trick: comparing the reforms to 'baseline' projections showing spending soaring to nearly 19 per cent of GDP. Providing health cover for the 37m without insurance will be costly. But Mr Clinton did not have to aggravate matters by promising everybody a package of benefits at least equivalent to those offered by Fortune 500 companies. Nor did he have to propose new benefits, for example for mental health and long- term care, that go beyond anything offered in the private sector. The Clintons deserve credit for bringing healthcare to the centre of the political stage. Few legislators doubt that reforms will be enacted next year. But the Clinton plan is increasingly seen as a starting point for detailed debate rather than a blueprint to be rigidly followed. Given the concern about costs, congressional leaders are likely to insist on a less generous package of minimum benefits. If health alliances survive, they will probably assume a less threatening form. Legislators, for example, could insist on a choice of at least two alliances in each area. They could allow smaller companies to opt out of alliances, say those with more than 200 employees rather than 5,000 as specified in the Clinton plan. And they could limit the power of alliances to regulate premiums or exclude health plans. Such amendments would create a purer form of managed competition. As for the employer mandate, many Republicans are urging Mr Clinton to place the obligation to buy insurance where it belongs - on individuals. But while smoothly articulating the logic of an individual mandate, few are willing to countenance the level of personal subsidies (and hence new taxes) needed to make such a law credible. Mr Cooper, supported by libertarians, rejects any kind of mandate, arguing the goal should be universal access to care, not universal coverage. The Clintons, however, adamantly oppose such backsliding; their bottom line is 'healthcare that can never be taken away'. Forget skirmishes like Nafta and the budget: next year Bill and Hillary will be fighting the battle of their lives.</p>

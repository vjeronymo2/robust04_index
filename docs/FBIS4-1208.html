			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R. Banda] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP]  leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the accord on Afrikaner  self-determination signed earlier on Saturday [23 April]  furthers only the interests of the ANC and SA Communist Party  [SACP]. The accord was signed by negotiators of the Freedom  Front, the government and the African National Congress.    Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement ANC leader Nelson Mandela  had already made it clear that he was not interested in the  creation of a volkstaat [homeland]. "It is very clear that the  ANC and the SACP will win the elction, and this will place them  in a stronger position, since they have given no real  undertakings in regard to a volkstaat in terms of the definition  as set out by the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National  Front] and the CP," he said.    "In these circumstances, even this accord offers no  possibility of the Boere Afrikanervolk [Boer Afrikaner people]  to obtain their full self-determination and independence."    Dr Hartzenberg said the "accord, taking part in the election  and being part of the new Parliament will not enable the freedom  front to achieve the freedom of the Afrikanervolk".</p>

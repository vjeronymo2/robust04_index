			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava March 9 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac sharply criticised Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar in  parliament on Wednesday [9 March], accusing Meciar of an attempt  to dismiss him. Kovac appeared in parliament today with a  report on the state of the Slovak Republic.    "I had and still have nothing against the (ruling Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia of which Meciar is chairman) HZDS and  the government, but I have serious reservations about the way  Mr. Meciar governs the country and the practices which create an  atmosphere of confrontation in political life," Kovac said. He  stated that at HZDS meetings he was regularly accused of  "banding together" with the opposition and Hungarians, and of  "being bribed" by foreign countries.    The end of Kovac's address seemed to be a defence of his  performance as president and an extraordinarily strong criticism  of the premier's methods of ruling. However, Kovac did not call  on the parliament, in which the government has lost its  majority, to dismiss the premier, nor did he urge the premier  himself to resign. He said that an end should be put to  denouncing people, and called for political, national and civic  conciliation.    The premier was not present in parliament when Kovac was  speaking.    Kovac assured deputies he would never commit treason "even  if  he had to drain the cup of bitterness to the dregs."    Observers believe the president's speech could influence  talks between Meciar's HZDS and the Democratic Left Party (SDL),  the strongest opposition party, on the government's stability,  the term of early elections, if they take place, and the  possibility of expanding the government coalition (now formed by  the HZDS and the Slovak National Party -- SNS).</p>

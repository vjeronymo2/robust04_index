[Begin recording] [Kamal Serveroglu] The president opened  the  meeting by saying that Azerbaijan belongs to all Azerbaijanis,  regardless of where they live. He then welcomed the members of  the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey Muhamed Cemberli,  Ahmet Karaca, and Mehmet (Mustek). He stressed the importance  of the work being done by the Society. [Words indistinct]  Geydar Aliyev also noted that the relations between Azerbaijan  and Turkey are friendly and fraternal by the will of the two  peoples. The Azerbaijani president expressed the conviction  that his upcoming visit to Turkey will open a new phase in  relations between these two countries.    In expressing full agreement with the president's views, the  members of the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey said that  they appreciate Geydar Aliyev's decision to mark the 100th  birthday anniversary of Mamet Emin Rasulzade, the founder of the  Azerbaijani Democratic Republic, at the state level. [passage  omitted]    In giving an in-depth briefing to the guests on the  political  and economic processes in the Republic, President Aliyev  particularly dwelled on the harm inflicted by the bloody war  being waged against the Armenian aggressors. He explained  Azerbaijan's position to achieve peace.    [Geydar Aliyev] We are waging a war against Armenia. The war  was not started by us. It was Armenia that started the war  against Azerbaijan. We have not occupied even an inch of  Armenia's land. But, Armenia has occupied Azerbaijan's lands.  Therefore, our war is a just war. We are defending ourselves.  We want to liberate our lands. We want to liberate them  peacefully, that is, through talks. I have repeatedly said that  we want to achieve this peacefully on the sole condition that  the Armenian troops leave all the Azerbaijani lands. Once the  Armenian troops leave, we could hold other talks.    [Serveroglu] The guests said they share President Geydar  Aliyev's views and added that the Azerbaijani Cultural Society  in Turkey is taking steps in this direction.    Other issues were also discussed at the end of the meeting.    Vafa Gulizade, state adviser on international affairs, took  part in the meeting. [end recording]</p>

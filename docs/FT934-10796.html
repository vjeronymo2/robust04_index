			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (6): Foreign policy stance seems vindicated - The important role being played by King Hassan MOROCCAN foreign policy for the past three decades has not just been consistent, but also consistently right, according to officials in Rabat. The recent breakthrough in relations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel is, for them, just the latest vindication of a Moroccan stance taken and maintained whatever the external or domestic pressures. Support for the western coalition against Iraq culminating in the Gulf war is cited as the best example of King Hassan flying in the face of domestic opinion, while the takeover of the Western Sahara from Spain in 1975 is seen as a lesson in how to defy international pressure. For King Hassan there has been no historical contra- diction in sending Moroccan troops to fight against Israel while also protecting his own Jewish population and arguing for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israel conflict. Meetings between Egyptians and Israelis in Morocco helped to prepare for President Anwar Sadat's critical visit to Jerusalem in January 1977, and few obstacles have been put in the way of Israelis of Moroccan descent who wish to return to their former homeland for holidays. But, at the same time, officials in Rabat stress that Morocco stands four-square behind the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve self-determination, is proud to be the chairman of the al-Qods (Jerusalem) committee of the Islamic Conference Organis- ation, and is a fully committed member of the League of Arab States. The visit by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to Rabat in September on his way home from his historic handshake in Washington with Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, was an ack- nowledgment of King Hassan's peace-making role. But it went no further than that. Israel's hopes for a visit by King Hassan to Jerusalem and the establishment of diplomatic relations were not realised, and are unlikely to be until there is substantially greater progress in the peace process. 'Peace is not just a piece of paper. It is not just a matter of politics. Peace is about changing people's minds, about changing the way they look at issues. This is what we have been trying to do, and we shall keep on trying,' says an official, who looks forward to early progress in Israel's talks with Syria in order to demonstrate that the peace process has become irrev- ersible. Less publicly, but with even greater private satisfaction, there is a growing sense in official circles that Morocco's 15-year military and dip- lomatic struggle to confirm its occupation of the Western Sahara is, however grud- gingly, winning international acceptance. Algeria's mounting domestic problems, the weakening of the nationalist Polisario Front, the preoccupation of the UN with other more pressing issues, and the US concern at the spread of Islamic radicalism, are combining to present a solution that will be acceptable to Morocco. The key lies in who would be eligible to vote in a referendum on the territory's future: just the 74,000 people included in the 1974 Spanish census, as favoured by Polisario, or the additional 120,000 said by Morocco to be of Saharan parentage or origin. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, said during a visit to the region in June that he was pressing both sides to come to an agreement. Whatever the outcome of any compromise, or a decision to go ahead without Polisario agreement, the Moroccans will accept only a formula which they are confident would produce a satisfactory result. The risk, of course, is that a frustrated Polisario, which is recognised by some 75 countries, could return to some form of armed struggle to continue pressing its case. Much would depend on the attitude of Algeria: there have been recent signs of a slight improvement in relations with Morocco. There is little indication, however, that this will translate into a more effective Arab Maghreb Union, the organisation which brings together Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and Maur- itania. Formed in 1989, the AMU has agreed a number of conventions but none has been put into effect. Moroccan officials acknowledge that the organisation's chances of development remain modest. There was disagreement between the five partners over the Gulf war and this was heightened when the other members decided to follow the UN ruling on sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the destruction of an airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland. Morocco's main attention, however, is concentrated on its negotiations with the European Community. Earlier dreams of an eventual bid for membership, and before that an agreement which would permit almost free trade in agricultural produce, have reluctantly given way to a more sober assessment of what might be possible. Whatever the final outcome on improved economic co- operation, EC officials see the biggest immediate gain for Morocco as political. 'The big gain for Morocco is not in whatever is finally negotiated. The details matter less than the heightened political visibility that Morocco will enjoy as a result of closer links with the EC, and the impact this could have on inward investment, not just from EC members but also from other industrialised countries, such as Japan', comments one official. Negotiations are certain to be tough over sensitive issues for southern European countries, such as the access allowed to Moroccan tomatoes, but diplomats in Rabat sense that King Hassan's desire to attach Morocco firmly to Europe will eventually prove decisive.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI REPORTEDLY WILL INVESTIGATE SHOOTING OF VIET WRITER  </P> <P> The FBI will investigate the attempted assassination of Vietnamese author Doan  Van Toai, who reportedly had received death threats at his home several weeks  after writing a controversial magazine article that called for the United  States to establish diplomatic ties with Vietnam.  </P> <P> Toai, who was shot three times as he was walking home Saturday, had informed  the FBI about threats including a mailed warning accompanied by a bullet,  sources within the Fresno Vietnamese community said.  </P> <P> A Fresno County Sheriff's Department spokesman declined Sunday to comment on  reports of recent death threats but said the FBI decided to intervene in the  case at the request of the family.  </P> <P> Toai, who remained in serious condition Sunday at Valley Medical Center in  Fresno, has long been a controversial figure because of his actions during the  Vietnam War and his writing since.  </P> <P> Through his books "The Vietnamese Gulag" and "Portrait of the Enemy,"  co-written with David Chanoff, and his magazine, Toai in recent years has  advocated restoring ties with Vietnam to deliver humanitarian aid to the  people. In a 1986 interview with The Times, he said that an article he wrote  exposing alleged fraud by an anti-Communist group provoked death threats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Threatened  </P> <P> "I wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times saying these people who want to  fight the Communist government are collecting money for that cause but are  actually using the money for themselves," Toai said then. "The group that I  wrote about in 1982 was overwhelmingly supported by the refugee community in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The group threatened to kill my whole family after the story ran," Toai said.  </P> <P> An associate blamed the attempt on Toai's life on a mistranslation of something  Toai had written recently in his newsletter about reeducation camps and  resettlement. "Due to that mistranslation we received a lot of tension, the  community (became) upset," said the associate, Vinh Ngo.  </P> <P> Fresno police said Toai was shot about half a mile from his home in an  upper-middle-class section of northern Fresno. He had dropped his car off  shortly before 9 a.m. at a service station, shopped and was walking home when  he was intercepted.  </P> <P> He was hit three times -- once in the head and twice in the body -- at close  range by gunfire from an automatic pistol, authorities said. Witnesses told  police the shots came from a dirty brown Pontiac station wagon carrying two  Asian men.  </P> <P> "Apparently he was talking to them" when he was shot, Fresno Police Lt. Robert  Hagler said. Toai staggered to the front door of a nearby house and asked for  help before collapsing.  </P> <P> The shooting is the latest of several attacks in California in recent years  against Vietnamese refugees who advocate that the United States establish  diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  </P> <P> In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was shot in Orange  County's Little Saigon after he was quoted as saying he supported normalizing  relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was convicted. And on  April 30, 1988, novelist Long Vu suffered partial paralysis after a severe  beating in the same Westminster refugee community. Vu's columns were critical  of both the South Vietnamese and present Communist governments in Vietnam. Last  January, an arson fire destroyed a Garden Grove travel agency specializing in  tours to Vietnam. No suspects have been arrested in the last two incidents.  </P> <P> Toai's political views have long put him at odds with many in Southern  California's Vietnamese refugee community. Vietnamese-language newspapers have  written editorials against him, and outspoken leaders warned him that his views  are unwelcome.  </P> <P> Nhat Tien, a Santa Ana writer and poet, said Toai recently published a  Washington magazine, Institute for Democracy in Vietnam, which served as a  vehicle for expressing his political views on Vietnam.  </P> <P> In the magazine's summer, 1989, issue, Toai argued that the United States  should establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, said Tien, who had a copy  of Toai's magazine.  </P> <P> Toai "believes that if there is a relationship with the United States, the  condition of the poor Vietnamese people would change for the better. He  believed that if economic conditions improved, the political climate would  change, much like China," Tien said.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Fresno Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Cobbs said there have been no recent  political firestorms "that I know of" in Fresno's Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> In both Fresno, one of the largest Vietnamese resettlement communities in the  country, and in Orange County's Little Saigon, Toai was far from popular among  refugees, several community leaders said Sunday.  </P> <P> In Fresno, a member of the Vietnamese Assn. of Central Valley said many people  in the refugee community were suspicious of Toai because he made statements  that led people to believe he supported the Communists. "He said, 'The  Communists do some good things for the people of Vietnam.' . . . We escaped to  come here; no way we can support the Communists."  </P> <P> A prominent member of Fresno's Vietnamese community who asked not to be  identified added: "The Vietnamese community is really talking about this,  they're not surprised he was shot."  </P> <P> Chuyen V. Nguyen, a former South Vietnamese Air Force pilot who lives in Orange  County, recalled that Toai was a member of South Vietnam's educated class who  led anti-war protests in Saigon.  </P> <P> "He did a lot of damage to the democracy of Vietnam back home," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> "Even after Toai escaped from some so-called prison in 1977 or 1978, he  traveled to China with a North Vietnamese official who then opposed the regime  in North Vietnam. We in the Vietnamese refugee community believe he has close  ties to Vietnam," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> "The Vietnamese people here in the U.S. view him as another member of the  Communist Party."  </P> <P> Wilkinson reported from Fresno, Reyes from Orange County. Times staff writer  Nancy Wride also contributed to this report.  </P></p>

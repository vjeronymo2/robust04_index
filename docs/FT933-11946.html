			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation charges reduce CRT to Pounds 3.3m but dividend lifted by 17% CRT GROUP, the training, recruitment and consultancy company, proposes to lift the total dividend by 17 per cent despite a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 3.3m in the year to April 30, hit by one-off reorganisation costs and the recession. Mr John Gittins, finance director, said the company used the Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 3.7m) cash generation as a guide to setting the dividend level, rather than headline profits. The pre-tax profits were struck after charges of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 0.8m) to cover discontinued and exceptional items. The exceptional charge has increased from the Pounds 630,000 reported at the interim stage, reflecting the adoption of the new FRS 3 accounting standard which meant reclassifying some extraordinary items, together with other accounting changes and the establishment of provisions against future costs associated with discontinued activities. Total turnover, including Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 4.35m) from discontinued operations, increased to Pounds 47m (Pounds 43.5m) and operating profits declined to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 6.07m) including a Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 481,000) loss on discontinued operations. The company's core training division increased sales to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 20.2m), contributing operating profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 6.3m). Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive said: 'The disappointing financial performance in this division was largely a consequence of substantial investment in the provision of training materials and improved quality control processes.' The company added Wetherby Training Services and Convergent Communications to the division. The acquisitions contributed Pounds 1.69m to turnover and Pounds 248,000 to operating profits. The consultancy division contributed turnover of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.5m) and operating profits of Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 670,000), following 'a poor start to the year'. The recruitment division contributed an improved Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.4m) to sales and operating profit of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 400,000). The board proposes a final dividend of 2.15p (1.825p) to give a total for the year of 2.8p (2.4p). The dividend is payable from earnings per share of 4.2p (8.3p).</p>

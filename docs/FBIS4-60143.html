			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has denounced the  Israeli piracy, saying: Israeli aggressive acts are being  repeated every day against Lebanon without the United States or  Europe raising their voices against Israel and asking it to stop  its aggression against peaceful people.    Israel says the resistance is the cause of its operations.  However, we ask Israel: If the resistance is the cause, why  don't you confront the resistance fighters in their positions?    He added: The enemy derives its freedom from our weakness  and differences. It also derives its freedom from the support  of global arrogant forces.</p>

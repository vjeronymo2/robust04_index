			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Mayhew reaffirms faith in union The Conservative party's belief in the union was emphatically reasserted yesterday by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, as he welcomed the loyalist ceasefire as 'another significant move forward in the long road to a lasting peace.' In a debate at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth coinciding with yesterday's ceasefire announcement Mr Mayhew made a forthright defence of the province's right to self-determination. But, watched by prime minister Mr John Major, he stopped just short of embracing grassroots calls for the government actively to persuade Ulster's people that their best future lies in the United Kingdom. Sir Patrick said: 'One undoubted fact in Northern Ireland is that most people living there want to stay within the union. That is where they think their best interests lie. And I say without hesitation we are glad of it. 'We are persuaders for the future of Northern Ireland to be decided among the people of Northern Ireland, themselves, freely and without external impediment,' he said. The 'delicacy of balance' had to be maintained if 'this province of the United Kingdom' was to achieve a less antagonistic way of life. Welcoming the loyalist ceasefire, Sir Patrick said the government would test that the 'intention of permanence' was genuine 'as we have tested the intent and sincerity of the IRA'. He added: 'If we can confirm to our satisfaction that the intention is permanent then we will explore with them the ways that the peace process can be strengthened and their views taken into account.' He made clear that the government was still not quite satisfied that the IRA had ended its campaign of violence for good. What mattered, he said, was the need to be sure they would not revert to violence rather than 'the precise language in which their intention is expressed'. Sir Patrick honoured the fortitude of the people of Northern Ireland in the face of terrorism, republican and loyalist. He condemned the terrorists' 'sickening, random crimes' and said of the horrific aftermath of outrages: 'The blood congeals and lies like pools of black treacle on the floor.' Sir Patrick and Mr Major were greeted enthusiastically by representatives in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on an amendment urging the government to be a persuader for the union. Mr Leonard Fee, chairman of the Conservative Northern Ireland Area Council and the senior unpaid Tory in the province, said 1,100 people had signed a petition urging the amendment to be called. He said: 'If we start down the devolution slope I believe within a fairly short period of time our nation will be in tatters.' Ms Dorothy Dunlop, a former Belfast city councillor, implicitly criticised Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, by saying that the government should have called a referendum after signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. 'If we had had a referendum then, we would have been spared much of the loyalist violence whose end we are celebrating today,' she said. She believed Mr Major would not have entered into the agreement had he been prime minister in 1985.</p>

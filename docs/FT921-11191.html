			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Schlesinger calls for anti-inflationstance in EC: Warning against high pay deals MR HELMUT Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, called yesterday for a tougher approach to inflation in all EC countries and warned that high pay deals in Germany would endanger monetary stability, growth, and jobs. Speaking in Stockholm on the day German steelworkers voted to strike for higher pay, he said the strength of domestic demand in low-inflation countries like Germany had led to 'intolerable inflationary trends'. Inflation is now 4 per cent in Germany and the Bundesbank has said it wants a return to 2 per cent, a goal which Mr Schlesinger yesterday said should be adopted by all EC countries. The IG Metall union has claimed a 10.5 per cent increase for steelworkers and set a 9.5 per cent ceiling for demands in the more important engineering pay round. Mr Schlesinger expressed concern over the inflationary risks caused by German wage demands. 'Vigilance seems to us to be imperative in this context'. The central bank lifted interest rates by half a point in December as a reaction against the recent acceleration in money supply growth, inflation, and the high pay claims. Recent statements by Mr Schlesinger have made clear the Bundesbank will not lower rates until it is certain that inflationary dangers have receded. Yesterday he said: 'The Bundesbank must stick to its objective of stopping inflationary trends.' Noting that yields on long-term bonds had fallen to just under 8 per cent compared with 9 per cent in mid-1990, before German currency union was announced, he added: 'I think it is true to say that the Bundesbank has been able to convince the markets of its determination to achieve monetary stability.' But he said it was important, especially after the Maastricht agreements on economic and monetary union, that EC countries made more progress in harmonising their economies to the standards of the best performers. While the Bundesbank bore a particular responsibility for this, 'the joint efforts of all the central banks of member states should, in my view, be geared to limiting price rises in the longer run to about 2 per cent per annum or less'. This goal, which is stricter than the Maastricht criterion, was reached by a number of countries in the 1950s and 1980s - 'it is not Utopian'.</p>

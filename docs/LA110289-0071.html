			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOUP WEIGHS ALTERNATIVES AS CLU SEASON DRAWS TO CLOSE  </P> <P> Like Excalibur, the famed sword of King Arthur, the future of this Kingsman may  not be set in stone.  </P> <P> In early August, Cal Lutheran administrators decreed that the 1989 football  season would be the last for Bob Shoup, the only head coach in the school's 28  years of football.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran will play its final game of the season Saturday against Azusa  Pacific, but it may not be Shoup's last game as the coach of the Kingsmen.  </P> <P> Shoup said that negotiations regarding his status should be resolved within a  week.  </P> <P> Because of the confidential nature of the negotiations, Shoup chose to speak  only in generalities, but he did say: "I'm trying to figure out what's in the  best interests of the university and not be damaged. . . . There are some major  considerations to be made. It would really surprise me if it could be done by  this Friday. It involves a lot of people and a lot of attorneys. I thought at  one time it might be put to rest last week."  </P> <P> Shoup said that various constituencies of the university must be dealt with in  the decision, but that the discussions are now basically between himself and  university President Jerry Miller, who could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> About six options are being considered.  </P> <P> A major issue for Shoup is a sabbatical leave, which was granted to him by the  Cal Lutheran Board of Regents. The sabbatical need not run concurrently with  the school year and was originally scheduled to begin in January and end in  December, 1990. The beginning date and length may be negotiable, though.  </P> <P> One of the six options reportedly would be for Shoup to take the sabbatical but  still coach the football team next fall. Shoup hinted that another option would  be to forgo the sabbatical, although he said, "I don't think I would do that. .  . . The fact that it's in the contract is a given, the question is the way to  do it."  </P> <P> Shoup contends that he should be able to retain not only his tenured teaching  position after the sabbatical but also his job as coach. Shoup said that last  year, when the team had a record of 2-8, was his most difficult as coach.  Although the team has continued to play hard thus far in a 2-6 season, he is  still eager for a sabbatical.  </P> <P> "I just kind of feel it's a fringe benefit that's really not been available to  me," Shoup said. "All the other faculty get one every seven years."  </P> <P> Shoup inaugurated the football program in 1962, and his team won the National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics championship in 1971. His career record is  184-87-6, one of the best in the nation. His teams have won 13 NAIA District 3  titles and played in three national championship games.  </P></p>

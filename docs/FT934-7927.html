			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UN to end hunt for Aideed The UN Security Council voted unanimously early yesterday to call off the hunt for General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord whose followers were blamed for attacks on international peacekeepers. The decision was in response to an abrupt shift in US policy after 17 American soldiers were killed on October 3 in a clash with Gen Aideed's forces. Adml Jonathan Howe, UN special representative in Somalia, had offered a Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 16,778) reward for capture of the warlord. Without naming Gen Aideed, the resolution sought suspension of 'arrest actions against those who might be implicated,' pending a report that will determine responsibility for repeated attacks on UN troops. Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate, said the goal now must be to foster a political dialogue leading to national reconciliation. Gen Aideed had refused to co-operate in peace-making efforts while a wanted man and the council now hopes he will change his mind. Seven Nigerians and 34 Pakistanis serving with the force have also been killed in attacks by Somalis.</p>

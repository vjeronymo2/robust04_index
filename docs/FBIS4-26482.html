			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Liang Fu (5328 1133): </F> "Fruitful Mediation"]    [Text] Between 13 and 18 June, former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter shuttled between the DPRK and the ROK. After returning  to the United States, he talked on the telephone with President  Clinton and met with relevant senior U.S. officials in order to  brief them about his visit to the Korean peninsula. This time,  Mr. Carter promoted an exchange of opinions between the DPRK,  the United States, and the ROK on the nuclear issue, and his  mediation activity was fruitful and has eased the tense  situation on the Korean peninsula to a certain degree.    In the recent period, the situation on the Korean peninsula  became tense due to the nuclear issue. In particular, after the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] adopted a resolution  to impose sanctions against the DPRK on 10 June and the DPRK  announced its withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dialogue  between the various parties concerned on the nuclear issue in  the DPRK was suspended, and the situation on the Korean  peninsula was strained further. The United States and some  other countries intensively planned to push the UN Security  Council to pass a resolution on imposing sanctions against the  DPRK. The U.S. and ROK armed forces carried out exercises and  deployed "Patriot" missiles. The DPRK also issued repeated  statements, saying that sanctions in any form would be regarded  as an act of war against the DPRK. At this moment, Carter was  invited to visit the Korean peninsula. Although it was just a  private visit, it still attracted extensive attention from the  international community.    Before visiting the DPRK, Carter first visited the ROK and  held a meeting with President Kim Yong-sam. In Pyongyang, he  met President Kim Il-song twice, and the two talked for a long  time. After leaving the DPRK, Carter once again visited the ROK  and conveyed a message from President Kim Il-song to President  Kim Yong-sam.    Carter's mediation has achieved positive results: the DPRK  allowed IAEA inspectors and monitoring equipment to remain in  the DPRK, and agreed that the United States should send  personnel to help the DPRK search for the remains of American  soldiers killed in the Korean war. President Kim Il-song also  expressed willingness to unconditionally meet with President Kim  Yong-sam at any time and in any place. The ROK gave a positive  reaction to this, and proposed that the two sides hold a meeting  of deputy premiers on 26 June in Panmunjom to make preparations  for the first summit meeting between the leaders of the south  and the north, which will be an important event on the Korean  Peninsula and will promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean  nuclear issue and regional stability.    After returning to the United States, Carter talked on the  telephone with President Clinton, and then told the press that  "the crisis was over." He also said that efforts made by the  United States to impose sanctions against the DPRK would "just  delay and hold up the diplomatic actions." Although the White  House expressed "prudent optimism" about Carter's visit to the  DPRK, it still "greatly appreciated the former president's  benign efforts."    All international opinion valued highly Mr. Carter's trip to  the Korean peninsula. His mediating activities once again show  that dialogue is better than confrontation and that continuing  to seek political settlement is more favorable to the settlement  of differences than recklessly imposing sanctions and exerting  pressure. People believe that through further dialogue, the  relevant parties involved in the Korean issue will certainly be  able to find a way to settle the issue peacefully and will  eventually realize the two objectives of making the Korean  peninsula a nuclear-free zone and safeguarding the stability on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

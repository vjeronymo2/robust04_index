			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (9): A snip - of the secateurs - Homes for serious gardeners / Gardens 'ACID or alkaline?' is a typical, no-nonsense question that serious gardeners will ask an estate agent when they are considering buying a house. With a shrewd idea of the answer, these gardeners are inquiring about the soil type and, perhaps, checking to see if the garden is good enough to appear in the Yellow Book, the annual list of gardens open to the public. Serious gardeners start viewing the outside of a property first. How much work will it be? Has the owner planned the beds well and coped with the soil conditions? If it is limey, are there acid pockets for heather or azaleas? These practical queries help to decide how interesting a garden it is, or could become. Is it a standard mixed herbaceous, shrub and rose garden - or is it a plantsman's garden with unusual species? For serious gardeners the grounds are as important as the house, if not more so, because the garden says best what sort of people they are. Two of the most interesting gardens to have come on the market in the past year, Clapton Court, in Somerset, and Shute House, in Dorset, each the creation of their vendors, deserve serious gardeners. Shute sold quickly; Clapton has taken a year but a sale is now agreed. New on the market, and sure to excite, is Tilgates at Bletchingley in Surrey. Together with Bodnant and the Savill Garden in Windsor, it houses the National Collection of Magnolias and has the world's largest collection, which vendor David Clulow has made over 23 years. Add azaleas and rhododendrons, many of his own raising, and a total 5,500 shrubs and trees (listed and labelled by computer) - but nothing herbaceous - so that it can be run by a gardener and his wife, and Tilgates looks a snip of the secateurs at Pounds 600,000 (from the London office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley). In 1906 Surrey's greatest gardener, Gertrude Jekyll, designed the 20 acres of terraced gardens and park at Thorpe Hall,Louth, in Lincolnshire, a brick house that dates back to 1584 and is listed Grade II*. Savills in Lincoln is seeking in excess of Pounds 650,000. Elaborate stone terraces, clipped yew hedges and spring fed pools abound in the garden of Overdale, at Church Stretton, Shropshire, landscaped by Bakers of Wolverhampton in 1928. As the job took three years and employed up to 20 men, buyers will ponder how much labour it needs today. Does that explain why the price has come down from Pounds 375,000 to Pounds 295,000, from Balfour &amp; Cooke or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford? In Yorkshire, Totterdownhill Farm, 16 miles from York, has four separate gardens in 1 1/4 acres and varieties of hosta, viburnum, prunus, cornus and much more. Savills in York is selling it for Pounds 300,000. In Perthshire the garden at Dykeneuk, at Butterstone, near Dunkeld, is larger and is planted with shrubs to give year-round colour. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Edinburgh is asking for offers of more than Pounds 200,000. Back in the Home Counties, Chesworth, in Horsham, Sussex, is a 15th/17th century house in 65 acres beside the River Arun, which feeds the waterfalls and weirs in the water gardens. Its 65 acres include a walled rose garden. 'A halo of romance still hangs about this quiet spot,' wrote the local historian in 1889. This romance, from Egerton, costs Pounds 950,000. The Barn, an intriguing Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced, Tudoresque brick and timber octagonal house, with leaded windows, in Nan Clark's Lane, Mill Hill, London NW7, overlooks another superb water garden with ponds and waterfalls, and a glorious parade of shrubs and trees in five acres eight miles from central London. The price is over Pounds 2m, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hadley Green. The attraction of Waterstock House in Oxfordshire, two miles from exit 7 on the M40, is that it is in the flat and well- watered country of the River Thame. The present owners have concentrated on horses. Gardeners, here is your chance, at Pounds 875,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Oxford. At Pounds 1.25m the company's Cirencester office offers water gardens, and a formal canal, by the River Leach, in Gloucestershire, flowing through the grounds at Southrop Manor, near Lechlade. Large greenhouses, walled gardens, terraces, cedar trees, an 18th century gothic gardener's cottage and a verandah along the front of the house, are the attractions of Melton Lodge, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, (from Bidwells or Savills in Ipswich at Pounds 775,000). You may find some of these houses too grand. A good, manageable family house in Swerford, a warm and unspoilt village in the northern Cotswolds, near Banbury, comes to auction on October 27. Its sheltered garden looks splendid now but with thoughtful replanting can easily be made better still. The Old Rectory needs work, but there is plenty of potential in both house and garden. Auctioneer/agent Lane Fox expects to obtain more than Pounds 400,000. I shall look for serious gardeners at the auction.

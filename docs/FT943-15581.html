			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: A way round the vagaries of regulators Sir, Some shareholders of privatised companies whose profits are subject to the vagaries of the regulators ('Power companies await the crunch', July 2/3) may wonder whether their interests and those of consumers are really so inevitably opposed, as is generally assumed. Could not a formula be found which would allow the benefits of modernisation, rationalisation and investment to be shared equitably between the parties, without stifling the companies' incentives to economise on the one hand or enabling them to rip off the consumers on the other? The answer is that it could if the regulator would only tear himself away from the two well-known methods of regulation, known as 'rate of return regulation' and 'price capping', both of which have failed so lamentably in the past. The formula needed is for profits to be limited, not by rate of return nor by prices per se, but by reference to the benefit the company brings to its customers by way of price reductions from year to year. Such a formula was published two years ago in the July 1992 Political Quarterly. This would enable the company to retain large profits as long as it passes on a proportion of its economies to its customers; profits would be inexorably reduced if the company tried to swell them at the expense of customers. The whole process is automatic, so the regulator need not intervene to keep the company on its toes. And the company need not look over its shoulder all the time to try to guess how severe the regulator will be after the next review. David Rudd, 14 Colcokes Road, Banstead, Surrey SM7 2EW</p>

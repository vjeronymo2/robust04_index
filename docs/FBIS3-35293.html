President al-Hirawi returned to Beirut last night at the end  of the Damascus summit.    Our correspondent in Damascus has reported that the first  round of talks lasted three and half hours and was attended by  Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. The two leaders  discussed the progress made so far on the Lebanese and Syrian  tracks in Washington and Israel's attempts to circumvent  Resolution 425. The talks also dealt with the U.S. message that  warns about the explosive situation in the south.    The two presidents' views were identical on the need to  continue coordination between the two countries to confront  internal and external developments.    During the second round of talks, Presidents al-Hirawi and  al- Asad discussed the internal situation and bilateral  relations. [passage omitted]    The two leaders concluded their summit with a third round of  talks in which Khaddam, Prime Minister al-Zu'bi, and Foreign  Minister al-Shar' attended. The talks dealt with the  developments in the region after the Geneva summit and the Arab  situation in light of the visits to Damascus by a number of Arab  leaders. The two sides also touched on issues of mutual  interest.    The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY cited presidential sources as  saying  that President al-Hirawi raised all issues pertaining to  Israel's aggressive designs in the south and western al-Biqa'.  President al-Hirawi also briefed the Syrian officials on the  course of the Lebanese-Syrian negotiations. He was briefed on  the progress made in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations.    According to knowledgeable sources, the local Lebanese  situation was also discussed during the summit, particularly  amid increasing parliamentary opposition. It has been learned  that the two presidents stressed the need for the government to  promote its efforts by patching up the differences of a number  of ministries and the dispute between the Labor Ministry and  trade unions.    Citing a Syrian official, REUTER reported that Israel is  responsible for the failure to achieve any progress in the peace  negotiations. Israel still refuses to abide by the peace  process and implement the UN resolutions, according to REUTER.  The Syrian official emphasized that Israel's failure to  withdraw from the occupied Arab territories means that the  negotiations have not achieved the desired objective.</p>

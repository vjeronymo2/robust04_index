			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Crocodile awareness syndrome - Practical Traveller FOUR years ago I spent a couple of days at Nkamba Bay Lodge, by the shore of Lake Tanganyika, within Zambia's Sumbu national park. I could have gone fishing. I did go for game walks, escorted by a guide, Olvitti Chasaya, and his supremely ancient rifle. What I did not attempt, because of the crocodiles, was to walk near the lake. The reason I respect crocodiles is my awareness of the number of people grabbed in recent years by the fearsome estuarine saltwater crocodiles - 'salties' - of northern Australia. Mainly, estuarine crocs range from southern China and the Malay archipelago to India and Sri Lanka, taking in Australia, New Guinea, the Philippines and the Solomons. In Papua New Guinea once I asked a tribal chief what to do if chased by a croc. 'Jump in the river,' he said brusquely. It is possible he was joking. For a rundown on crocs, alligators and other animal (and insect) hazards when travelling in tropical parts, you need the latest edition of The Tropical Traveller by John Hatt (Penguin, Pounds 6.99). The writer insists that you should never run from a wild cat. 'Although terrifying, it is much safer to face them. One acquaintance was charged by a tiger in Nepal. His guide rushed at the tiger, shouting and yelling. The tiger retreated.' Other tips: Buffalo and hippopotamus are far more dangerous than lions. On South Africa's Natal coast a cow hippo was once seen to plunge into the sea, seize a 300lb shark from the surf, haul it on to the beach and trample it to death. Piranhas' ferocity, on the other hand, is much exaggerated (says Hatt), though the red-bellied piranha, common in savanna ponds, can inflict terrible bites. It is likely that most piranha wounds are caused out of water. Landed piranhas (fishing boat or river bank) flop about and gnash their teeth. Sharks: you are in greatest danger when near a wriggling fish, as spear-fishermen will confirm. Avoid night-time swimming: some of the most dangerous species, including the tiger shark, come into the shallows at night. Good news about snakes: there are no dangerously venomous snakes in Ireland, Iceland, New Zealand, most of Polynesia and Micronesia, the Galapagos, the Canaries, Malta, the Orkneys, Shetlands, Madagascar and numerous other islands. A South African survey showed that 74 per cent of snakebites are inflicted below the knee, and 67 per cent below the ankle. Lesson: wear boots and thick trousers. The snake's fangs may penetrate the trousers, but the amount of venom delivered will be greatly reduced. Dogs: again, do not run away. Face the dog, look fierce and bend down as if to pick up a stone. If the dog still threatens, throw a stone at the dog's (dogs') head(s). Dogs are not only a problem in undeveloped countries. In the US, more than 1m dog-bites a year require hospital attention. Mosquitoes: about 1m people a year die of malaria, but mosquitoes also carry some 80 other diseases. Insect repellants last far longer on material (clothes, sheets) than on your skin. Many mosquito species like to bite ankles, so wear socks doused in repellant. 'This may deter mosquitoes more than you think,' says John Hatt, 'because many of them begin their investigations as close to the ground as possible.' Hatt covers a broad range of subject matter: travel preparations, money (carrying it, keeping hold of it), equipment, flying, health, transport and accommodation, culture shock and so forth. There is even an index. I especially liked his disclaimer: 'The author and publisher have tried to make the advice and information as accurate as possible, but they accept no responsibility for loss, injury, inconvenience or other liability arising from any person using this book.' Another worthwhile paperback, recently updated, is Europe By Train, by Katie Wood and George McDonald (Fontana, Pounds 7.99). It is packed with information, some of it otiose, some of it twee, but all of it well marshalled.</p>

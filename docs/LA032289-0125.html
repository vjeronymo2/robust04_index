			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A substance called "chromium picolinate" could offer athletes a safe  alternative to anabolic steroids, according to Gary Evans, a chemistry  professor at Bemidji State University in Minnesota. He discussed the possible  benefits of the nutrient during a meeting of the Federation of the American  Societies for Experimental Biology at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Two studies at Bemidji State found that the compound helped promote muscle  tissue and decreased body fat, he said. In one study, football players on the  same exercise programs took either chromium picolinate or a placebo.  </P> <P> Those taking the chromium picolinate showed an average 42% greater growth in  lean body mass and a 22% drop in total body fat, compared to a 1.06% drop for  the control group, he said.  </P></p>

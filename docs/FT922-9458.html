			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Stores' view of married women 'outdated' MARRIED WOMEN are finding themselves in a 'ghetto of part-time work' because of managers' outdated assumptions about attitudes to jobs, according to research by Lancaster University into employment in the retail sector. While married women were thought to be reliable, loyal and flexible, it was also assumed they would take time off because of their children and give their husbands' careers precedence, the report found. The majority of the supermarket employees studied were part-timers, and most of those were married women. Stores surveyed were Asda, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, Littlewoods and EH Booth branches in the Lancaster area. Employment Patterns in Contemporary Retailing. Roger Penn and Betty Wirth.

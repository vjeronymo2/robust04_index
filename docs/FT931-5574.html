			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs endorse pub rents campaign A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs has given its backing to a campaign by licensees of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, protesting at the 'excessive' rents charged on long-term leases by the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture company. The MPs - representing all three of the main political parties - have called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to initiate an urgent Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the subject. Using a parliamentary early day motion, they said they noted 'with grave concern' widespread evidence of 'unrealistic changes in tenancy agreements and rents' imposed on landlords by Inntrepreneur. Ten days ago, licensees of Inntrepreneur pubs, some of whom have acquired GrandMet shares, picketed the food and drinks group's annual meeting to publicise their claims. Inntrepreneur, established two years ago in the Pounds 2.36bn pub-for-breweries deal between GrandMet and Courage, owns about 6,850 pubs. The estate is managed by GrandMet and most of its beer is supplied by Courage.</p>

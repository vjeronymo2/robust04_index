			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forecasts"] </F>   [Text]  <H3>  Entrepreneurs More Optimistic About Business  Prospects </H3>   The poll on business expectations carried out by the Office  for Economic Forecasting and Policy of the Slovenian Chamber of  Economy (SKEP) on the eve of 1994 reflects greater optimism than  in 1993. Entrepreneurs are more optimistic in their forecasts  for 1994 for both production and sales, while their export  expectations are even greater.    Following the remarkable pessimistic forecast in June and  slightly more favourable one in September, the December forecast  for 1994 showed that the number of entrepreneurs expecting an  increase in production has risen by 30 per cent, while those who  are optimistic about sales outnumber those who are pessimistic  by 32 percent. The greatest modification in expectations is  expected in the area of production and sales opportunities -- in  the third quarter of 1993 the number of those who expected a  decrease in production was seven percent higher than the number  of those who forecast growth, and the number of optimistic  forecasts for sales was 15 percent lower.  <H3>  Over One Third of Respondents Believe 1994 Will Be Better  Year </H3>   Results of the Stik survey, a public opinion poll carried  out  by DELO, show that almost one third of those polled expected  1944 to be worse than 1993, 36.7 percent believe 1994 will be  better, and 37.3 percent would be satisfied if 1994 turns out to  be the same as 1993. A greater number of respondents expect  that the economic situation in Slovenia in 1994 will deteriorate  rather than improve. As few as 26.8 percent of those polled  expect the situation to remain the same in 1994. The poll was  carried out from 21 to 22 December and included 1,177 people.  <H5>  Better Expectations for 1994 </H5>   As many as 39.9 percent of Slovenians believe life will be  better in 1994, 24.4 percent maintain it will be the same as  this year, and 28.2 percent expect it to be worse, the SPEM  marketing research company reported in a poll which included 387  respondents. The most vital part of the population, in  particular men between 30 and 54 years of age, believe that  Slovenians will lead a better life in 1994 than in the current  year.  <H5>  Optimism Gaining Ground </H5>   Almost one half of the direcors of medium-sized and large  companies included in a poll carried out by the Gral agency and  published in the GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK weekly said that sales on  the domestic market would remain unchanged. A strong third of  the directors expect the sales to increase, while only as few as  one tenth of those polled expect that their companies will sell  less on the domestic market in 1994 than in the currrent year.    According to the same poll, a brighter atmosphere is  prevailing among Slovenian exporters. Almost six tenths of  those included in the poll are hoping their exports will  increase in 1994, while only one tenth of them expect that their  sales on foreign markets will fall. The expectations of the  directors included in the poll about their business standing are  very high, since only two out of one hundred directors  interviewed expect that the current situation will deteriorate  in 1994.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Defence cuts fall hardest on navy and air force: Pounds 500m air defence missile plan shelved - Tornado squadron to disband BROAD-RANGING cuts in war-ships, submarines and fighters and the cancellation of two weapons projects were announced by the government yesterday on publication of its annual defence white paper. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced that Britain was shelving a Pounds 500m-plus plan for a new air defence missile system. British Aerospace had been bidding with Raytheon of the US, maker of the Patriot missile, for the contract against other international consortia. The UK is also following the US and Germany in withdrawing from a new anti-tank weapon to be fired from multiple rocket launchers. Mr Rifkind said the job could be done by aircraft. He confirmed that the navy would try to sell or lease its four new Upholder class conventionally powered submarines, which have cost more than Pounds 200m each. Work on the last vessel at Cammell Laird is almost complete. Alternatively the submarines may be placed in storage. The fleet of frigates and destroyers is to be cut from 39 to 'about 35'. An RAF Tornado fighter squadron now patrolling Bosnian airspace from a base in Italy will be disbanded next April, bringing to 15 the number of squadrons cut since the government announced its Options for Change programme three years ago. Mr Rifkind said the measures reflected the decreasing likelihood of a serious external threat. Amid Tory backbench warnings that cuts should go no further, he insisted that Britain's forces were sufficient to carry out all the tasks required of them. 'There is a clear operational justification for each of these reductions, which otherwise would not have been agreed,' he told the Commons. Other long-awaited measures, including the expected abandonment of plans for an air-launched nuclear missile, were put off, opening the the way to Labour attacks of 'indecision'. Mr Rifkind described the cuts as 'modest, but significant'. Despite 'lurid headlines', he said, spending targets remained the same as agreed with the Treasury last November, when plans over the next two years were reduced by Pounds 1.05bn. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said the measures would accelerate job losses, and warned of a 'tide of redundancies' in the defence industry in the next six months. However, Mr Rifkind said reductions were offset by enhancements including plans to buy 'a substantial number' of support helicopters. He announced a Pounds 75m order for over 400 ammunition-supply vehicles from Cheshire-based Foden. He said the four-nation Eurofighter was 'secure'. Figures published yesterday showed the UK share of Eurofighter development costs at Pounds 3.46bn against Pounds 2.72bn a year ago. The army, the focus of recent controversy about the size of cuts, is the service least affected by the measures. Mr Rifkind said there were no plans for further reductions in armoured regiments, which would stay at eight. The government had still to decide whether to upgrade existing tanks or buy more Vickers Challenger 2s. The white paper confirmed navy personnel would be cut to 52,500 by 1995, instead of 55,000 foreseen two years ago. Further reductions are due after that.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Friday [20 May] called for an  overall review of the methods for setting public service  charges, particularly highway tolls.    The proposal was made in connection with the government's  latest decision to uniformly freeze proposed hikes in public  service rates until the end of the year in easing the burdens on  a recession-hit private sector.    Speaking to reporters, Hata said many cabinet ministers  agreed earlier in the day on the need for a "thorough and  drastic review" of the current rate-fixing system.    Hata especially criticized "a pool system" used to calculate  highway tolls as a mechanism that always works toward a rate  hike.    He cited the use of the government's fiscal investment and  loan fund as one option in replacing the pool system in which  funds collected by drivers finance new highway construction.    The government announced Wednesday it will suspend rates for  services such as telephones, rents on government-owned houses  and public transportation. The plan was approved by Friday's  cabinet meeting.    On utility charges, Hata said the issue should be separated  from charges subject to the latest rate hike freeze. Rates on  gas and electricity were cut last November as part of efforts to  pass on to consumers the companies' windfall profits from the  yen's appreciation against the dollar. The companies said the  cuts would be effective until the end of September this year.    What to do after September is a matter to be handled by the  industries concerned after taking into account various economic  factors like crude oil prices and exchange rates, Hata said.    On the growing difficulty of female college graduates to  find  jobs, with many companies refusing to hire women, citing the  recession, the trade minister said he will ask the business  community to "refrain from hesitating" to recruit such students.  The tendency, if covered by the overseas media, would undermine  the reputation of Japanese corporations, Hata said. He said he  will make the request when he meets leaders of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren) next Tuesday.    Turning to the ongoing Japan-U.S. informal trade talks in  Washington, Hata said he has yet to receive any information  about the meeting. The two countries began subcabinet-level  talks Thursday in a bid to find common ground for resuming the  stalled negotiations on a new bilateral trade framework.</p>

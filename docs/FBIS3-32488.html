			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 20 Jan (PL) -- The levels of juvenile  delinquency and tourism-related prostitution (jineterismo, in  popular jargon) increased in Cuba during the past few years but  on a minor scale, according to [Juan Contino], Cuba's top youth  leader.    Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists  (UJC), has told PRENSA LATINA that the country's youths prove  every day their high degree of preparedness in every area,  including the area of ideology, and he denied assertions by  ill-intentioned individuals to the effect that Cuba's youths  "are lost."    Although he acknowledged it is no excuse that only a small  number of youths are on the wrong path, Contino has said  individuals who -- instigated by the diversionist campaigns led  by enemies of the revolution -- undermine the merits of the new  generations know full well they are magnifying a lie.    Contino explained there are segments of the youthful  population of the island (there are approximately 3.1 million  citizens between the ages of 15 and 30) that have behavioral  problems that go hand in hand with the crisis Cuba is  experiencing.    That the number of crimes perpetrated by youths is  increasing  throughout the world -- and Cuba is no exception -- does not  justify the appearance or intensification of these phenomena in  a socialist society, he said. He added that the UJC works on an  individual basis in an attempt to rescue boys and girls who  succumb to those weaknesses.    We know it is a difficult task that must be worked on  everyday by everyone -- relatives, schools, teachers, social and  political institutions, and mass organizations -- but we are  willing to take strong actions against crime and prostitution,  in defense of the Cuban people's peace of mind, he said.    Contino has disclosed the UJC is extending its actions  beyond  its membership -- which is estimated at approximately 500,000 --  to the entire youthful population, including youths who have  committed crimes and have served time in jail, to achieve their  reincorporation into society.    The 33-year-old member of the Communist Party of Cuba's  Central Committee, an economist by profession, has said if you  want to talk with Cuban youths, you must look for them on any  battle field, actively engaged in the struggle to fulfill the  revolution's leading tasks.    Contino has said over 40,000 youths participate in urgent  sugar harvest tasks (to guarantee the country's leading  industry). He has also suggested that anyone who wants to  understand what Cuban youths are really like must go to a  sugarcane plantation.    He cited as an example that over 167,000 students at the  pre-university level and from technological institutes and  universities volunteered to spend 15 days of their 1993 vacation  working on farms, and more than 100,000 youths participated in  those tasks throughout the recently ended year.    Contino has also explained that approximately 60 percent of  the country's scientists and more than 70 percent of its tourism  workers are young, authentic proof, he said, of the education  they received from childhood.    The top youth leader, who replaced current Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina a year ago, has denied the existence of a crisis  of ethical and moral values among Cuba's younger generations,  let alone a generational struggle between the youths and the  revolution's traditional leaders.    A nation with a young population whose average age is 32.1  years -- who have brought down continuous allegations that they  would topple the revolution --cannot have internal struggles,  because there are no antagonistic contradictions between  generations that share the same principles and prospects, he  concluded.    The UJC, which emerged shortly after the revolution in 1961,  is a selective and voluntary organization that is joined by the  best Cuban students and workers of up to 30 years of age.    The UJC maintains relations at present with approximately  218  student and youth groups in 61 countries, and at home it works  in coordination with children, youth, and student associations  (the Jose Marti Pioneers Organization and High School and  university student federations).</p>

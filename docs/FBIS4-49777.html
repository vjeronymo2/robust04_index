			<p>BFN     [Text] The Shaanxi Provincial Government Delegation,  headed by Governor Bai Qingcai, returned to Xian on 28 April  after concluding its eight-day visit to Japan. During the  visit, the delegation fulfilled the task of establishing  friendly relations between our province and Japan's Kagawa  Prefecture so as to lay a foundation for future exchanges and  cooperation. In the meantime, the delegation also discussed  with the Japanese side specific cooperative and exchange  projects for this year.    Governor Bai Qingcai was interviewed by Japan's NHK  broadcasting company on our province's investment environment,  and its economic and natural resources, so that Japan's mass  media and social stratum would know more about Shaanxi.</p>

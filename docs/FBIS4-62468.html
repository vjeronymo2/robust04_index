			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] At a meeting between the defense ministers of  Armenia and Azerbaijan and the commander of the Karabakh Army  today, an agreement was signed envisaging a reliable ceasefire  in Karabakh.    [Correspondent Murtazin] To judge by all events, for the  first time in the six years of the Karabakh conflict, today the  warring sides have reached a final accord on a ceasefire. This  is to take place at midnight on 16-17 May. Pavel Grachev has  taken the process of disengaging the troops into his own hands.  Journalists were invited to the meeting, which probably  witnesses to the fact that all fundamental issues had already  been settled.    The main thing is a total ceasefire along the entire  frontline. According to the Russian minister's plan, by 25 May  the warring sides should be withdrawn to a distance of between 5  and 15 kms from the contact lines. The security zones thus  created will be occupied by Russia's peacekeeping forces under  the command of First Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev.    Issues relating to the withdrawal of troops from the  territory of Azerbaijan will be resolved not by the military,  but by politicians: it is they who will determine the staus of  Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

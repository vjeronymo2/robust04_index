			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political uncertainties overshadow markets In the absence of significant new economic data, political concerns dominated the currency markets yesterday, writes Gillian Tett. Uncertainty over the UK parliamentary vote on VAT and the timing of the next interest rate rise shaped market sentiment towards sterling. News that Antonio Di Pietro, the Italian government magistrate, might resign undermined the lira. Political uncertainties also weakened the punt, after new Irish elections appeared more likely. Meanwhile, the resignation of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, helped to firm the dollar fractionally. Trading in sterling was relatively quiet ahead of the crucial vote last night on the passage of the bill introducing the VAT increase on fuel. During the day the pound firmed moderately, ending at Dollars 1.5631, up from the previous close of Dollars 1.5591. Against the D-Mark it improved to DM2.4579 from Monday's DM2.4542 finish. Analysts said the British currency appeared to be caught between two conflicting pressures. On the one hand, the political uncertainty that had accompanied the UK vote was weakening investors' confidence in the currency. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'What international investors have seen for the second week in a row is a picture of a government surviving by one or two votes. It does not smack of strong government - it looks quite Italian, in fact.' But on the other hand, sterling has been supported by growing market expectations that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, will raise interest rates when they meet today. Indeed, widespread fears that interest rates would be lifted faster if the vote on VAT were lost fuelled expectations yest-erday of an imminent interest rate increase. If the UK monetary authorities do not, in fact, raise interest rates this week, this could significantly weaken sterling in the days ahead, analysts warned. Mr Rob Hayward, economic adviser at Bank of America, said: 'Speculation has been growing in the last 24 hours of a rate rise. If there is not a rise this week, we will probably see a negative reaction from the markets.' These growing expectations of a rate increase triggered a significant fall in sterling futures for the second day in a row. The March contract dropped some 18 basis points to close around 92.50. At this level traders are assuming that interest rates will be 7.5 per cent by next spring. Political uncertainty yesterday weakened the lira and led to a slide in Italian futures after Mr Di Pietro, the symbol of Italy's anti-corruption drive, submitted his resignation. The lira finished at L1,033 against the D-Mark, compared with L1,028 the previous day. Meanwhile, the Irish markets were overshadowed by speculation that new elections were imminent after talks on an alliance between the Labour and Fianna Fail parties collapsed. The Irish punt ended at DM2.405, against DM2.415 at Monday's close. The news that Mr Lloyd Bentsen was resigning as US Treasury secretary, and being replaced by Mr Robert Rubin, was received relatively well on the markets. Although the dollar had weakened during early European trading, it rallied slightly after the news of the appointment. It finally closed at Y100.3, compared with Y100.4 the previous day. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.573, compared with Monday's DM1.574 close. The dollar ended the New York trading session at Y100.1 and DM1.5723. Traders pointed out that Mr Bentsen's departure was seen as being favourable for the dollar, because of his tendency to talk down the dollar against the yen in previous months. In the longer term Mr MacKinnon now believes that the fundamentals bode well for the US currency, and is predict-ing that the dollar could strengthen significantly in the coming months. Mr Steve Hannah, international economist at IBJ, remains doubtful. 'The markets are speculating that the Fed will tighten in December or January, and if it does not there is a risk that the Fed will lose credibility,' he said. The Bank of England yesterday forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m in the UK money markets, and removed almost all of this at established rates.</p>

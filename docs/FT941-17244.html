			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fresh cash for Czech-Slovak bank The Czech and Slovak governments have injected new capital and strengthened the balance sheet of Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka (CSOB), their jointly-owned foreign trade bank. The move is the latest in a series designed to improve the operational efficiency and profitability of the bank and set it on course for privatisation. The governments have injected Kcs4.05bn (Dollars 135m) into the foreign trade bank of the former Czechoslovak socialist republic, and transferred Kcs40bn of bad and doubtful debt into two new 'collection units,' to be funded and managed by CSOB. The bank also implemented credit write-downs which, together with the capital injection, raised its capital adequacy ratio to 6.25 per cent at the year end. The bank, which finances over half the foreign trade of both republics, is 73 per cent-owned by the Czech government, which provided Dollars 100m of new capital, and 26 per cent by the Slovak government, which provided the remaining Dollars 35m. One per cent of shares are held by bank employees. It will report an increased operating profit for 1993 before providing for bad debts, but an overall loss for the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- The Serbs are  "overwhelmingly responsible" for the continuation of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy  Claes said here Thursday [30 December].    He called for the maintenance, and possibly the  strengthening, of sanctions against Serbia as "the only solution  for making the belligerents lay down their arms."    Analyzing Belgium's six-month term as president of the  European Community, Claes, accompanied by Prime Minister Jean  Luc Dehaene and Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt, admitted  that "despite all the initiatives taken, we were not able to get  things moving."    Last week's meeting in Brussels between the Bosnian warring  factions and the 12 EC foreign ministers "was a great  disappointment," he said.    The fact that the ceasefire agreed to by all factions at  that  meeting was not respected "puts their representativeness in  doubt," he added. "The different parties seem to be more  inspired by a dialectic of war rather than peace."    "It has been clearly proven that the Serbian faction, and  notably Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, continues to have  an overwhelming responsibility in this tragedy," Claes said.    The foreign minister, warning that military invention by the  West could lead to an internationalization of the conflict,  called for more pressure against the belligerents instead.    "More violence will not solve things," he said.    Asked about the decision of several EC countries to  establish  diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, Claes said Belgium would "follow their example" after  it gives up the EC presidency.    Greece, which will take over the presidency from Belgium on  January 1, "is ready to accept this decision," Claes said.    The presence of European diplomats in Skopje "could make the  Greeks accept a compromise" over the name and the flag of the  Macedonian Republic, he added.    Greece has refused to recognize Macedonia's independence and  establish relations as long as the republic keeps its current  name and flag, which includes symbols claimed by the Greek  people.</p>

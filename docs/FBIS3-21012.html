Hopmann from DASA [Deutsche Aerospace </F> AG]: "Ariane-5 Upper Stage AESTUS Engine"]    [Text] Upper stage motors are not as powerful and  impressive as those that propel the lower stages. However, due  to their position closer to the payload, they have to offer  extremely high efficiency and absolute minimum mass.    The AESTUS engine development started with a technological  phase in 1986. The go-ahead for the main industrial development  programme was given in 1989. The AESTUS engine is being  developed by Deutsche Aerospace with support from more than  eight industrial companies throughout Europe.    The AESTUS engine is the key propulsion element of the  Ariane-5 upper stage, which provides thrust and impulse for  payload insertion into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), low  earth orbit (LEO), and sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). During the  mission to GTO it burns nearly 10 tons of the storable  propellant combination monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen  tetroxide.    From the early technological and pre-development activities,  the pressure-fed engine (formerly called "L5", then "L7") has  grown in thrust, operating time and specific impulse. The  latest version, now in its final development stage, produces a  thrust of 28 kN [kilonewton] for a nominal duration of 1100  seconds [s] and it operates with a vacuum specific impulse of  3177 Ns/kg (324 s). The increase of thrust from 20 to 28 kN,  achieved by an increase in dimensions, caused a severe  combustion stability problem during development. Considerable  efforts were spent to solve the problem and the engine has now  successfully passed all stability tests.    All other development targets have been reached and the  formal qualification of the engine is planned for early 1994.  It has been proven that the design is mature and it has  sufficient margin against critical loads or conditions. This  was demonstrated by exploring a much wider test domain (in terms  of mixture ratio and thrust), compared to the operational domain  expected during flight.    The engine is therefore considered to be a highly reliable  workhorse for Ariane-5, offering also growth capabilities for  future versions of the launcher.    Since reliability was one of the most important design  drivers, well-proven design concepts were used. The only  notable exception was the injector, where a novel coaxial  multi-element design was introduced with the aim of achieving  high combustion efficiency, combustion stability, and adequate  thermal conditions for the injector face plate and the  combustion chamber inner wall. The photograph shows the layout  of the engine that consists of the following components:    -- cross-type universal joint    -- multi-element coaxial injector    -- regeneratively-cooled combustion chamber    -- radiation-cooled nozzle extension    -- oxidizer and fuel valve assembly    -- gimballing actuator struts.    The newly developed injector comprises 132 coaxial injection  elements. The fuel enters the injector coming from the cooling  channels of the chamber. It cools the face plate before feeding  each injector and being injected into the chamber. The oxidiser  is distributed to the injection elements via a manifold located  on the rear of the injector base-plate.    The combustion chamber is an integral design, the same as  that developed and used by Deutsche Aerospace for the cryogenic  engines HM7 and HM60 Vulcain. It consists of a stainless steel  inner liner with milled cooling passages and an electrolytically  deposited nickel layer for outer closure. The  regeneratively-cooled nozzle part extends to an area ratio of  10:1. At the interface to the injector, the combustion chamber  is fitted with quarter wave acoustic absorbers. The absorbers  are not required for normal engine operation and not even during  helium-gas ingestion testing, but bomb testing revealed too  small a margin against bomb-triggered combustion instabilities.  This margin could be markedly improved by the introduction of  these absorbers, tuned to the first and second tangential modes  of the chamber. Following are the main design and operation  data of the motor:    -- Length: 2195 mm    -- Nozzle exit diameter: 1263 mm    -- Mass: 111 kg    -- Thrust (N): 27,870    -- Mass flow: 8.772 kg/s    -- Mixture ratio O/F: 2.05    -- Chamber pressure: 10.28 bar    -- Propellant feed pressure: 17.8 bar    -- Nozzle area ratio (aerodyn.): 83.3    -- Vacuum specific impulse: 3176.8 Ns/kg    -- Characteristic velocity: 1684.7 m/s</p>

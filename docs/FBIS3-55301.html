In  1993 as a whole prices of consumer goods and services increased  tenfold.    From 21 through 27 December prices of foods increased by 2.3  percent, nonfood goods by 1.6 percent, and services by 1.7  percent.    The foods that registered the biggest price increases were  eggs -- six percent; fish products -- 3.9 percent; and  vegetables -- 3.6 percent. Tobacco products (0.9 percent),  flour (1.2 percent), and salt (1.3) percent showed the smallest  increases. Sugar prices remained the same, except in in  Yoshkar-Ola, Makhachkala, and Ufa, where the price increased by  4-7 percent.    Prices of meat and meat products and bread and bakery  products increased by 2-2.3 percent on average.    In the period before the new year meat prices increased at  the rate of 3.8 percent in city markets and prices of vegetables  and fruit increased at the rate of 4.8 percent, a higher rate  than in the previous weeks of December.    In December the price of industrial consumer goods increased  by 10.5 percent, but at the end of the month the prices of  cultural and everyday items were hardly rising at all. The  increase in prices of sewn and knitted goods was within the  range of 1.3-2.1 percent over the week.    The increase in prices and tariffs in the sphere of consumer  services was higher than in the case of food and commodities and  was 15.4 percent in December. Against this general background  the rates for notaries' offices' services showed a sharp,  twofold increase, since they depend on the official minimum  level of pay. There was a faster-than-average increase in the  rates for chargeable medical services. For instance, the charge  for an initial consultation at the end of December was more than  2,000 rubles and the charge for a general blood test was 1,233  rubles. Dry cleaning and hairdressing rates increased by 1.2-2.1  percent over the week.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Dockers begin mass claim for unfair dismissal Scores of dockers crowded a hall in Kent yesterday in a mass compensation claim for unfair dismissal. A total of 270 people who worked at the Kent port of Sheerness are involved in one of the biggest cases of its kind in recent years. The workers, who are mostly members of the TGWU general union, say they were unfairly dismissed a year ago after the port was privatised, when the new owners moved to cut wages. About a third are still unemployed. As well as claiming compensation many say they want their former jobs back. More than 100 claimants, including dockers, clerks and security workers, attended the opening day of the tribunal, held in a sports hall in Ashford. Mr John Couch, the workers' solicitor, said before the hearing that their mood was one of anger over the way they had been treated. He added: 'Some had worked at Sheerness for 30 years.' The workers sat on specially built seating listening to the opening address by Mr Alan Hannah, for the port's employers, who told the three tribunal members that this was a 'very unhappy case'. The dockers laughed when Mr Hannah told the tribunal that the employers had not intended to cut wages. Managers had to target high wages and working practices at Sheerness to keep the port viable and improve efficiency, he said. They drew up changes in pay and conditions which were rejected by the union. Mr Hannah said: 'The objective was to make the operation efficient. Old practices were to be looked at, but not at the cost of savage wage cuts or compulsory redundancies among the labour force. That was not the intention.' He admitted the company proposed sweeping changes in pay and conditions but said the syndicate which lent the new owners Pounds 15m could have taken control of the port and made large-scale redundancies if the cuts were not achieved. 'The management's position was desperate. If savings could not be made by agreement wages would have to be reduced unilaterally,' he said. Dockers began a work-to-rule in protest at new contracts but later accepted redundancy, he added. Outside the tribunal dockers said the new management had tried to cut wages by 60 per cent after privatisation. The workers, some of whom are now employed at the port of Sheerness as contractors, could qualify for payments of Pounds 13,000 each if they win their claim. The hearing is scheduled to run until March 28.</p>

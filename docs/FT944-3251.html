			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Albright &amp; Wilson With chemicals companies' profits rising sharply, Tenneco may have chosen a good time to float its Albright &amp; Wilson subsidiary. The company, which could fetch Pounds 600m, has restructured its operations recently, is arguably a low-cost producer and supplies chemicals to the likes of Coca-Cola and Colgate toothpaste. That said, investors' enthusiasm should be tempered. For a start, they should ask why Tenneco has chosen to float Albright instead of selling to a trade buyer  - an option it has sought for at least a decade. The main reason is that the US conglomerate thinks it will receive a better price from a float. But potential investors will wonder why they should pay more than trade buyers are willing to put up. Thinking about the longer term in the notoriously cyclical chemicals industry is sobering. Albright faces questions about one of its most important products  - washing powder phosphates which are banned in many countries. By its own admission, it is also squeezed between much larger suppliers and customers. None of this means that Albright will not thrive as an independent entity; merely that the price must reflect the risks.</p>

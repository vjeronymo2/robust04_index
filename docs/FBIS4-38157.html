			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri  has stated that His Majesty King Husayn's recent visit to  Washington constitutes one of his majesty's most important  visits abroad in terms of timing, content, and results both in  the local and regional arenas. [passage omitted]    In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, al-Masri added  that his majesty believes that cohesion on the internal front,  overcoming economic difficulties, and promoting Jordan's  democratic, economic, and development march cannot be ignored in  any political move and that Israel's recognition of Jordan's  sovereignty over its usurped territories, as well as returning  its full water rights, will be useful for our Arab brothers in  their negotiations on the other tracks. If the Arab rights are  recognized on their tracks--a matter that has taken place on the  Jordanian track--then this principle would apply to other tracks  and all aspects of Arab rights.    He also said that the House of Representatives always  supports any accomplishment and policy that enables Jordan to  restore its rights, promote its development, and achieve the  utmost Arab coordination with the other Arab brothers in order  to reach a concerted comprehensive solution.    Al-Masri added: I understand the extent of doubts and fears  of many of the sons of our people, but stagnation and the lack  of movement in the international arena, as well as allowing  fears and points of weakness to overwhelm confidence and the  points of strength in the Arab Islamic society in Jordan and  abroad, will only lead to more Zionist control of the region and  the international circles. Jordan's move toward negotiations  and peace issues, he added, has not come in a vacuum, has not  been hasty, and will, with God's help and King Husayn's wisdom,  pursue this course to achieve the goals in which our loyal  Jordanians believe and for which they are working.</p>

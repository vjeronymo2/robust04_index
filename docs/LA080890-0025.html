			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND BUCKEY TRIAL ENDS IN DEADLOCK  </P> <P> The McMartin Pre-School molestation case leaves most of us disgusted with our  legal system ("Buckey Jury Deadlocks; Mistrial Is Declared," Part A, July 28).  </P> <P> Everyone involved lost -- parents, defendants and mainly the children.  </P> <P> I personally feel that these children were exploited by being exhibited on the  talk show circuit and news conferences by their publicity hungry parents. This  is child abuse at its lowest level.  </P> <P> How many parents would advertise the molestation of their children on national  TV? Not very many I hope. In fact the majority of the McMartin students were  not allowed to be viewed on the media.The parents of these kids should take a  bow.  </P> <P> JOHN RANKIN  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

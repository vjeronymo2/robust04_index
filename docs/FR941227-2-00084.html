Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background of the Proposed Routine Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past 15 years, the United States (U.S.) has established a network of bilateral Social Security agreements that coordinate the U.S. retirement, survivors and disability insurance (RSDI) program with the comparable programs of other countries. The agreements, commonly known in the U.S. as ``totalization'' agreements, are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act. Currently, the U.S. has totalization agreements in force with 17 countries, including Canada and virtually all of Western Europe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the main purposes of the agreements is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the U.S. and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers may qualify for partial U.S. or foreign benefits based on ``totalized'' (i.e., combined) credits from both countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementing the totalization agreements has required SSA to share certain personal information in its files with counterpart social security agencies in the other countries. Generally, this sharing has been limited to personal information needed to adjudicate claims for benefits under the agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present wording of the four routine uses permits disclosure of personal Social Security records for totalization purposes, which, as discussed above, involves adjudication of claims. Consistent with section 233 of the Social Security Act, the contemplated revision would expand the field of allowable disclosures by permitting disclosure of personal information in SSA's files to a foreign Social Security agency essentially for all SSA and foreign program-related activities in the U.S. or abroad. This will, in addition to the adjudication of claims, include those instances in which SSA and a foreign country have entered into mutual assistance arrangements under a totalization agreement. Under a mutual assistance arrangement, the foreign country would assist SSA generally in the administration of its programs and SSA would provide reciprocal services for the foreign country. This would include post-entitlement reviews and redeterminations, applications for Social Security numbers, program and operational studies, integrity reviews and evaluations, research and statistical studies, and the like. It will also include situations where information from SSA's records is needed by a foreign Social Security agency to implement a provision of an agreement other than adjudicating a claim for benefits. For example, a foreign agency may need information from SSA's records to determine if, under the provisions of an agreement, a person has the right to make voluntary contributions to its Social Security system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revised routine use provides for disclosure: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``To the Social Security agency of a foreign country, to carry out the purpose of an international Social Security agreement entered into between the United States and the other country, pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security Act.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GERRY FAUST FINDS SERENITY AT AKRON;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING TENURE AT NOTRE DAME, THE  COACH DISCOVERS THAT THE CROWDS ARE SMALLER, BUT THE REWARDS ARE GREATER, WITH  THE DIVISION I-A ZIPS.  </P> <P> At Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Coach Gerry Faust and his players drew  thousands of people to home games to watch the nation's most dominant prep  football team play. Later, when Faust was at Notre Dame, a stadium crowd of at  least 59,000 was guaranteed -- regardless of the opponent.  </P> <P> Nowadays Faust is lucky if he can get one-third of the seats filled at the  Rubber Bowl, home to his University of Akron Zips. Although Faust probably  couldn't fill the stadium's 35,000 seats if he gave tickets away, he finally is  finding serenity as a college football coach.  </P> <P> "I have a great group of kids with a super attitude," said Faust, who takes his  Zips (3-2-1) to Annapolis, Md., on Saturday to face the Naval Academy (2-3).  "I'm really enjoying myself now."  </P> <P> The atmosphere surrounding Faust, in his fifth year at Akron, has not always  been pleasant. When he left Moeller after the 1980 season to coach Notre Dame,  Faust was supposed to carry the winning tradition to South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> But by the time he resigned after five years, Faust had the most losses of any  football coach in school history, with a 30-26-1 record. After the Irish lost,  58-7, to Miami in his last game there, a Sports Illustrated article described  Faust as the man who left "Notre Dame's football program . . . in shambles."  </P> <P> "You don't like to read or hear the things you hear about the coaching, but you  have to learn to accept that," Faust said of the media attacks. "I wanted to  win. Not because people were upset. I wanted to do it because I believed in the  university and what it stood for."  </P> <P> What Notre Dame followers could not accept were the two 5-6 seasons under  Faust. In that time Notre Dame lost four straight times to Air Force -- its  only losses to a service academy since dropping a game to Navy in 1963.  </P> <P> Despite his lack of success at Notre Dame, Faust received nine job offers after  he left. He settled on Akron, a Division I-AA school that was looking for a  well-known coach to engineer its transition to Division I-A.  </P> <P> "I looked forward to the challenge," he said. "After taking the job at Notre  Dame, I realized I had a lot to learn. Looking back, I wasn't ready. I know how  to deal with college kids now. Ten years ago, I didn't."  </P> <P> The Zips -- Zippy the kangaroo is the mascot -- are 25-23-2 under Faust. Last  year, in just its third year of I-A ball, Akron had a 6-4-1 record after two  losing seasons.  </P> <P> "We're doing better than we thought we would be doing. We have a long way to  go, but we're pleased with the progress we've made," Faust said. "We eventually  would like to get to the level of the Naval Academy, Syracuse, West Point and  Boston College. The transition to I-A has been really tough."  </P> <P> After coaching at an institution that pretty much sold itself, Faust has had to  become a salesman to attract players.  </P> <P> "We made great strides over the last couple of years, and the enthusiasm is a  lot better in the community," he said. "You have to really work hard to get  kids here, and I'm always out recruiting. But the work is paying off. Our kids  have a great belief in each other."  </P></p>

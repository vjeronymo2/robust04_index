			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: N American setback for Neotronics A sharply lower contribution from its North American gas equipment subsidiary meant pre-tax profits of Neotronics Technology fell from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 509,000 in the six months to March 31. Sales slipped from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 9.85m. Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said some market share had been lost in North America, but measures taken had meant that by the end of March some of this share had been recaptured. German sales had fallen slightly after an exceptionally good first half last time. Earnings per share were 1p lower at 1.38p. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.85p, but Mr Gotley cautioned that the level of the final would be reviewed in the light of the full year results.</p>

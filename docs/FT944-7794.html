			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Designers stress their proletarian credentials Music blared, pretty girls provided decoration, and the covering was slowly removed from a vehicle on an elevated stage. Porsche was unveiling its prototype of the family car its designers hope will capture the hearts of Chinese bureaucrats and consumers, writes Tony Walker. The German sports carmaker could not be accused of under-selling its wares in the competition to participate in China's 'people's car' project. It has developed the prototype C88 (Concept 88 car) especially for the Chinese market, with styling that embraces such features as headlights with oriental characteristics. Porsche - which makes fewer than 20,000 cars a year - was very much the outsider among the world's car giants exhibiting at last week's small-car show in Beijing. The company wants to supply basic design and engineering assistance to a Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on models produced. Its representatives emphasised that Ferdinand Porsche designed and built the first Volkswagen in the mid-1930s - Germany's 'people's car' and the prototype for 21m 'Beetles'. Also trying to persuade the Chinese of the importance of a long track record was Ford Motor Company. It invoked Henry's name and that of the Model-T - the world's first mass-produced vehicle. 'All great endeavours begin with a vision,' said Mr Wayne Booker, Ford's executive vice-president for international operations. 'Ninety-one years ago, Henry Ford had a vision of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people . . . From that beginning Ford has adhered to the vision of serving working people.' It was not clear whether this appeal to the proletarian instincts of Chinese officialdom made much impact. But the announcement by Mercedes-Benz that it was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Pounds 800m) in a new plant producing 250,000 FCC (Family Car China) concept cars a year would have been welcome. Mercedes-Benz's squat, snub-nosed prototype was not the most elegant vehicle on display. But it attracted attention from both Chinese consumers and international competitors, who were curious about the German luxury car producer's ideas of what might sell in a mass market. Mercedes-Benz executives were proud of the FCC's innovative design, which incorporates alternative propulsion options, such as electric or hydrogen drive. They also claimed outstanding fuel efficiency, with the 1.3 litre petrol engine capable of 800km on a single tank. Participants in the show admired the Chinese for enticing the world's top carmakers to Beijing. But there was a hint of exasperation that, because of the huge potential of the China market, the Chinese clearly had the 'upper hand', as one Japanese representative said. 'They are very good merchants,' he said. 'They are taking full advantage of the situation to let us know they are the masters, and that they are calling the shots.' Chinese visitors to the exhibition were mostly 'window-shoppers'. Economic reforms are bringing the possibility of purchasing cars within range of many Chinese, but the price tag on a 'people's car' at this stage would be beyond the means of most. 'You have to be rich to buy a car,' said Miss Shen, who was viewing the Mercedes prototype. 'I'm dreaming of owning a car, but I'll have to wait . . . till next century, perhaps.'</p>

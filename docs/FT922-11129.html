			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / People: Finance directors for BAe and Courtaulds When an executive leaves one company and its stock drops sharply in early trading, and the shares of the company he's moving jump, it is clear the City reckons that person to be an outstanding manager. Richard Lapthorne (right) who, at 49, takes over as British Aerospace's director of finance in July, is well regarded by the chemical industry analysts who have followed his career at Courtaulds, where he has been finance director since 1986. Rating his departure as a loss for Courtaulds, they described him as a first-rate technical accountant who understands the City. Closely engaged in the tax implications involved in splitting Courtaulds into two companies, he has also been heavily involved in the operational aspects of Courtaulds. He is also described as 'lively, ebullient and no retiring violet'. Lapthorne admits that he has little knowledge of his new company; during his interview he had met only members of the board and no line managers. He hopes to bring his experience of tight financial controls and management information systems to BAe, and also 'a hatred of bureaucracy'. Lapthorne says he does not intend to stay behind his desk at BAe's headquarters in the Strand. 'I enjoy flying and plan to see the businesses so I can understand them. I have a lot to learn and want to get to grips with the operational issues rather than staying office-bound and becoming bored out of my mind.' He is replaced at Courtaulds by Michael Pragnell (left), previously in charge of the coatings business. Pragnell has an MBA from Fontainebleau, but has no formal accountancy qualifications. According to Lapthorne, 'Courtaulds has plenty of accountants.' ***** Peter Ryan has been appointed non-executive chairman of TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, replacing Paul Torday who is to concentrate on his duties as group chief executive. Elliott Hirst, md of Oldham Signs, and Gavin Turner, md of Elfab-Hughes, have been appointed to the board; Alex Duma has retired. ***** Michael McLaren has been appointed company secretary of ALPHAMERIC. ***** Alan Lovell, appointed acting chief executive a year ago, has been confirmed as chief executive of CONDER. ***** David Booth has been promoted to finance director of LEX RETAIL GROUP. ***** Andy Proudfoot has been appointed md of Capita Management Consultancy; he moves from KPMG. John Hawkins, previously sales and marketing director of MMC, is appointed marketing director of Telecom Capita. Both companies are part of The CAPITA Group. ***** Richard Fernie is promoted to md of Chubb Electronic Security Products, part of RACAL. ***** William Watson has been appointed company secretary of EUROPEAN COLOUR. ***** Duncan Grier has been promoted to finance director of HOWARD HOLDINGS in place of John Albery who retires in June. ***** Graham Nixon, formerly chief executive, has been appointed executive chairman of FERRY PICKERING GROUP, in place of Peter Wardle who has resigned as non-executive chairman. ***** Bob Scales, md of LMG Fibrenyle, is also appointed md of LAWSON MARDON PLASTICS.</p>

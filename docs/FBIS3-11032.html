The demonstration of community spirit shown by the peasants  did not, however, have President Juan Carlos Wasmosy as a  witness, who early this morning left for Brazil with Bolivian  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to attend the inauguration  of a navigation sluice.    That ceremony was not even attended by Brazilian President  Itamar Franco. Wasmosy's activity was labeled inappropriate and  irresponsible by peasant leaders.    Since last night, the government had ordered strict control  on all roads of all vehicles carrying people to Asuncion. The  National Police and the Highway Patrol even halted trucks at the  toll stations in Coronel Oviedo, Carapegua, Tacuara, and San  Jose de los Arroyos.    The Public Works and Communications Ministry also revived an  old 1948 decree, which was never enforced, that prohibits  carrying people in cargo trucks.    The machinery of that ministry and companies under  government  contracts also obstructed the free movement of vehicles by the  Yhaguy River near Itacurubi de la Cordillera. In this regard,  the alleged participation of the Public Works and Communications  Ministry in the assembly of "tire busters" (nails to flatten  tires) made members of Congress intervene.    The march, without precedent in our country's history,  gathered thousands of peasants from different parts of the  country in front of the Congress building. The largest group  gathered at the Metropolitan Seminary's facilities on Kubitschek  and 25 de Mayo Avenues, from where they left to gather in front  of Congress.    By this paper's publication deadline [ULTIMA HORA is an  afternoon newspaper], no incidents of any kind had been reported  in the country. Strong security was seen mainly in Asuncion and  around Congress.    The police forces were supported by Armed Forces members in  combat uniforms who were located at strategic points.  Helicopters also flew over the city.    The demonstrators came to the city in different kinds of  vehicles in the face of the obstacles created by bus owners. The  peasants' mobilization was supported by high school and  university students and labor unions. The political parties and  movements only made an appeal to their followers to support the  mobilization.    At the same time the mobilization in the capital was taking  place, agricultural organizations closed Highway 6 near  kilometer 143 at the Santa Clara crossing, the highway to  Hernandarias at kilometer 4 (with the support of student  groups), and the road to Villeta. In Carapegua, the peasants who  were forced to get out of trucks decided to block Route 1 for  about two hours. The need to have their demands heard by the  government made many peasants walk 25 km (this happened in the  General Resquin area).</p>

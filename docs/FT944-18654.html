			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Nuclear stance under threat Unions representing nuclear power workers will tomorrow attempt to throw out the report of the party's commission on the environment, which they claim has been 'packed' with supporters of Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. The report states that the party has resolved to phase out nuclear power. But the unions - the AEEU, the GMB and TGWU - say this has not yet been resolved in Labour's forthcoming review of energy policy. The GMB will abstain when the report comes before the conference tomorrow. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, said his union would definitely vote against the report. The TGWU general union will probably vote for the report, arguing that other motions before the conference will qualify the report's anti-nuclear bias.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Retribution When Mr Andreas Papandreou regained power last October, there was some optimism that the new Greek government would take urgent action to correct the country's severe economic imbalances. This hope has evaporated into the Athenian ether. The upheavals surrounding the drachma following the ending of capital controls last week are a symptom of a more widespread Greek crisis. Since his unsuccessful premiership between 1981 and 1989, Mr Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement have toned down left-wing radicalism. Yet they appear as ill-equipped as ever to manage the economy of the poorest and, on many measures, most wayward member of the European Union. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the new economy minister, has given no sign that he will prove better able to master Greece's challenges than his predecessor, the late Mr Giorgos Gennimatas. By freeing capital controls without announcing measures to curb the fast-growing budget deficit, Mr Papantoniou exposed Greece to the risk of instant retribution from the financial markets. The measure, anticipating by six weeks the liberalisation deadline of July 1, looks like a gamble that has failed. The Greek authorities have managed to prop up the drachma with a draconian tightening of short-term interest rates to levels of more than 100 per cent. This has further damaged the outlook for the Greek economy in the coming year. A monetary squeeze of the sort the Bank of Greece has been imposing can at best buy time for stern budgetary action. In the absence of such moves, and in the wake of last week's estimated Dollars 1bn fall in foreign exchange reserves, a decision to let the drachma float down abruptly against the D-Mark could be only a matter of time. A combination of recession, lack of spending controls and large-scale tax evasion may push central government borrowing to 17 per cent of gross domestic product this year, compared with a target of 12.9 per cent. In view of the inertia of Mr Papandreou's administration, it seems unlikely to summon the necessary political will either to increase the efficiency of tax collection or to expand the privatisation programme. The government appears to be banking on extra revenue from EU structural funds later this year to ease the problems caused by revenue shortfalls. However, a country already heavily dependent on EU transfers, and which has antagonised its partners by its intransigence over neighbouring Macedonia, can expect tough treatment from the rest of the EU. Greece's prospective transfer to Germany of the EU's six-monthly presidency should be the signal for a more uncompromising EU line over the chronic divergence of the Greek economy. Disbursement of EU grants for planned infrastructure projects should be made dependent on the Greek government's ability to fulfil rigorous economic targets. Additionally, there can be no question of Brussels discussing any new EU loans to Greece until the Papandreou government has put its house in order. If Greece needs additional external credits which cannot be raised on capital markets, it should turn not to the EU but to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cigna earnings surge in opening quarter CIGNA, the big Philadelphia-based insurer, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 106m in the first three months, compared with Dollars 48m a year ago. The improvement was struck after realised investment gains of Dollars 37m, as against Dollars 8m in the first quarter of 1991. Cigna's chief executive, Mr Wilson Taylor, said that the property-casualty results continued to 'reflect the weak pricing environment', but he added that the employee benefits, and individual life and pensions businesses had all performed well. The property-casualty division reported after-tax profits of Dollars 31m, but only after including realised investment gains of Dollars 21m and Dollars 20m from the sale of Cigna's equity interest in MBIA, the bond insurance business. A year earlier, the company reported break-even figures, but had no net realised gains or losses. The employee life and health benefits division made Dollars 38m after-tax, after including realised investment gains of Dollars 3m. A year ago, the figure was Dollars 19m, with a similar level of investment gains. The employee retirement and savings benefits operation made Dollars 48m, after investment gains of Dollars 4m, compared with Dollars 43m, with no investment gains or losses, a year ago.</p>

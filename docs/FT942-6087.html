			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J shareholders reject rescue Gerald and Vera Weisfeld, the millionaire couple who founded the What Everyone Wants chain, did not get what they wanted yesterday as shareholders in discount retailer Brown &amp; Jackson rejected their rescue plan at an extraordinary meeting in London. The company could now face legal action arising from its decision to recommend a second rescue package in preference to that of the Weisfelds. It was clear from his statement that Mr Weisfeld, who had previously refrained from commenting on the competing rescue offer from South African group Pepkor, was angry. The Weisfelds had offered to inject up to Pounds 28.4m, in return for a 43 per cent stake and two seats on the board. The board of B&amp;J had recommended the Weisfeld's offer, until earlier this month when Pepkor offered an injection of up to Pounds 56.3m for a 63 per cent stake. The company said the Pepkor offer had been preferable as it meant B&amp;J would get a Pounds 20m cash injection immediately. Mr Weisfeld said his efforts to provide a similar immediate injection had been hampered by a lack of financial information from the company. Shareholders representing 58.6 per cent of the votes cast rejected the Weisfeld's offer. An egm will be held on June 3 to vote on the Pepkor proposals.</p>

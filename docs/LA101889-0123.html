			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> BASKETS DISTRIBUTED FOR RECYCLING EFFORT  </P> <P> In preparation for a citywide recycling program to begin at the end of the  month, city officials are distributing more than 7,300 multicolored recycling  containers to residents.  </P> <P> The baskets, which come in three colors and are similar to milk crates, are  being passed out to homeowners at the rate of 500 to 900 a day, city spokesman  Mark Klosterman said.  </P> <P> On Oct. 30, homeowners participating in the volunteer program will sort  recyclables in their homes and leave the baskets curbside for pickup. Aluminum  and plastic containers will be sorted into light blue baskets, glass will be  sorted into dark blue baskets and newspapers will be sorted into white baskets,  Klosterman said.  </P> <P> "The city of Laguna Beach is very conservation oriented and we hope to be one  of the top in the country," Klosterman said. "We're shooting for a minimum of  70% participation."  </P> <P> City staff members have been promoting the new program through mailers, and  have made presentations to schools, community service groups and homeowners  associations, Klosterman said.  </P> <P> In addition, advertisements will be run for the rest of the month in local  newspapers and promotional materials, such as bumper stickers, will be  distributed.

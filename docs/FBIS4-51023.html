			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua  recently pointed out at the closing ceremony of the national  conference of directors of posts and telecommunications bureaus:  The postal and telecommunications services should seize the  present opportunity to improve service and accelerate the  development of telecommunications, while adhering to the  16-character principle of overall planning, regional and  inter-departmental cooperation, designation of responsibility at  various levels, and joint construction.    Zou Jiahua said: The development of transport and  telecommunications will directly promote commodity circulation  and the development of socialist market economy in our country.  The present international environment is favorable to us, we  ourselves have the necessary conditions for development, and  there is an increasing demand for communications service in the  society. So, it is a very good time for us to develop the  postal and telecommunications services. With the concerted  efforts made by the workers and cadres, the postal and  telecommunications department last year invested 40 billion yuan  in fixed assets, increased the capacity of telephone exchanges  by 12.86 million lines, and put into operation eight optical  cables. The achievements were tremendous and exceptional in the  history of the world's telecommunications.    On the 16-character principle, he explained: Overall  planning means that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  should change its past practice, pay more attention to  macroeconomic management of the nation's telecommunications, and  shift its emphasis from microeconomic management to  macroeconomic management of the telecommunications business in  the country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  should seriously formulate a strategic principle, a long-range  development plan, and an annual development plan for the  development of China's telecommunications. On regional and  interdepartmental cooperation, he pointed out: It is necessary  to foster the idea of joint efforts and cooperation; pool the  scientific research forces and the production forces of all  departments, provinces, and cities; and prevent duplicated  construction projects. We should build well a nationwide public  telecommunications network. At the same time, we should also  make the special-purpose telecommunications network play its  role. We should bring into full play the initiative of both the  localities and various departments.    He added: In order to accelerate the development of the  postal and telecommunications services, we should rely on  scientific and technological progresses. In the last few years,  the postal and telecommunications services have taken a greater  stride in using new technology. We have adopted many advanced  telecommunications techniques of the world, such as  program-controlled exchange, optical fiber communications,  satellite communications, and mobile communications. The postal  and telecommunications department should cooperate with other  departments and pool resources in research and development.    He pointed out: While developing itself, the postal and  telecommunications department should improve service and turn  the users' demand into a motive force for it to improve its  work. Instead of treating telecommunications service as a power  in our hands, we should establish the notion of serving the  people and serving the national economy.</p>

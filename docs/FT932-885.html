			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / US bank files Dollars 1.5bn BCCI suit THE global settlement between the liquidators and depositors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) could be placed at risk as a result of the a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) law suit against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the leader of Abu Dhabi. The suit, filed in a US court by First American Bank, secretly and illegally acquired by BCCI, alleges that Sheikh Zayed, his family and senior former First American officials such as Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary, were guilty of racketeering, conspiracy and fraud. Mr Clifford was indicted last year in New York on charges of accepting bribes and lying to US bank regulators. The suit says the Abu Dhabi ruler and his government were to blame for financial damage caused by the BCCI affair because he was 'the dominant and controlling shareholder' of BCCI since 1972. Specifically, it says Sheikh Zayed and his colleagues were responsible for reducing First American's sales value by Dollars 500m and caused a loss of Dollars 1bn of deposits. In Washington, Mr Caffey Norman, a lawyer for Sheikh Zayed, denied the allegation and said he was 'outraged' and would contest the charges. This is the first such legal action against the ruler of Abu Dhabi, whose government has repeatedly denied any guilt in the BCCI affair. It comes amid mounting speculation in the US that either federal prosecutors or Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, may be planning to indict Abu Dhabi officials. The suit could have wide-ranging implications because it is a rare US legal action against a foreign head of state and because it could derail the planned settlement for BCCI depositors agreed last year by liquidators and Sheikh Zayed's government. In Cairo, Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI depositors committee, said he supported the legal action and would ask BCCI liquidators to reconsider the deal they agreed last year with Abu Dhabi in light of the lawsuit.</p>

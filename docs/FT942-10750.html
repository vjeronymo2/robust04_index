			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Helicopter group forecasts big fall in losses this year Eurocopter, the Franco-German helicopter company, hopes to reduce its losses significantly this year after a very difficult year in 1993, according to Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, chairman. Mr Bigay said that Eurocopter - which is 70 per cent owned by Aerospatiale, the French aerospace group, and 30 per cent by Deutsche Aerospace, its German counterpart - sustained a net loss of between FFr350m and FFr400m (Dollars 61m - Dollars 70m) on turnover of around FFr10bn in 1993, the worst year for the helicopter industry since the 1960s. He predicted that the middle to late 1990s would be a 'critical period' for the company, which was created in 1991. However, Mr Bigay said that Eurocopter had already started to recover from its difficulties in 1993 and hoped it would halve its net loss this year. The industry suffered last year from the economic recession, which triggered a substantial reduction in orders for helicopters for civil purposes, and from significant cutbacks in government expenditure. Demand was also affected by the problems of the oil industry which, has been one of the main markets. The recent fall in the oil price has forced many oil groups to cut down on orders for new helicopters for use on off-shore rigs. Eurocopter estimated that the number of helicopters sold last year was roughly half that of the 1,000 sold in each of the previous 10 years. Mr Bigay said demand does not appear to have improved so far in 1994. The Franco-German company also claims that it is more vulnerable to downturns in demand than its US competitors - Sikorsky and Bell - because it does not have the benefit of a strong domestic market. However, Eurocopter does have high hopes for the long-term potential of the NH90, a new helicopter being developed on a pan-European basis.</p>

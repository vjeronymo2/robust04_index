			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Bundesbank debates new rate cut: Half-point reduction will be on policymakers' agenda today despite inflation fears THE Bundesbank will today discuss a further 0.5 percentage point cut in Germany's leading interest rates against a tense background of deepening recession in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Today's discussion follows the weekend meeting in London of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries at which Germany's trading partners said they would like an early cut in German rates. The Frankfurt-based directorate of Germany's central bank is understood to have put the interest rate cut issue on the agenda for today's regular council meeting at which it will be joined by the heads of the regional central banks, who are the main source of pressure for reductions. Expectations about today's meeting have seesawed since the G7 meeting. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, initially fuelled hopes of lower official rates by predicting a slight easing of German money market rates this week. But the Bundesbank's subsequent money market operations have suggested no change. Some economists have warned that the Bundesbank may not act because of continuing fears about inflation. Until yesterday there had been no sign of the turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism which prompted surprise cuts in the discount rate and the internationally important Lombard rate to 8 per cent and 9 per cent respectively a month ago. However, in addition to calls from Germany's partners for a further cut in interest rates to pull Europe out of recession and boost the world economy, German domestic factors have come increasingly into play. This week's industrial production statistics showed output in December and January almost 7 per cent down on a year earlier. These figures, Deutsche Bank's new forecast that the economy is heading for a crash-landing, and a warning yesterday from Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of Volkswagen, that he was braced for a 'long, massive recession', will tend to weight the opinions of regional heads in favour of cuts. However, economists warned that over-reaction - especially in the wake of last month's abrupt rate reduction - could damage the bank's credibility and its reputation for guiding events rather than being guided by them. Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, admitted that the rate of decline in industrial output was unprecedented compared with previous recessions. However, manufacturing accounted for only a third of gross national product, he said. He still believed there was a better than 50 per cent chance of recovery starting this year, based on service industries' growth and the prospect of rising exports. 'A cut tomorrow could be viewed as giving way to panic in industry,' he said. Exchange markets had settled now that the downward direction of the Bundesbank's rates policy was clear. It was probably not necessary for it to use up more ammunition at present. If further turbulence could be avoided, there was a 'marvellous opportunity . . . to generate real confidence' after the French elections this month. The leaders of Germany's three-party coalition agreed to boost petrol and diesel taxes from next year to raise revenue for a planned railway reform, Chancellory Minister Friedrich Bohl said, Reuter reports from Bonn. He said early today that it had been agreed to seek a motorway user fee along with the tax increase to raise about DM8bn in annual revenues as of next year. Coalition leaders had settled on a fuel tax rise of 13 pfennigs per litre starting in 1994, he said. Currencies, Page 31 World stocks, Page 37</p>

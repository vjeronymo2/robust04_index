			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO RESTORE ANTI-BIAS LAWS MAY FACE VETO  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Wednesday that he would oppose this year's  major piece of civil rights legislation, even as President Bush praised Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. and pledged "to live up to the highest ideals of the  civil rights movement."  </P> <P> Thornburgh said he will recommend vetoing a bill that would overturn five  Supreme Court decisions limiting protections against job discrimination. The  Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee handily approved the bill as  Thornburgh's letter was released.  </P> <P> Passage of the bill, which would make it far easier for civil rights plaintiffs  to win job discrimination lawsuits, has been the civil rights movement's  highest legislative priority for a year.  </P> <P> In a letter to Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),  Thornburgh said: "The Administration opposes as inconsistent with equal  opportunity any legislation that would encourage quota systems or otherwise  divide our society along racial lines." Supporters of the bill deny that it  would encourage quotas.  </P> <P> Bush sidestepped the issue in his speech to the Joint Center for Political and  Economic Studies. He pledged to "fight against poverty and for opportunity" and  to "use this office -- this bully pulpit -- to condemn, in the strongest terms,  racism, bigotry and hate."  </P> <P> In raising the veto possibility, Thornburgh noted that the Administration has  proposed legislation to overturn two of the five rulings. He said it "is  determined to help root out racial bias and bigotry and to guarantee equal  opportunities for all Americans."  </P> <P> It is the other three rulings on which the Administration and the Senate bill  are at odds. The three, which were decided on 5-4 votes at the end of the  1988-89 Supreme Court term, held that:  </P> <P>  -- In cases of alleged employment discrimination, employers no longer have to  demonstrate that apparently discriminatory hiring and promotion practices are  essential to corporate success. Last year's court decision in Ward's Cove  Packing Co. vs. Antonio shifted the burden of proof to employees who charge  that they were victims of discrimination. The Kennedy bill would shift the  burden of proof back to employers.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said that, without establishing a link between specific employment  practices and a resulting discriminatory impact, "employers could be found  liable for the numerous innocent factors that can cause statistical imbalance  in the composition of a work force."  </P> <P>  -- Managers may include race or sex as a reason for denying an employee a  promotion if they also give other, legitimate reasons for their decision,  according to the court's ruling in Price-Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. The Kennedy  bill says that the employer is guilty of illegal discrimination if race or sex  was one reason for denying a promotion.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said that this would penalize employers in cases in which race or  sex was "a motivating factor" in employment decisions, regardless of whether  the same decisions would have been made anyway.  </P> <P> "Allowing recovery based on an employer's state of mind is contrary not only to  the spirit of Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) but to the spirit of  our legal system as well," he said in his letter to Kennedy.  </P> <P>  -- White employees, according to the ruling in Martin vs. Wilks, may now  challenge court-approved affirmative action plans years after they are adopted.  This decision threatened to unravel hundreds of city and county plans to hire  and promote more minority members. The Kennedy bill would bar new lawsuits if  the white employees knew about affirmative action plans but waited years to  contest them.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said that the court's ruling "may lead to fairer, more carefully  considered and unassailable remedies for discrimination."  </P> <P> The bill's supporters deny that it would compel employers to use quotas for  women and minorities.  </P> <P> The President, in his remarks Wednesday, noted that "prejudice and racial  tensions still exist in America." Bush predicted that "the day will come -- and  it is not far off -- when the legacy of Lincoln will finally be fulfilled at  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- when a black man or woman will sit in the Oval  Office."  </P> <P> "When that day comes, the most remarkable thing about it will be how naturally  it occurs. He or she will be another President, another traveler in the  continuum of freedom, representing all the people of America."  </P> <P> Bush's words did not mollify civil rights leaders, who expressed outrage at  Thornburgh's veto threat.  </P> <P> Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,  an umbrella group of more than 180 organizations, accused the Administration of  deciding "to bow to the right wing of the Republican Party."  </P> <P> After noting that the threatened bill has 40 co-sponsors in the Senate and 164  in the House, Neas predicted that it would be passed with at least 70% support  -- more than enough to override a veto.  </P> <P> The Senate committee approved the measure on an 11-5 vote.  </P> <P> Staff writer William J. Eaton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

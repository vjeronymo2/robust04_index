			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> READERS EXPLAIN UPROAR OVER 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS'  </P> <P> Having been in the eye of the storm, I didn't think it could get more  frightening. I attended the Costa Mesa City Council meeting on Oct. 1 and  discovered I was wrong.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse must not be "punished" in retaliation for the  production of one play out of 26 seasons of art presented to meet the demand  created by the citizens of Costa Mesa. To refuse the Playhouse funds that  otherwise would have been granted is to castigate it for exercising a  constitutional right to free speech. To renege on agreements the city made with  the Playhouse regarding facilities during the weaning process from city funds  can be viewed as nothing short of a cheap attempt to reprimand the Playhouse  for presenting a controversial piece.  </P> <P> I performed in "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." My 11-year-old  son also performed in the production. As some council members said of  themselves, I am not Catholic but I am a Christian. Unlike some others of my  faith, I am not offended by Sister Mary. Quite the contrary, I found it an  excellent opportunity to teach my child that he must ask himself the tough  questions about what he believes. He must never let someone "explain it all"  for him. And when he has asked himself these questions and has drawn his own  conclusions, when someone else challenges those beliefs he will be standing on  solid ground. He will not feel threatened or have to resort to refusing the  right of others to question those beliefs in order to justify his own. It was  also an opportunity to teach him that our government supports freedom of  speech.  </P> <P> We live in a democracy. I doubt there is one of us who agrees with the city's  use of each and every tax dollar we pay. It is the very nature of our  government that a little of what comes out of each citizen's pocket will be put  to use for the majority he is not a part of. I do not feel that the possible 2  cents that may have funded a particular play -- out of the possible $2 that I,  as a single taxpayer, doled out to support all the arts -- is a significant  loss. The quality of living those $2 buy me and the other citizens of Costa  Mesa is well worth the 2 cents "lost" in funding one play, one musical  presentation, one poetic reading or one art exhibit I might find personally  offensive.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa City Council members seem willing to throw the baby out with the  bathwater. Censorship of the Playhouse or a complete end of funding to the arts  seemed to be the only options they would entertain. I cannot express how  disappointed I am in the council members who represent me in Costa Mesa, save  Council Member (Mary) Hornbuckle. She is the only one who seems to have any  perspective whatsoever on the funding of the arts issue. Thank you, Ms.  Hornbuckle, for your voice of reason. I hope, as you discuss these issues with  fellow members in the future, that you can persuade them toward your good  judgment.  </P> <P> As for me, I will continue to voice my support for unrestricted funding of the  arts with city tax dollars. I will vehemently stand against any change in the  city's dealings with Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse in particular. I will continue  to teach my children to question authority and come up with their own answers.  I will use my vote as a 23-year member of the city of Costa Mesa to keep in  office those officials who share a respect for all others, including those who  disagree with his or her own views.  </P> <P> PEPPER HAMILTON RHOADS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

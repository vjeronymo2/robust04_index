			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END OF B OF A'S 'GOLDEN PARACHUTE' PLAN MAY SET TREND  </P> <P> BankAmerica Corp.'s decision to collapse its "golden parachute" plan puts it in  the vanguard of what executive compensation experts and shareholder rights  activists hope will be a movement.  </P> <P> "I think they're on the cutting edge," said John A. Fischer, a principal in the  Los Angeles office of Sibson &amp; Co., a human resources consulting firm.  "We're going to see a lot more sensitivity about executive compensation."  </P> <P> Elimination of the 3 1/2-year-old provision was quietly disclosed last week in  the proxy of San Francisco-based BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America.  According to the document, officers covered by the plan "voluntarily  surrendered their rights to receive benefits under the plan, and the board  terminated the plan."  </P> <P> The golden parachute program, known more technically at BankAmerica as  "change-in-control severance agreement plan," was adopted in August, 1986, when  the institution was drowning in red ink because of bad loans and was under  siege by a hostile suitor, Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. It  provided for payments equal to three times an officer's annual cash  compensation, plus the value of some stock, should the executive be fired or  leave after a change of ownership. BankAmerica Chairman and Chief Executive A.  W. Clausen's cash compensation for 1989 was $1.7 million (including bonuses),  and Vice Chairman Richard M. Rosenberg, who will succeed Clausen as the firm's  top executive next month, earned $1.2 million.  </P> <P> Such programs sprang to life during the 1980s takeover wave and were adopted by  scores of U.S. companies. Shareholders criticized them as costly provisions  that tended to insulate management and dissuade suitors; rank-and-file workers  complained that management could walk away in comfort after a takeover, whereas  they were left hanging out to dry.  </P> <P> Given BankAmerica's dire straits at the time, observers said, the plan was  viewed as necessary to lure talented executives who otherwise saw no incentive  in joining the troubled firm.  </P> <P> Since then, however, BankAmerica has staged an awesome turnaround by trimming  staff and costs and bolstering its California retail banking operations. For  1989, it reported a record profit of $1.1 billion. Management has stabilized. A  spokesman said the golden parachutes were "no longer necessary."  </P> <P> In recent years, "management insulation mechanisms" have increasingly come  under fire, said Donald Crowley, a banking analyst in the San Francisco office  of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a brokerage house. As a result, he added,  shareholders "will view in a positive light" BankAmerica's decision to halt the  program.  </P> <P> A sampling of compensation experts said they did not know of other firms  contemplating the elimination of golden parachutes, but all agreed that  companies would be wise to consider it.  </P> <P> "Institutional investors are increasingly taking the position that they won't  support companies (with those plans)," said Sibson's Fischer.  </P> <P> For example, Del Webb Corp., a Phoenix-based real estate company, is in the  midst of a proxy fight with Webcott Holdings, a Los Angeles limited partnership  formed by a dissident director that is seeking to overturn the firm's executive  golden parachutes and other anti-takeover provisions.  </P> <P> In a recent survey of 500 large companies, Towers Perrin Forster &amp; Crosby,  a New York consulting firm, found that 30% had change-in-control provisions.  But as the takeover climate has cooled in recent months, the firm has seen a  slowing in the rate of adoption of golden parachute plans, according to Michael  J. Halloran, leader of the firm's executive compensation practice.  </P> <P> One compensation consultant said she admires BankAmerica for taking the lead.  "So often, such programs stack up . . . and no one takes a second look," said  Robin A. Ferracone, a vice president of Strategic Compensation Associates, a  Los Angeles consulting firm.  </P></p>

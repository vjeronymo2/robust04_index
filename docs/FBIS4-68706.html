			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov, under rubric "Taxation of the </F> TEK" [Fuel and Energy Complex]: "The Government Has Sped Up the  Oil Excise Tax"]    [Text] The Russian government has introduced a new  system for levying the excise tax on oil. Now the excise tax  will be computed not in percentages of the price, but in  absolute values (the average amount of the excise tax will be  14,750 rubles per ton of oil). The new system was introduced by  the decree entitled "Excise Tax on Oil Produced on the Territory  of the Russian Federation," which was put into the official  delivery system yesterday.    The levying of excise taxes on the sale of oil by the  petroleum and gas associations was introduced as long ago as  September 1992. At that time it was established that the excise  tax is levied in the form of a certain fixed percentage of the  price of the output that has been sold. Such a measure was  completely understandable -- under the conditions of the formal  freeing of the oil prices, the government was attempting to link  the price increases with the budgetary proceeds (by raising the  price, the oil producer automatically increased the payment of  the excise tax). It is noteworthy that, unlike the excise taxes  on ordinary commodities (for example, alcoholic beverages and  tobacco), the Russian excise tax on oil is levied at a different  rate for various petroleum-producing associations: for less  effective producers, the rate of the excise tax is lower than  for the more effective ones. Moreover, a number of associations  operating at a low profit rate are completely freed of having to  pay the excise tax. Thus, realistically speaking, the oil excise  tax is, rather, a kind of variety of differentiated rent -- in  the instructional guide concerning the levying of this excise  tax it is stated outright that the payers of the excise tax are  the producers who are situated in relatively better natural and  economic conditions.    In September 1993 the rates for the excise tax were  increased. However, the principle remained the same -- the  levying of the excise tax in percentages of the price. Now,  however, in conformity with the new decree, the principle has  been changed --it has been decided to levy the excise tax in the  form of a fixed amount, with its monthly indexing in conformity  with the change of the exchange rate of the dollar to the ruble.  For the time being, the rate of the excise tax has been  established in the amount of 14,750 rubles per ton;  simultaneously Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and Mintopenergo  [Ministry of Fuel and Energy] have been instructed, within the  period of one week, to develop new differentiated rates for the  excise tax for individual petroleum and gas producing  enterprises and associations. In addition to petroleum, the  decree also pertains to an excise tax on gas --Gazprom [gas  industry] has been instructed to develop recommendations  concerning the possible increase in the rate for this excise  tax, effective 1 July 1993 (for the time being, it constitutes  15 percent).    One's attention is drawn by the fact that, with the existing  level of the release prices of petroleum, the new principle for  levying the oil excise tax does not increase, but even somewhat  decreases, the payments made by the petroleum enterprises to the  budget. Moreover, the state actually is rejecting the idea of  continuing to augment the budget at the expense of the increase  in oil prices -- inasmuch as the average amount of the payments  becomes independent of the actual price level.    Thus, the new excise tax that is fixed in its absolute  expression enables the authorities to achieve two goals at once.  First, the government demonstrates its concern for the financial  status of the petroleum producing enterprises, enabling them, if  they so desire, to keep more funds at their disposal. Secondly,  the authorities are emphasizing their disinterest in raising  petroleum prices and are deflecting from themselves any  accusations to the effect that the high prices are explained by  the high excise taxes. Thus they are managing to display also  their concern for the consumers of petroleum in the domestic  market.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Evolution of the Russian Excise Tax on Oil                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Time of introduction                  |Average rate of excise tax            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |September 1992                        |18 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |July 1993                             |24 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April 1994                            |14,750 rubles                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

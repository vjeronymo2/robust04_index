			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN SETTLES LIBEL SUIT WITH SOVIETS;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: THE RUSSIAN NEGOTIATORS ADMIT THAT THE CHARGES OF SPYING WERE A  MISUNDERSTANDING, BUSINESSMAN'S LAWYER SAYS.  </P> <P> After years of litigation between a Palo Alto businessman and the Soviet Union,  a settlement was reached on the American's lawsuit charging Moscow with libel  for accusing him of being a spy and breach of contract, it was announced  Monday.  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied," the businessman, Raphael Gregorian, 61, said in a telephone  interview. "It was a mutual decision."  </P> <P> Gregorian's Los Angeles attorney, Gerald L. Kroll, said Soviet negotiators  admitted to "a misunderstanding" in accusing his client of spying. "It's  probably the first time ever the Soviets accused someone of spying and then  admitted it was a misunderstanding," he said.  </P> <P> The international legal tangle was broken 18 months ago when Kroll had a chance  meeting in Los Angeles with Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.  Gerasimov, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> "He suggested steps to take to resolve it," Kroll said.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement, affirmed last week by U.S. District Judge David V.  Kenyon in Los Angeles, were kept confidential. Signing it along with Kroll were  American lawyers representing Medexport, a Soviet government firm.  </P> <P> For years, Gregorian was a welcome figure in Moscow business circles. His  California International Trade Corp. generated $10 million a year in sales  exporting such items as kidney dialysis and heart-lung machines and batteries  for heart pacemakers. Suddenly, in 1984, the Soviets revoked his permit to sell  medical supplies. Shortly afterward, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia printed a  story denouncing Gregorian, accusing him of bribery, smuggling and espionage.  </P> <P> Gregorian maintained his innocence and declared that the article destroyed his  reputation. He claimed the Soviets trumped up espionage charges to avoid paying  him. Then, doing what no one had done before, he sued the Soviet Union in U.S.  courts for libel. He also demanded that the Soviets pay for medical equipment  still in Moscow.  </P> <P> In 1985, Kenyon entered a default judgment against the Soviet Union, awarding  Gregorian total damages of $413,165, consisting of a $250,000 libel award  against Izvestia and $163,165 in breach-of-contract damages.  </P> <P> The Soviets balked, angering Kroll who, in one colorful episode, took custody  of a typewriter at an Izvestia correspondent's Washington home as partial  payment.  </P> <P> Following legal maneuvering, in which the U.S. State Department held that the  Soviet Union was a sovereign power immune from legal action, Kenyon dismissed  the libel award, but ruled in 1987 that the Soviets still owed Gregorian the  $163,165 balance.  </P> <P> Kroll appealed to a federal appellate court, which reversed Kenyon's decision  and sent the case back to the federal judge last year for a new trial. The  settlement precludes a trial.  </P></p>

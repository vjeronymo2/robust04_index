			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Counter sales of medicines jump 14% Sales of over-the-counter medicines increased nearly 14 per cent in value terms last year to Pounds 1.2bn, according to figures today from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the non-prescription medicines trade association. A significant part of the growth, which was nearly 5 per cent in volume terms, was accounted for by the introduction of nicotine patches and the flu epidemic at the end of 1993, said the association. The market for anti-smoking products was worth Pounds 63m last year - an increase of nearly 200 per cent in value terms. Skin treatments were worth Pounds 128m, up 18 per cent in value. Other growth categories included treatments for thrush and cold sores - new to the over-the-counter market. One significant growth area this year is likely to be indigestion remedies. Earlier this month, the decision was taken to licence Tagamet and Pepcid, two powerful indigestion remedies, for OTC sale. They represent the most important extension of the OTC market for more than a decade.</p>

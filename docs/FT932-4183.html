			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Administrators plan quote and rights for Moran MORAN HOLDINGS, the tea producer, freight forwarder and property developer placed into administration last August, yesterday announced plans to be readmitted to the Unlisted Securities Market and launch a Pounds 2.3m rights issue. Mr Ian McIsaac and Mr Tony Houghton of accountants Touche Ross, the joint administrators, said they believed it was the first time that a company had been restructured and refinanced under the administration procedure of English insolvency law without using a company voluntary arrangement. The administrators yesterday applied to the London Stock Exchange for a new quote for the company, and will apply to the High Court to lift the administration order if shareholders approve the restructuring package at an extraordinary general meeting on July 5. Trading in the shares, which were suspended at 33p, is expected to begin on July 7. Shareholders must approve an increase in the company's sharecapital of Pounds 1.65m and loan and underwriting arrangements agreed with Darnforth, a British Virgins Islands-based subsidiary of Volkart Brothers Holding, part of a Swiss commodity group. Shareholders will be offered 2-for-1 rights in 8.9m new shares at 30p each to raise up to Pounds 2.3m. The issue is fully underwritten by Darnforth, which will also provide a secured loan of up to Pounds 1.15m. Unaudited accounts for the six months to December 31 1992 show pre-tax losses of Pounds 398,000 after a non-recurring charge of Pounds 434,600. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 243,000 covers the cost of the administration. The accounts show outstanding litigation against the company from Sissmore, a provider of secretarial and registrar services, for Pounds 690,000 and against Moran India and the Reserve Bank of India in Calcutta.</p>

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposed rule change consists of modifications to NSCC's rules and procedures relating to the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's ACATS to accelerate the time in which accounts are transferred. The proposed rule change is made in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') recently filed proposed rule change to amend NYSE Rule 412 relating to transfers of customer accounts. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a complete description of the NYSE proposed rule change, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34246 (June 22, 1994), 59 FR 33559 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21] (notice of filing of a proposed rule change relating to NYSE's Customer Account Contract Rule and its related interpretations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under NSCC's proposed rule change, NSCC Rule 50, Section 9, will be amended to allow a receiving member one business day after receipt from NSCC of the customer account asset data report to determine whether to accept, to reject, or to request adjustments to the account. Currently, receiving members have two business days to respond after receiving the customer account asset data report. Where Mutual Fund Services eligible book share mutual fund assets are to be transferred, a receiving member again will have one business day instead of two business days after receipt of the customer account asset data report to submit detailed transfer instructions to NSCC. Each business day that the delivering member causes an adjustment to be made to an account will give the receiving member one additional business day to accept, reject, or request adjustments or in the case of mutual funds to submit transfer instructions. Currently, receiving members have two business days after an adjustment. Additionally, the proposed rule change will delete language that treats transfers of accounts containing option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because the changes will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments relating to the proposed rule change have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received by NSCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

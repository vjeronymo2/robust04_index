			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / France is ordered to quit China consulate CHINA has ordered France to close its consulate in Guangzhou in protest at the sale of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft to Taiwan. France, which refuses to confirm the sale, said it regretted the decision. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has always denounced weapons sales to Taipei, threatening the countries supplying them with reprisals. Jiang Enzhu, China's vice-minister of foreign affairs, said the sale had seriously worsened bilateral relations. By insisting on it 'in disregard of the strong objection of the Chinese side, the French government has seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty and security, interfered in China's internal affairs and obstructed and jeopardised China's efforts to achieve peaceful reunification,' Jiang said. 'This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side.' The consulate has been ordered to close within one month, a move which could affect French business interests in the fastest-growing economic region in the world. French companies fear their business in the pipeline, including the supply of Airbus aircraft to Chinese airlines, could be cancelled. The French company with the most to lose is Framatome, now completing its second nuclear power station at Daya Bay. Framatome has been involved in active talks to build two more reactors and Guangdong province may need up to 12 more plants by the year 2010. The value to the French company Dassault of supplying Taiwan with Mirage fighters and over 1,000 missiles is put at Pounds 2.47bn. China's move against French business interests raises questions about whether it will now feel compelled to take steps against the US. To win defence industry votes during the presidential election campaign, Mr George Bush authorised the sale to Taiwan of 150 F-16 jet fighters.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese credit banks report mixed results JAPAN'S three long-term credit banks report that increases in profits from lending operations in the year to end-March, were offset by declines in profits from securities investments and by increased bad debt provisions. Pre-tax parent company results were mixed. At the Industrial Bank of Japan, unconsolidated pre-tax profits fell 2.9 per cent to Y129.1bn (Dollars 1bn). Long Term Credit Bank reported a 7.9 per cent increase to Y101.3bn and Nippon Credit Bank saw a 35.2 per cent rise to Y70.6bn. Profits from lending operations were boosted by the declines in Japanese and overseas interest rates which allowed the banks to widen lending margins. They also tried to increase loans to high-margin borrowers and to companies willing to pay fees for non-loan services. At IBJ, net business profits, a measure of profits from lending operations, rose 76 per cent to Y160.2bn. LTCB reported a 39.7 per cent rise to Y78.0bn. NCB saw net business profits soar 180 cent to Y54bn. These increases are much larger than those recorded earlier this week by Japanese commercial banks because long-term credit banks make long-term loans and so benefit from falling interest rates since their fund-raising costs fall faster than rates charged to borrowers. These large profit increases offset declines in financial investment income caused by the weakness in the Tokyo stock market. All three banks suffered losses on the values of their stock portfolios. By restraining growth in assets, the three banks managed to keep their ratios of capital to assets above the 8 per cent minimum which the Bank for International Settlements will bring into effect next March. IBJ posted a ratio of 8.33 per cent, LTCB 8.27 per cent and NCB 8.32 per cent.</p>

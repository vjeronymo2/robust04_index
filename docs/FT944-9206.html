			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed lifts US short-term rates by 75 basis points The Federal Reserve yesterday raised US short-term interest rates by 75 basis points, the sixth monetary tightening this year, writes Philip Gawith. In a move described by analysts as the most widely expected interest rate increase in history, the Fed lifted the Federal Funds rate to 5.5 per cent, from 4.75 per cent, and the discount rate to 4.75 per cent, from 4 per cent. The dollar gained a pfennig on the news, standing at DM1.5558, from DM1.5445 before the Fed's announcement, at the New York close. Against the yen it had reached Y98.75, from Y98.2. The Fed's move came around 19.30 GMT. Analysts described the dollar's response as fairly muted, reflecting the fact that higher interest rates had already been discounted in the market. The increase was slightly more than traders had expected, with most participants expecting the Federal Funds rate to rise by 50 basis points. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, said the statement which accompanied the move had been entirely non-committal about whether a further tightening of policy could be expected next month. He said there was an 'innuendo' in the decision to raise rates by 75 basis points, which suggested that the Fed might wish to avoid another move in 1994. Futures markets were discounting short-term rates rising to around 6 per cent by the year-end. Although US interest rates have now risen above those in Germany, Mr Weinberg said the problem for the dollar remained huge capital outflows. He said a rally in the dollar required that economic growth slow below 3 per cent, and that there be no signs of inflationary pressure. This combination, he added, did not look to be at hand. 'We are at least a quarter or more away from any possible remission period for the dollar.' As to the short-term outlook. looking back at previous Fed tightenings this year, Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI in London, noted that Dollars /DM typically jumps 0.75 to 1 pfennig on the news, but subsequently surrenders these gains within three days. The Irish punt has shown some weakness in recent days, as uncertainty about the survival of the ruling coalition has raised the prospect of an early general election. The punt closed at IPounds 1.0187 against sterling, from IPounds 1.0189. For the past few months it had traded in the IPounds 1.01 to IPounds 1.013 range. But Mr Jim Power, senior economist at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, said concerns about political instability were 'totally overdone'. Although elections were by no means assured, Mr Power said that even if there were to be a new government, 'we can be guaranteed that economic policy will be virtually identical to what we have had so far'. He said no politician would have the nerve to challenge the economic policy consensus, which was 'largely dictated by the Maastricht convergence criteria'. Although the punt and sterling track each other closely, Mr Power said the recent decline in sterling had not been a factor in the weaker punt. Rather, this reflected the political uncertainty, and the fact that interest rate differentials across the yield curve had moved too much in favour of sterling. The Swedish krona slipped back towards the level it was at before the Sunday referendum, which voted in favour of joining the EU. After rising towards SKr4.65, from SKr4.75, against the D-Mark in the first bout of post-election, the krona has since given back most of its gains. It closed in London at SKr4.736, from SKr4.712. The French franc recovered some of its recent loss to end at FFr3.437/D-Mark from FFr3.440. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said recent franc weakness, on alleged uncertainty surrounding next year's presidential elections, had been exaggerated. 'Even a Delors victory does not have much policy implication,' said Mr Barr. From a financial market perspective, he said, there was little to choose between the likely candidates. In its daily activities the Bank of England cleared, at established rates, a Pounds 500m shortage in UK money markets. Overnight money traded between 3 3/4 and 5 per cent. Sterling weakened slightly against the D-Mark and the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.5826, from Dollars 1.5849 against the latter. It has now fallen nearly 4 per cent from a high around Dollars 1.64 at the beginning of the month.</p>

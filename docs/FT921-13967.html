			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Institutional holders seek to oust Cityvision board THREE institutional share-holders in Cityvision, the video rental chain, have called for an extraordinary general meeting to oust the current management and replace it with a team led by two of the company's former executives. The shareholders, Fidelity Investments, US-based Alliance Capital and Postel  -the UK's largest pension fund - hold approximately 16.8 per cent of Cityvision's shares. Companies are required to hold an EGM if those holding a minimum of 10 per cent of shares ask for one. Cityvision is facing a Pounds 75m agreed bid from US-based Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation which some shareholders say does not fairly reflect the value of the company's franchise. Some were also angered by directors' move to improve their severance terms around the time they were discussing the friendly bid. Yesterday, Cityvision's directors urged shareholders to ignore a circular by the two former executives, Mr Phillip Crane and Mr Ray Hipkin who have the backing of the three institutional investors. Cityvision said that the two 'are offering shareholders nothing' and that by the time an EGM could be called, the Blockbuster offer was likely to have become effective. The company also said that it had issued legal proceedings against Mr Hipkin after he resigned in 1988. Yesterday, Cityvision shares closed at 51p, some 3p below the weighted value of the cash and shares offer. See Lex</p>

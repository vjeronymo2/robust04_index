			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: NURSERY WALKS LET TODDLERS GET IN STEP WITH NATURE  </P> <P> The docents at Nursery Nature Walks, who lead family walks at 31 Southern  California sites, like to get their charges off on the right foot -- well  before that foot can even walk. "We like to start them on walks right after  birth," director Judy Burns says. "Kids who start the walks right after they're  born are so sensitive to nature. When they start talking, they say all the  names of plants."  </P> <P> Geared for families with preschool children (although older siblings are  encouraged to come along), the walks usually are two hours long and paced for  beginning walkers. Most of the sites are stroller-accessible. Participation is  not limited to parents and their children; grandparents, aunts and uncles --  anyone with a preschooler in tow -- is welcome.  </P> <P> "There's lots of touching and feeling and smelling" along the path, Burns says.  "They look under things and then put back the rock homes. The docents talk  about what grows where and about Indian life."  </P> <P> The program began four years ago under the sponsorship of the Palisades-Malibu  YMCA with walks in the Santa Monica Mountains. Now, as the program has  attracted 80 volunteers from different areas, walks are offered from Orange  County to San Gabriel to Ventura. Sites include Will Rogers State Historic  Park, Arroyo Seco, Charmlee Park, Chatsworth Park South, Griffith Park,  Chantree Flats and Almansor Park. Most walks are limited to 10 families and  reservations are required. One to two weeks advance reservations are necessary  for most walks, longer for the most popular outings such as the one at  Placerita State Park.  </P> <P> Spaces still are available for walks May 13 and 20 at Topanga State Park, May  14 at El Dorado Park (Long Beach), May 21 at Malibu Creek State Park and May 27  for Almansor Park duck pond.  </P> <P> Donations are requested for walks ($3 per family). For reservations or to be  put on the mailing list of upcoming walks, call (213) 454-5591.  </P></p>

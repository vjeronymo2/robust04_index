			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NET LOSS? During Charles Keating's 33-day stay in Los Angeles County Jail, he  lost 20% of his net worth. . . . Along with the shirt off his back and the rest  of the clothes he came in with -- which the Sheriff's Department misplaced --  the former head of Irvine's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan had $25 in his wallet  when he arrived -- but only $20 when he left. . . . No word from Keating on  where the money went. Dan Weikel and Kris Lindgren  </P></p>

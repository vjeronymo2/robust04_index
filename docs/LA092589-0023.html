			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Singer-actor Pat Boone is expected to have his broken jaw set today) at UCLA  Medical Center, where he was being treated for a bad fall from his bicycle.  Boone, 55, was injured about 7:35 p.m. Saturday when the front wheel of his  bicycle became caught in a steel grating on a Beverly Hills street, not far  from his home, police said. "He flipped head first over the handle bars,  breaking his jaw and suffering lacerations," said Beverly Hills Police Lt.  Miles Lee. He was transported by paramedics to UCLA Medical Center. Hospital  spokesman Richard Elbaum said Boone was in good condition Sunday and would  likely be released from the hospital early in the week. "He's walking around  and the nurses tell me he's doing really well," Elbaum said. The entertainer is  a born-again Christian whose fortunes have risen and fallen with the changing  times. During the 1950s, when ballads were popular, he recorded several hits,  including, "Love Letters in the Sand," "Friendly Persuasion" and "April Love."  Claudia Puig  </P></p>

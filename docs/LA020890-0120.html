			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTER LIKES BLOCKS MORE THAN SHOTS;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: LOYOLA'S TRICIA GIBSON IS TIED FOR THE LEAD IN BLOCKED SHOTS IN THE  WCC.  </P> <P> Like a hawk seeking prey, Tricia Gibson of Loyola Marymount roamed the shiny  Gersten Pavilion court, arms high to block a three-point shot that could cost  her team the game.  </P> <P> With about two seconds left a Portland player tried to get one off. Gibson's  right hand swatted the ball to the floor, and Loyola escaped with a 64-62 win.  </P> <P> The feat was nothing unusual for the 6-foot-3 junior. It was another shot  rejection for the co-leading shot blocker in the West Coast Conference. Gibson  led the conference in blocked shots until last weekend when San Diego freshman  Chris Enger tied her average.  </P> <P> "Of all the big kids I've seen since I've been here," said seventh-yearCoach  Ron Fortner at rival Pepperdine, "I've never seen one that good at Loyola. She  gives Loyola something it never had before, good strength in the middle."  </P> <P> Fortner, one of those who recruited Gibson out of La Mirada High, says he  thought she'd be a solid Division I basketball player, but he never expected  her to do this well.  </P> <P> "I knew she had potential to be pretty good," he said, "but to be honest with  you, defensively she's much more effective than I thought she was going to be  out of high school. She's definitely one of the best big kids in the  conference."  </P> <P> Gibson, 20, is a consistent scorer and strong rebounder, although her specialty  is keeping opponents' shots from going through the hoop. She's eighth in the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. with 66 blocked shots, one more than her  total last year.  </P> <P> Defense is undoubtedly Gibson's forte. Appropriately, she's featured on the  cover of the first-ever Loyola women's basketball media guide blocking a shot.  </P> <P> "I'm more inclined to go 100% on defense than on offense," Gibson said; "I know  that if I don't play defense we're in trouble, but if I don't play offense the  other girls will take up the slack.  </P> <P> "Scoring is not my role. I get yelled at in practice for not shooting, but I'd  rather give the ball to Kristen (Bruich) or Lynn (Flanagan) than shoot it. It  just doesn't bother me not to score."  </P> <P> Loyola Coach Todd Corman believes that's unusual for a big player. He says they  normally want to score big numbers.  </P> <P> "She really likes playing defense," Corman said, "and she's outstanding. She's  a real presence in the middle for us. She's the most intimidating defensive  player we have."  </P> <P> She's also one of the most versatile. Gibson is Loyola's best rebounder (6.9 a  game) and the league's most accurate shooter (56%). Her 10.0 average is third  on the team behind guards Bruich (15.0) and Flanagan (13.0).  </P> <P> Last year she was the nation's 20th leading shot blocker at 65 and third on the  team in both scoring and rebounding. She was also an all-league selection on a  Loyola team that posted the school's best record (17-11, 9-5), good enough to  finish third among eight teams in the West Coast Conference.  </P> <P> Not bad considering Gibson was hampered by a knee injury from a pickup game  before the season started. She had arthroscopic surgery in May, 1989, and spent  six weeks in rehabilitation with Bruich, who had the same surgery on the same  knee.  </P> <P> Both players sat through preseason conditioning workouts, but were back for the  first official day of practice in mid-Oct.  </P> <P> "I played in pain," Gibson recalled while looking at the scars on her right  knee. "My knee would get stuck and towards the end it was real painful. I think  I could have played about 25% better if it wasn't hurt."  </P> <P> But that wasn't Gibson's only injury last season. Bruich, also her roommate,  elbowed her while chasing a loose ball against Portland. The wound required  seven stitches above the left eye. Shortly after that Gibson sprained two  fingers during practice.  </P> <P> "For our next game I had tape on my eye, my fingers and my knee," Gibson said  laughing. "Someone asked me if I had been in a car accident. It looked that  way."  </P> <P> This season appears to be healthier, although flu caused Gibson to lose 13  pounds in December and a sprained lower back muscle kept her out of practice  three days last week.  </P> <P> She is, however, prepared for this weekend's home matchups against the two best  teams in the WCC, the University of San Francisco and St. Mary's. Both are 6-1  in league.  </P> <P> The Lions, who defeated San Francisco 72-67 on the road last Saturday, are only  1 1/2 games out of first place in the WCC with a 5-3 mark (12-10 overall).  </P> <P> "I just want us to succeed as a team," Gibson said. "I don't care about  individual stats. I want the team to do well. I guess I'm a different kind of  player. I don't even read the sports page, and once the game is over that's it.  I don't talk about it."  </P> <P> Despite Gibson's there's-more-to-life-than-sports approach, she's always given  athletics enough to succeed. At La Mirada she was a Times basketball all-star  in 1987, and also was a standout in volleyball.  </P> <P> As a senior she was the Suburban League Most Valuable Player in both sports.  Gibson was also a two-time all league middle blocker and center. She averaged  20 points a game as a senior and was recruited to play basketball by Loyola,  Weber State, Pepperdine and Utah. She narrowed her choices to Pepperdine and  Loyola because she didn't want to leave the state.  </P> <P> "Tricia was, without any doubt, the best post player we've had here," said La  Mirada Coach Lyle Lewinson. "And she was very coachable. She would adapt to  whatever we told her."  </P> <P> And at Loyola she adjusted, giving up the glory of scoring to become a  defensive specialist. She says she likes change. Once she obtains a degree in  liberal studies, Gibson plans to become a third-grade teacher, then an athletic  director.  </P> <P> Until the end of next season, however, she'll continue to feed a voracious  appetite for blocking shots.  </P></p>

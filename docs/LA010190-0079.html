			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SITTING IT OUT: Those wanting to cheer on Orange County entries in today's Rose  Parade will be disappointed. . . . Despite a history of entries that extends,  with lapses, back to 1917 when Santa Ana first entered, there will be no float  from here this year. . . . "We're cutting back on all the frills," a Santa Ana  City Hall spokesman explained. Instead, the city will be represented by the  Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, appearing 110th in the line of march.

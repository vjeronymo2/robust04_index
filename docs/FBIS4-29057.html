			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The government should  increase its investment in public-sector construction projects  by an average 7.1 percent every year through fiscal 2000 to  maintain an annual economic growth rate of 2 to 3.5 percent  until 2010, a government study group said Tuesday [14 June].    The group, formed by the Construction Ministry to estimate  mid- and long-term construction investment by the public sector,  said that spending by the private sector on building plants,  offices and shops will remain weak until at least fiscal 2000.    Private-sector firms are taking time to adjust inventories  accumulated during the "bubble economy" era of the late 1980's,  it said, adding public-sector investment will be a key factor to  sustain Japan's economic growth. It said the 7.1 percent  desired increase is calculated based on an assumption that Japan  wants to maintain an annual 3 to 3.5 percent economic growth in  real terms through the 2000 business year, which ends March 2001.    Should Japan want to maintain the economic growth for 10  years from the 2001 business year at a pace between 2.6 and 2.9  percent, the government will find it necessary to increase its  construction investment by an average 2.7 percent every year,  the group added. The rate can be lower than for earlier years  because private-sector investment will have recovered by then,  it said. If the government increased such investment at lower  paces, the economic growth target will not be sustainable, the  group added.    With public-sector spending on construction projects boosted  to the recommended rates in those periods, the scale of Japan's  construction market, including housing, private-sector business  facilities and public-sector construction projects, will reach  about 870 trillion yen for the decade through the 2000 business  year. The scale will then reach to about 1,180 trillion yen for  the next decade, it said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- The government has  decided to collect rents for U.S. Embassy buildings here in  Seoul retroactively to the past five years and in the future and  inform shortly the U.S. Government of the decision, a Foreign  Ministry official said over the weekend. He added the  government would start negotiations with the U.S. Government on  the matter during next week, if things go smoothly.    The Board of Audit and Inspection noted last July that the  U.S. Government had not paid rents for its embassy buildings for  the past 13 years without any legal basis.    The government has concluded that it is reasonable to  collect  retroactive rents for the past five years and continue to  collect new rents in the future, the official said.    The government will also request that the U.S. Government  move the embassy to the old site of Kyonggi Girls High School as  soon as possible, he added. The rents are estimated at about  500 million won a year. The U.S. Government is expected to  claim the right to use the buildings free of rents.</p>

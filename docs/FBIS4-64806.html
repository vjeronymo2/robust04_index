			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khristos Papadhias] </F>   [Text] The Palestinians have asked to be trained in Cyprus  and then join the police force of the new Palestinian state that  will cover the Gaza Strip following the signing of the  Israeli-Palestinian agreement.    The Palestine Liberation Organization has asked the Republic  of Cyprus officially, through diplomatic channels, whether it is  possible for the Police Academy to train 500 Palestinian  citizens every year as police constables or officers.    According to our information, the Ministry of Justice and  Public Order is considering the issue but has not given any  answer. The Palestinian State will cover in full the cost for  the training and maintenance of the Palestinian cadets at the  Police Academy.    The PLO has also submitted a similar request for the  training  of policemen to Greece, where there is also a school for police  inspectors.    The request by foreigners to attend the Cyprus Police  Academy  proves that the level of the academy's three-year educational  and professional training is very high and recognized  internationally.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Letter: About face on the ERM and the singular generosity of Britain's chancellor Sir, Your review, 'What the economists have to say now' (September 18), highlighted a shameful about-face by people who really ought to know better. Only two or three had a proper sense of perspective. Euro-sceptics have the excuse of having opposed consistently ERM membership. Politicians may be expected to jump ship and take opportunistic advantage of changing circumstances. Most economists, however, and a large part of the media, cannot claim such immunity. They hailed ERM membership in 1990 as necessary, long-overdue, the only route to stable growth and low inflation etc, and many persisted with the 'stick with it' view right up to the government's decision to suspend membership. Now that sterling has devalued, lo and behold, these same voices can be heard saying that the UK should stay out of the ERM. Doubtless, some have assumed that the ERM will break down completely and that the UK should fend for itself. We concede that German unification has changed Europe to a degree unimaginable in 1990 and financial markets have been reacting violently to suppressed pressures. Had the German government not relied on massive borrowing to finance unification and had other European governments adopted a more flexible approach to exchange rate management, these pressures may have been released without the crisis that has erupted this summer. So much for the past. Now that sterling (and the lira) are outside the ERM, it is vital that it should rejoin a reconstituted ERM. The UK could stay out for a while longer, awaiting further falls in German interest rates. It seems to us, though, that these will now come much more quickly than expected, having regard for the crisis itself and Germany's gathering recessionary forces. It may, therefore, take rather longer to secure the next 2 to 3 per cent reduction in UK rates than under a free float - but to do so under a float is short-termism and myopic. After the crisis is over, Europeans will try again to find the means to integrate (albeit different from the Maastricht economic blueprint), the EMS will still be there, the US dollar will not reel because of sharp US rate cuts and a UK and European economic recovery is bound to happen eventually. Under these circumstances, the economic and political arguments for UK membership of the ERM will be as strong as they ever were in the 1980s. An independent Bank of England would help too. We are not saying the UK should re-enter immediately - merely that long-term UK interests are still best served inside the ERM and that the UK should do so in the context of decisions made on a wider European basis. Whatever rate is chosen at the time, this policy is the only one that will cement lower inflation. We may yet be surprised by the speed of change in Europe's interest rate environment in the months to come - and perhaps in economists' views about the ERM again] George Magnus, John Shepperd, S G Warburg Securities, 1 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PA</p>

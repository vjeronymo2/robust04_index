			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has stressed that  the Israeli military escalation in south Lebanon is aimed at  diverting attention from the main objective of the peace  negotiations to discussions on security. He said in a press  meeting this afternoon that Lebanon must not yield to this or  accept the replacement of basic and substantive issues by  security proposals.    Concerning relations between Israel and the Vatican, Buwayz  hoped they would remain within the context of urging and  pressuring Israel into implementing international resolutions  and complying with the peace principles drafted in Madrid.

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THERE'S NO PRIVACY IN WORLD OF ADVERTISING  </P> <P> The medium is the message. Or: Advertising at your convenience.  </P> <P> Think of it. A captive audience. Attention focused straight ahead. Eager for  reading material.  </P> <P> A perfect way to hit your target (audience). A wonderful chance to expose your  client.  </P> <P> It's here: eye-level advertising at urinals, and on the inside of toilet-stall  doors.  </P> <P> Maxwell Media Inc., a new ad agency in Mira Mesa, is trying to tap the  heretofore untapped water closet market.  </P> <P> It's called "Stall Tactics." You peddle while they piddle.  </P> <P> "It's a natural place for advertising," explained co-owner Sandra Maxwell. "You  can count on having people's attention anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute.  You can do a lot of selling in that time."  </P> <P> This being San Diego County, naturally, the desired market is the upscale,  car-buying, real-estate-buying, gadget-buying crowd, male and female.  </P> <P> The trick is to match the right product with the right lookie-loo.  </P> <P> It's called selective demographics. Restaurants and nightspots are the  locations of choice.  </P> <P> Thusly, beach apparel/surf gear at Club Diego in Pacific Beach, a Lexus car  dealership at Paparazzi in La Jolla, cellular phones at Epazote's in Del Mar, a  foreign car repair shop at the Triton in Cardiff.  </P> <P> Also, spread out in North County: Samsonite, Merrill Lynch, Dow Corning and  Budweiser.  </P> <P> (All you wise guys can forget it. There are no plans to put bail bond ads in  biker bars or rolling paper ads in reggae hangouts.)  </P> <P> The ads are a Midwestern idea (Maxwell and her husband, Tom, are from  Minneapolis) that has only recently migrated to Southern California.  </P> <P> The ads are letter size (8 1/2-by-11), full-color and sealed behind glass. Four  to six ads per space; market surveys say the more ads, the more likely that  people will retain the pitch.  </P> <P> Word of the restroom ads was relayed by a tipster who saw them at Cilantro's in  Rancho Santa Fe.  </P> <P> A real stand-up guy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gone, Like the Old West  </P> <P> Mobley Meadows Milam is looking for a few good guns: family six-shooters stolen  from his Sunset Cliffs home in a recent burglary.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old attorney and former federal prosecutor hopes a pawnbroker or  swap meet devotee will notice the historic pieces: a Civil War-era Remington  (serial No. 86543) and a turn-of-the-century Smith &amp; Wesson (serial No.  B-178470).  </P> <P> The Remington was owned by Milam's great-grandfather John Meadows (1828-1882),  teacher, preacher, wagon-trail boss and sheriff of Tulare County.  </P> <P> The Smith &amp; Wesson belonged to Milam's grandfather Mobley Meadows  (1875-1915), the legendary sheriff of Imperial County whose statue still graces  the county fairgrounds outside El Centro.  </P> <P> "I'll probably get around $1,000 from the insurance company, but I'd much  rather have the guns back," Milam said.  </P> <P> Luckily, the thief missed some heirlooms. Like the (supposed) scalp of the  Indian who killed John Meadows in the Arizona uprising known as Meadows'  Massacre.  </P> <P> "Thank God the burglar didn't get that," Milam said.  </P> <P> I went out to take a look. He wasn't kidding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Betting Everything to Win  </P> <P> Words, words, words.  </P> <P> * How eager are the Japanese to win the America's Cup?  </P> <P> Banner at the base camp in Tokyo of Nippon, the 12-meter yacht that 30 Japanese  companies are preparing for the 1992 race off San Diego: "There Is No Second."  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "I'm a Lover, Fighter and Wild Bull Rider."  </P> <P> * Headline in the San Francisco Chronicle assessing Pete Wilson's image  problem: "Not Just a Bland White Guy."  </P> <P> * The first Coronado Eagle, a new twice-monthly newspaper, hits the stands  today. It's the work of Dean Eckenroth, former publisher of the Coronado  Journal.  </P> <P> * Pacific Beach dude to tourist girl: "Texas? I've never been back East."  </P></p>

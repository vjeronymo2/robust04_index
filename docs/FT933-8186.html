			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Profits dip but Kmart optimistic on outlook KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, reported lower post-tax profits in the quarter to July, with core discount stores still under pressure and losses growing on its Pace membership warehouse operation. But the company's shares edged up Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 23 1/8 in New York after Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said second-half earnings were expected to exceed last year's levels. Renewed strength in consumer spending, good weather, and promotional activities, had brought about an improvement, he said. Net income for the second quarter of Dollars 102m, or 22 cents a share, was down more than one-third from Dollars 168m, or 37 cents, a year ago. The company, which is in the process of revamping many of its stores to compete with the faster-growing Wal Mart, had warned at the end of June of a likely fall in profits. First-half net income fell to Dollars 152m, or 33 cents a share, before special items, from Dollars 284m, or 62 cents, the year before. Sales grew by 10 per cent, to Dollars 19.2bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he continues to  have reservations about the situation in Hebron, where 120,000  Arabs remain under curfew because of 415 settlers. However, he  said, the question of whether or not to continue the closure  hinged solely on security considerations and the need to prevent  any Jewish bloodshed.    Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction that the government  would reach a decision regarding the evacuation of the Jewish  settlers from central Hebron on the basis of security  considerations, not public opinion polls. Rabin added that the  support voiced by right-wing elements for Dr. Goldstein's crime  had been widely reported in the international media. Today, Mr.  Rabin said, we do not look as nice as we thought in the eyes of  the world. The prime minister stressed that Israel had no other  negotiating partner among the Palestinians except Yasir 'Arafat  and the PLO.    As for the situation in Lebanon, Prime Minister Rabin said  that yesterday's ambush in the security zone was laid by members  of Ahmad Jibril's PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command] and not by the Hizballah. The  identity of those who launched the katyusha rockets that landed  in the western Galilee yesterday, however, remained unknown.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir added that during the session,  it  was reported that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was currently  completing its plans for new security arrangements in Hebron and  in the Cave of the Patriarchs. When these plans are completed  they will brought before the political echelon for approval.  One of the aims is to prevent Jewish extremists in Hebron and  Qiryat Arba' from harassing Arabs, as has been the case in the  past.</p>

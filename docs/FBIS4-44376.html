			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Two days after the Saxony Anhalt  Landtag election, leading Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] officials spoke out in favor of electing Reinhard  Hoeppner, the SPD candidate, as new minister president.  Meanwhile, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] on Tuesday [28 June] warned Hoeppner and the SPD  against a "popular front alliance" with the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS].    In an interview with STERN magazine, Lower Saxon Minister  President Gerhard Schroeder (SPD) said that, in the sphere of  social policy, the PDS was certainly closer to the SPD than the  CDU on some points. On north German radio, Schroeder said that  questions of possible forms of cooperation between the SPD and  the PDS would have to be answered in Saxony Anhalt.    In an interview for STERN magazine, Deputy SPD Chairman  Oskar  Lafontaine described the CDU warnings against the PDS as  "impertinent." "After all, it was the CDU that took over the  East CDU, an affiliate of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany,  and all its assets. Kohl is not only -- what irony of history  -- Adenauer's grandson but also Honecker's heir," Lafontaine  said in the interview, parts of which were made available to  DPA. In Lafontaine's view, there can only be one consequence  after the election in Saxony Anhalt: "Hoeppner must become  minister president."    For Juergen Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the  CDU/CSU Bundestag group, the voters of Saxony Anhalt decided  that the CDU should form a government. In his view, the Saxony  Anhalt SPD group is under pressure from the federal party. "The  SPD has broken Hoeppner's backbone," Ruettgers said. The  discussion on the PDS tolerating an SPD minority government only  makes sense when "popular front alliances" can no longer be  ruled out.    Similar arguments were brought forth by Johannes Gerster,  deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, and Michael  Glos, head of the CSU group in the Bundestag. If the SPD were  to accept the support of the PDS in the election of minister  president, then Willy Brandt's words that those things that  belong together will grow together would become reality in the  socialist sector, Glos said. Gerster told NEUE OSNABRUECKER  ZEITUNG that the SPD-Greens minority government, which the SPD  was seeking, would "directly lead to a popular front alliance."  SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping and Hoeppner seem to have become  megalomaniac to believe that the CDU would tolerate a minority  government between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens, Gerster said.</p>

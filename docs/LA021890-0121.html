			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO OIL SPILL ALONG COAST  </P> <P> There has been a noticeable increase in the number of homeless people on the  streets of Huntington Beach -- a sad irony in the wake of the massive  redevelopment project the city is undergoing. This brand of redevelopment was  initiated by politicians in collaboration with out-of-town developers.  </P> <P> Our neighborhoods are being subjected to nocturnal aerial spraying of the nerve  gas malathion -- brought to us by the petrochemical conglomerates who have  strong lobbies in Sacramento and Washington.  </P> <P> Now our precious seashore is threatened by a nearly 400,000-gallon oil spill.  </P> <P> Yes, this country is the "land of the free and the home of the brave." The  wealthy few, using the government as their tool, are free to impose the results  of their greedy way upon the rest of us. Meanwhile, the rest of us must be  brave in order to endure and overcome this dictatorship of amassed capital.  </P> <P> BEN MILES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

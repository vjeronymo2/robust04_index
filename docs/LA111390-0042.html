			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VETERANS START WORK ON LONG-SOUGHT MEMORIAL  </P> <P> In a struggle that has lasted longer than some wars, a group of Hawthorne  veterans finally broke ground during the weekend on an armed services memorial.  </P> <P> For the last five years, the Hawthorne Veterans Council has held garage sales  and raffles, cashed in empty aluminum cans and charged a quarter a scoop for  food at fund-raising suppers to raise money for the project .  </P> <P> Despite the groundbreaking, the veterans council cannot declare victory yet.  During the next six months, the group will use about $31,000 to install  flagpoles and concrete slabs at the memorial site outside Hawthorne Memorial  Center. The grand monument the veterans have in mind will have to wait.  </P> <P> "We don't have enough to complete the thing like we want to," said Ben  Ainsworth, a member of the veterans council.  </P></p>

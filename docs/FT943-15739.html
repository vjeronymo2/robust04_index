			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Dealers in the derivatives reported a dull session as uncertainty over US and German interest rates overshadowed trading, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 2,955, Following a bout of sideways trading, the contract moved gently forward, with some encouragement drawn from comments from the Treasury suggesting a steady recovery of the UK economy. A firm performance in UK gilts brought a further advance in September and and it hit a high of 2,970 over lunch. Significantly, volume remained poor, an indication that many of the market's leading participants had chosen to remain on the sidelines ahead of news on the US dollar and the outcome of today's meeting by the Bundesbank. However, active selling, mainly by independent (local) traders, emerged in the mid-afternoon following an initial retreat in US bonds. September then fell to a low of 2,936 before recovering to finish at 2,947, at a premium to cash but 4 below its estimated fair value premium of 5 points. Volume was 10,763 lots. Turnover in traded options again showed an improvement. A total of 33,603 contracts was traded, of which 12,184 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,118 in GEC, the busiest stock option.</p>

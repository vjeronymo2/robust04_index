			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MORE BUSES: OCTD says its most popular routes are Line 43, on Harbor Boulevard,  Line 85, which runs on Campus Drive and Tustin, Red Hill and Sunflower avenues,  and Line 57 on Bristol Street. . . . Officials said the system will reroute  Line 61 from Campus Drive into the new terminal at John Wayne Airport later  this year, after a three-year hiatus due to airport construction and low  ridership.

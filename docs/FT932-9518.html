			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Time to change the window display - The way forward for the Roddick family 'BODY SHOP', says the taxi driver at Littlehampton station, more a statement than an enquiry as to destination. It is a fair assumption that anyone getting off the London train at the south coast seaside resort-cum-retirement home and seeking a taxi is heading for Body Shop International's new head office at Watersmead. 'Anita and Gordon,' says the taxi driver on the return journey, referring to the Roddicks, managing director and chairman respectively of Body Shop, 'are the biggest employers in Littlehampton. But everyone slags them off'. Littlehampton does not like the slogans on the lorries, he says, and worse still 'you saw that naked lady on the grass? Littlehampton doesn't like it.' The naked lady needs a little explanation. Body Shop's 20 acre site, containing head office, factory, warehouse, shop and creche, is littered with witty, life size figures. A cleaning lady continually mops the floor of the reception area. In front of the office - a green roofed pagoda - are two groups of figures which on inspection reveal themselves to be tableaux of paintings. One, Seurat's bathers, the other Manet's Dejeuner sur l'Herbe, including the aforementioned naked lady. The naked lady, it transpires, is a metaphor for Anita Roddick. 'Anita's blatant. She has an idea and she tells everyone, and she's blunt and to the point'. The Littlehampton mentality is shared by some in the investment community. While Body Shop was generating phenomenal growth 'the dinosaurs', as Anita calls stockbrokers and fund managers, could swallow the principles - even applaud them as a good marketing ploy. But Body Shop broke faith with the City last autumn, making a profit warning, admitting in effect that the phenomenon could not go on for ever. The shares plunged. Now there is a story going around that Body Shop is giving up its principles and becoming a 'normal' company. With the usual Body Shop fervour this was denied when the group reported annual profits for the year to February down from Pounds 25.2m to Pounds 21.5m. 'Some of the less friendly observers, and Body Shop watchers, have determined that we will abandon our principles and reveal ourselves as shallow cynical exploiters. We must disappoint them,' the company said. It is clear that the non-meeting of minds between Anita and the City continues. She makes no concessions to the dinosaurs' point of view, nor do they, she believes, to hers. She finds finance boring. Her passion is searching the world for jungle juices to incorporate into Body Shop products. 'Direct sourcing,' she says, 'a lot of effort goes into that but the institutions are just not interested. Financial science is what grabs their goolies'. Asked about childcare at Watersmead, she scorns to make a commercial justification for it, mentioning almost in passing that Body Shop's staff turnover is under 3 per cent - an amazingly low figure for a retailer. 'We got in because it was morally right not because we viewed it economically', she affirms. 'We don't put profits into Lear jets or a chairman's Rolls Royce', implying that questions ought to be asked of companies which do. 'The creche and the environmental issues we've done early. Others will have to follow and it will cost them more.' Even Anita, just off a 10 hour overnight flight from Brazil, where she has been arranging supplies of Brazil nut oil, admits to being too tired to cope with her colleagues' excitement about her trip. She has escaped to her husband Gordon's office and does not intend to interrupt. Her hair - so wild in the press photos - is neatly tied back; the car park is full of cars, not bicycles; the writing on the lab wall 'it is obscene to test something so unimportant as a moisturiser on an animal' is not crazy. But it is Gordon that gives the Body Shop game away. There is a commercial company behind the image. He does not attempt to disguise the problems Body Shop has met. They are typical of small companies which have grown rapidly. 'It has grown to a dimension where you get the illnesses of giantism. When it was small you could drop an idea in one end and it would reach the other end in two weeks. It got to the point where it took two years.' An example he gives is a window display design created for the whole group. 'People would say it won't work in Australia because its winter there and they don't want spring posters. There would be three months of arguing ending up with a compromise.' Those compromises went into every area of the business. Shops in Sweden and Hong Kong would be supplied with the same shampoo range regardless of the different hair types. 'We had to change all that. The only way to change was for the whole business to be fragmented into areas that made some sense.' These are UK retail, international retail - subdivided into US and the rest of the world  -and the supply company. Now the group will produce market specific ranges. The first, designed for the US, is based on blue corn (to the uninitiated, a blue version of sweetcorn) and the second is a tea tree range for Australia. Another concern was that Body Shop 'had become production led rather than retail led. The UK and international business will be headed up by retailers,' Gordon stresses. Mr Geoff Marshall, a respected retailer, has been hired to run the UK side, and Mr Michael Ross, for eight years a franchisee of Body Shop, has been put in charge of international retailing. Body Shop has reached maturity in the UK, Gordon admits. But he reckons to attract more people into the shops through increasing the range of goods, and to become a more aggressive promoter. With about half the group's profits made in the UK, maturity there inevitably means a slowing of the group's profit growth. But Gordon expects that overseas expansion will be strong. Anita butts in: 'When you think how big the planet is we are not a speck in the eye'. Body Shop will open its 1,000th store this year, and only a quarter of them will be in the UK. But, the sceptic asks, retailers who venture abroad have a low success rate. Gordon has evidently been asked that many times. 'The evidence is we have controlled it quite well.' He puts the success down to franchising. Each country is run by a head franchisee. 'They are all individual entrepreneurs, all keen to be successful. If we'd tried growth overseas in any other way I honestly believe we would have failed. Boots pulled out of Canada after years there. Body Shop is trading very well in Canada,' he says. He puts the group's profit fall last year down to the poor economic climate in the UK, the overheads at Watersmead where the factory is running at only 25 per cent of potential capacity, and the costs of relocating the US head office. These should be temporary problems. Similarly, Gordon asserts, the group's borrowing levels will fall as capital spending, Pounds 20m last year, reduces. He has no anxieties about the share price. 'We are not in the arena to do acquisitions or raise cash to do anything'. And he is relaxed about relations with the City. 'They hate heaps of the things we say. I view it as their problem.'</p>

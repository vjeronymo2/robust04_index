The cabinet decided today to dispatch six  soldiers as unarmed military observers to the war zone in  Georgia. According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the  German contingent will include four military observers and one  medical officer. They will form part of a UN contingent of  about 60 soldiers from 10 nations.    There will be no constitutional problems over the observer  status of the mission: This is only a "diplomatic mission" and  no blue helmet operation is involved, the dispatch does not  conflict with the government's position not to send soldiers to  states on whose territory German troops fought in the past,  Vogel pointed out. Incidentally, the Germans did not invade  Georgia during World War II, he stressed.    Georgia's existence as a state is threatened by the  separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which want  to merge with Russia.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION LAW FAILING, STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> The landmark overhaul of U. S. immigration law enacted in 1986 has thus far  failed to reverse the well-established pattern of illegal immigration from  Mexico and is unlikely to achieve lawmakers' stated goal of deterring  undocumented migrants, an academic study here has found.  </P> <P> Those conclusions, reached by a group of researchers directed by the Center for  U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U. S.  immigration authorities and congressional aides, who assert that the law is  working as designed.  </P> <P> The academicians, whose more than two-year study of the effects of the 1986 law  is among the most systematic such reviews done nationwide, reported this week  that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or without  documentation, and that many illegal aliens are using bogus paper work to  secure jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobs Still Available  </P> <P> Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the  study found that most Mexican migrants continue to find work in the United  States and that few are returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for  more than 90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States.  </P> <P> "The 1986 immigration law has not shut off the flow of new undocumented  immigrants from . . . Mexico," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center  for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of the study. "No viable alternative to  migrating to the United States has developed in these communities, so they're  continuing to send people."  </P> <P> Moreover, Cornelius, one of the leading U. S. experts on Mexico and  immigration, said migrants are increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico  relatively new to the migrant stream, such as Mexico City and the states of  Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The development is an ominous one for U. S.  policy-makers seeking to deter illegal immigration, Cornelius said, as it  indicates that new migrant networks are being created at a time when  authorities would like to seal off arrivals from traditional migrant areas.  </P> <P> The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive reform of  the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely  to reduce the flow of illegal aliens, mostly Mexicans, into the United States  via the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> Cornelius and others have argued that the law will likely be ineffective as  long as Mexico's economy continues to deteriorate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Disputed Results  </P> <P> INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting  that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things,  authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U. S.-Mexico border  -- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration --  have declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law.  </P> <P> "We feel we've pushed back the tide" of illegal immigration, said Ron Rogers,  an INS spokesman in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> U. S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part  to the deterrent effect of the so-called "employer sanction" sections of the  new law. Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers'  documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United  States.  </P> <P> The study found that a large number of Mexican illegal aliens -- 41% of those  with jobs who were interviewed by the academicians -- had resorted to using  false or borrowed immigration documents to secure work, thus circumventing the  law.  </P> <P> The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, was more probably linked  to the fact that more than 3 million formerly illegal residents have been  granted legal status in the amnesty program and are now able to cross the  border legally.  </P> <P> Congressional aides with two U. S. senators active in immigration matters,  Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of  Massachusetts, characterized the results of the San Diego study as premature,  as it will take years to judge the new law's true effectiveness.  </P> <P> The San Diego study involved a series of stages, including interviews with more  than 300 Mexican immigrants, both documented and undocumented, working for 100  non-agricultural employers throughout Southern California and the San Francisco  Bay Area. Employers were also surveyed. It is estimated that half of all  Mexican immigrants to this country are bound for California.  </P> <P> Researchers also traveled to Mexico and spoke with residents from towns in  three states -- Michoacan, Jalisco and Zacatecas -- long identified with  immigration to California.  </P></p>

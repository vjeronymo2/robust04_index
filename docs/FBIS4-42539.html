			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed G.C.: "The Deputies Have Adopted the </F> Military Programming Law"]    [Text] In a joint move, unusual but predictable, the  majority and Socialist Party [PSF] deputies adopted--on  Wednesday 1 June--the military programming law on which the  National Assembly first voted on 24 and 25 May. The final  vote--which was due to take place on Tuesday, 31 May--was  finally postponed by one day after Assembly Speaker Philippe  Seguin noticed both the absence of the defense minister from  government benches and...the failure of the electronic voting  system.    Only the Communist deputies voted against the bill, with Guy  Hermier (Bouches-du-Rhone) expressing the view that France "is  wasting a historic opportunity to take a decisive step toward  disarmament and peace." Two absentees were noted: Jean-Pierre  Chevenement who had announced his intention of abstaining, as  did Jean-Pierre Michel, his friend from the Citizens' Movement;  and also that of Julien Dray who did this to express his  opposition to the text and its approval by the PS [Socialist  Party]. In the forthcoming issue of the weekly pamphlet GAUCHE  SOCIALISTE [Socialist Left] which they edit, Julien Dray and  Jean-Luc Melenchon, (PS) senator for l'Essonne, write that  "voting in favor of this law is stupid, politically dangerous,  and militarily ineffective."    Welcoming the "support" of the country's three big political  forces for his bill, Defense Minister Francois Leotard  reaffirmed the government's position on nuclear tests. France,  he said, intends "to maintain its nuclear effort, and that  includes tests if they seem necessary."</p>

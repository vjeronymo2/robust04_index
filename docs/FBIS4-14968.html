			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw </F> Hryb by ZVYAZDA correspondents Yan Kamotski and Natallya  Talkanitsa, under the "Parliamentary Diary" rubric; place and  date not given: "`Alyaksandr Lukashenka Began His Election  Campaign'"]    [Text] As is known, on 31 April, the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet did not adopt a resolution to dismiss four government  members and the National Bank chairman, as was proposed by  People's Deputy Lukashenka. ZVYAZDA correspondents have asked  Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb to comment on the  parliament's discussion of this issue.    [ZVYAZDA] How do you estimate the fact that the parliament  has not adopted any resolution on proposals put forward by the  commission headed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka?    [Hryb] I think that the reason for this was the lack of any  documents which could substantiate charges against each of the  individuals. In my opinion, it was necessary for people's  deputies to have at their disposal both documented evidence and  explanatory statements by the ministers. As became clear today,  the commission has not spoken with any of them. It is  impossible to adopt a resolution on the basis of such one-sided  material.    [ZVYAZDA] Thus, you believe that the commission simply  failed to convince people's deputies of the guilt of government  members?    [Hryb] Absolutely. Even the opposition's representative,  People's Deputy Malashka, said that he would like to see the  government dismissed, but would not vote in favor of anyone's  dismissal without having documented proof of their guilt.    [ZVYAZDA] Do you think Alyaksandr Lukashenka used this  opportunity to begin his election campaign?    [Hryb] It is hard to say. He may be the best person to  answer this question. However, judging by all appearances --  yes, he has.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Technology (R&amp;D): All for one and one for all - How General Electric has co-ordinated its research labs so they produce more commercial products BILL LORENSEN takes a scalpel, cuts into the face of the deformed teenage girl, peels away the skin around her eyes to reveal bone, and quickly proceeds to re-align her features so that her eyes no longer protrude abnormally from her skull. The scalpel is only electronic, and the three-dimensional face is merely portrayed on a television monitor in the computer graphics laboratory at General Electric's corporate research and development centre in Schenectady, New York. But the techniques Lorensen is demonstrating were used in just such an operation by cranial facial surgeons in a Boston hospital who have been experimenting with new GE equipment, hot off the laboratory bench, designed to help very long and complex medical procedures. Advanced GE body scanning equipment, combined with the laboratory's computer graphics techniques, allows surgeons to construct three-dimensional images of patients and then simulate the cuts needed to perform successful operations on them. This is just one small example of the way in which GE, one of the largest and most diversified companies in the US, is addressing two fundamental issues facing businesses with large R&amp;D staffs: How do you make your scientists, who may be happier advancing pure human knowledge, perform work which is relevant to the company's business, boosting the bottom line? And, in the case of a diversified business like GE, how do you get laboratories in different scientific disciplines to co-operate, making the product as a whole more valuable than the sum of its parts? Lorensen's work involves close co-operation between the graphics laboratory and GE's applied physics lab, which has responsibility for maintaining the company's lead in medical diagnostic imaging, gained through its development of computed tomography and magnetic resonance scanners. His job also involves working hand-in-hand with GE Medical Systems, the division which sells the imaging equipment, and the hospitals which buy them, like the one in Boston. The Schenectady centre, one of the largest and most influential R&amp;D bases in corporate America, dates back to the start of the century and employs just over 1,000 scientists and technicians. Its long list of successes includes the invention of the modern medical X-Ray tube, the first method of manufacturing industrial diamonds and development of the world's leading computed tomography scanner. GE's operating divisions also have their own large R&amp;D facilities, but about 30 per cent of all the group's patents and some 50 per cent of its technical papers are generated at Schenectady. Its broad sweep of current R&amp;D includes: a computerised design tool that runs other computerised design programs to find the optimal solution to problems; the application of fuzzy logic, or smart controls, to consumer electrical goods; and the use of computer-based analysis to reduce risk in GE's large financial services business. However, the centre has gone through a big shift of emphasis in recent years. Walter Berninger, who heads the engineering physics research centre, says that 20 years ago there was far more of a focus on pure research. About 10 years ago came a demand for greater relevance to GE's operating businesses, while the emphasis now is on both revelance and importance - with the latter measured in terms of profits. Much of the shift is due to Walter Robb, who has headed the centre since 1986 and before that spent 13 years as head of one of GE's business success stories - the medical systems division which is now the world's leading producer of diagnostic imaging equipment. Robb has made two important structural changes. The first is in the way the centre is funded. Under the old system, GE's various operating businesses paid Schenectady a fixed annual assessment, or tithe, based on the size of the business. This money went into a central pool and it was up to the centre to decide how to spend the sum. The system was frustrating for both sides. The businesses saw no connection between what they had paid and what the laboratories did, while the centre often complained of businesses sitting on commercially applicable patents it had developed. Robb sharply cut the tithe paid by the businesses and now applies this smaller pool to fund more high risk, so-called 'exploratory' research which may or may not find a practical application one day. However, any work going beyond the exploratory area now has to be financed 100 per cent by a business out of its own funds. The result is a closer watch by a business on how its money is spent and a concern on both sides to ensure the results can be rapidly commercialised. 'It is very rare now that a programme is in the applied development area and is not tied in on the critical path of a business's product plan,' says Robb. 'They have limited dollars and they are trying to spend them on things that are going to be important.' The second change, linked to the first, was in the way the centre communicated with the various businesses. It previously had a group of full-time liaison managers, each of whom looked after several GE businesses. Robb replaced them by assigning senior Schenectady figures - the managers of the various laboratories - to spend part of their time being the centre's rep with a single business. The rep gathers ideas from all the centre's laboratories for research which might help his client business and each spring he puts together a funding proposal which he pitches to the business. 'He is to some extent a salesman,' says Robb. 'He comes back from the business with a commitment to fund a certain number of programmes.' The result has been much closer links between the two sides, with, for example, the Schenectady manager invited to the business's planning sessions and staff meetings. There are also substantial financial incentives underpinning this co-operation. The more funds a researcher can attract, the more chance he has of getting his ideas patented and into products. The centre gives an extremely modest Dollars 400 (Pounds 200) reward for a patent, but an individual's salary depends in part on performance. Schenectady now also grants reseachers GE share options for outstanding work. A feature of the annual performance review of senior managers is how many products their operations have 'transitioned' - an ugly piece of slang, often heard in the centre, which means transferring an idea from the laboratory to the market-place. Michael O'Mara, who runs the chemical research centre, says Schenectady scientists no longer throw an idea over the wall to a business division, sit back and say 'my job is done'. 'People see that if you want your baby to be successful in the market place you have to take on more responsibility.' This attitude has been reinforced by a more general GE philosophy encouraged by Jack Welch, the group's chairman, who aims to create a 'boundaryless' organisation to cope with the business challenges of 1990s. His idea is both to cut out unneccessary layers of bureacracy and also to foster the free flow of ideas around the vast organisation. Robb says Schenectady has always been pretty boundaryless itself, sharing ideas between labs, but it has now become much more open in exchanging ideas with GE's businesses. In turn the businesses are now less suspicious of the centre: 'They are prepared to come here and tell us what they are working on, and how much money they have to spend on it, and what the price objective is.' Robb points out that some 40 per cent of the centre's patents and technical papers are produced in co-operation with people in the businesses, while about 75 per cent of the business ideas it puts forward find their way to a commercial application. Some 40 to 50 per cent of its patents and papers involve teams combining more than one Schenectady laboratory and Robb believes that this is the way of the future, with more and more advances being made by combining two technologies. However, he also reckons that the biggest breakthrough facing Schenectady is not going to be in any particular technology but in research productivity. Computer capability is on the way, he says, which will allow the centre to 'model, or simulate, practically every laboratory experiment that we will contemplate doing . . . even making a metal alloy.' That, in turn, will increase GE's general business productivity by cutting down the cycle time of new product development. And this, management gurus aver, is a key factor for business sucess in the 1990s.</p>

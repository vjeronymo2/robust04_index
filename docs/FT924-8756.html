			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Need for finance is key element in pact THE AGREEMENT on economic co-operation, signed by British and Russian ministers yesterday, lays down a new formal framework for the promotion of co-operation between the two countries, writes Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor. In particular, the two parties acknowledge the significance of financing - including providing medium and long-term credits - for 'steady and effective' economic co-operation. In the framework of national rules and international arrangements, they agree to provide export credits on 'suitably favourable terms'. They also recognise the importance of the development of infrastructure, including both national and international transport and communications systems. Companies and organisations will be encouraged to participate in projects to improve the infrastructure, including co-operation in securing funding from international organisations. Each party agrees to provide legal protection for investment by nationals of the other country in accordance with the 1989 Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments.</p>

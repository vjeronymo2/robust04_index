			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / BBA plans Pounds 125.9m rights issue and continental acquisitions BBA, the engineering group, is raising Pounds 125.9m in a rights issue and spending Pounds 86m on two acquisitions in continental Europe. The move comes only a week after the Pounds 58m sale of a controlling stake in Pacific BBA of Australia, which reduced gearing from 61 per cent to 44 per cent on a year-end basis. After paying for the acquisitions, the share issue will cut it to 21 per cent. The one-for-four issue, priced at 142p a share, comes less than two years after BBA's last issue which raised Pounds 79.1m. After yesterday's announcement, the share price slipped from a three-year high of 177p, valuing the group at Pounds 555m, to 170p. BBA said it intended to maintain its dividend at 7.5p this year, giving a gross yield on the rights issue price of 6.6 per cent. The group has twice dipped into reserves to pay an uncovered dividend. BBA is buying two electrical engineering companies making coils, instrument transformers and high-voltage testing equipment. About Pounds 53.9m is being paid for the companies and Pounds 32.2m taken on in debt. Haefely, based in Switzerland, is costing a total of SFr146.5m (Pounds 65m), including SFr36.5m debt. Last year it made SFr17.7m operating profit - twice the 1990 level - on sales of SFr152.4m. The second acquisition, MWB, is German. About three quarters of its DM50.8m (Pounds 21m) cost is debt. MWB made DM3m operating profit on turnover of DM74.3m last year. Mr Ian Williamson, chief executive of engineering products, said Haefely and MWB would join Trench, a Canadian company, to create a group focused on electrical power distribution equipment. In a full year they add about Pounds 100m to group turnover, which totalled Pounds 1.32bn in 1992, and increase the strength of the industrial division with Pounds 35m at the operating level on sales of Pounds 486m. Mr John White, managing director, said the group - which also has automotive and aviation divisions - now had 'sufficient cores'. It would continue to sell non-core activities. At the year-end the group's net debt was Pounds 227.5m. By the end of this year it expected debt to be about Pounds 150m, with gearing of 31 per cent. The group regarded its 'comfort level' for gearing as 40 per cent. Lex, Page 22</p>

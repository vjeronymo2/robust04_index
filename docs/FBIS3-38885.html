The fact that over four  million of their fellow citizens do not have jobs is one of the  greatest challenges for society and the state, since the  founding of the Federal Republic, Rexrodt said today in response  to the latest labor market figures from Nuremberg. This is not  one of the usual economic crises, but "a deep structural crisis."    Rexrodt resolutely rejected "political demagogues" with  "patent prescriptions." Rather, it is necessary to embark "upon  the stony path of structural renewal."    The economics minister called upon companies and unions to  keep a sense of perspective in pay disputes. "Both sides in the  current [engineering] pay dispute can signal common sense."</p>

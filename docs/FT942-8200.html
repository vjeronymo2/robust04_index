			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: DTB plans promotion for link-up with Matif The Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based derivatives market, plans to launch an intensive marketing exercise in France. The campaign will start before the first DTB terminals are installed in Paris in September as part of the German exchange's co-operation with Matif, its French equivalent. The DTB is also close to winning the regulatory approval which will allow it to expand into the UK, the US, and continental European countries, Mr Jorg Franke, the DTB's joint chief executive, said yesterday. At present, the DTB has only one screen outside Germany, in Amsterdam. Further international expansion will follow the DTB's declaration this week that it intends to join Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group. However, Mr Franke warned it would take a year from the signing of a contract with Reuters for DTB technology to be adapted to that of Globex, at a cost of between DM6m (Dollars 3.5m) and DM8m. He said he expected five or six French institutions to be trading DTB products out of Paris 'from the very beginning'. The products available to the French, via a computer link with the German system, will be the DTB's futures contracts on five- and 10-year German government securities coupled with the corresponding options. The agreement with Matif envisages that by the end of next year, members will have full access to the DTB's dealing and settlement technology. DTB announced pre-tax profits for last year were DM47.9m, up from DM42.2m in 1992. This reflected a 44 per cent increase in trading volume, from 34.8m to 50m contracts, offsetting a reduction in fees.</p>

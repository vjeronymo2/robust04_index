			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Public's economic optimism 'rising' Members of the public feel more optimistic about the state of the economy and their employment prospects than at any time since May last year, says the first of a series of surveys to be published monthly by the Financial Times, Lisa Wood writes. The index by MORI, the market research organisation, is based on two surveys, one concerned with the fear of individuals in work becoming redundant in the next 12 months, and the other on whether the public generally expects the state of the economy to worsen. The survey, entitled Mood of the Nation, was indexed at 100 in April 1993: the higher the index, the more miserable the public. In its first month the index was at 107. The misery level was highest last October (127) and at the beginning of this year (124). In July the index was at 112, the lowest since the index began. There appear to be small but significant changes during the period in individuals' financial behaviour, such as taking out loans or increasing levels of credit card borrowing. In 1993 26 per cent of the May sample said they intended to increase their level of savings. That figure fell to 17 per cent this month. Fear of redundancy itself had fallen slightly by this month, with 42 per cent of respondents either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned' about losing their jobs. In April, the last time the question was asked, the figure was 44 per cent. Fear was highest last October, at 53 per cent. The survey was based on interviews with 2,031 adults aged 18 plus at 150 constituencies across the country with interviews conducted face to face between June 30 and July 4. Copyright MORI/FT.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Evidence that the Bank of England and UK chancellor caught London's markets unawares when they announced a cut in base rates was provided by the derivatives markets yesterday, writes Peter John. The futures contract on the FT-SE 100, which expires on December 17, saw exceptionally heavy turnover of more than 22,000 contracts as dealers raced to adjust their books. The rush to get back into the market via the futures saw a turnaround of some 60 points between the high and low points of the day. Worries that US investors were poised to repatriate funds had led to a Europe-wide stock market slide. Dealers expected further weakness yesterday and when the December future opened it traded down more than 20 points to 3,046. When the half-point cut in base rates was announced, December futures turned round to hit 3,104. Then, profit-taking in the afternoon saw the contract tick back to 3,067 by the official close - exactly where it started in the first place. At that level it was at a discount to the cash market in contrast to the estimated fair value premium of some 6 points. Although fair value premium takes account of interest rates it will not change as it is calculated on three-month money rather than actual base rates. Options saw slightly reduced turnover of 47,700 lots, against 50,700 on Monday, with hedge buying of FT-SE puts contributing heavily to turnover of the Footsie options. Land Securities was the most actively traded stock option (2,832 lots) folllowed by Thames Water (2,128).</p>

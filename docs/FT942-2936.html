			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Cup: Odds-on for a betting record Even though England, Wales and Scotland failed to qualify, the World Cup finals may break all records for soccer betting in Britain. The Coral bookmaking firm reckoned yesterday that betting on the month-long competition could top Pounds 30m. Ireland have been well supported - down from 50-1 to 28-1 - and so have outsiders Nigeria, sliding from 150-1 to 33-1 in recent days. Coral lists Brazil as 3-1 favourites, followed by Germany (7-2), the Netherlands and Italy (6-1), Colombia (9-1) and Argentina (10-1).</p>

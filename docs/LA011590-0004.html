			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A VICTORIAN HOMECOMING IN CARLSBAD  </P> <P> One's abiding passions in life do bring moments of curious disadvantage, which  is a suitably empurpled Victorian way of expressing just what Patricia Watkins  feels sometimes.  </P> <P> Like when she peers from the widow's watch of her lavishly recreated  19th-Century home on the coast of Carlsbad and observes how passers-by act when  they come upon the home, with its tall cupola, witch's hat and a virtual  dessert tray of gingerbread ornamentation.  </P> <P> Once, Watkins recalled, "these people pulled up and took a tablecloth out. They  had champagne, a bucket, a flower vase and a little ghetto blaster. They  danced, they kissed. They set up a tripod and a camera and took pictures of  themselves.  </P> <P> "It was so bizarre."  </P> <P> Life can be like that when your home is dubbed "Disneyland South" by the  neighbors and its Victorian ostentation rises like a frosting apparition in a  seaside community that didn't even become a city until the Eisenhower  Administration.  </P> <P> Gawkers, shutter-snappers and occasional folks who simply knock on the door for  a well-meaning inquiry are the price Watkins, her husband, William, and their  six children are willing to pay for owning one of the most unusual and  prominent residences on the North County coast.  </P> <P> Lyn Pinney of the Carlsbad Convention and Visitors Bureau said, "It's pretty  outstanding. If you drive up the coast, you don't find many homes like it. In  fact, I can't think of any."  </P> <P> But only three years after the couple finished building their dream house,  business demands are requiring them to spend more time in Las Vegas, where  they're from. So they put their Carlsbad Victorian on the market four months  ago. The asking price is $3 million, but, hey, that includes the antique  furniture. The price is $2.5 million if sold nude.  </P> <P> So far, 150 parties have expressed interest in the 3-story, 14-room blue-gray  residence with burgundy and plum trim that was hand-milled from redwood.  However, most potential buyers want to convert it into a bed and breakfast for  tourists, and they disappear upon learning the city won't allow it.  </P> <P> The couple is taking the sorrow out of selling their house by planning to erect  an almost exact duplicate in Las Vegas, where 19th-Century architecture is  about as natural to the desert as showgirls in rhinestone G-strings.  </P> <P> But for the Watkins family, their long-held affinity for a style popular during  the long reign of England's Queen Victoria -- a style most later generations  regarded as silly and dandified -- goes wherever they go.  </P> <P> William Watkins is a well-known Carlsbad area developer and Patricia is a  former art teacher who specialized in portraits. They married 10 years ago,  creating a perfect union for collect-aholics who decided to design and furnish  a Victorian retirement home with a sea view. First, she recounted, the couple  set about searching for the house that would be right for them -- to copy.  </P> <P> "We took an extensive tour of Victorian homes in Northern California," that  included Ferndale, Eureka and Arcata up in redwood country. They also  scrutinized San Francisco's "painted ladies" but decided the architecture "was  more pure in Ferndale because it's more rural" and thus hadn't been modified  over the years.  </P> <P> They chose a scheme with familiar Victorian features and began two years of  building in 1984. Neighbors in Terramar, a 1950s-era residential enclave just  south of the Encinas power plant, watched the construction with considerable  amusement.  </P> <P> "People were calling it 'Disneyland South,' " recalled Bailey Noble, president  of the local homeowners association.  </P> <P> People were friendly enough, but there was some suspicious talk that drifted  back to Patricia Watkins.  </P> <P> "Coming in from Las Vegas and putting all these phone lines in because we have  children, somebody asked if we were bookies," she said.  </P> <P> When the house was done, raised to its full 35-foot height, perhaps the most  impressed observer was the city's building inspection department.  </P> <P> "It's all 2-by-4 lumber studding. It's way overbuilt, you wouldn't believe it,"  said Tony Mata, chief building inspector. "I had to take my whole department  down there to see it. They were amazed."  </P> <P> Not everybody shared that enthusiasm, like the man who laboriously delivered 24  brass and bronze ceiling fans. "He said, 'Why the hell didn't you put in air  conditioning?' " Watkins said.  </P> <P> Although somewhat crowded on a 69-by-105-foot lot, not unlike an original  Victorian fit, the inside of the Watkins abode has a feeling of spaciousness  and warmth. Actual 19th-Century homes had cold, tiny rooms with high ceilings,  but the building code and a desire for comfort caused the family to elect  bigger rooms, each crowded with antique furniture, lamps, stained-glass  windows, art and curios.  </P> <P> "We collected Belter furniture. He was the premiere furniture-maker before the  Civil War," Watkins said. But amid all the antiquity -- the 1870 parlor stove  and the Tiffany window and much more -- are splashes of pure whimsy.  </P> <P> In one downstairs bathroom, the toilet has the old-fashioned pull-chain from  the tank located on the wall about six feet above the bowl. The bowl sits  beneath a sturdy oak chair with a high back and arms decorated with red velvet  pads. It resembles a formal dining room chair. The seat is flipped to the side  to make way for relief.  </P> <P> In the second-story office sit two late 1800s barber chairs at the windows  overlooking the ocean. William and Patricia sit there and gaze. But her chair  also has a more practical use.  </P> <P> "I sit here and blow my hair dry and watch the people go by," sometimes ducking  from photographers, she said.  </P> <P> With few exceptions, they rather enjoy the attention and the typical  uncertainty of viewers about whether the home is a genuine Victorian.  </P> <P> "I actually had a person ask me whether we dragged this house down from San  Francisco," she said. "Right down I-5. Right."  </P> <P> People with modern taste usually regard Victoriana as gaudy and foppish.  </P> <P> "It's all of those things," said Watkins. But "you look at something like a  piece of furniture and you think, look what's happened over the last 100 years,  and this is still here. . . . It's just so good to feel there was something  yesterday."  </P> <P> What Watkins and her husband, owner of Watkins Development Co., hope for  tomorrow is that a buyer will come along so they can focus entirely on building  their next new Victorian in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Despite all the inquiries on the Carlsbad house, the city's restrictions on bed  and breakfasts have turned most of the interested parties off.  </P> <P> City Planning Director Michael Holzmiller said five years ago, the city acted  to safeguard areas with single-family dwellings, and as a result has only one B  and B. "The city wanted to be cautious and conservative. One issue of concern  to Carlsbad residents is protection of the R-1 zone," he said.  </P> <P> But, he added, "maybe we're being a little too cautious and we should consider  (bed and breakfasts) in unique single-family zones."  </P> <P> Patricia Watkins is sure her house will sell and her family will go on to the  next Victorian adventure. But as much as she loves that era, even she has  limits: "I enjoy the beauty. The next thing I enjoy is the microwave and  running water and how lucky I am that I wasn't living back then."  </P></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / British Rail franchise sell-off to be delayed by up to a year The privatisation of British Rail is to be delayed by up to a year as government and rail authorities work through the detailed preparations needed to begin the sale of franchises. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, disclosed yesterday that the government did not expect to sell off the first six franchises until some time before the end of 1995. It had originally hoped to sell the franchise for the Gatwick Express, running between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport, this autumn and a further six franchises early next year. 'We did indicate an earlier timetable when the Railways Bill was going through the House but that was before we had done detailed work,' Mr MacGregor said. News of the delay came less than two weeks before the creation of separate companies to own BR's track and signalling and to lease rolling stock. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'The Tories' plans for rail privatisation are falling apart before they've even started.' Despite the delay, the government still hopes to have privatised more than half of BR's passenger rail services by April 1996. The first six franchises to be sold off are expected to be Gatwick Express; the east coast main line between London and Scotland; the Great Western main line; the London, Tilbury and Southend line; south-western division; and ScotRail. The Isle of Wight line will be sold off later because it will operate as a single unit including both train operations and track. Apart from Gatwick Express, which is already operating as an independent company within BR, the first six franchises will start operating as 'shadow franchises' from April 1 this year with the remaining 19 due to start in October. These will be run by their existing management as independent operations to establish how attractive they might be for private bidders. A fear of some potential bidders is that the government might reduce or remove subsidies for lossmaking lines during the life of a franchise. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, indicated that the Treasury would be expected to maintain subsidies. The privatisation timetable announcement coincided with the launch of a campaign against the rail programme by Save our Railways, a protest group, the Labour party and the three transport unions.

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Beverley may face legal action from creditors Disgruntled creditors at Beverley Group, the insolvent engineering company, yesterday said they were considering legal action to overturn a company voluntary arrangement endorsed by its shareholders this week. Creditors owed some Pounds 500,000 want the voluntary agreement thrown out, forcing the group into liquidation and clearing the way for an investigation of Beverley's management. The company, however, warned that a legal challenge was unlikely to succeed and said it was pursuing its own action against the creditors involved. Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said: 'These creditors are acting maliciously. They have no interest in the future of Beverley, and we are suing a number of them for money they owe us.' The creditors, however, claimed they could pursue legal action by proving that voting on the voluntary agreement was mishandled. The agreement was approved after the company agreed to two amendments proposed by the Inland Revenue, one of the company's principal creditors. 'Had the company not agreed to these amendments, the Inland Revenue would have voted against the CVA and the management would have been defeated,' the dissident creditors said. 'We believe those amendments should not have been put to the meeting without prior notification.' The amendments called on the group to set aside enough funds to pay for liquidators should the CVA fail to restore Beverley's fortunes, and imposed a 60-day deadline for repayment of outstanding taxes. Buchler Phillips, the insolvency practitioner which conducted the vote, said it had followed the correct procedures. 'I don't think there's any possible challenge that would result in legal action,' said Mr David Buchler, the firm's senior insolvency partner. While providing for partial repayment of creditors, the CVA should leave Beverley as a clean shell company with Fluid Engineering, its only operating subsidiary, as a solvent operating business.</p>

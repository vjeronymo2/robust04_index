			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Taking issue on Watergate Sir, I take issue with Jurek Martin ('Is the US system still working', June 17) on one point. He says that politicisation of the judiciary has meant the 'rejection of fine legal minds (Robert Bork)' from seats on the Supreme Court. But let us not forget Bork's role in Watergate. It is one Martin could have easily mentioned, particularly as he acknowledges the actions during Watergate of some 'principled civil servants', such as Elliot Richardson, Nixon's attorney general, who chose to resign rather than fire (at Nixon's behest) the special prosecutor who was about to expose the president's role in the conspiracy. The man who finally did axe Archibald Cox was, of course, Bork. Fine legal mind notwithstanding, for that reason I am glad Mr Bork never ascended to the Supreme Court. Barry Shelby, 280 E 10th Street 17, New York, NY 10009</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 26 Apr (TANJUG) -- Macedonian [Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov  has returned from Sofia this evening following his first  official visit to Bulgaria, and positively assessed his two-day  "very open" talks with Bulgarian officials.    Gligorov said that two treaties on Skopje-Sofia cooperation  that were to have been signed -- on the elimination of double  taxation and the protection of mutual investments -- have not  been signed because of the refusal by Bulgarian officials to  sign these documents also in the Macedonian language. According  to Gligorov, the Macedonian delegation deemed that the  Macedonian language could not be a contentious issue and that  the right of every nation is to call the language it speaks as  it pleases.    However, President Gligorov expressed the hope that talks of  this kind would gradually yield results. Gligorov also  expressed the conviction that Bulgarian President Zhelev "has an  understanding of this issue," but that "they should clarify this  matter in Bulgaria on their own."    The Macedonian president also said that journalists at a  news  conference in Sofia were most interested in the possiblity of  Macedonia joining a former Yugoslav republic or some neighboring  state. According to him, this is an issue that has been decided  once and for all, because Macedonia has become a free,  sovereign, and independent country and no other option can be  taken into consideration.</p>

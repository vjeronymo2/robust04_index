			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> SHE OFFERS A SPORTING PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> ANITA DEFRANTZ LOOKS AT VACANT LOTS AND EMPTY SCHOOLYARDS AND SEES A WAY TO  HEAL COMMUNITIES. AS KEEPER OF THE OLYMPIC SURPLUS, SHE HAS THE MONEY TO MAKE  IT POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> Through the covetous eyes of Anita DeFrantz, the woman who presides over  Southern California's $90-million share of the 1984 Olympic surplus, parking  lots appear as soccer fields in waiting, locked schoolyards are wasted  community parks, and gymnasiums in gang territory -- these are untapped  treasures, potential 24-hour shelters from the violence outside.  </P> <P> "I've heard about a program in Maryland called the 'midnight leagues,' where  kids can play basketball through the night," DeFrantz was telling the director  of just such a gymnasium in Mona Park near Compton, scanning the rickety  facility as she spoke.  </P> <P> "Yeah, but I tell you," the gang-wise director said doubtfully, "that would be  like putting targets on their backs."  </P> <P> "What they were saying," DeFrantz persisted, patiently but emphatically, "is it  gave them someplace to go. It's down the road, but it's a possibility. It's  tough, but these facilities are here. And we ought to use them."  </P> <P> DeFrantz, a 37-year-old Santa Monica resident, is widely recognized as one of  the most powerful women in sports. A bronze medalist rower in the 1976  Olympics, DeFrantz led an unsuccessful fight to overturn the U.S. boycott of  the 1980 Moscow games. In 1984, she served as a prominent member of Peter  Ueberroth's team of Olympic organizers, and she since has been elected to the  International Olympic Committee, one of two U.S. members on the prestigious  panel. She also sits on the executive board of the U.S. Olympic Committee.  </P> <P> While her stature in sports is international, it is Southern California that  has provided DeFrantz with a living laboratory to develop and test her theories  on the societal possibilities of sport. For the last two years, DeFrantz has  served as president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (AAF),  the organization that manages the region's share of a $250-million surplus  generated by the 1984 Games -- money that Ueberroth promised throughout would  go only to "kids."  </P> <P> With this sizable stake and her crusader-like zeal, DeFrantz has set out to  demonstrate that sports, properly organized and executed, can unite cities torn  apart by crime and poverty, and can rescue children who might otherwise be lost  to street-gang warfare -- or just simply lost. She intends to expand on the  bromide that sports builds character: envisioning community sports clubs that  become central forces within neighborhoods, and sports activities that are  elevated into outdoor classrooms, teaching children mathematics as they score a  baseball game, geometry as they race a sailboat.  </P> <P> At a time when children in Los Angeles all too frequently fall victim to crack  cocaine or rifle blasts, the notion that salvation might somehow be found in  dribbling basketballs or running wind sprints is not an easy sell, yet DeFrantz  keeps selling.  </P> <P> "We know now that they take part in gangs," she said in an interview. "We know  now that they use drugs, that they're teen mothers. So why don't we try  something that gives these kids an opportunity to choose? There's much that can  be done for our community through sports. Sports provides a basic tenet of our  society, being successful."  </P> <P> DeFrantz can transform venues as varied as an international sports forum in  Athens, a dinner gathering in West Los Angeles and a high school in downtown  Los Angeles into pulpits from which she makes her case. And whether she is  speaking to one of the studio moguls that sit on her board, or a member of  European royalty at an IOC function, or a South-Central Los Angeles community  activist who has come seeking grant money, the message is always the same --  what sports can do for our children.  </P> <P> Trained as a lawyer, DeFrantz speaks her mind softly but with authority,  sprinkling the words and anecdotes of Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman  and film maker Spike Lee with her own. At 5 feet, 11 inches, she has a  commanding physical presence.  </P> <P> DeFrantz also advances her philosophy through the foundation's awarding of  grants to existing organizations and through the creation of its own programs,  which include an effort to train coaches to bring children broader lessons  about sport.  </P> <P> She travels Southern California in a black Buick Park Avenue, dropping in on  programs the foundation has financed and exploring potential sites for more  activities, and in her rounds DeFrantz has collected many horror stories. She  has seen poor children who make do with a soda can for a baseball bat, who play  soccer with a bundle of rags as the ball. She has seen children "with shoes  that don't come close to fitting, who don't have the energy to play because  they're not getting enough to eat."  </P> <P> These, more than anyone, are the children DeFrantz wants to reach with the  Olympic surplus.  </P> <P> "You have to make the playing field level," she said, "so anybody can walk on  it."  </P> <P> DeFrantz, a single woman with no children, seems to know a lot about kids, and  gives them an uncommon measure of respect.  </P> <P> "I was once a child," she said, laughing. "And I have very vivid memories of  what that was like."  </P> <P> She speaks softly of a childhood spent in segregated Indianapolis, Ind., of  being a little girl of no more than 9 or 10, swimming on a team at the  Frederick Douglass swimming pool. Her father, a community activist, held big  dreams that his only daughter would one day plunge across the color line and  into Olympic history by becoming the first African American to win an Olympic  gold medal in swimming.  </P> <P> But there wasn't much time to practice in a segregated pool closed nine months  of the year, and DeFrantz remembers how difficult it was to compete with white  children who practiced year-round.  </P> <P> "I knew that the kids at the Riviera Country Club had something I was being  excluded from," she said. "I think my passion comes partly from denial. . . . I  know that I missed out on something. That's why I crusade for kids to have it.'  </P> <P> It is a long way from Frederick Douglass pool in Indianapolis to the swank  Sports Club LA in West Los Angeles, where on a recent night DeFrantz could be  found addressing the Stanford Professional Women of Los Angeles County. The  audience of about 30 career women, most of them white, had come expecting a  feminist theme. DeFrantz, however, stuck mainly to sports, although she added  some twists that seemed to draw in the crowd.  </P> <P> "I think we have to make sure the youth are taken care of," DeFrantz told them.  "I hope some of you in this room got the chance to take part in sports when you  were young. If you did, you can think about that one moment when everything  worked. When you caught the pass.  </P> <P> "Each man has that moment," she continued. "We want to make sure no girl in  this community is denied that moment."  </P> <P> DeFrantz herself graduated with honors from Connecticut College, where, she  recalled pointedly, she played her first organized baseball game. She earned a  law degree at the University of Pennsylvania, and at the same time won a spot  on the 1976 Olympic rowing team. She was also prepared to compete in the 1980  Moscow Games and her efforts to overturn the U.S. boycott gained her  international notice and were honored by the IOC. It also prompted a call from  Ueberroth, and before long DeFrantz was employed by the L.A. Olympic Organizing  Committee. She has been a resident of Southern California ever since.  </P> <P> She works now out of the Britt House, a 79-year-old restored home on West Adams  Boulevard that serves as the AAF headquarters. Since 1985, the AAF has provided  more than $16 million worth of grants to 276 athletic organizations and  programs, with an emphasis on sports activities that benefit girls, the poor  and the handicapped. The grant money mainly has been drawn from interest and  investments generated by the surplus, which remains intact at about $90  million.  </P> <P> DeFrantz, who was with AAF from the start and became president two years ago,  was a leading proponent of the idea that the foundation should do more than  simply pass out grants. Rather, DeFrantz believes, the Olympic legacy should be  used to create what she and others call a "sports renaissance."  </P> <P> It was a new concept to some, a little difficult to understand. "It took time  to really come to grips with everything; it was a new approach," said board  member William Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles  County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Robertson serves along with television  producer David L. Wolper, who is chairman of the AAF board, Mayor Tom Bradley,  Los Angeles Dodgers President Peter O'Malley, entertainment executive Lew  Wasserman and 12 others.  </P> <P> Steve Montiel, who worked with DeFrantz in helping create the AAF and now  serves as president of the Institute for Journalism Education, recalled that  she "talked about sport in a way I had not heard sport talked about before . .  . (and) the light went on."  </P> <P> One of the most ambitious elements of the DeFrantz vision is sports clubs,  which she views as community centerpieces, "providing opportunities where there  are none. (They can) bring communities together and develop traditions in  communities that don't have tradition; develop infrastructures in communities  that don't have infrastructures."  </P> <P> The AAF sports clubs, to be situated initially in the Mar Vista Gardens and  Jordan Downs housing projects, Mona Park near Compton and Southwest Community  College, are based loosely on a club system prevalent in Eastern Europe, where  children are exposed to sports at an early age and throughout their teen years.  </P> <P> But unlike their European counterparts, where children are often groomed to be  Olympians, the primary goal of the AAF sports clubs will be to introduce  athletics to communities that would normally have little opportunity for  sports.  </P> <P> "It's an era where kids are struggling to find things to tie them to a  community," DeFrantz said. "One thing I heard about Los Angeles before I came  here was nobody knows their neighbors. Finding things that can bring people  together is important . . . (and) education is one way. Sports is another.  </P> <P> "I think with such a culturally diverse community, you can't expect everybody  to go to the same church as they might in rural America. We need ties that run  through and connect. And what better way to tie those people together than  through our children?"  </P> <P> The clubs would operate out of existing facilities in low-income neighborhoods  with a goal of economic self-sufficiency. Children could join for a nominal  fee. They would receive membership cards, uniforms and coaching, and would be  allowed to participate in organized competition. The clubs would be run by  community members.  </P> <P> A special emphasis would be placed on ensuring that well-trained coaches  supervise the activities, and that children be introduced to sports that  otherwise might escape their interest. DeFrantz sees no reason why inner-city  children should not be taught to fence, say, or even to sail.  </P> <P> At present, the only club in operation meets weekly at Los Angeles Southwest  Community College, where early on a recent Saturday about 30 children had  gathered to perform warm-up calisthenics in the cool morning sunlight. And by 9  a.m., braids flying in the breeze, sneakers beating against the dirt, the  children were off and running around a former Olympic training track.  </P> <P> They had come from throughout south Los Angeles, with some of the mothers  arriving in hair rollers and sweats, a concession to the early start. The club  had been meeting every Saturday morning since late last summer.  </P> <P> "It's a family thing over here at Southwest" said Barbara Edmonson, a mother  who had brought five children, two of them her own, to the track.  </P> <P> Kathy Kelly, another mother, said she had noticed changes in her 14-year-old  daughter and other children: "Things you thought you never could do they find  they can. And when you accomplish small things, the bigger things get easier,  and you go through life with the attitude that you can do whatever you want.  </P> <P> "They're not ghetto-blasting, pants-sagging kids," she said, proudly. "They  want to look good. They have pride in themselves."  </P> <P> It is DeFrantz's dream that sports clubs like Southwest "will endure and  eventually become intergenerational," and that the system might one day be  exported to other cities.  </P> <P> She believes that sports clubs offer something different than such established  programs as the YMCA and Boys' Clubs.  </P> <P> "The Boys' Clubs and YMCAs have general programs," she said. "Our sole focus is  on sports. Our clubs belong to the community and represent the community's  desires. It's not some association coming in and setting its philosophy down on  a community. It's a chance for the community to own something of its own."  </P> <P> It is DeFrantz's belief that sports are a mirror of society, and that  athletics, like any other educational tool or service -- be it good schools or  decent social programs -- are often denied to the poor.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get the city to do what it should be doing in the poor areas,"  she was telling one of her staff members at the Britt House one afternoon.  "This system is designed to destroy the poor parts. We're trying to show that  anybody can do this with the proper support.  </P> <P> "You can look at sports and see how just a society is," she later elaborated.  "Sports initially were segregated by economics and they still are by virtue of  access. . . . We want to make sure every young person in Southern California  has a chance to experience what sports has to offer."  </P> <P> Although DeFrantz has particular concerns about poor children, she believes  that all youth should have access to sport, and AAF grants. The foundation, she  said, attempts to spread the surplus among all Southern California communities.  </P> <P> "I call it a birthright," she said. "It comes with being human. . . . Some kids  with less may need it more, but they should all have it. That's my philosophy."  </P> <P> DeFrantz spends most of her time on the hunt for new program ideas, new ways to  get children interested in a wide variety of sports, new places to put  activities.  </P> <P> "Our vision," she said, "is to have every sports facility being used all the  time." She gains inspiration from a basketball tournament staged in a Santa  Monica parking lot. "I figured if they could do it, we could. . . . That's  another resource -- parking lots -- where we can put major events, like soccer  which can be played on asphalt."  </P> <P> Schoolyards locked shut over weekends and after dark trouble her: "We have  schools that are locked up and closed as many hours as they're open. The  facility is there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the community needs to  feel it owns the school, (and should be allowed) to utilize its gymnasium, its  playing field -- when the administrators go home."  </P> <P> The AAF lobbies schools to keep facilities unlocked and supervised after school  hours.  </P> <P> In DeFrantz's view, sports offers untapped educational opportunities. While she  stressed that games are no substitute for schoolwork, the two can complement  each other.  </P> <P> "The kid who is good in math," she said, "could be superb in sailing, figuring  out the vectors and angles. The kid who loves baseball and keeps the statistics  may not know she'll be the next physics whiz."  </P> <P> Sports can also teach patience, she said, and other important lessons not  taught in classrooms -- or on the streets.  </P> <P> "Our kids grow up thinking everything is immediate," DeFrantz said. "That's one  of the things about gangs. Gangs have no sense of the future. It's all now  because most of those kids don't make it into the future."  </P> <P> Given a chance to be a part of a team, she said, children "have a sense of  history. They know things progress from one game to the next. And they are  people who respect the human capability of excellence."  </P> <P> So far, community reaction to the AAF approach seems positive, although  everyone -- including DeFrantz -- agrees that the foundation has just begun to  become a presence.  </P> <P> Recreation directors in low-income neighborhoods that have been chosen as  sports club sites said they did not have to be sold on the value of athletics  as an anti-gang tool. Even some of the gang members seem to respect the  potential of sports.  </P> <P> "There's a saying among the older guys that athletes are off-limits," said  Glenda Howry, who has been director of the Jordan Downs housing project  recreation center for five years. "If they find out a kid is halfway good in a  sport and trying to excel," they leave the child alone. "I guess they feel  that's their only way out."  </P> <P> DeFrantz, a patient crusader, said she sees an energy growing: "It becomes a  synergy. This isn't tomorrow or next month. It's 10 years from now. But if we  want the energy to go into the 21st Century, now's the time to turn up the  voltage."  </P> <P> Reality, though, can throw up high hurdles. In Mona Park gym, director Winston  Phillips still had trouble swallowing the notion of staging basketball games  there in the middle of the night. He thought that at a minimum it would be  necessary to post a police guard.  </P> <P> "We could (try) it," Phillips said. "But we'd have to have a car stationed  here, because if the rival gang members got the word, there could be trouble."  </P> <P> That the gym director agreed to at least consider a midnight basketball league  seemed to satisfy DeFrantz, for the moment. She walked outside the gym and  watched as a swarm of tiny children played together on swings in the sand. She  lingered over the scene of happy commotion for several minutes, smiling.  </P></p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Dow Chemical put in red by Dollars 370m charge DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, says it will take a one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 370m against fourth-quarter earnings. The charge, which will cover write-downs and write-offs, will push the company into the red for the period. It will include a previously-announced shutdown of Dow Canada Sarnia's chlor-alkali and derivatives facilities. Dow said the charge also covered lower forecast values for oil and gas in Canada which have decreased the asset value of these properties. It said the move was consistent with its strategy to diversify into specialities. Mr Enrique Falla, chief financial officer, said Dow expected fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations to 'exceed 35 cents per share, in line with financial analysts' expectations'. Dow is due to post its fourth-quarter results on January 30. Concern about possible litigation over silicone gel breast implants made by Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, the glass products manufacturer, prompted Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Dow Corning and Corning senior debt ratings. Dow Corning's senior debt rating was cut to A2 from Aa2. The company's long-term debt and commercial paper ratings were placed under review for possible downgrade. Although the implants bring in only 1 per cent of Dow Corning's annual sales, there is increasing concern the company may be flooded with lawsuits amid the growing controversy over the long-term safety of the devices. While Moody's downgraded Corning's long-term senior debt rating to single-A2 from single-A1, the rating agency left Dow Chemical's rating unchanged.</p>

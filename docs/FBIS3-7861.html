The commander of UN forces in Bosnia said he had "an  agreement in principle not in writing" with Bosnian Serb  authorities and that he felt he needed a written agreement.    The Brotherhood and Unity bridge between the Serb-held  Grbavica part of the Bosnian capital and the mainly Moslem rest  of the city was to be opened to civilian pedestrian traffic.  "I'm not going to push the issue on either side today," said  Rose. "I'm afraid you'll all have to come back in a couple of  days' time," he told reporters.    In Belgrade Sunday, Bosnian Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic  said his troops would use force to stop the re-opening of  Grbavica bridge. The cancellation left over 100 Sarajevo  residents, who had come to the bridge, disappointed that they  could not see or get news of loved ones in Grbavica they had not  seen in some cases since the war began in April 1992.</p>

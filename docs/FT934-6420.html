			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Builders see signs of fragile upturn Evidence of a faltering recovery in Britain's construction industry emerged yesterday with the announcement that orders for new work were up 10 per cent in the three months to the end of September compared with the corresponding three months last year. Department of the Environment figures show orders in the first nine months up 7.5 per cent compared with the first three quarters of 1992. Most of the rises have been in public and private housing work and other public construction. The industry fears that these sectors may be hit badly in next week's Budget. Most vulnerable is thought to be government spending on housing associations, which the chancellor is expected to trim by at least a further Pounds 300m in 1994-95. Orders for housing associations and other public housing jumped by 45 per cent in the first nine months of this year. Private housebuilding orders rose 8.8 per cent over the same period. Housebuilders said that the fragile recovery in private housing would be undermined if the chancellor decided to announce further cuts in mortgage tax relief in the Budget. Private investment in factories, warehouses, shops and offices has remained at a low ebb, with industrial orders rising only 1.8 per cent and private commercial orders at about the same level as in the first nine months of last year. Private industrial and commercial orders, however, rose sharply in the three months to the end of September - both rose by 11 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'The latest figures are encouraging but surprising given the present mood of the industry.' He added: 'New-order figures over the last year have been extremely erratic. A sustained improvement in workload is necessary before we can be sure recovery is really under way. The construction industry waits with bated breath for the chancellor's Budget.' About 150,000 new home starts are expected to be registered with the National House Building Council this year, about 19 per cent up on last year and the best level for three years, the NHBC said yesterday.</p>

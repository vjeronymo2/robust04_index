			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Saudi  Arabia agreed to conclude pacts on investment guarantees and  avoidance of double taxation at a joint committee session this  week in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. The two  countries also promised to cooperate in improving conditions for  South Korean construction companies operating in Saudi Arabia,  the Ministry said. The committee, the 10th of its kind, was  convened after a five-year hiatus.    Seoul officials captured Riyadh's interest with proposals to  jointly bid for construction contracts in third countries and  for South Korea to participate in the Saudis' railroad-building  project. Saudi Arabia, in return, asked for more private-level  economic cooperation suited to the changing political situation  in the Middle East after the Gulf War, the drop in international  oil prices and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.    South Korea registered 3.73 billion U.S. dollars in imports  from Saudi Arabia last year, mostly crude oil, and posted  exports of 940 million dollars. Although a heavy imbalance may  be inevitable due to oil purchases, officials said they want to  rectify it as much as possible -- through a more active advance  into the Saudi construction market, for example. Officials said  the two sides agreed to work on expanding bilateral  import-export activities.</p>

Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the  United Nations, and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Tom Hubbard met for 90 minutes and were expected to resume talks  after a break, but they did not, the officials said. The  meeting reportedly ended early when North Korea demanded that  the terms of the Pyongyang-Washington agreement be written down  on paper.    American officials said they needed to consult among  themselves on whether to accept the demand.    Pyongyang and Washington reportedly negotiated the accord's  details, specifically how and when the two Koreas will reopen  dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States will  announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team  Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level  talks.    The U.S. State Department maintains that around the time  that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin  in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume.  After that, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for the  third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be  announced.    Seoul officials said that despite repeated promises by  Washington on these terms, Pyongyang wants a more concrete  commitment.    The two sides are not expected to exchange official  documents  on the agreement they are working on, but are likely to write  down the accord's major points on non-official paper, they said.    Although North Korea and the United States will meet again  on  Thursday, final and immediate agreement cannot be expected since  the North Korean negotiators need time to consult with their  home government, according to the officials.    Chances are, therefore, that the IAEA inspection team will  arrive in Pyongyang next Monday since the only remaining flight  to Pyongyang from Beijing is this Saturday.</p>

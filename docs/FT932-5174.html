			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Miners plan W Australian gas pipeline THREE OF Australia's leading mining companies, Western Mining Corporation, BHP Minerals and Normandy Poseidon, have lodged a proposal to build a ADollars 400m (Pounds 175m) gas pipeline to link Western Australia's gas fields with the state's mineral production centres. The three companies announced yesterday they had formed a joint venture called Goldfields Gas Transmission in response to an invitation from the Western Australian government. The envisaged pipeline would transmit gas from the North West Shelf region to the state's gold and other metal projects along a route stretching more than 1,500 km to the south-east. The chairman of the GGT management committee, Mr Don Morley, said yesterday that the purpose of the pipeline, which would be built and funded by the private sector, was to reduce energy costs. 'This is complementary to the interests of the joint venturers in GGT whose collective energy needs represent between 75 and 90 per cent of the initial pipeline loads,' he said. Mr Morley said the GGT proposal envisaged that third parties would have access to the pipeline at fair tariffs. Other parties would also be considered for direct participation in the project. GGT was prepared to begin environmental and aboriginal heritage studies on the pipeline route immediately if the Western Australian government approved the project, Mr Morely said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the news segment of </F> the "Dalniy Vostok" program]    [Text] Japan could have begun construction of a maritime  complex for the storage and processing of liquid radioactive  waste from the Pacific Fleet in Maritime Kray in June [sentence  as heard]. A corresponding intergovernmental agreement has been  concluded and construction will be financed from the $100  million which Japan has earmarked as aid for Russia and the CIS  countries for dismantling nuclear weapons.    Selection of a maritime waste storage system was conditioned  by the Maritime Kray people's opposition to storage of  radioactive substances on land. In this way Tokyo will  contribute to speeding up the stalled process of nuclear  disarmament in the Far East, particularly where nuclear  submarines are concerned, since only the unsolved problem of  liquid radioactive waste is hampering their dismantlement.  Presently the tanker TNT-5 [on which liquid waste is stored]  has been moved from the bay near Bolshoy Kamen village further  south to Pavlovskogo Bay.</p>

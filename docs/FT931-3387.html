			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling falls THE MARCH short sterling futures contract dipped around five basis points yesterday, as dealers all but abandoned hopes for a Budget interest rate cut today. Weekend newspaper reports that tax increases in the Budget were likely to be modest, and stronger than expected manufacturing output figures yesterday, reduced already waning expectations. Some dealers thought that a fiscally tight Budget would be accompanied by another full percentage point cut in interest rates. However, reports suggest that the chancellor is set to increase the overall tax burden by as little as Pounds 2bn. A 0.8 per cent rise in manufacturing output in January, compared with the previous month, added to the feeling that pressure on the government to ease monetary policy was lifting. The month-on-month increase compared with expectations for a 0.1 per cent rise and added to evidence that the economy is at a turning point. The March contract, which opened at 94.12, moved as low as 94.06 during the day and closed at around 94.08. Contracts further out also fell. The June contract dropped 7 basis points from the opening to end at 94.57 in late trading. On the money markets, short dated cash rates were squeezed higher by a large forecast liquidity shortage which the Bank of England had difficulty relieving. By midday the Bank had removed only Pounds 353m of a Pounds 1.4bn shortage and overnight rates crept as high as 13 per cent. The Bank made better progress in the afternoon, purchasing bills totalling Pounds 1.03bn and providing late assistance of Pounds 20m. Overnight rates drifted to just below 8 per cent, while the three-month interbank rate finished unchanged at around 5 15/16 per cent. In continental European futures trading, dealers reported that agreement on the Solidarity Pact in Germany had improved the underlying tone of the market, even if some doubts about a Bundes-bank easing on Thursday still existed. 'There are still sufficient underlying tensions in the European exchange rate mech-anism to prompt a sell-off in the Continental markets if the Bundesbank decides not to do anything,' warned one. The market has priced in a half-point cut in the discount rate. A full one point cut would prompt a significant rally.</p>

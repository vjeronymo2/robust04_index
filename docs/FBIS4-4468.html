			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- A report issued overnight by  the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) putting Japan top of the  list of nations with trade barriers is not intended to slap  sanctions immediately against Japan, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday.    "The USTR report is just one step of the procedures under  the  super 301," Fujii told a regular press conference after a  morning cabinet meeting. "Super 301" is a retaliatory provision  of a U.S. Trade Law recently reinstated by the Clinton  administration. The report "does not mean a unilateral action  against Japan," he said.    In its report for 1994, the USTR listed trade barriers in 39  nations and designated 49 sectors in seven fields for Japan.    Asked about Japan's market-opening measures launched Tuesday  in hope of resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the  United States, Fujii quoted U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor as saying that "the U.S. is not discouraged, and the door  is open." Fujii said, "we must actively take the measures  decided voluntarily in the package."    Turning to domestic issues, Fujii called for swift enactment  of the fiscal 1994 provisional budget that failed to become law  Thursday, the last day before the fiscal year started Friday.    The government submitted the stopgap budget worth some 11  trillion yen to the Diet on Tuesday. The measure is intended to  bridge a delay in approval by the Diet of the full budget for  fiscal 1994.    The provisional budget passed the House of Representatives,  but deliberations hit a snag in the House of Councillors on  Thursday in furious debate over Prime Minister Morihiro  hosokawa's alleged stock dealings and loans.</p>

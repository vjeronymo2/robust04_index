			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / People: Turton takes up arms for Citizens A woman tipped as a future permanent secretary in Whitehall has been given the high-profile job of fronting the prime minister's drive to smarten up the public services. Genie Turton, deputy secretary in the environment department, becomes director of the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter unit on July 11. Turton, 48, is currently head of the cities and countryside group in the environment department and a member of the Chancellor's Private Finance panel. She is one of the growing number of senior mandarins with experience of business, gained through the Cabinet Office programme for strengthening links between the public and private sectors. After a secondment to Midland Bank, she was a non-executive director of the Woolwich Building Society between 1987 and 1991. A graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, Turton joined the ministry of transport as a fast-stream entrant in 1970. After a spell in the Cabinet Office as head of the machinery of government division in the early 1980s, she became director of heritage and royal estate in the environment department with responsibility for royal palaces such as Hampton Court and the Tower of London. In 1991 she was promoted to deputy secretary in charge of the department's housing and urban group. She lists her hobbies as books, music and shopping. She replaces Brian Hilton, who returns to his old department, Trade and Industry, to take charge of the research laboratories. Hilton, 54, was spirited from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1991 to create a unit that would implement Major's Citizen's Charter. He says he has hugely enjoyed the task of giving life to the charter: 'It is now common currency in the language. It is inconceivable that we should ever return to the days when there were no standards of service in the public sector, and nobody cared whether performance targets were met.'</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Mr Jacques Chirac hopes to succeed President Mitterrand Mr Jacques Chirac, the president of the neo-Gaullist RPR party, who is hoping to succeed President Mitterrand SEEN as a weak link in the Yes camp, Mr Chirac, 59, initially refused to commit himself either way on European union, inhibited by the deep divisions in his party. Faced with the knowledge that the RPR would split over Europe whatever he did, this former prime minister eventually climbed off the fence in July and said he would vote in favour of European union, but leave the party rank and file free to go their own way. The result has been a surreal RPR television campaign, in which the party has divided its air time equally between arguments for and against European union. He is campaigning on the theme that France will be stronger in a post-Maastricht Europe than it is now. He also argues that General de Gaulle would have believed the same. 'There is no serious alternative to the unity of nations. Maastricht is the continuation of an action desired by General de Gaulle,' he told his opening campaign rally earlier this week. Socialists, however, suspect that the Gaullist idea of a Europe of loosely co-operating sovereign states and the pooling of sovereignty proposed in the treaty are incompatible.</p>

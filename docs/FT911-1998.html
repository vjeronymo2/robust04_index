			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Turkish and Soviet banks in joint venture TURKIYE Emlak Bankas, the country's third largest bank, is to set up an offshore banking joint venture with Tveruniversalbank of the Soviet Union. The new bank will operate in Istanbul's free trade zone. Offshore banking was legalised in September last year, and the government hopes that Turkey will attract business which currently goes to centres in the Arab Middle East. The joint venture is the second between Turkish and Soviet banks. Last month, Ziraat, the state-owned agriculture bank, announced plans for a joint venture with a Soviet bank. Emlak is understood to be also discussing setting up a joint venture bank in the Soviet Union with Tveruniversalbank to finance bilateral trade and construction projects. Trade relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are expanding rapidly because of Turkish purchases of Soviet natural gas. Last year, Turkey bought 4.1bn cubic metres of Soviet natural gas at a cost of Dollars 1.5bn, but plans to buy up to Dollars 5bn of gas annually by the mid-1980s. To date, four privately-owned Turkish banks and four foreign banks - Arab-ian Express Bank, Arab Bank, United Bank, and Dubai Islamic Bank - have applied to set up off-shore banking units in Istanbul.</p>

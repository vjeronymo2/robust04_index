			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters feel 'green' squeeze ENVIRONMENTAL pressures are causing a structural change in the metals smelting industry - particularly in copper and zinc smelting - that will force smelters to raise prices charged to the mining industry by 20 to 25 per cent, according to Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and mining group. He suggests that in the short term copper miners can afford to absorb the increase in smelter treatment charges but this is not the case for the zinc miners. And, 'in the medium to longer term, the higher processing costs will have to be reflected in (metal) prices,' warns Mr Baack. He says, in MG's latest metals markets survey, that smelters are suffering 'irreversible' changes to their revenues and costs, changes directly or indirectly related to pollution control measures. To comply with present standards, smelters need to spend up to a third of their capital investment and operating costs on control measures, he points out. At the same time, some revenue-producing by-products of the smelting process, such as sulphuric acid and cadmium, are threatened by present environmental trends. Smelters, forced to capture more sulphur from ores, are producing much more sulphuric acid, yet demand for the acid has fallen - also because of environmental factors. Mr Baack says it is possible that before long smelters will have to pay heavily to dispose of sulphuric acid. He points out that the price of cadmium has also fallen so low that it is hardly worth recovering during zinc smelting. 'Since the use of cadmium is being further restricted because of its toxicity, it is unlikely that the market will recover,' Mr Baack adds. 'As a consequence of this development, higher smelting charges are unavoidable. . . Surcharges of between 20 and 25 per cent can be reckoned on.'</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Monday Interview: 'We're insiders and usurpers' - Sir Michael Perry tells Guy de Jonquieres of Unilever's prospects after the Uruguay Round For a group its size - its Pounds 25bn annual sales dwarf the economies of many of the 150 countries in which it does business - Unilever has long kept a remarkably low profile. As Sir Michael Perry, co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products manufacturer, puts it: 'We have always believed in letting our brands do the singing.' Recently, however, Unilever has begun to raise its corporate voice. Early last month Floris Maljers, Perry's Dutch counterpart, led a group of Europe's most powerful industrialists in calling publicly on governments to cut social costs, speed up deregulation and listen more closely to industry. Soon afterwards, Unilever saw another, more ambitious, lobbying initiative pay off when agreement was reached in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. For months beforehand, top executives had hammered away at the importance of getting a deal - and the dire economic consequences of failure. In private, they delivered the same message to the world's politicians. Now the deal is done, what is in it for Unilever? The direct benefits look surprisingly modest. Because the group, which has plants in 80 countries, makes many products locally, few are vulnerable to trade barriers. None the less, it expects increasingly to move products across borders and to supply worldwide from a single source so as to capture scale economies. It is also relieved to see the resolution of the long-running trade dispute over oilseeds, of which, as the leading margarine producer, it is a big purchaser. But for Perry, the Uruguay Round is as important as a guarantee of continued free trade as for its specific provisions. Had the Round collapsed, the world trade system would probably have dissolved into regional trade blocs as wealthier economies banded together behind protectionist walls. That, he admits, would not have all been bad news for Unilever, given its wide international spread. 'One can argue that in the short term at least, a measure of protection is not something people sniff at. It has advantages if you happen to be an insider.' The snag was that those advantages would have been bought at the expense of poorer economies, such as India and Africa, where Unilever also has big stakes. The closing of industrialised markets could have threatened economic development in China, where it is rapidly stepping up investments. That matters a lot to Unilever, which relies increasingly for growth on fast-expanding, and highly profitable, operations outside the stagnant markets of western Europe and north America. Another big plus from the Round is that pressure is kept on developing countries to plug away at broader economic liberalisation. Still, the process is not a one-way bet. In India, where the group's local subsidiary is the second largest publicly-quoted company, liberalisation will make it easier to do business - but also for new competitors to enter the market. 'So we have a foot in both camps. We're insider and usurper,' Perry says. Nor does he expect the political path ahead to be entirely smooth. 'The big problem these governments face is that, if they are democracies, they have a rather sad and difficult imperative - they want to be re-elected next time round. If ripping away bureaucracy and protection leads to massive disadvantage for local interests, there is a political price attached.' That dilemma is not confined to the developing world. Perry foresees 'new stresses and strains' as the European Union wrestles with declining industrial competitiveness and high labour costs, while facing growing pressure to underwrite political stability in the countries of central and eastern Europe by opening its market to their exports. 'The reality is that right next door, in east Germany, the Czech Republic and so on, there are massively lower costs which are going to threaten the standard of living of everyone else in Europe and increase pressures on structural unemployment.' Here, too, Unilever finds itself on both sides of the argument. It would like more freedom to export to the west from the low-cost plants in central Europe. 'If we don't, our competitors will, and our shareholders won't thank us for putting them at a disadvantage,' Perry says. Yet the group also has a huge stake in western Europe, where it makes more than half its sales and employs more than 100,000 people. If things were left to the laws of supply and demand, labour costs in the EU would plunge, he says. 'But since we all want passionately to cling to gains in our standard of living, we shall do everything possible to prevent that. But something has got to give somewhere. In the past, the gap (in labour costs) was plugged by tariffs and protection. The dismantling of protection has to lead to another solution.' What might that be? Ideally, Perry says, the gap would be closed by a rise in living standards in the developing world. The differential could also be narrowed by a reduction in social charges in western Europe, which would lower labour costs without eating too deeply into take-home pay. He is encouraged by the realistic tone of the recent white paper on competitiveness by Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. But he is far less sanguine about reducing long-term unemployment, which he considers the biggest threat to the world economy. 'There is little companies can do on their own. We will generate wealth by using every ounce of innovation and technology . . .to make products and services. But we are able to generate a unit of wealth these days with lower labour content than we were. Therein lies the dilemma. Where that takes us, I'm not sure. But it is an area where the old, easy, answers no longer apply.' With so much on its plate, he reckons, the EU needs to adjust to the impact of the Uruguay Round before it is ready to launch any further big initiatives in foreign economic policy. 'We now have to let the thing settle, let the patterns become clearer. It may lead to some recoil, some back-tracking.' But any period of reflection and consolidation is likely to be kept short by the rush of events elsewhere - above all by political change and uncertainty in the former Soviet Union and China. 'The threats to stability in Europe and the world are self-evident. To that extent, the arrangements put in place in the Uruguay Round, which appeared to fit the context of economic and geopolitical structures as they were yesterday, will have to be looked at again when patterns change. I can't put it any more precisely than that.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Born:      1934 in Eastbourne, Sussex Education: King William's College, Isle of Man, St John's College,            Oxford Career: 1957:      Management trainee, Lever Brothers 1968-77:   Marketing director, then chairman, Lever Brothers Thailand 1977-81:   President, Lever Argentina 1981-83:   Chairman, Nippon Lever 1983-85:   Joint managing director, United Africa Company International 1985:      Joins Unilever main board 1987-92:   Personal products co-ordinator and director of marketing 1992:      Chairman, Unilever  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

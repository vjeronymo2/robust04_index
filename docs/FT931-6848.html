			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Wilkinson Sword in likely sale to US group WARNER-LAMBERT, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, is in advanced negotiations to buy Wilkinson Sword, the razors and toiletries company put up for sale last year. It is understood that Warner-Lambert and Eemland, the Dutch-registered consortium of international investors which owns Wilkinson, aim to conclude negotiations early next month. Although a price has yet to be agreed, it is likely to be well below the Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) which Eemland had hoped to achieve. Warner-Lambert owns Schick, the second-largest US wet shaving products company. Acquisition of Wilkinson would give Schick a stronger base for European expansion and could provide keener competition for Gillette, the US company which dominates the world razor business. In Europe, Schick sells mainly in France and the Benelux countries. It has small market sales in Germany and Britain. Schick is also the leading supplier in Japan, the only country where it is ahead of Gillette. A deal would mark the fifth change of ownership since 1980 for Wilkinson Sword, which Eemland acquired from Stora, the Swedish forest products group, in a heavily leveraged buy-out five years ago. Eemland's main shareholders include a group of Scandinavian banks and insurance companies, JP Morgan, the US bank, and Gillette. Wilkinson was put up for sale in October, partly because the Scandinavian shareholders were not prepared to inject further capital. In addition, Gillette has been ordered by the European Commission and anti-trust authorities in the UK and several other countries to end its involvement in Eemland on the grounds that it is anti-competitive. Gillette has a 22 per cent non-voting stake in the consortium and has extended it a loan worth more than Dollars 100m on onerous terms and at an exceptionally high rate of interest. Eemland's debt is believed to total several hundred million dollars. Eemland's shareholders have agreed to sell Wilkinson with a debt-free balance sheet and share its financial liabilities between them. Wilkinson had operating profits of DM46.8m (Pounds 19.8m) on sales of DM316.3m in 1991. Its financial performance is understood to have deteriorated sharply since then, partly because of heavy marketing to support a razor system launched last spring. Wilkinson sells its products in the European Community and has a small loss-making business in the US. Gillette has also agreed, under pressure from anti-trust authorities, to hand back rights to the Wilkinson brand in central and eastern Europe.</p>

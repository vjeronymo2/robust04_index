			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Balint Magyar, executive </F> chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not  given: "People Cannot Legally Be Made To Adhere to the  Coalition Agreement"]    [Text] I dare say that it was not us who spent the most  money on the election campaign, Balint Magyar told MAGYAR  HIRLAP. We also interviewed Magyar, member of the coalition  negotiating team of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], on  the planned agreement and the chances of the negotiations.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What is the guarantee that the coalition  partners will adhere to the contents of the agreement that is to  be made?    [Magyar] The coalition agreement is a political arrangement  and of course no one can be forced by legal measures to adhere  to it. The agreement is valid while the sides observe it. If  someone violates the agreement, this means that he no longer  wishes to govern together with the partner. In this case, the  coalition can collapse. The coalition agreement establishes the  conditions for joint governmental decisionmaking, the  implementation of the jointly made decisions, and joint  responsibility for these.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people might believe that the coalition  talks have been halted because, according to the indications,  you did not manage to make any progress on 12 June.    [Magyar] The views are constantly being brought closer  together and the number of disputed issues is being reduced all  the time. With Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], we are continuously  coordinating the text on the mechanisms and guarantees of joint  governmental work. There is no need at all for concern; even in  Germany, the coalition talks last two to four weeks although  they already have established mechanisms for such talks.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is it possible that you will manage to agree  on the guarantees today or this week?    [Magyar] I would not exclude this possibility.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Between the two rounds of the elections, you  said that the MSZP would exclude the possibility of coalition  cooperation with the SZDSZ if it named [MSZP Chairman] Gyula  Horn as prime ministerial candidate. Did this cause any  problems in the negotiations?    [Magyar] Both parties acted independently when they set up  the negotiating delegations for the coalition talks. I find it  perfectly natural that neither side interfered in the other  side's selection of the delegation members or in determining its  size. As for the quoted statement, a fundamentally different  situation arose after the second round of the elections because  the MSZP acquired a 54 percent majority in Parliament.  According to the surveys, the majority of the MSZP's and  SZDSZ's voters are committed supporters of the two parties'  coalition, and the Socialists made a coalition offer to us. All  these made it perfectly clear for us that we had to enter the  coalition talks.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As one of the SZDSZ's influential  politicians, do you have governmental desires, would you accept  a nomination for some kind of governmental position?    [Magyar] I have already said many times that I do not have  such ambitions. I have not changed this view. As a matter of  fact, participation in the coalition talks does not necessarily  mean that the person in question wishes to take a role in the  new government.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] According to assessments published in the  press, the SZDSZ had spent the most money on the election  campaign. According to certain information, the party has  serious debts. I am asking you, as the SZDSZ's campaign chief,  what is true from all this?    [Magyar] The SZDSZ does not have serious debts. As a matter  of fact, the assessments of campaign costs did not contain the  costs of certain advertisement carriers. The SZDSZ used the  amount that is had at its disposal during the campaign rather  efficiently. I dare say that it was not us who spent the most  money on the campaign but at least two parties were ahead of us  in this.</p>

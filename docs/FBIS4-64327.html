			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Goodman and Dean Godson: "Is It Possible </F> for Britain to Pull Out of Europe?"]    [Text] A Britain restored to its former glory, once again  master of its destiny and the workshop of the world. Or, an  introverted little island, buffeted amidst its North Sea setting  by the chill waves of economlc isolatlon.    Two very different visions of Britain's future outside the  EC. Which would prove more accurate? Before the question can be  answered, a further one poses itself: How possible would it be  for Britain to leave the EC? Slipping anchor and sailing away  from standardised condoms, bans on British bangers and Jacques  Delors is not easy as it sounds. Never mind Maastricht, the  real problem is the 1972 European Communities Act. It was this  that confirmed Britain as a member of what is now the EC. To  this day, academics tear each other's beards out over what it  implies. It set out the terms under which Britain joined the  Community, however, it said nothing about how Britain could  leave.    Simple, say some. No Parliament can bind its successor. So  a future Parliament could simply repeal the 1972 Act. Not so,  answer others. As the terms under which Britain joined the EC  acknowleged the supremacy of Community law -- it supersedes that  of member states -- we cannot leave, since there is no lawful  means.    Greenland, of course, got out in 1984. But Greenland, a  former Danish colony, is rather an unusual case. Antony  Bradley, a former professor of constitutional law, sees a  potential goldmine for m'learned friends.    "Unless withdrawal could be by agreement, Central European  institutions and member states might have claims for  compensation under international law," he said. However, he  adds that, were terms for withdrawal to be agreed with the rest  of the EC, Parliament could probably get away with it.    What then? Doom, disaster, and everything short of a plague  of locusts, according to Europhiles. "Disastrous...suicide,"  said Sir David Knox, the Europhile Tory MP. "Those who want to  leave are living in a fantasy world; 60 percent of our exports  now go to the EC. If we left, we'd have no say in setting the  rules."    Figures, as vague as they are alarming, support this view:  2.5 million jobs are at risk, employers have warned. Last  week, Howard Davies, the Director General of the CBI  [Confederation of British Industry], reiterated that the  organisation is "committed to making a success of Britain's  membership." Farmers seem to agree. "The single market  provides important opportunities for British farmers," said Paul  Reiderman of the National Farmers' Union.    Bunkum, say Euro-sceptics. "The outcome would be  astonishingly positive," said Teddy Taylor, the outspoken  Euro-sceptic. "Exports to the EC have risen less fast than  imports: the deficit since 1973 has been 1 billion pounds.  Then there is the saving from quitting the Common Agricultural  Policy -- 32 pounds a week per family. And what about the costs  to Britain of EC decisions, like the 350 pounds million payment  to former local and health authority workers?"    He also questions the assumption that leaving the EC would  ignite a trade war. "You don't have to be an EC member to be  part of the single market -- look at the EFTA states like  Sweden."    The benefits of withdrawal roll on. VAT [value-added tax]  would be slashed were our 2.3 billion pound EC contribution to  cease. The City, as an offshore financial centre, would be  largely unaffected -- and could even prosper. Since we trade  more outside the EC than any other member state save Denmark,  Euro-sceptics foresee Britain's tranformation into a vibrant  independent nation -- "Europe's Singapore."    It is all, perhaps, a bit too good to be true. Britain could  survive outside the EC, but it would not be plain sailing. "The  City would hardly suffer at all," said Tim Congdon, of Lombard  Street Associates, "but it is possible that trade barriers could  rise in the event of Britain departing." Back to Paul  Reiderman: "The voice of British agriculture is stronger as a  result of being part of a European trading block than it would  be otherwise. How much weight would we carry on our own in  GATT?"    Here is the rub. National prosperity drives the debate about  EC membership, but the reasons for preserving or junking it  touch upon even more than hard cash. They concern political  fundamentals: power, seats round the table, our place in the  world. More importantly, they ask what Britain is, and what sort  of people we are.    If Britain remains an EC member, it is not hard to forecast  the consequences. Europe's economic fortunes will continue to  decline, leading to more EC-led intervention and protectionism  here; the role of our institutions -- the Monarchy, Parliament,  the Church of England -- will increasingly be called into  question.    The alternative is shrouded in mist. Some transitional  unemployment, certainly, the transfer of civil servants from  Brussels to China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the untwinning of  British towns with their continental counterparts maybe; perhaps  a revival of national morale, at least for a while.    Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the economic  cart  will carry on driving the political horse. And, significantly,  disillusion with the EC is spreading throughout British business.    Dr Anne Robinson, of the Institute of Directors, emphasises  that it has no view on EC withdrawal. Nonetheless, "the  overwhelming view of our members is that the single market  hasn't delivered." And if it can't deliver? "Then people are  going to get very fed-up with Europe, aren't they?"</p>

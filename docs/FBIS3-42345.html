According to the version given by military detachment  commander Colonel Henry Dominguez, the seizure dismantled a  major part of the CGR's logistical structure tasked with  supplying arms and quartermaster supplies to the various groups  who operate in the Departments of Santander and Norte de  Santander, the southern part of Cesar Department, and Bolivar  Department.    The operation began at 0500 [1000 GMT] on 2 February and  ended 12 hours later. Alfredo Angarita Torres, "Hermes,"  logistic wing leader of the northeastern war front; Jesus Emilio  Ovalle Rodriguez, "Chucho;" and sisters Angelina and Barbara  Perez Duran were captured in house No. 3-77 on 21st Avenue, in  the Tasajero neighborhood.</p>

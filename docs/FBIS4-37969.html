			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 27 Jun (MENA) -- Yemeni Information Minister  Hasan al-Lawzi has denied reports claiming that the armed  forces, "the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy,"  violated the cease-fire announced the day before yesterday and  that came into force at midnight on Saturday [25 June].    He told MENA's correspondent in Sanaa that the forces of  "unity and constitutional legitimacy" fully complied with the  cease-fire decision on the Aden and Hadhramaut axes according to  the Defense Ministry's instructions to the commanders of these  two axes in every sector. But, he added, continuing their line  of rejecting all national initiatives, the "forces of rebellion"  resumed their attacks on the armed forces units in several  places inside Aden. He went on to say that these forces carried  out air raids on the Bi'r 'Asakir and Sabir Districts of  Hadhramaut Governorate and on civilian installations in the  Lahij Governorate's capital city of al-Hawtah. These forces, he  noted, are continuing their attacks despite all the military  units' commitment to the cease-fire, patience, and  nonretaliation in appreciation of UN Secretary General Dr.  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's appeal and in response to the brothers and  friends' good offices.    The Yemeni information minister told MENA that the "rebels"  believe their voice can only be heard amid the fighting and  reports on the fighting. This, he said, prompts them to foil  every serious effort toward stabilizing the situation without  achieving even part of a foreign political step to serve their  illegitimate goals. He noted that these goals have met no clear  response, only explicit financial backing from a minority and  propaganda support that the facts will soon reveal.    He explained that if the armed forces were not extremely  concerned about the lives of Aden citizens and civilian and  economic installations in the city they would have been inside  Aden city. He said the "renegades" realize this fact before  anyone else and continue to count on it. He added that the  armed forces would work to end their use of this, employing  great patience throughout every violation and attack. He said  all the state authorities, primarily the people's armed forces,  will remain extremely concerned for citizens' lives, for the  Yemeni homeland's economic and trade capital, and for the  people's gains in the Aden infrastructure.</p>

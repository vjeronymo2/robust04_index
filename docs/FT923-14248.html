			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Soviet N-reactor safety cash cut down to Dollars 100m LEADERS of the G7 yesterday failed to agree on a Dollars 700m emergency fund to make Soviet-designed nuclear reactors safe, but decided on a much smaller Dollars 100m fund to complement their bilateral programmes. Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted that the outcome amounted only to 'the first steps. Much larger steps are necessary in the future'. The G7 did agree to back a common programme of action, based on the conclusions of a nuclear safety working group, which warned that no fewer than 25 power stations in Russia and eastern Europe should be closed urgently. However, the lack of alternative energy supplies means that at first only emergency safety measures will be carried out. The 15 remaining Chernobyl-type reactors, and 10 other early model pressurised water reactors will stay in operation until alternatives are available. The programme contains three parts: urgent safety measures on the power stations; more substantial redesign alterations; and help for the affected countries in establishing more rigorous safety control and inspection. The plan is to carry out the programme through bilateral contracts, all co-ordinated through the 24 OECD industrialised countries, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The compromise on financing amounts to a disappointment for the Europeans, and above all for Mr Kohl, although all attempted to put a brave face on it yesterday. It resulted from US and Japanese resistance to the idea of a common nuclear safety fund. On the US side, this was stated as a worry that a multilateral fund would be excessively bureaucratic, and take too long to put into action. US officials also expressed doubt about the ability of the EBRD to supervise the entire programme. Japanese doubts about the effectiveness of a multilateral fund were compounded by unwillingness to make substantial further financial commitments until the political dispute with Russia over the ownership of the Kurile islands is resolved. The Chancellor questioned Japan's reserve. 'Japan is pretty close to Vladivostok. There are nuclear power stations in Vladivostok, of the same design,' he said. Officials involved in the programme suspect that a desire to protect national nuclear contractors, such as Westinghouse in the US, Siemens' KWU in Germany, Framatome in France, GEC in Britain, and Mitsubishi in Japan, also made agreement difficult. The Dollars 100m fund will be used to carry out those emergency measures which the bilateral contracts fail to include. The European argument in favour of a joint programme was based on the fear that individual countries would avoid the most difficult safety programmes. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said all G7 members would contribute to the smaller fund, a success in itself in persuading some movement from the US. Non-G7 countries will be encouraged to contribute.</p>

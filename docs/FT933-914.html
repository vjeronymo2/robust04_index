			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Satisfied UN ends its mission in Cambodia MR YASUSHI AKASHI, the Japanese diplomat in charge of the United Nations' Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, left Phnom Penh yesterday expressing satisfaction at the broad success of his mission but regret that Khmer Rouge guerrillas were still challenging the authority of the new government, Victor Mallet writes from Bangkok. Mr Akashi and his colleagues in the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia have also urged foreign donors to support the country financially after the two-year UN mission. Mr Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian finance minister, left for Washington yesterday to negotiate with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Donors have pledged Dollars 1bn to Cambodia, but little of the money has been disbursed. UN officials fear the local currency may collapse with the disappearance of the dollars previously spent by UN staff.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / ICI may pull out of chlorine production IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indust-ries, the British chemicals group, is to decide in three months' time whether to pull out of chlorine production and associated businesses in the UK because of high electricity prices and tightening environmental controls. To meet stiffer emission controls that will come into force in the next few years, ICI estimates it will have to invest about Pounds 50m by about 1996, with Pounds 30m of this committed by next year. However, managers fear they may not be able to justify such investments at current levels of profitability, which have been hit by rising power costs since privatisation of the electricity industry. Closure of ICI's three British sites - at Runcorn and Northwich in Cheshire and on Teesside - would cost about 7,000 jobs and worsen the UK's visible trade balance by about Pounds 1.5bn a year. The company closed two chlorine plants near Fleetwood, Lancashire, earlier this month, with the loss of 100 jobs. Mr Bob Hunt, managing director of ICI Chlor-Chemicals, said yesterday that it would be impossible to justify Pounds 30m of capital spending on present financial performance. ICI has already said that no plant will operate if it cannot meet new, tougher standards for emission control. 'At today's levels of profitability, we have too poor a case to put to the ICI main board for the capital needed to sustain the business, especially when we are not performing to the levels of the past,' Mr Hunt said. Electricity now accounts for about 75 per cent of ICI's variable costs in chlorine production. The company uses the Castner-Kellner process, in which electrolysis splits a solution of brine into chlorine and caustic soda. These are the basic feedstocks for a wide range of chemical products, including most modern solvents and plastics. About 4,000 'downstream' jobs depend on chlorine production at Runcorn alone, where ICI's complex of three Castner-Kellner plants consumes 1 per cent of the nation's power output, making it Britain's largest electricity customer. The company has the bulk of the UK market but now cannot afford to operate plant for long enough each day to fill all its export orders. Power changes, Page 8</p>

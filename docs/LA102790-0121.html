Macy &amp; Co. is considering the  sale of a significant equity stake to help reduce debt. Macy, which already has  sold small stakes to finance buybacks of some of its bonds, said it was  considering more equity sales and was "exploring the possibility of selling a  more substantial equity interest to a buyer who shares our view of Macy's value  and future." The retailer disclosed its plans in a letter to stockholders but  did not identify any prospective investors.  </P></p>

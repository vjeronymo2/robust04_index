			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Ministry Demand"] </F>   [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Ministry categorically refuted the  France Press news on an alleged statement by Minister  Crvenkovski during February 21 talks with the Netherlands  counterpart Kooijmans, on Macedonia being ready to seek a  compromise on the name issue, regardless of the latest trading  embargo enforced by Athens. It is obvious that the word "not"  is omitted after the word "Macedonia," without which the  sentence makes no logical sense. Crvenkovski had explicitly  stated in The Hague that Macedonia is ready to continue the  negotiations with Greece, regardless of the Greek trading  blockade imposed on Macedonia, the Foreign Ministry underlined.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Generational Change Imminent for </F> Employers"]    [Text] Nuuk -- The big construction jobs will require new  thinking on the part of Greenland employers in the years ahead.    What does an employer in Greenland look like?    If one regards the Greenland Employers Association delegates  who met in Nuuk last weekend as representative of the typical  employer, one of the answers is that he is a Danish skilled  worker who has built up his own firm from scratch since the  1960's and 1970's. Now he is in his fifties or sixties and has  begun to look around for a successor.    But that is easier said than done.    The unfavorable times and the chronic lack of well-trained  labor in Greenland have made it almost impossible to sell the  small firms.    One of the routes leading to the necessary changing of the  guard may be increased cooperation among the individual owners  of small firms along the coast.    However this requires new thinking and flexibility on the  part of the members of the Greenland Employers Association.  <H5>  Analysis </H5>   And these were the very qualities the chairman of the  association, director Erik Norskov of Qaqortoq, called for in  his address to the delegates' meeting in Nuuk.    Therefore the employers association has entered into a  cooperative agreement with the home-rule-owned Greenland Base  Company on an extensive industrial analysis that will chart all  of Greenland's trade and industry.    "The analysis is aimed at trying to create a clear picture  of  what the business sector really has at its disposal in the way  of materiel, manpower, and economic resources in order to ensure  Greenland firms the greatest possible participation when the  very large construction projects that have been planned are  realized in the years ahead," Norskov said.    "The analysis will be a good tool for continued industrial  development and therefore the Greenland Employers Association is  disappointed that many firms are keeping their cards close to  their chests. The analysis is trying to involve 450 firms in all  branches, but at present only 120 firms have responded."    At the meeting of delegates doubts were raised about the  impartiality of the Greenland Base Company as a home-rule-owned  enterprise when private firms lay all their cards on the table  and talk about their innermost secrets.    Norskov was not afraid to open up and talk about his firm's  prospects and he urged the other members of the association to  do the same.    "If we are to participate in the big construction jobs, such  as airplane runways on the coast, cooperation is an urgent  necessity," he said. "Otherwise our members risk seeing the work  go to outside consortia."  <H5>  Hands Off! </H5>   "The economy is still weak in Greenland with record-high  unemployment and declining exports," Norskov noted.    Even so, restrained industrial policy optimism prevails in  the employers association. The breakup of KNI [Greenland Trade  Production, Transportation and Distribution] and the  restructuring of the last of the old GTO [Greenland Technical  Organization] organizations has made the economy clearer just as  a market economic point of reference based on freer and more  open competition has been created.    "But we are still a long way from a totally free market  economy," Norskov noted.    "The political system still keeps the big state-owned firms  under tight control. It is to a large extent the politicians who  dominate company boards of directors and control the firms on  the basis of political rather than sober business management  considerations. This hampers a commercial firm that has to  compete on the basis of efficiency and at the same time it  hinders free and natural price formation, and in a number of  situations the political influence can create competitive  distortions.    "Therefore the politicians should seriously consider  following the market economy intentions all the way, withdrawing  from direct firm management and leaving it to the  professionals," said Erik Norskov, chairman of the Greenland  Employers Association.</p>

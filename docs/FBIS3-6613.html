			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To assist bilateral cooperation in the auto  industry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] and the Chinese Government will sponsor the "Conference  for Cooperation Between Japanese, Chinese Auto Parts Industries"  (tentative name) around June. The conference is designed for  exchanging information on Japanese auto parts makers hoping  business in China and on Chinese products and factories which  may interest Japanese companies. Some Western automakers,  including Volkswagen of Germany and Chrysler of the United  States, are taking part in Chinese national projects on  automobile development but Japanese companies are far behind in  this field. Under such circumstances, MITI decided to pave the  way for Japanese companies' advance into the growing Chinese  market.    MITI has already started listing domestic parts  manufacturers  that want to set up production strongpoints in China, aiming at  promotion of joint ventures in the auto industry.    The conference will be organized by officials of the Japan  Auto Parts Industries Association and Chinese auto and auto  parts makers. They will meet periodically to accelerate  bilateral cooperation through exchanging information on definite  plans for business tie-ups. The formal accord is expected to be  concluded in May, when Chinese State Planning Commission  officials visit Japan.    China's automobile production counted 1.4 million units in  1993, and production has doubled in the last three years. Some  estimates say the figure will reach 3 million in 2000. While  Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki are participating in China's  national automobile projects, no major Japanese automakers are  involved in. In general, Japanese automakers' ties with China  is weaker than those of Western automakers.    The Chinese Government is attaching importance to developing  its own auto parts industries, and it called for Japan's  assistance to the national policy when a Japanese automakers'  mission visited Beijing in the fall of 1993. In response,  Nissan's affiliated Kinugawa Rubber Industrial Co. Ltd.  established a joint venture company in Tianjin. Also, Yazaki  Corporation and Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. have subsidy  companies in Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively.    Some auto parts makers are conducting feasibility studies on  operations in China, and the "cooperation conference" is  expected to accelerate moves toward technological assistance and  joint ventures.    About 4,000 auto parts factories are reportedly conducting  business in China, but only 20 are subsidies of Japanese auto  parts makers. In the ninth Five-Year Economic Plan starting in  1996, China intends to improve productivity of auto parts makers  through mergers and large-scale management.</p>

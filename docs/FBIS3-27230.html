Meanwhile, Anhui has  earnestly implemented the guidelines of the double-support work  meeting held in Yanan; has upheld the policy of "consolidating,  developing, and improving military-civilian ties"; has  concentrated energies on developing social productive forces and  on raising military fighting capacity; has conscientiously  promoted double-support activities; and has continually  consolidated and developed new relations between the military  and the people, whereby "their hearts are linked togehter and  beat as one, and they share a common destiny." Anhui has made  progress in expanding the scope and content of double-support  work; and has improved the overall standards of the activities.  Therefore, the general situation has been very good.    Speaking at the meeting were responsible comrades from  Military Unit No. 80302 garrisoned in Anhui, from the Hefei City  Government, and from the Anhui Military District.</p>

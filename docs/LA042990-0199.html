			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO SLAIN CANDIDATE;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA: PIZARRO IS HONORED AS A CHAMPION OF PEACE. THE LEFTIST M-19 GROUP  NAMES HIS  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of mourners crowded rain-drenched Bogota streets Saturday for  a funeral march honoring assassinated presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro  Leongomez, a guerrilla chieftain who became a champion of peace.  </P> <P> Pizarro's leftist political movement, the Democratic Alliance M-19, announced  that it will continue its campaign for May 27 presidential elections with  another former guerrilla as its candidate.  </P> <P> A young man firing a machine pistol killed Pizarro, 38, aboard an airborne  jetliner Thursday. The assassination was the latest killing in a long wave of  terrorist violence that has engulfed Colombia.  </P> <P> Cocaine traffickers based in the city of Medellin have carried out many  killings and bombings, while right-wing death squads and leftist terrorists  have been blamed for others.  </P> <P> Col. Oscar Pelaez, chief of judicial police, identified Pizarro's assassin as  Gerardo Gutierrez Uribe, 20, who had worked for a billiards chalk factory near  Medellin. Pelaez said the factory was linked to the Medellin cartel, headed by  Pablo Escobar Gavira, Colombia's most notorious drug lord.  </P> <P> "The one responsible for the death of Carlos Pizarro Leongomez has a name:  Pablo Escobar Gavira," Pelaez told reporters. A statement issued Friday by  anonymous traffickers, believed to include Escobar, denied any responsibility  for the assassination.  </P> <P> Police also have blamed Escobar for the assassinations of presidential  candidates Luis Carlos Galan in August and Bernardo Jaramillo in March.  Investigative documents in court files, however, have not implicated Escobar in  any of the killings, the newspaper El Espectador reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Bishop Guillermo Vega, chairman of the church's Justice and  Peace Commission, officiated at Saturday's funeral Mass for Pizarro. "Nobody  spoke against violence as he did in recent days," the bishop said.  </P> <P> As Pizarro's coffin emerged from the cathedral on Bogota's central Plaza  Bolivar, a waiting crowd clapped and began chanting, "The government killed  him." The chant echoed widespread outrage over the government's failure to  prevent terrorist attacks.  </P> <P> But a member of the M-19 who was helping with crowd control said the chant did  not reflect the political movement's official position. "We make no  accusations," he said.  </P> <P> Draped with a red, yellow and blue Colombian flag, the coffin was placed atop a  black hearse parked beside the empty site once occupied by Colombia's Palace of  Justice. About 40 M-19 guerrillas took over the judicial center in November,  1985, and all were killed in an army counterattack.  </P> <P> Eleven Supreme Court justices and about 50 other people also died in the  besieged building, which was gutted by fire.  </P> <P> Under heavy rain at midday Saturday, Pizarro's funeral hearse moved slowly  through crowded streets, followed by a long procession of marchers. Radio RCN  estimated the total number of mourners on the streets at 30,000.  </P> <P> The procession, which took five hours to reach the National Cemetery where  Pizarro's body was buried, stopped at the historic Quinta Bolivar, an estate  used by South American independence hero Simon Bolivar. Guerrillas stole  Bolivar's sword from the estate's museum in 1974 to announce the M-19's  formation.  </P> <P> M-19 stands for April 19 Movement. That is the date of allegedly fraudulent  presidential elections in 1970.  </P> <P> At the estate Saturday, the M-19 proclaimed former guerrilla Antonio Navarro  Wolf as Pizarro's successor in the presidential campaign. "I accept so that  there may be peace in Colombia," said Navarro, who lost a leg in a June, 1985,  grenade attack against him at a restaurant in the city of Cali.  </P> <P> At that time, Navarro was the M-19's chief negotiator in peace talks with the  government. The M-19 withdrew from the talks shortly after the attack.  </P> <P> Pizarro led the guerrilla movement into new peace talks last year that  culminated when the rebels gave up their arms and entered the political arena  in March. In recent opinion surveys, Pizarro was favored by about 5% of voters  polled.  </P> <P> Pizarro's widow, Laura, said at graveside services Saturday that he was brave  in battle and equally brave in making peace.  </P> <P> "Let us not let all his efforts be in vain," she said. "Let us not lose hope,  and let us continue opening paths to peace for our country."  </P></p>

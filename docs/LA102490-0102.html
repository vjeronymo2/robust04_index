			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK COACH SERVES SUSPENSION  </P> <P> His team maintained its unblemished record, but Frank Parodi, the Moorpark  College men's soccer coach, has been punished for having a dispute with a  referee that led to the termination of a match with two minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Western State Conference Commissioner Aviva Kamin on Monday handed Parodi a  one-match suspension for his role in a verbal tiff with referee Roger Silva in  a WSC match on Oct. 12 against Hancock.  </P> <P> Parodi sat out a 4-0 WSC victory over Glendale on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It could have been worse," Parodi said.  </P> <P> Visiting Moorpark was leading the Hancock match, 2-1, when Silva ended play  after the argument, which capped a simmering dispute. The Hancock match is  considered a no-contest and will not count in Moorpark's record of 12-0, 7-0 in  conference play. If the match has a bearing on conference results, it will be  replayed at Hancock after the regular season.  </P> <P> "I think the decision is great because the kids aren't penalized," said Paul  Dunham, Moorpark athletic director.  </P> <P> Because a member of the school staff had to lead the team, Gary Abraham,  Moorpark women's basketball coach, was the coach of record Tuesday. But Parodi  said Peter Schraml, Royal High boys' coach, actually did the coaching.  </P> <P> Silva was not disciplined, Parodi said.  </P></p>

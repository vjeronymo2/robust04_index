			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Banking on a real demand Sir, May a retailer express a view about the letter from Mr John Saunders (Letters, December 21), National Westminster Bank Professor of Marketing at Loughborough University Business School, who talks of the 'unholy trinity of church, unions and retailers'. Trading on Sundays may well bring greater convenience to customers in certain fields, such as DIY, furniture and local neighbourhood services. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the public is crying out for a seventh day on which to purchase food or clothing. When the law is rationalised, as it surely will be, some of us who will not contravene current UK legislation may wish to ease congestion and assist customers by opening on the occasional Sunday. I would suggest, however, that in view of his title, Mr Saunders might like, as a first priority, to point up the archaic and arbitrary nature of bank opening hours. It would be infinitely more helpful to the nation if banks opened for a whole working day on five, or, perish the thought, six days a week. Now that would be meeting a real demand, as opposed to the fanciful one that shoppers are stampeding to Sunday trading venues. Barry Hyman, head of media relations, Marks and Spencer, Michael House, Baker Street, W1A 1DN</p>

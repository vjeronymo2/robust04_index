			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UN report ready on Iraqi arms Mr Rolf Ekeus, the United Nations envoy, arrived in Baghdad yesterday to assess the readiness of systems installed for the long-term monitoring of Iraqi weapons programmes - a central condition for the eventual lifting of the oil embargo maintained against Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Mr Ekeus declined to say on his arrival when the monitoring systems would be fully operational, information he is due to convey in a report to the UN Security Council on October 10. But UN officials in New York said they expected Mr Ekeus to declare that systems for monitoring possible missile, chemical, nuclear and biological weapons production to be 'provisionally operational' within a few weeks, at which point a 'test period' of the monitoring could begin. According to diplomats at the UN, such a report would then seriously test the unanimity of the UN Security Council on whether to offer Iraq a definite timetable for compliance with long-term monitoring of its weapons programmes. France, Russia and China have already made it clear that, if Mr Ekeus' report is positive, they would would then argue that a 'probation period' of six months should immediately begin to test Iraqi compliance with long-term monitoring - after which the Security Council should discuss lifting the oil embargo. The US and Britain, however, have made it equally clear that they would strongly oppose setting any such a definite deadline. UN inspectors have now installed an array of monitoring devices and prepared detailed blueprints of factories and manufacturing operations which could produce weapons banned under the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. UN officials said devices to monitor missile production and testing, including cameras at several sites, were fully in place, that surveillance methods at potential chemical weapons production sites were 'just starting up' and that means for surveying possible biological weapons production were soon to be installed. Iraqi officials insist that they have fully met all Gulf war ceasefire conditions and that the Security Council should respond by offering at least some easing of the embargo once the UN monitoring programme begins any test period. Officials warned last week that unless Mr Ekeus could offer some such concessions, Iraq would 'explore other ways of dealing with the Security Council'. Whatever Mr Ekeus reports, however, there is unanimity in the Security Council that no easing of the embargo can take place until and unless Iraq formally recognises both the sovereignty of Kuwait and the legitimacy of UN-demarcated borders between Iraq and its southern neighbour. 'Until they have done this, nothing else will happen,' said a western diplomat.</p>

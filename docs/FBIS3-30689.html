One of the aims of my visit is to persuade the Polish  parliamentarians to engage themselves more closely in the  formulation of the future Europe, said Martinez after meeting  Sejm and Senate Speakers Jozef Oleksy and Adam Struzik  respectively.    Speaking after his meeting with Jozef Oleksy, Martinez said  that Poland is playing an important role in the Council of  Europe which will help facilitate and speed up Poland's  integration with the European structures.    Jozef Oleksy said that Poland no longer needed to fight to  justify its place in Europe, and said that he and Martinez were  agreed that Poland should be a driving force for initiatives in  the Council of Europe. Oleksy proposed that the Council of  Europe should open a representative office in Warsaw along with  the lines of the office of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Adam Struzik said after meeting Martinez that their talks  covered Poland's role in creating a bridge between Western  Europe and eastern neighbours of Poland.    The situation in Poland following the September 1993  parliamentary elections was also touched upon during the  meeting. The visiting president of the Parliamentary Assembly  of the Council of Europe met Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  to discuss Poland's participation in the Council of Europe's  efforts aimed at European integration and stabilization of  democratic institutions on the continent. The two politicians  reviewed European security issues and the situation in Russia  and Ukraine.    Martinez also met with leader of the parliamentary caucus of  the Democratic Union (UD) Bronislaw Geremek and discussed with  him the question of a possible admission of Russia and Ukraine  to the Council of Europe.    Despite expectations, the talks did not touch upon the  subject of UD's resignation from participation in the Polish  delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe. The UD's decision came in protest over the election of  Tadeusz Iwinski, an SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) mp, as deputy  president of the assembly.    The principle that decisions on the composition of the  Polish  delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe are taken in parliament and not outside of it, is the  condition of the presence of Confederation for an independent  Poland (KPN) in the delegation, party leader Leszek Moczulski  said after meeting Martinez.    Moczulski claimed that such decisions should be made by all  parties represented in the Sejm on a consensus basis. He added,  however, that "from the point of view of a political rivalry in  Poland, the KPN's condition is impossible to be met."    KPN has been assigned one place in the 12-member delegation  but the party decided not to appoint a party candidate and said  it wants an equal number of delegation members. They are  elected or appointed by the Sejm from among its members and  political parties in the delegation follow the proportion of  their strength in the Sejm.</p>

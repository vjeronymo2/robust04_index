			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / HSBC surprises with 51% advance HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland of the UK, yesterday surprised analysts when it unveiled a 51 per cent increase in profits to HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 325m) from HKDollars 3.3bn in the six months to June 30. The results, which did not include Midland's interim profit of Pounds 89m or the bank's recent HKDollars 3.39bn sale of 10 per cent of Cathay Pacific, were struck after a 63 per cent increase to HKDollars 4.48bn in charges for bad and doubtful debts. Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company was the main source of bad debts. At the interim stage, the bank has loans totalling USDollars 768m outstanding to O&amp;Y and made a specific provision of USDollars 187.5m against them. A dividend of 70.5 HK cents (4.8p) was declared, 31 per cent up on the 54 HK cents paid a year ago. It said that shareholders could expect to receive not less than HKDollars 2 a share in dividends for the whole year, or 14.2p a share. The bank said it intended to distribute a third of its dividend at the interim stage and two-thirds at year-end. Mr William Purves, chairman, said at a press conference late yesterday that the merger with Midland was proceeding well. 'The things we want to do should be completed by 1993', he said. The main operating subsidiary, Hongkong Bank, made a net profit of HKDollars 4bn. This figure includes the bank's share of Hang Seng Bank's profits, Wardley, its Asia-Pacific merchant banking arm, and Hongkong Bank of Australia. Although there is no precise comparison with last year, due to restructuring, the whole of HSBC made HKDollars 3.3bn last time. Profits in Canada were flat, due to higher provisions, but the British Bank of the Middle East enjoyed 'strong profit growth', while Australia returned to profit, and Marine Midland Bank of the US made a half-year profit of HKDollars 337m compared with a loss last time of HKDollars 849m. HSBC's costs as a percentage of operating income were 51.6 per cent, and would have been 60 per cent had Midland's results been incorporated. Mr Purves said the maintenance of a cost-income ratio of 60 per cent was an aim of the merged bank. Lex, Page 14</p>

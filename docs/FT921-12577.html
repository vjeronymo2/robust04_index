			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Clean air that costs money - Lucia van der Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe clean air and visits a furniture showroom AS temperatures plunge most of us turn up the heating. Those with antique furniture, musical instruments or paintings may be nervous about what this does to their cherished objects. The answer is likely to be a lot of harm. Many a valuable piano or piece of inlaid furniture has cracked and split - not so much because of the heat itself but because of the dryness the heat causes. But there is no need to panic. Something can be done, and relatively cheaply. Humidifiers deal efficiently with the problem and the simplest humdifier in the world consists of a saucer kept filled with water. Anybody wanting professional advice might like to know that The Air Improvement Centre at 23 Denbigh Street, London SW1V 2HF, has brought out two leaflets (with the blessings of Sotheby's and the British Antique Furniture Restorers Association) filled with advice on how to care for antique furniture and musical instruments. Both leaflets are free, both are packed with advice covering everything from where to put furniture, how to wax it and the range of humdifiers available. The Air Improvement Centre sells humidifiers so, naturally, it has a vested interest in the matter but the leaflets do offer sensible advice. If you decide to opt for a sophisticated humidifier you can always go along to the centre and buy one. A simple hang-on radiator humdifier, the Casana 500, for instance, sells for Pounds 24.60 while a more sophisticated electric model, the Turmis 200, sells for Pounds 98. Anyone who suffers from sinus problems or hay fever or who feels the air in their home should be cleaner might like to bear in mind that The Air Improvement Centre aims to improve the air you breathe. It has a range of panaceas - ranging from ionisers to air improvers at prices ranging from about Pounds 30 to Pounds 400. One of my favourite mail order catalogues, LL Bean of Freeport, Maine, in the US, has decided to make a big play for the international customer. It is making it as simple as possible to do as chic Americans have done for generations and dress the LL Bean way. For a copy of the catalogue you either telephone (and LL Bean is famous for keeping its shop and its telephone lines open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year (1-207-865-3111, fax 1-207-878-2104). There is a British address: LL Bean Inc., PO BOX 54, Swindon, SN5 8LB. For those who have not yet discovered the charms of LL Bean it was the original purveyor of the much-copied Ivy league look. It started by specialising in rugged wear for fishing, shooting and other pioneering activities but these days urbanites are as much addicted to chinos, cotton seersucker shirts, handsewn shoes, and rugby shirts. Since those early days the range has expanded and there is a special range for women which includes sunglasses, walking shorts, canvas shoes, leather belts, khaki culottes - as well as traditional, outdoor gear. Prices seem reasonable with wool 'ragg' socks, for instance, selling at Dollars 7 (Pounds 3.80) a pair and men's stone-washed jeans selling at Dollars 28.50 (Pounds 15.70). Bear in mind that you also have to pay postage, packing and any duty.</p>

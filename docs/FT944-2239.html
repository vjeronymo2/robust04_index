			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Thailand invites Dollars 4bn power station bids Thailand's electricity authority yesterday invited bids to build and operate Dollars 4bn of power plant projects with output totalling 3,800MW by 2002. The tender, announced as part of the gradual privatisation of Thailand's energy sector, has aroused considerable interest among major international power generators and local construction companies. The bids to supply 1,000MW in the year 2000, 1,400MW in 2001 and 1,400MW in 2002 must be in by the end of June 1995. Successful companies will be well placed to bid for four further 1,700MW projects coming on stream every year between 2003 and 2006. A spokesman for the electricity authority (EGAT) said he expected all foreign bidders would bring in local partners: British Gas has already teamed up with Thailand's Union Energy and Mitsui said it would soon announce a link with a local partner. The tender process has been delayed for several months following complaints by potential bidders in August that the original draft terms were too tough. EGAT said it had softened its demands which previously included the right to take over any project that it deemed was not fulfilling its contractual obligations. Foreign executives said that this condition would have made it difficult to obtain financial backing. The Bangkok representative of the Hong Kong group Hopewell Holdings, Mr Colin Wier, said the project was 'a first for Thailand' and would provide companies with interesting opportunities but added: 'We will have to think long and hard about the ground rules.' EGAT will judge each bid primarily on price although financial backing and experience will also be taken into account. The choice of fuel is likely to be difficult as the government has indicated its preference for environmentally friendly fuel, especially natural gas. Thailand, however, has no spare gas supplies. These would have to be bought from Burma or elsewhere. EGAT is cautiously seeking private sector help to meet demand for electricity which is rising by 11 per cent a year. The Asian Development Bank has calculated that Thailand needs to invest Dollars 22bn by 2000 to meet projected electricity demand. The first step in the privatisation programme was the sale of 50 per cent of the Electricity Generating Company, which owns a power station in southern Thailand, earlier this year. This was a popular but relatively modest-sized flotation with a stock market value of about Bt8bn. EGAT itself plans to go public within three years.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Russia delays fixing rouble exchange rate: Anthony Robinson and Martin Wolf on moves to convertibility THE 'difficult and tremendous task' of fixing the rouble exchange rate within a 7 1/2 per cent fluctuation band on either side of a central rate will not be attempted until 'some time this autumn', according to Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. The government had earlier indicated its intention to fix the rouble on August 1. The first stage of Russia's 'serious move towards convertibility of the rouble' is to begin on July 1 with the abolition of multiple exchange rates and the introduction of a unitary floating rate of exchange. After presiding over a meeting of the governing council of the re-capitalised Moscow Narodny Bank in London on Friday, Mr Matiukhin made clear that convertibility would have to be backed by a tight credit policy. In addition, a sophisticated system of currency exchanges must be created throughout Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union, backed by adequate communications and staffed by people who have so far not been trained. Mr Matiukhin said there would be no special exchange rate for capital transactions, but non-residents would not be allowed to buy the rouble freely until it had appreciated from present undervalued levels and could be fixed. So-called 'cashless' rouble accounts should also be made convertible into cash before floating commences. Mr Matiukhin said he had emphasised to the central banks of the other republics that the rouble was the national currency of Russia. Preparations for the introduction of convertibility - to be initially limited to current account transactions for Russian residents only, and later extended to residents of other republics and to capital inflows - had already led to closer co-operation between republican central banks. 'Many of them used not to turn up for sessions of the inter-republican central bank council. But all 15, including the Baltic republics, Ukraine and others who are contemplating issuing their own currencies, turned up at the last meeting,' he said. Rules on the distribution of cash, common interest rates and common obligatory reserve ratios had already been agreed. They had also established correspondent accounts between central banks, which resemble a payments union. 'Now what we are trying to agree is the limits on mutual credit.' Limits on credit expansion will be needed in all the republics in what he called the 'rouble zone'. The impending steep rise in the price of Russian oil and energy products will increase the balance-of-payments deficits of most of the 14 non-Russian republics with Russia. This will intensify their need for Russian financial assistance, which will only be available if they remain in the rouble zone. The other republics will also have to increase their exports to Russia to reduce their deficits. Though the Baltic republics are expected to be the first to issue their own currencies they are 'likely to be like the Scottish pound to start with', Mr Matiukhin said, in a reference to the way some Scottish banks retain the right to issue bank notes, but under Bank of England control. He also said that the International Monetary Fund agreed with Russia on the need to preserve the rouble zone. The Group of Seven industrialised countries had decided to channel most of the promised Dollars 24bn aid package through Russia.</p>

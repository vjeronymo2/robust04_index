			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Double bill - London Promenade concerts WEDNESDAY brought the first of several double Proms this season: a whole concert at 7pm, and another, shorter one at 10pm. For what will almost inevitably be smaller audiences, and usually smaller-scale music, the BBC decision to keep the second concerts in the Albert Hall this year instead of planting them in modest venues nearby may be debatable; but the late all-Villa-Lobos programme by the Lontano ensemble sounded terrific. Their effervescent conductor, Odaline de la Martinez, must find an excuse to give it again during the winter. In five contrasting works, it displayed the composer at his reckless, engaging best - and Lontano too, and the BBC Singers who appeared with them, and Anne Dawson's lovely soprano. To her, of course, went the evergreen Bachianas Brasileiras no. 5 (the one with the haunting vocalise over eight cellos). Miss Dawson was not only ravishing in the first movement, but - with canny assistance from de la Martinez - made subtler sense of its tricky successor than we usually hear. The BBC Singers boldly essayed the original version of Bachianas Brasileiras no. 9 ('for orchestra of voices'), and brought it off with awesomely secure pitch. They also joined the shivaree of Villa-Lobos's early Nonet: a tongue-in-cheek label, for the nominal nine players are supported - nay, crowded - by the substantial chorus and 18 percussion instruments, many of them exotic. The young composer threw everything into the pot, and called it 'A rapid impression of the whole of Brazil". New to me was his still earlier Quartet for harp, celesta, flute and alto sax - and female chorus to show how much he admired Debussy's Sirenes. Ravel looms even larger, and yet the piece fairly tingles with pungent Villa-Lobos ideas. Just afterwards came his Choros no. 7, an irresistible serenade for septet (plus a secret tam-tam, which booms gently and magically through the penultimate verse). Lontano executed it more or less perfectly. I should love to hear the whole programme again - especially if the BBC could be persuaded to round it off with the choral Choros no. 10. The earlier concert found Yan Pascal Tortelier also in full, stylish command of his scores. Though he became Principal Conductor of the BBC Philharmonic only last month, they played devotedly for him. Ravel's La Valse was adorned with all the delicately decadent touches that 'international' bands miss when they go through the piece like locomotives: soulful swoons from solo strings, wicked woodwind gurgles. Nothing was forced; nor in Dutilleux's cello concerto "Tout un monde lointain. . .' either, where the marvellous Redon-like orchestral colouring seemed to well up as naturally as Tim Hugh's lyrical phrases in the solo role. (His aplomb survived a broken string at a particularly awkward point.) The old Saint-Saens' warhorse, the 'Organ' Symphony which has long been a Prom standby, boasted a poco adagio of great sweetness without saccharine. Tortelier allowed no trace of vulgarity anywhere, however, and toward the end of the Finale I began to doubt whether excluding cheap thrills was altogether wise.</p>

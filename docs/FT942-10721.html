			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (10): Only a trickle of foreign investment Bangladesh is attracting only a trickle of foreign investment despite a raft of incentives and cheap labour, writes Sheila Jones. Total foreign investment stands at barely Dollars 800m, the bulk of which is in one single project, the Dollars 510m Kafco fertiliser plant. Tax holidays and duty-free facilities in two Export Processing Zones have attracted only about Dollars 140m in the past 10 years. Many foreign businessmen say they are put off by an overbearing bureaucracy, poor industrial relations, low productivity, and an underdeveloped infrastructure. They also worry about political stability and a lack of protection under business and contract law. Mr Ian Sangster, managing director of Lever Brothers Bangladesh, the UK subsidiary, complains about copyright infringement and the lack of intellectual property rights. He points to a row of soaps on a shelf at the company's Chittagong headquarters, imitations of Lever's famous Lifebuoy brand: Life Bath, Likeboy, Life Joy and Lucky Boy. Lever's Wheel household soap sells variously as Wheeli, Wheal and Willi. 'It's a massive problem,' says Mr Sangster. 'But there is no support from the law. It is not a criminal offence.' He also points to the slow pace of moving goods. 'It can take four to six weeks to get a consignment cleared through customs, where it would take as many days in the UK. That delay costs us.' Some businessmen complain about constantly changing faces in government ministries and the slow pace of legislative reform. Others says that borrowing costs to business are higher than they should be because banks fail to fully differentiate between their best and worst customers: 'So I'm paying the cost of other people's bad debts.' Mr K. M. Iqbal, deputy general manager of James Finlay, the UK trading company based in Chittagong, says the government's tariff structure penalises local producers. 'It can be cheaper to import a finished product than to make it here,' he says. 'Even efficient companies are finding it tough.' But James Finlay, like Lever Brothers, has been in Bangladesh for many years and intends to stay. It is well established, knows the system and is making profits; Tk64m last year before tax, on turnover of Tk645m. It is the newcomers which the government is finding difficult to attract. 'There is a lot of apparent political instability frightening investors  - and they're partly right,' says Mr Iqbal. 'But democracy takes time. Inevitably there will be teething problems.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by the Central Electoral Commission for the </F> Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea]    [Text] On 15 March 1994 the president of the Republic of  Crimea read out an appeal to the electorate, citizens'  associations, trade union organizations, workforce, and members  of electoral commissions, proposing that the members of the  electoral commissions adopt decisions on the commissions'  participation in a poll of citizens scheduled by a presidential  edict for 27 March 1994 with notification of the pertinent  executive authorities of the decisions on the poll so adopted.    In connection with the said appeal the Central Electoral  Commission declares that:    In accordance with Article 5 of the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea, the organization and activity of state  authorities of the Republic of Crimea shall be based on a  separation of powers, with actions in violation of this  condition being deemed anticonstitutional.    The organization of the work of electoral commissions is  within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of  Crimea. The executive's demand for actions by the electoral  commissions for which provision is not made by the Republic of  Crimea law "Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of  Crimea" without the corresponding decision of the Supreme  Council of Crimea is not based on law.    Considering the difficulty of the elections conducted  simultaneously by the electoral commissions of deputies of the  Supreme Council of Crimea and the Supreme Council of Ukraine,  the Central Electoral Commission calls the attention of the  electoral commissions to the need for unswerving compliance with  the Republic of Crimea Constitution and the Republic of Crimea  law "Election of the Supreme Council of Crimea" and will adopt  the necessary measures to ensure legality in their activity.    Expressing a protest against the unfounded assertions of the  president of the Republic of Crimea concerning the Central  Electoral Commission's violations of legislation of the Republic  of Crimea, the Central Electoral Commission appeals to the  electorate, political parties, and other public associations of  the citizens and the workforce to refrain from actions putting  political pressure on members of the electoral commissions and  to display forbearance and organization in order to ensure that  the elections of deputies to the Supreme Council of Crimea on 27  March 1994 be held in an atmosphere of observance of democracy  and in full conformity with the requirements of Republic of  Crimea legislation.    [Signed] Central Electoral Commission for the Election of  Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea  <H6>  * * * </H6>   We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission, to answer this question: Does this statement mean  deadlock and a boycott of the president's poll decree?    "No, it does not. There is no deadlock and no boycott. A  poll  is possible. And the Central Electoral Commission is prepared to  assist in its execution. But the execution of a poll, not a  consultative referendum as signified by this word in the  president's edict. The execution of the latter requires,  according to the law, a special decision by the Supreme Council."</p>

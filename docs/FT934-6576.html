			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Back to base The only real surprise about yesterday's base rate cut was its timing. Markets have long discounted a cut near the time of the Budget. Its arrival a week early might seem neither here nor there, but it does mean that a half point is all the market can expect. Indeed, the Bank, which only a few weeks ago was arguing against a cut, has set something of a floor under interest rates for the time being. On its own admission, yesterday's cut takes into account the overall stance of the Budget - evidently the Governor has enjoyed an insight so far denied to the full cabinet. If the markets are disappointed by the content of the Budget itself, there will be no consolation in the thought that a large rate cut could be in the offing. Nor does a mere half point cut suggest that much radical pruning of the PSBR is planned. Were the chancellor to be planning a full frontal attack on mortgage interest relief, say, a deeper rate cut would have been in order. That would not preclude some deft manipulation of income tax allowances which would shift a greater burden on to higher rate tax payers while permitting an expansion of the 20 per cent band. Mr Clarke will surely still want to make a splash with his first effort. The political attractions of such an approach are beguiling. If that is indeed the approach, the markets may be less impressed by his failure to correct the overall deficit. Yesterday's cut almost certainly brought the trough of the interest rate cycle closer. Yet the recovery remains modest, and at some stage a painful fiscal adjustment looms. There is little enticement for equities in that. If base rates have little further to fall, there is not much to go for at the short end of the gilt market either. That will make the PSBR harder to fund as long as it remains large.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;35&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes. The CAA advises that a single dormant electrical fault in the control circuit of the thrust reversers could cause a thrust reverser to deploy if the pilot selects reverse thrust during the approach phase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flight. The CAA also advises that, currently, a 4-second time delay occurs in the rudder bias annunciation system. This annunciation system provides a warning to the flight crew that an asymmetric thrust reverser condition may exist. If an asymmetric thrust reverser condition occurs, and the flight crew does not receive sufficient warning from the annunciation system, the flight crew may apply high reverse thrust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These conditions, if not corrected, could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.78&hyph;9&hyph;3662B, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 7, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the control circuit wiring of the left and right engine thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. The modification involves grounding the normally closed contacts of the deploy microswitch to remove possible dormant shorts, wiring new independently signalled contacts in series with the power supply to the deploy valve solenoid, separating the wiring for the rudder bias not inhibited annunciation (warning) from the wiring for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncommanded hydraulic pressure warning to bypass the 4-second time delay, and other miscellaneous wiring changes to the thrust reverser wiring system. Accomplishment of the modification will improve the integrity of the electrical control circuits of the thrust reversers by eliminating the possibility of single dormant failures in the thrust reverser system. Accomplishment of the modification will also correct the status annunciation of the rudder bias by ensuring that, when an asymmetric thrust reverser condition occurs, the status of the rudder bias system is annunciated to the flight crew before the power settings for high reverse thrust are applied. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the control circuit wiring for the engine thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 60 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $81,700, or $4,300 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

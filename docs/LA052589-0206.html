			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. CITES JAPAN, BRAZIL AND INDIA FOR UNFAIR TRADE  </P> <P> The United States today cited Japan, Brazil and India for unfair trade  practices, congressional sources said.  </P> <P> High Administration officials briefed Congress on President Bush's decision. A  formal announcement was being held back until the affected nations could be  informed.  </P> <P> Washington cited the unfair trade practices of Japan for wood products,  satellites and superconductors, Brazil for licensing and services, and India  for investment, the sources said.  </P> <P> The congressional sources said the United States notified five other countries  that they will become priorities for investigation of unfair trade practices  involving intellectual property rights.  </P> <P> Another 25 countries will be placed on a "watch list" for possible  investigation of unfair trade.  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert A.  Mosbacher had urged Bush to cite Japan for unfair trade practices, but key  foreign policy advisers had argued that Tokyo should be spared because it is a  loyal ally in the Far East.  </P> <P> Japan, which had a $52.1-billion trade surplus with the United States last  year, was a key target of congressional proponents of the 1988 Trade Act, which  requires Hills to list countries believed to have significant barriers against  foreign goods by May 28.  </P> <P> But the decision, under the law's so-called "Super 301" provision, was actually  made by Bush after listening to heated debate at a Monday meeting of his  Economic Policy Council.  </P> <P> The nations cited must agree to end the restrictions within 18 months or face  retaliation, which could include 100% tariffs on their exports.  </P> <P> Diplomats and businessmen from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have repeatedly  called on Congress and the Administration to keep their names off the list.  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses follow the transatlantic trend Senior bourses found it difficult to detach from Wall Street after an initial fall on Friday's transatlantic losses. Their task was made no easier by conflicting advice from investment strategists, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT followed the Dow, the Dax index closing the session 58.85, or 2.75 per cent lower at 2,079.4, dropping another 10 points after hours and closing the post bourse with a partial recovery and the Ibis-indicated Dax at 2,095.11. Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM10.8bn. Financials lost out on interest rates, Dresdner Bank falling DM19.80, or 4.7 per cent to DM405.20; but Deutsche Bank recovered from DM792.50, down DM26.50 at the close to DM806 at the conclusion of the post-bourse. BMW, still supported by the Rover deal, actually managed a token rise of DM3.50 to DM770 at the end of the day. PARIS dipped sharply at the opening but found its feet later on with brokers reporting that the selling was led by retail investors, as institutions remained largely absent. The CAC-40 index finished down 42.11 at 2,287.06, off the low of 2,258.60. Traders remained unperturbed by the rise in US interest rates, and noted that the Dow's resilience at yesterday's opening provided a support to trading in the afternoon. Promodes, the retailing group, stood out with a gain of FFr17 to FFr1,135, almost alone among CAC-40 stocks in showing a rise. James Capel put out a hold note yesterday, following the company's recent turnover data which showed a rise of some 7 per cent, and ahead of the 1993 profit figures due early next month. Capel expects the latter to show an increase of 26 per cent, leading to an eps of FFr40.30. ZURICH saw heavy selling by traders and speculators while institutional investors were largely inactive. The SMI index shed 76.8 to 3,089.8 as the day's events prompted some speculation that the market, which has risen steadily in recent months, could at last be facing a short-term correction of 5 per cent or more. Among banks UBS lost SFr24 to SFr1,489, SBC shed SFr11 to SFr514 and CS Holding dipped SFr21 to SFr739. AMSTERDAM lost ground but closed off the session low as some bargain hunting emerged. The AEX index finished off 5.30 at 205.60. KLM featured with a less than average 50 cents fall to Fl 51.50. Investors have become more positive about the group recently while Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy recommendation at the end of last week. MILAN's loss was limited to 1 per cent after some short covering towards the end of the day and the Comit index fell 6.82 to 664.88. BCI, due to be privatised later this month, rose another L51 to L5,291. Falck, the steelmaker, climbed L514 or 10 per cent to L5,633, after Friday's announcement that a shareholders syndicate, formed in December 1991, would not continue after June. Alitalia soared L223 or 18.6 per cent to L1,419 on recent management change and on talks with other airlines. MADRID saw heavy selling and the general index closed 7.30 lower at 349.17 in turnover up from Pta43.8bn to Pta59bn. In a weak construction sector, Huarte lost Pta145, or 6.1 per cent at Pta2,215. In banks, Santander, which said over the weekend that it was considering a bid for the troubled Banesto, fell Pta130 to Pta7,190. Banesto itself ended Pta 54, or 6.75 per cent down at Pta750. BRUSSELS dropped by just under 3 per cent at worst, but a mere 15 basis points cut in base rate stopped the slide in its tracks. After a flurry of Bel-20 basket buying near the close the index recovered to end only 1.64 down at 1,527.11. VIENNA picked up from the day's lows, limiting the sesion's loss to 1.1 per cent in low turnover as investors awaited the outcome of last night's Wall Street performance. The ATX index finished 13.43 lower at 1,192.64. HELSINKI suffered in the banking and forestry sectors, down 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, as the Hex index lost 72.6 to 1,899.3. COPENHAGEN eased in good turnover, while Unidanmark slipped DKr10 to DKr229 in spite of reporting its first profit since its formation in 1990. The KFX index lost 1.31 to 115.00. WARSAW bounced 8.5 per cent higher as local investors, with few other investment opportunities, returned to the market after the sharp losses of the previous three sessions. The WIG index added 1,266 to 16,137.5.

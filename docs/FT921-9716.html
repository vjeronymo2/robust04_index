			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Further 500 troops are sent to Ulster SEVERAL HUNDRED more troops were on their way to Northern Ireland yesterday, bringing the Army presence there to its highest level since 1979. About 500 soldiers from 2 Battalion The Queen's Regiment were ordered to the province in response to calls for stronger security to deal with the upsurge in sectarian killings. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will discuss Northern Ireland's security with nationalist and Unionist leaders today after one of the most violent months since the early 1970s. Two other extra units were deployed in Northern Ireland last month - an infantry battalion and a field artillery regiment sent to refurbish permanent checkpoints. These were in addition to the 10 battalions, totalling 10,800 soldiers, which have formed a more or less constant Army presence for more than five years. The total now stands at about 12,300. There are also about 6,100 soldiers of the locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment, half of whom are part-time. Army officers said that the deployments were meant to be 'very short-term' but the troops would remain as long as they were required. The prime minister hopes his meeting with local leaders will encourage political co-operation in the province. But officials made clear yesterday that it was an opportunity for him to listen, rather than an effort to start formal 'round-table' negotiations. He is expected to ask the leaders to encourage greater co-operation between the community and security forces and to express the abhorrence of most people in the province to violence. The government has sought to avoid increasing permanent troop levels. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said the authorities wanted to show they were 'actually prepared to do the things they need to do'.</p>

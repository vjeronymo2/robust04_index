The restriction was originally imposed because armed hostilities then were taking place in Iraq and Kuwait, and because there was an imminent danger to the safety of United States travellers to Iraq. American citizens then residing in Iraq and American professional reporters and journalists on assignment there were exempted from the restrictions on the ground that such exemptions were in the national interest. The restriction was extended for additional one year periods on February 18, 1992 and February 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although armed hostilities have ended, conditions in Iraq remain unsettled and hazardous. Regional conflicts continue in northern Iraq between Kurdish ethnic groups and Iraqi security forces. In southern Iraq, military repression of the Shia communities is severe, rendering conditions unsafe. Iraq's economy was severely damaged during the Gulf War and continues to be affected by the U.N. economic sanctions. Basic modern medical care and medicines may not be available to our citizens in case of emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. citizens and other foreigners working inside Kuwait near the Iraqi border have been detained by Iraqi authorities in the past and sentenced to lengthy jail terms for illegal entry into the country. Although our interests are represented by the Embassy of Poland in Baghdad, its ability to obtain consular access to detained U.S. citizens and to perform emergency services is constrained by Iraqi unwillingness to cooperate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these circumstances, I have determined that Iraq continues to be a country ``*&blank;*&blank;* where there is imminent danger to the public health or physical safety of United States travelers.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, United States passports shall continue to be invalid for use in travel to, in, or through Iraq unless specifically validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State. The restriction shall not apply to American citizens residing in Iraq on February 1, 1991 who continue to reside there, or to American professional reporters or journalists on assignment there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public notice shall be effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and shall expire at the end of one year unless sooner revoked or extended by Public notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Warren Christopher, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4979 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;10&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

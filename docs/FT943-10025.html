			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Wakey wakey - open your eyes to new products - Innovations Spew is every parent's nightmare: the fruit-flavoured powder, available in the US, makes a coloured foam in the mouth, and is sold complete with a reflecting 'Spewer Viewer' so children can check the effect. Oaw is a French canine 'sports drink' which is said to refresh and revive dogs after they have been exercising. Hot 'n' Cold is a Danish bread-and-ice-cream sandwich which can be served grilled, fried or toasted. Spew, Oaw, and Hot 'n' Cold are just three of the 12,000 new products which have been unleashed on unsuspecting consumers around the world in the past year, according to the market research group Mintel. Its 450 field researchers - who shop for the new, bizarre and the handful of products which will still be on the shelves by next year - report that product innovation has been continuing unabated, even in those economies affected by recession. Six product areas account for about a quarter of all launches listed last year by Mintel in its fortnightly new product reports: confectionery; desserts and ice creams; sauces and seasonings; soft drinks; haircare; and oral hygiene. New launches in confectionery have ranged from the vitamin- enriched and sugar-free, to the high-calorie and luridly- coloured. In France, Neon Sucettes are lollipops which stain the tongue 'electric blue', 'toad green', or 'Dracula red'. At the same time, France has also seen the launch of 'natural' fruit gums which claim to help keep the 'intestinal eco-system' in good order. The Japanese appear to be keen on what Mintel terms 'functional' foods. For example, Wakey is a gum which wards off sleepiness, while Kiss Mints have extended their range to include apple mint for etiquette, herb mint for relaxation, and jasmine mint for elegance. A new drink based on dokudami, a foul-smelling plant, 'helps quicken blood flow, promote urination and prevents various adult diseases'. The wonder drink is also said to be 'efficacious against piles, constipation and menopausal disorders'. In personal care products, the 'two-in-one' trend, which began with shampoos and conditioners, now seems to be working its way through bath and toothpaste new launches. Mentadent Mouthwash, for example, is being packaged in a dual-chambered container which dispenses baking powder and hydrogen peroxide solutions. Not unlike Spew or Neon Sucettes, the effect is blue and effervescent. Mr David Jago, Mintel's new products specialist, says that most new product launches are doomed to failure. The commonly-quoted figure is 90 per cent, although he says it depends on how failure is defined - for example, character merchandising is often only intended to have a short life span. 'I'd hazard a guess that around 70-80 per cent of all product introductions don't succeed in the long term,' he says.</p>

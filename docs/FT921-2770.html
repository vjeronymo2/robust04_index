			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Isosceles plans US, Ulster disposals ISOSCELES, the Gateway food retail group formed through a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday said it would float Wellworth, its Northern Ireland supermarket chain, on the stock market, and sell Herman's, its US sporting goods chain, this year. The two disposals would help prepare Isosceles for a stock market flotation which would allow its shareholders to realise their investment. Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, chief executive, said Isosceles would concentrate on expanding the mainland UK food business, particularly two new formats, Somerfield and Food Giant. Analysts suggested that the announcement reflected the poor financial position of Isosceles. Mr Mitchell-Innes said the next repayment of debt was not until April 1993, when Pounds 100m was due, and Isosceles was 'not desperate for cash'. Isosceles, which has debt of around Pounds 1.3bn, had hoped to sell assets earlier to pay down the debt. But recession and the slump in values of retail businesses meant that disposals could not be made at sufficiently high prices. In 1990 Isosceles refinanced its debt to take account of its inability to sell assets, notably Herman's. Last year, Mr David Smith, who masterminded the buy-out, and Ms Elizabeth Hignell, the finance director, left Isosceles. Herman's, which has been losing money, has been shown as an asset held for disposal in Isosceles' accounts and its value was written down in the last balance sheet to Pounds 194m. Mr Mitchell-Innes said although Herman's had been for sale for some time, the group would now actively market it. He said there were some signs of a pick-up in the US retail market but he could not say whether Herman's would fetch its book value. Wellworth is regarded as a successful business and made operating profits in Isosceles' last financial year, to end April 1991, of Pounds 17.7m. Analysts said it could be valued at up to Pounds 150m on a flotation, although yesterday's announcement might flush out a trade buyer. Advisers to the disposals are SG Warburg, the UK merchantbank, and Wasserstein Perella, the US buy-out specialists. Wasserstein, originally a rival bidder to Isosceles for Gateway, is now a 40 per cent shareholder in Isosceles. Lex, Page 20</p>

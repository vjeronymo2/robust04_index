			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, Feb 23 (TANJUG) -- Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate Granic said on Wednesday [23 February] that Croatia is  ready to pull out its troops from the former Yugoslav republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that it has already withdrawn 600  soldiers in the past few days.    Granic met in Bonn with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel  to discuss the involvement of Croatia's regular army troops in  the fighting between the Bosnian Croats and Muslems in Mostar, a  city in southern Bosnia, and in other regions.    The UN Security Council has ordered Croatia to withdraw its  troops from Bosnia by February 17 or face international  sanctions. After the deadline expired, the UN secreatry general  informed the Security Council that about 5,000 soldiers of the  regular Croat Army remain in Bosnia.    Following talks with Granic, Kinkel said there are hopes for  a peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia especially after the  favourable developments in Sarajevo, but he underscored that  there are `several Sarajevos' in Bosnia.    In an interview with the German radio Kinkel said that  Russia's involvement in the peace process in Bosnia is extremely  important and that there can be no resolution of the crisis in  the former Yugoslavia without Russia.    Granic told a press conference that the Croatian Government  would do everything so that the problems in Bosnia and in the  other parts of the former Yugoslavia are resolved in a peaceful  way through political means.</p>

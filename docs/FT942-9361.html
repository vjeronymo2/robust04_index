			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Factory prices support low inflation outlook A survey pointing to moderate retail sales growth in April and news yesterday of a seven-year low in the inflation rate for goods leaving UK factories suggested that Britain remains on course for a steady recovery with low inflation in spite of last month's tax increases. The Confederation of British Industry reports today that retail sales volumes grew rather more quickly than expected in the year to April, maintaining the 'relatively modest annual growth in volumes' of the first three months of this year. According to the Central Statistical Office yesterday, producer output prices - the price of goods leaving factories - rose 2.2 per cent during the year to April, the lowest rise since December 1986. The two reports, coming at the start of a week packed with UK statistics, appeared to support the Treasury's belief that the risks of higher inflation are not as great as feared by the Bank of England and that the economy is strong enough to withstand April's increases in direct and indirect taxation. That message was hammered home in Brussels yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, when he rejected European Commission forecasts that UK growth will fall next year to 2.3 per cent from 2.5 per cent. 'The forecasts are plainly wrong and quite out of line with other people's forecasts,' he said. 'Britain's recovery is well on course. Inflation is staying down and I think we are going to have a good, steady, sustained non-inflationary recovery.' The CBI's monthly distributive trades survey, carried out between April 18 and May 4, showed that most retailers reported higher sales volumes in the year to April, with especially strong growth in shoe shops and clothing stores. The improvement, said Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI survey panel, showed that the 'high street recovery remains on course'. However, he warned that April's volume growth remained below the year-on-year growth rates of late last year while retailers considered sales below the seasonal average. The picture of an unspectacular recovery with low inflation was supported by the producer price figures where the 'under-lying' seasonally adjusted output price index, which excludes food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, showed no increase in April. The index rose in the latest three months at an annualised rate of only 1 per cent. Meanwhile, input prices - the cost of raw materials used by manufacturing - edged up slightly, reflecting higher commodities and imports costs. The index of input prices rose 0.5 per cent in April from March and fell 1.5 per cent during the year to April compared with the previous year.

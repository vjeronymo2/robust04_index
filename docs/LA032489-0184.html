Final  </P> <P> IN BRIFE;  </P> <P> LOLICH DAUGHTER PLACED ON PROBATION  </P> <P> The daughter of former Detroit Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich has been placed on  three years' probation for stealing $70,000 in coins and jewelry -- including  her father's 1968 World Series ring -- from her parents' home.  </P> <P> Oakland County Circuit Judge David Breck on Thursday also ordered Stacy  Michelle Lolich, 19, to undergo periodic drug testing and abstain from alcohol.  Breck said he doesn't believe she has a substance abuse problem but he ordered  the tests as a safeguard. Stacy Lolich and John Ellenbrook, 22, of Lake Orion  were charged last July with stealing the items from her parents' home in  Washington, Mich. Some items were recovered.  </P></p>

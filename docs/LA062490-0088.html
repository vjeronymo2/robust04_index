			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GETTING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: SCOTT AYAKATUBBY USES ACUPUNCTURE AS PART OF HIS TRAINING REGIMEN.  </P> <P> If you don't think beach volleyball is a tough sport, you should see veteran  pro Scott Ayakatubby during one of his acupuncture sessions.  </P> <P> "I've got needles sticking out of my ears, my hands, my back, my feet, and my  butt," Ayakatubby said. "But I'm hooked on it. It helps get the new blood in  and the old blood out."  </P> <P> For the last couple of years Ayakatubby, 25, of Hermosa Beach, has been using  acupuncture as part of his training regimen.  </P> <P> You could say Ayakatubby's seven-year career is literally suspended on pins and  needles.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Ayakatubby had half a season wiped out because of a herniated  disk between the last two vertebrae in his lower back.  </P> <P> The disk brushed against Ayakatubby's sciatic nerve, sending intense pain along  his right side from his back to his heel. The injury is similar to the one  suffered a year ago by baseball slugger Dave Winfield and hockey star Mario  Lemieux.  </P> <P> "Most of the time it's just stiff, but when it hurts it's a sharp pain,"  Ayakatubby said. "Sometimes I've got to watch how I get out of bed in the  morning."  </P> <P> Ayakatubby first hurt the back after a tournament in Hawaii in 1988. He was out  for the rest of that season and part of the next, frustrating the plans he and  longtime partner Brent Frohoff had for a surge into the game's highest circle.  </P> <P> Right now, Ayakatubby is doing whatever he can to make sure it doesn't happen  again.  </P> <P> Barring surgery, that has meant frequent visits to the chiropractor and  masseuse and the acupuncturist, on recommendation from Ayakatubby's  grandmother.  </P> <P> "I'm as scared of needles as anyone else, but I figured if my grandmother could  handle it, I could too," he said.  </P> <P> This season, Ayakatubby appears to be all the way back. This weekend in Cape  Cod, Mass., he's playing with his fourth partner of the year -- first Frohoff,  then veterans John Hanley, Jon Stevenson and Tim Hovland.  </P> <P> At the Cape Cod Open, Ayakatubby is teamed with Hovland, the fifth-ranked  player on the tour. Hovland's regular partner, Mike Dodd, missed the event with  the flu. Ayakatubby and Hovland are the fourth-seeded team in the tournament.  </P> <P> Seven years ago, Ayakatubby and Frohoff broke onto the tour. They were best  buddies from Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> Ayakatubby was only a year removed from Mira Costa High -- he was Mustang Coach  Mike Cook's most valuable player -- when he and Frohoff turned pro.  </P> <P> They both had American Indian blood -- Ayakatubby is part-Chickasaw, and  Frohoff is part-Cherokee. The rest of the tour called them "The Young Lions."  </P> <P> "We had a great summer that year," Ayakatubby said. "All of a sudden, we had  all this money we never had before, and we were just having a good time, on and  off the beach."  </P> <P> As the years went by, the pair began to take volleyball seriously. They made it  a way of life. They won their first tournament in 1985 at Santa Cruz; a year  later they won the second indoor championship of beach volleyball at the  Calgary Saddledome.  </P> <P> But they split for good this year.  </P> <P> Ayakatubby and Frohoff beat Hovland and Dodd on April 29 to win at Ft. Worth,  Tex. In other tournaments, they finished second twice, and fourth once.  </P> <P> But Frohoff moved on in late May, when former Olympian Karch Kiraly dumped his  partner, Kent Steffes of Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> Kiraly had experimented with Frohoff as a partner last season during  Ayakatubby's injury problems. Now Kiraly-Frohoff is one of the tour's most  formidable tandems, finishing no less than second in four events.  </P> <P> "Brent's game has really grown by playing with Karch," Ayakatubby said.  </P> <P> Although Ayakatubby holds no hope of playing with his old friend again, he  isn't holding grudges either.  </P> <P> "When Brent went with Karch, it was a pure business decision," Ayakatubby said.  "He had a chance to play with one of the best players in the world. I'd  probably do the same thing. It happens. I just can't dwell on it."  </P> <P> Instead, Ayakatubby is toughing it out. He and Stevenson -- the Assn. of  Volleyball Professionals president -- took seventh at Indianapolis last  weekend, which brought Ayakatubby's earnings this season to $31,000. He has  made more than $130,000 in his career.  </P> <P> At times, he's done it while battling heat exhaustion, which makes his legs  lock up and shake uncontrollably.  </P> <P> "I walk around like I'm 90 years old," he said.  </P> <P> Then of course there's the stiff back, which constantly reminds Ayakatubby of  the delicacy of his career.  </P> <P> The inherent demands of beach competition -- twisting, turning, jumping,  arching the back for spikes and diving into the sand for digs -- takes a steady  toll on the 6-foot-4 Ayakatubby.  </P> <P> "This game wrecks my body more than any other sport," he said. "It's kind of  frustrating because this is how I make my living."  </P> <P> He's no longer a young lion. Nowadays, folks around the tour call him "Ak."  Ayakatubby has the beach in his blood -- he started playing beach volleyball at  6, helped along by his mother and his uncle, Matt Gage.  </P> <P> Gage, the AVP's tour director, was an active player during Ayakatubby's boyhood  and won 26 open tournaments "back when they played for a six-pack and a  T-shirt," Ayakatubby said.  </P> <P> Today, Ayakatubby is happy. He has finally reached a plateau where he can work  out during the week, and he's playing consistently again.  </P> <P> "I have to stay healthy so I can go all out, which I haven't been able to do  for two years," he said. "I hated sitting out. That puts you into a bad mood  all the time."  </P></p>

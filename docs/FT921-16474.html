			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Strong results in US securities THE US securities industry's strong financial performance in 1991 has been underlined by figures showing that New York Stock Exchange member firms reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 824m in the third quarter of the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 124m a year before. The third quarter performance took place against a background of keen investor involvement in securities trading as US interest rates continued to fall. In the third quarter of 1990, the market was plagued by uncertainty surrounding the Gulf crisis. The figures cover NYSE member firms that do business with the public, rather than specialist market makers. The underlying 1991 quarterly performance was even better than the figures suggest because they include a one-time Dollars 200m pre-tax provision by Salomon Brothers for potential liability from its Treasury auction rigging scandal. The 322 firms covered by the figures saw revenues rise to Dollars 15.25bn, up 16.5 per cent, from the Dollars 13.01bn in the third quarter of 1990. Second quarter 1991 revenues totalled Dollars 14.85bn and after tax profits were Dollars 859m. Profits in the third quarter represented an 8.9 per cent annual return on member firms' average net worth of Dollars 37.95bn during the period.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UCI PROGRAM TARGETS PRE-COLLEGE STUDENTS  </P> <P> A college preparatory program will be offered by UC Irvine this summer for  gifted junior high and high school students who qualify in what UCI called a  "talent search."  </P> <P> Students with exceptional math, verbal or overall academic ability are being  sought for the first-time program, said Jim Waldron, the program's director in  the UCI Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges.  </P> <P> To qualify, students in grades 7-12 must score as well as or better than the  average high school senior on either the SAT or the SCAT examination.  </P> <P> The deadline for registration for the SAT -- the Scholastic Aptitude Test for  college admission -- is Friday, although late registration is permitted until  Feb. 15, and students may be able to take the test as walk-ins at test sites,  Waldron said.  </P> <P> The final day for registering for the SCAT -- a shortened version of the SAT,  which is not used for college admission -- is Feb. 22.  </P> <P> Classes will be taught by UCI professors, who will include such subjects as  international relations, critical thinking and writing, physics, jazz-dance,  sailboating and college survival.  </P> <P> "This is a very selective program for high-achieving students," Waldron said.  "Our goal is to offer especially stimulating educational experiences not  usually available to these students."  </P> <P> Applicants must pay a $15 fee. In addition, tuition for the 5-week session --  offered June 26 to Aug. 3 for high school students -- is $585. High school and  junior high students may enroll in the 3-week session, scheduled July 10-28,  for $535.  </P> <P> Scholarships are available. Students may commute or live in campus guest  quarters with a chaperon. Minibus service is also available in Orange County.  </P></p>

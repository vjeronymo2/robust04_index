			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / CBI calls for urgent action to reduce long-term jobless Economic recovery in Britain will not solve the problem of the country's 1.5m long-term unemployed, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday in a report welcomed by the Labour party and trade unions. The CBI said it would need urgent state action to reduce the number of people out of work for more than six months. It would also need a commitment from employers to recruit the long-term unemployed and greater willingness from the jobless to take available work. The employers' organisation urged the government to increase incentives for the unemployed to return to work and called for the reform of the state employment service. It stressed that such measures would not add to state spending. The CBI said the state employment service should be made more sensitive to employers' needs. It also said the service should equip the jobless with basic skills of literacy and numeracy. It urged employers to make more use of the employment service to fill vacancies while the jobless were called on to train for new jobs as unskilled manual work declines. Mr Ian McCartney, Labour's employment spokesman, welcomed the CBI initiative. 'This is an unprecedented report by employers, calling for active intervention to end mass unemployment,' he said. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the report was a very positive step. 'It shows widespread recognition across the political spectrum of the problems of the long-term unemployed,' he said. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said unless immediate steps were taken to reduce long-term unemployment, wage-led inflation could re-emerge as the labour market tightened because of skill shortages. A survey of 450 employers carried out for the CBI by the Gallup poll organisation revealed widespread criticism of the state employment service. Over half the companies said they had never heard of any of the government employment schemes that cost about Pounds 1.5bn a year. In a CBI survey of the long-term jobless, about 28 per cent said the low wages on offer compared with the welfare available was a handicap to rejoining the labour market. In a separate report, the six-man independent panel of economic forecasters advising the Treasury also suggested changes to cut the cost of employing people on low wages and a new income tax and National Insurance system to make it more attractive to hire the unskilled.

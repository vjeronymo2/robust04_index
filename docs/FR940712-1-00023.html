Notice of the finding is to be published promptly in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This notice meets the latter requirement for the 12-month finding made earlier for the petition discussed below. Information contained in this notice is a summary of the information in the 12-month finding, which is the Service's decision document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A petition dated September 30, 1992, was received from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Dr. Shi-Kuei Wu of the University of Colorado on October 5, 1992. The petitioners requested the Service to emergency list the Rocky Mountain capshell ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acroloxus coloradensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as endangered and to designate critical habitat concurrently with the listing. The petitioners submitted biological, distributional, historical, and other information and scientific references in support of the petition. The notice of a 90-day finding was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28543), indicating that the petitioners provided substantial information to warrant the requested action. Concurrent with publishing the notice, the Service initiated a status review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the 90-day finding was completed, the Rocky Mountain capshell was thought to be restricted to only two populations in the United States and five in Canada. In the United States, one population existed at Peterson Lake, Boulder County, Colorado, and the other at Glacier National Park in Montana. In Canada, the Rocky Mountain capshell was known to occur in three lakes in Quebec and two ponds in Ontario. The species was presumed extirpated from two lakes in Jasper National Park, Alberta (Clarke 1992a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the summer of 1993, an extensive survey effort in Colorado increased the number of known Rocky Mountain capshell populations in Colorado from one to five, with four of these populations apparently in ``good health'' and occurring on National Park Service or U.S. Forest Service lands (Pioneer Environmental Services 1993, Riebesell and Kovalak 1993). The fifth population is located on privately owned land and appears to be the only Colorado population that is in peril.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A status survey conducted at Lost Lake, Montana in September 1992 found that Rocky Mountain capshell population to be stable. This population is estimated to contain between 20,000 and 40,000 individuals, based on the number of snails found per square meter and the amount of available habitat (A.H. Clark, Ecosearch Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

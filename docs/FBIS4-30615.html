			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japanese industries have  begun studying measures to overcome the rising value of the yen,  including importing low-priced materials from overseas, industry  sources said Monday [27 June].    The yen has been on an uptrend [upward trend] against the  U.S. currency, closing in Tokyo Monday at a postwar high of  99.93 yen against the dollar.    Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., are now  considering importing rolled steel from South Korea for use in  their vehicles, the sources said.    They said rolled steel imported from South Korea is about 20  percent cheaper than the domestic product.    Mitsubishi plans to use South Korean rolled steel for the  interior of its cars, such as the inner face of doors, they said.    In addition, domestic shipbuilders, facing rising  competition  from South Korea, launched a study last year to import  low-priced steel materials, the sources said.    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. has decided to import steel  materials from South Korea and Brazil on a spot deal, and its  imports of shipbuilding materials this year are expected to  account for around 5 percent of the procurement, they said.    Shipbuilding firms are in a dilemma over the increasing use  of imported materials, however, as customers want prices to be  cut in line with cheaper production costs.    For similar reasons, construction and other industries are  hesitating to increase imports of raw materials from overseas,  the sources said.    They said automobile makers and shipbuilders are using  low-priced imports as a tool for price bargaining with domestic  steelmakers.    Export-oriented industries have been hit hard by the strong  yen.    Kyushu Matsushita Electric Co., an affiliate of the world's  leading consumer electronics maker Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co., said the yen's rise by 1.00 yen per dollar will  produce a loss of 1.8 billion yen per year.    The company has mapped out its business projection for the  current year on the yen-dollar exchange level of 105 yen per  dollar.    Yoshihiro Yasui, president of Japan's top sewing machine  maker Brother Industries Ltd., described the yen's rise above  the 100 yen per dollar level as epoch-making.    Yasui said dollar-yen exchange rates are moving on  speculation regardless of fundamental economic factors.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Denby coming to market with Pounds 43m tag Denby Group, the stoneware pottery maker, yesterday announced the final details of its flotation with a share price of 130p, which values the company at Pounds 43.3m. Based on this share price, and forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for the year to September 30, the group is coming to the market on a prospective multiple of 14. This compares with about 17.5 for Portmeirion Potteries, which has been cited as its closest comparison in the sector. Denby also forecast a final dividend of at least 1.4p for the year to September 30 and earnings of 9.2p. Based on the pre-tax forecast, the notional full year dividend would have been 3.1p, with a yield of 3 per cent. Denby, which is returning to the market after a 13 year absence, is issuing 20.4m shares through a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 8.5m net for the company. Some 15.3m shares are being placed with institutions. The balance will also be placed, although subject to a clawback depending on the public demand for shares. Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, has said the group intends to use the proceeds to pay off the debt incurred in the Pounds 5m venture capital-backed management buy-out in 1990. The board will retain 22 per cent of the enlarged company, with existing shareholders owning a further 17 per cent. The group has spent the last four years recovering from mishaps which began with an ill-fated diversification in the US in the 1970s. Heavy losses led to a takeover by Crown House in 1981, and eventually Coloroll, which collapsed in 1990. Since Denby's management bought the company pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds 724,000 in the 18 months to September 30 1991. COMMENT The glut of flotations left Denby coming to the market with a price lower than many existing shareholders might have wished. The rating seems about right, however, given the difficulties which many are facing in getting new issues away. Investors can look forward to substantial growth abroad, and might want to study Portmeirion's experience in the US for future potential.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> RED SOX SEEM TO BE HAVING FUN FOR A CHANGE  </P> <P> Once staid and often surly, for years the Red Sox were known as a team without  personality. The Paul Revere statue down the road had as much life as Red Sox  players. You want fun, go to Faneuil Hall. You want base hits, come to Fenway.  </P> <P> Boy, are times a changin'. No longer a group of businessmen with attache cases  and foul outlooks, the Red Sox actually seem to be enjoying themselves. What's  more, they even seem to like each other.  </P> <P> "The old stuff about 24 cabs for 24 players is far from the truth now," Mike  Greenwell said. "It's one cab, 24 players. If we could all get in one cab, we  would.  </P> <P> "Before, we had a lot of the old school. They'd go out and do a job and that's  it. They were not rah-rah types. We have a little bit of a college atmosphere  now."  </P> <P> Together, they are in first place, well ahead of the Blue Jays. Together, they  are joking and laughing, probably all the way to the playoffs. Greenwell is  behind some of the fun, along with recent imports Tom Brunansky and Tony Pena.  </P> <P> For the first time, the Red Sox have a kangaroo court. It's an old baseball  tradition whereby fines are instituted for goofball mistakes, on and off the  field. The Red Sox may be the last team to have instituted one.  </P> <P> When they change, they really change. On Aug. 11, the Red Sox engaged in the  ultimate battle of rally caps, the silly baseball superstition in which players  wear their caps wrong; it's supposed to ignite the offense. The Red Sox won  that game, 3-2, in Seattle's Kingdome on Dwight Evans' home run in the 13th  inning.  </P> <P> Just as important to them, Greenwell claims the rally-cap battle was won, too.  "We cut holes in the caps and put shaving cream all over our faces," Greenwell  said.  </P> <P> Greenwell, who instituted the court, introduced a seance-like atmosphere in  Milwaukee July 24 when he held "a candle ritual" in an effort to revive sagging  Red Sox bats. Greenwell placed the bats in a darkened clubhouse, then put 150  candles in a circle and lit them. Also present was a rubber chicken.  </P> <P> It was weird, but it worked. The Red Sox hitters are doing almost as well as  their pitchers. There's the other change. Red Sox pitchers, formerly a  necessary evil, are this team's strength. Of course, there's Roger Clemens  (20-5). But it's not Roger, over and out anymore. Mike Boddicker (13-8) is a  solid No. 2 pitcher, but hardly anyone expected they'd also get contributions  from Greg Harris, Tom Bolton and Dana Kiecker.  </P> <P> Holding the Red Sox back in the early going was their offense. They are at or  near the bottom of the league in stolen bases and home runs, a deadly  combination that has been overcome by their league-leading .274 batting  average. Last week, they pitched three straight shutouts against the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Some say the Blue Jays possess more talent, but Ellis Burks said, "Up and down  the lineup, we're the best team."  </P> <P> Not all of his teammates agree. Evans said, "If you were to write our team and  their team on a piece of paper, I think I'd take their team."  </P> <P> Not that this team is without ability. Far from it. Wade Boggs, Evans and  Clemens are potential Hall of Famers and Greenwell and Burks are All-Star  quality, at least. Togetherness would be nothing without talent. As Boggs  pointed out, "You could have 25 Peter Pans where everyone sleeps together and  still not win. You still have to cross those white lines."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 5 Jun (AE) -- The expansion of the  Landless People's Movement (MST) in Brazil was on the agenda of  a meeting the 14 Army High Command generals held at the end of  May. Military reports say that documents prepared by the Army  reveal that in addition to the Trabalhadores Ranch in  Pernambuco, land invaders have another training area known as  "Cacador University" in Santa Catarina in the town of Cacador.    Most Army reports on landless people's action were prepared  by the Southern Military Command, which covers Rio Grande do  Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana. The Army considers these states  the most critical because of frequent land occupations and the  methods landless people use in their operations. There is also  major concern about Sao Paulo State, which the military has  placed in fourth place because of the large number of land  occupations. Next comes Pernambuco as the state with the next  largest number of occupations.    Army reports show that "Cacador University" is an old  convent  that priests donated to the Landless People's Movement. Various  types of training are given in the convent, which landless  people have christened a "university" because it is considered a  school. According to military sources, the slogan of the group  occupying this area is "occupy, resist, and produce."    According to information gathered by the Army, when someone  outside the MST gets near the area, landless people abandon all  suspicious activities that might prove they were undergoing  training and begin chanting church songs in an attempt to show  they were in a cult.    A Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) document, to which O  ESTADO had exclusive access this week, also mentioned "Cacador  University." SAE also considers the "university" a landless  people's training area.    The Army reports always mention the Military Police's rapid  intervention in all the places where land occupations have been  reported. Army officers are concerned because if the Military  Police are overwhelmed or if help is needed to enforce the  Constitution, the Army will be called in. This is why the Army  believes it is justified in closely following all landless  people's movements.    At Army High Command meetings, generals always evaluate  landless people's action. The matter never has a noticeable  place on the agenda, but it surfaces either as part of the  debates or as a subject for an exchange of information among  military commanders whenever they discuss the national situation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baroda, June 1, The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]  today countered the Prime Ministers "posture" on the issue of  nuclear option and asserted that India ought to declare itself  as a "nuclear weapon state".    BJP president L.K. Advani as well as senior leader A.B.  Vajpayee said that while the BJP was all for de-nuclearisation  and disarmament the most question was whether this was happening  anywhere.    "China", Mr Vajpayee said, "has just tested another nuclear  device" Iran is on the threshold of the bomb while Pakistan is  widely believed to have already made the bomb.    "So, where is the de nuclearisation?" Mr Vajpayee said and  added: "We can also destroy the bomb. But first we have to make  one. We should declare that we are a nuclear weapon state. That  declaration itself would suffice."    Mr Advani, while talking to news men, said he for one was  amused by the Prime Minister's reported remark that the BJP was  resorting to one-upmanship on the nuclear option issue. "I would  say that it is the Prime Minister who is indulging in  one-upmanship by saying that his Government has kept the nuclear  option open."    The BJP, Mr Advani said, ha been a consistent advocate of  India going nuclear. An additional argument in support of this  view now stemmed from the sort of attitude being adopted by the  US after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its emergence as  the only superpower.    Mr Vajpayee, touching upon the PM's remarks while delivering  his own valedictory address at the BJP session, said it would  not suffice for the Prime Minister to say that the nuclear  option has been kept open. "You have to move further," he said.    Indiscipline flayed: Mr Vajpayee highlighted the need for  the  party to take all sections alone in its onward march. He also  called upon partymen to live up to the party's image by making a  break with factionalism and indiscipline.    In his customary session-end address, Mr Vajpayee told the  National Council members that the contagion of factionalism and  indiscipline widely prevalent in the other political parties was  threatening the BJP as well. It was for partymen to see this  danger.    Mr Vajpayee also spoke of the need for the Party to rise to  the aspirations of Dalits. "In fact, the Dalits have started  rallying behind the BJP in a big way. It is a good development  but we are not even aware of it," he said, and called for Dalit  conventions in the various States.    Mr Vajpayee came down heavily on anti-party activities being  resorted to by some. The party should not condone this. No  leniency should be showed to those who defy party discipline.    He also came down heavily on partymen jostling for position  and power.</p>

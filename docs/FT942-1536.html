			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (11): Samsung in the global village - The impact of Gatt on a key industrial group The Uruguay Round of Gatt has sharply divided South Korea, provoking a clash between tradition and modernity. Farmers demonstrate in the streets of Seoul and other cities to protest at the opening of the rice market, which they warn could destroy the agriculture industry and with it the source of the country's rich culture. In contrast, the Samsung industrial group tells its workers in a corporate video that 'if we fail to open our door to foreigners, both Korea and Samsung will perish'. Parliamentary approval of the new Gatt agreement, which is expected this summer at the earliest, would represent the most significant sign yet of the government's commitment to accept a more open economy. If farmers are the biggest losers from the Gatt treaty, Korea's big conglomerates, such as Samsung, believe they will be the main beneficiaries because the accord promises increased business. 'Industrial groups such as Samsung are the best-prepared sector of the economy to take advantage of the Uruguay round because we have been exposed to foreign competition for 30 years, while the service and agricultural sectors are vulnerable because they have been protected,' says Mr Lim Dong-sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute. One obvious benefit is that exports of Korean manufactured goods will increase due to the reduction of tariffs. Samsung is the world's leading producer of semiconductor memory chips and Korea's largest consumer electronics company. Its other main businesses include ships, machinery and petrochemicals. Although Samsung, the country's second largest conglomerate, is expected to face stiffer competition at home due to increased imports, particularly in the petrochemical and machinery sectors, it believes that growing exports will outweigh the negative effect of lower Korean tariffs. Samsung has also recently reduced its operations in textiles and food processing, two other sectors that could suffer under increased imports from China and south-east Asia as tariff barriers are dismantled. Nonetheless, Mr Lee Kun-hee, the Samsung chairman, remains deeply concerned that the group, which his father founded in 1938, remains psychologically ill-prepared to compete in the global market. 'Despite the enormous changes in the world, Samsung has yet to comprehend how far behind we are in these rapidly changing and competitive times,' Mr Lee wrote in a group pamphlet that has become mandatory reading for its employees. 'We are still caught up in the notion that Samsung is the best in Korea. We cannot be satisfied with that notion because it has no meaning in this global village,' he adds. Mr Lee last year introduced management reforms that emphasise individual initiative in a group that was known for its rigid hierarchical structure. The reforms were widely publicised in Korea after President Kim Young-sam recommended that government officials should study Samsung's new management practices. But there has been growing resistance among employees to the changes, which are considered 'too radical', according to one Samsung executive. An internal survey revealed that a majority of workers disliked Samsung's new working hours of 7am to 4pm, which were introduced to improve efficiency. Moreover, the group seems torn between its traditional commitment to growth and Mr Lee's goal of promoting quality at the expense of quantity, even if means the loss of market share. Officials at Samsung Electronics, for example, speak of making the concern one of the world's five biggest electronics companies by 2000, up from its current ninth place ranking, even as they acknowledge the need for improvements in product quality. The 'quality' issue has taken on increased importance for Samsung because one adverse result of the Gatt agreement is that it will place increased pressure on Korea to end its import ban on important Japanese products, such as electronics and cars. 'We are still lagging behind the Japanese in terms of quality and productivity, although we are confident we can close the gap before 1997, when the import ban is expected to be eased,' says Mr Moon Byung-dae, a senior managing director of Samsung Electronics. The entry of Japanese cars into the domestic market could also hurt Samsung's plans to begin passenger car production in late 1997, although Samsung believes that its recent agreement to buy advanced technology from Nissan of Japan will make it competitive. One benefit from the Gatt agreement is that it could force the government to accelerate its financial liberalisation programme, which would improve opportunities for Samsung to finance its corporate activities. Samsung and other Korean companies generally have to pay high interest rates on capital raised at home because of the country's antiquated and inefficient financial system. Companies are also restricted by the government from raising large amounts of cheaper funds abroad. The opening of financial services 'will help the competitiveness of industry because it will promote increased efficiency in the domestic financial sector and lead to lower capital costs,' says Mr Lim. Lower capital costs are crucial for Samsung as it undertakes a restructuring of its operations. Samsung plans to expand its high-tech activities, including costly research on developing a next generation of 256-megabit memory chips. It will also spend at least Dollars 6bn on its car project by 2000. But financial liberalisation will also have a negative impact, at least temporarily, on the financial service business that Samsung is developing. It already owns leading insurance and credit card companies and bought a securities firm in 1992. 'These financial companies will suffer a bit initially because the financial sector in general is vulnerable to foreign competition, but in the long term we don't expect our position will be harmed,' says Mr Lim. Indeed, analysts believe that Samsung and other conglomerates that operate financial services will benefit in the long term from financial liberalisation. The government is expected to break down barriers among various financial sectors and allow the creation of comprehensive Korean financial houses as one means to improve their competitiveness against foreign rivals. 'Financial liberalisation will provide an opportunity for Samsung and other conglomerates to edge out weaker competitors and expand their financial services, outside of banking, as the financial industry undergoes consolidation,' says Mr John Wadle, an analyst for BZW in Seoul.</p>

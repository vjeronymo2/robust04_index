			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Observer: Pukka cuppa Calling all discerning tea-drinkers. What do pianist Richard Clayderman and autumnal flush muscatel Darjeeling Silver Tips have in common? The answer is marketing whiz David Hutton. As one of the founders of Tellydisc in 1979, he had the dubious distinction of launching Clayderman on an unsuspecting public. Now he is trying to reincarnate the East India Company, founded by Royal Charter in 1600 and dissolved in the wake of the Indian mutiny of 1857. Together with Harrogate merchant Tony Wild, who had the same idea independently, he has gained permission to use the historic company's coat of arms, and the two are planning a range of products including spices, booze and fashion-goods. But the first venture, just set up, is a subsidiary specialising in teas, with appropriate guidance from the archives. As well as reviving the original recipe of Earl Grey, the co-directors have located a Sri-Lankan estate established by the ancestral company in the 1840s, where the almost forgotten Silver Tip - hand-rolled and sun-dried whole tea leaves - is again in production. The least we can hope is that the results are less syrupy than Clayderman.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Convulsions in the countryside - Patricia Morison visits the Museum of Rural Life ONE consolation for being a reluctant urban-dweller is the BBC's superb early morning farming programmes. Nothing brings home more sharply the convulsions now taking place in the British countryside - or the reasons why, apart from doctors, farmers have the highest rate of suicide. And yet, it seems there is extraordinarily little awareness among the folk who this Easter will be unloading the organic Brie and Frascati outside a thousand rented cottages, that what happens to British farming will vitally affect the countryside we urbanites currently enjoy. Anyone seriously interested in the countryside will doubtless know, if only by reputation, the Museum of English Rural Life at Reading, on the edge of the University campus in a dreadful 1960s prefab. Started in 1951, the museum houses a large collection (only a small part is on show) illustrating the changing face of farming and rural industries between, roughly, 1850 and 1950. However, this permanent exhibition of 'rescue objects' is only the tip of the haystack: it is but one part of the unique resources offered by Reading University's Institute of Agricultural History. First, however, the museum (0734-318660). These days, the countryside is well stocked with rural museums dedicated to the bygone skills and folk-customs of Thomas Hardy's England, etc. etc. aThe Reading Museum is fairly old-fashioned and strictly educational, not Bank Holiday fare for children. In the words of its Director, Dr Ted Collins, 'There are no chaps leaping about in smocks here' - and besides, it is shut on public holidays. This is a museum chronicling change in the countryside, not nostalgia, and above all, the interface between industry and farming. In that respect, it forms a remarkably good counterpart to Hardy's novels. In Tess of the Durbervilles, written in the great agricultural depression of the 1880s, Hardy's observes the reaper-and-binder, harvesting 'with the gentle ticking of grasshoppers making love'; this refers to a revolutionary innovation which, as I now know, was the invention of Cyrus H. McCormick of Virginia in 1831, and popularised here by the Great Exhibition 20 years later. School history books tend to overlook one salient fact: the 'dark satanic Mills' had as much impact on rural life in the 19th century as they did on urban society. Men like Robert Ransome of Ipswich, whose business developed out of patenting cold cast iron ploughshares, or Robert Boby of Bury St Edmunds who invented the Boby corn screen, were as significant in their impact, not just here but overseas, as ever Robert Arkwright with his spinning jenny. Of course, in these days of the computerised milking parlour, photographs of any pre-war farming activity are bound to strike a nostalgic chord. I was fascinated to find that benighted farmers in Kent still used ox-teams in 1910, much like their ancestors in the Domesday Book. The Ransome's Hall part of the museum houses a selection of fine wagons including the quaintly-named Hermaphrodite of 'Maphrodite', a cross between a wagon and a cart. There is also a collection of beautifully crafted model ploughs and a mass of curious objects for making besoms, chair-bodging, dairying, and such beastly operations as bloodletting horses (a fleam-stick) and cutting off lambs' tails. A small section portrays the changing image of the farmer in society. It does not, alas, take the story as far as today's barley barons in their Range Rovers, doomed as they may be to become the museum exhibits of tomorrow. But it is piquant to read the laments of observers like Richard Jeffries in the 1880s on the gentrification of Farmer Giles and, especially, of his womenfolk. 'The daughter is pale and interesting and interprets Beethoven, and paints the old mill, while a skilled person hired at a high price rules in the dairy.' Newly pallid misses of that type were what Angel Clare rejected in favour of poor, rosy-cheeked Tess. So much for the museum, then, a good morning's outing. The Institute of Agricultural History is a far more notable beast. Essentially, it is an extraordinarily rich archive - over 30,000 books and periodicals, company records, government bumph on farming, old films, union archives, and over one million photographs - charting every aspect of the history and development of the countryside from the late 19th century to the present day. Most of the material is British, but not all, and many of the company archives chart the rise and fall of British agricultural engineering exports overseas. The photographic archive is wonderful. Carefully indexed, it allows you to check what steam lawnmowers looked like, and inspect the designs for electricity pylons and village streetlighting considered in the 1930s (the Council for the Preservation of Rural England has deposited its archives here). Collectors of vintage farm machinery often consult the the Institute because crammed onto its shelves are longhand ledgers of engineering firms dating back to early last century. People looking to set up 'traditional' rural industries, researchers working on historical ecology, landscapists, historians of food, hunting, costume, and agrarian political discontent, have access to invaluable material through the Institute's computerised data base. In theory, you could use deposits of old MAFF farm management surveys to check the profit sheet of any farm in the land: unfortunately, these records are classified secret. Dr Collins also points to the hitherto unexploited potential of the Institute as a source of information for the development of alternative technology. He would like to see more Third World governments funding research into pre-tractorisation techniques. However, the premises of the Institute are absurdly small for its collection and the archives, let alone the activities of its staff and the public. An appeal has now been launched by the University of Reading to make of the Museum and the Institute a new entity, the Rural History Centre and is looking to raise Pounds 3.5m for a new building. The Centre will link up with Reading University's strength in in all aspects of agriculture, food production, and the environment at large and could play a really significant part in helping the general public reach a more informed, less sentimental understanding of the countryside and its inhabitants.</p>

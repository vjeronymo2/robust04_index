			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Insurance chief calls for delay on industry watchdog Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, has called for a delay in setting up the new financial services watchdog so that an alternative plan can be considered. His call comes within a week of the publication of details about how the Personal Investment Authority intends to operate. Completed application forms for firms and individuals to be admitted to the new regulator - scheduled to open for business in July - are due to have been filed by early April. Mr Greener, whose role puts him at the top of two of the UK's largest insurance companies, suggested yesterday that a deferment of a few months would be better than forcing firms to decide their regulatory future under such time pressure. Given that the process of setting up the PIA had already taken over two years, he said: 'I can't see what difference six months would make.' Mr Greener has produced alternative proposals for a single private investment regulator, which address training, costs, and compensation arrangements. A paper has been circulated within parts of the industry, and a copy is to be sent to Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary. It envisages a two-tier arrangement, where an executive committee of people working in financial services is supervised by a board of public interest directors. Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, said yesterday the proposal was interesting but 'has come very late in the day'. Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, and Mr Palmer have already begun meeting financial services practitioners to give more detailed explanations of how the PIA intends to work.

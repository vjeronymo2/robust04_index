			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A second bite of the cherry  -Tax-exempt special savings accounts / The higher initial limit for those with maturing Tessas THE MEASURE: When their Tessas mature, savers will be allowed to invest Pounds 9,000 in the first year of a new one. WHAT IT MEANS: Tax-exempt special savings accounts became available in January 1991. They were introduced by John Major when he was chancellor as a way of encouraging people to save. Whether this is what actually happened is debatable - a lot of existing building society money went straight into these accounts to benefit from the tax break. You could put up to Pounds 9,000 over five years into a Tessa and, as long as the capital remained untouched, the interest earned would be tax-free. The maximum investment in the first year was Pounds 3,000 and the annual maximum after that was Pounds 1,800, to the overall Pounds 9,000 limit. Under the new Budget rules, savers will be able to take out a new Tessa when their first one matures and will be able to invest Pounds 9,000 in the first year. This must be done within six months of the maturity of the old Tessa. The overall limit of Pounds 9,000 is unchanged, and people who invest less than Pounds 9,000 in the first year will be able to save over the next four years to the usual annual Pounds 1,800 limit. You are allowed to hold only one Tessa. Those who have never had a Tessa, however, or who have less than Pounds 3,000 in one, will not be able to take advantage of the new rules. They will be able to deposit a maximum of only Pounds 3,000 in the first year. The main reason for the increase to Pounds 9,000 in the first year is due to competition between building societies and their tax-free equity counterparts, the personal equity plan providers. By setting the first year maximum investment at Pounds 9,000, the chancellor has put Tessas on an equal investment footing with Peps. Investors can put Pounds 6,000 a year in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 more in a single company plan. Banks and societies were concerned that if the first-year Pounds 3,000 Tessa limit was not extended, they would see a sudden outflow of the Pounds 15bn of Tessas due to mature in the first quarter of 1996. Moves intended to harmonise banking conditions in Europe mean you are not confined to a UK bank for a Tessa. European Authorised Institutions  - credit companies incorporated in other EU member states - can offer them and some do, mainly from the Irish Republic. Under the second banking directive, which came into force at the beginning of last year, banks authorised to do business in an EU country are allowed to set up branches in another EU country without needing to get permission from that country's supervising authority. Some savers may be concerned about compensation should the 'foreign' bank go bust. Under new arrangements, the level of compensation to which a saver is entitled is the same as the compensation arrangements in the country in which the bank is operating. So if you open an account with a French bank which is operating in the UK, you will receive the same level of compensation as for a UK bank - 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. This also means that if you move abroad and open an account with a UK bank, your compensation will be at the level of the deposit protection scheme operating in that country, not the UK's where protection for building societies is 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. Base rates were high - 14 per cent - when Tessas were introduced. But since they are now only 5.75 per cent, savers may prefer to consider an alternative investment or use the money to reduce a mortgage. The most competitive Tessa rates can be found in our Best Rates table on page 8. If you are an investor in an offshore growth fund, do not be surprised if you no longer receive cheques for small sums of money. Distributor funds are obliged to pay out 85 per cent of their income as dividends in order to satisfy Inland Revenue requirements which differentiate them from roll-up funds that do not pay out income. But distributor funds which have an annual gross income of only 1 per cent or less will no longer have to distribute it.</p>

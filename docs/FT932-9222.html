			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Simon Eng shares decline to 52 1/2p SHARES IN Simon Engineering yesterday continued their sharp decline, triggered by Wednesday's profit warning and worries about the company's financial strength. The shares, which opened on Wednesday at 100p, yesterday fell from 73 1/2 p to 52 1/2 p in heavy trading. The fall was prompted by the company's confirmation that an expected first-half loss this year will breach a banking covenant on levels of interest cover. The company said its bankers remain supportive and no other covenants were in danger. The shares were further undermined by a profits downgrade from Smith New Court. The broker yesterday forecast Simon would incur a Pounds 6m loss this year, with no dividend, instead of a profit of Pounds 7.3m. Simon, involved in access equipment and process engineering, has seen its shares fall from a peak last year of 301p. Following a sharp outflow of cash in the last 12 months, gearing has passed 100 per cent.</p>

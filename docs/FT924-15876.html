			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Japanese car sales down Japanese vehicle sales were 4.4 per cent lower in September than a year ago as consumer demand continued to wane, writes Steven Butler in Tokyo. The Japanese Automobile Dealers Association said yesterday that 466,252 vehicles were registered in September. The only rise in sales recorded was for small trucks. A 11.2 per cent drop in sales of cars of more than 2 litres reflected the impact of the recession on spending on luxury items. Sales of Toyota cars were virtually unchanged from last year, while Nissan sales were down 19.3 per cent. Mitsubishi sold 8.9 per cent more cars.</p>

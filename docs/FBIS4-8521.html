			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic  president Radovan Karadzic expressed the hope today that "a  positive turn in UN behavior is still possible," if bombing and  other enemy acts against the Serbs stop immediately.    "If this does not take place there is not a nation in the  world that will accept the presence of UN forces on its  territory," Karadzic said in a letter sent to UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali.    "After this bombing, which can only be explained as  involvement in the civil war on the Muslim side, our relations  cannot be the same as before," the letter sent after NATO's  second air attack on Serb positions near Gorazde says.    Reminding Butrus-Ghali that he himself said on one occasion  that the "safe areas" were Muslim army strongholds, Karadzic  cites the international law on war, according to which "safe  areas" should be demilitarized and in which only the armed  presence of a third side, in this case UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces], is allowed.    "Muslims are constantly killing us from their `safe areas',  protected by your soldiers, and they have launched a major  offensive from Gorazde against the Serbs," Karadzic stresses.    He stresses that UNPROFOR has placed itself completely on  the  Muslim side and bombed Serb civilian and military targets at a  time when the Serbs are offering a cease-fire and the Muslim  side is rejecting this.    Karadzic says that there have been many irregularities in  UNPROFOR's behavior in the two years of war. Its members have  engaged in illegal trading, they have smuggled arms and  ammunition to the Muslims, and they have openly given them  military assistance in terms of reconnaissance and other actions.    Despite this, the attitude of the Serbs toward the UN  authorities has been exceptional during this entire time,  Karadzic says, adding: "There have not been any serious  incidents, while the other side has killed dozens of your  soldiers."    "The most recent UNPROFOR command in Bosnia-Herzegovina has  utterly damaged these relations, while its bombing has destroyed  the last remnants of respect for your armed forces here,"  Karadzic stresses.    "You will understand that we can no longer cooperate with  this command of yours that ordered the bombings. You will also  understand our greater caution regarding the movement of members  of UNPROFOR and the equipment being transported by them. All  the agreements and good relations until now, which arose out of  trust, have been wiped out, and we must monitor the behavior of  UNPROFOR as a potential hostile force."    "I hope, Your Excellency, that a positive turnabout in the  behavior of the United Nations is still possible. Of course,  this implies that the bombings and other hostile acts against  the Serbs must stop immediately," Karadzic concludes in his  letter to Butrus-Ghali.</p>

According to authorities concerned on 14 February, Chairman  Li Tiehu of the Xianhu business group of Jilin Province, China,  visited the ROK in early February to discuss this issue and  conveyed the North Korean authorities' intention that "Rather  than China or any other country, North Korea is now counting on  the South Korean side for the necessary funds to develop Port  Chongjin that is estimated to exceed $100 million," and added  that "North Korea is gearing up efforts to open sea routes  between Pusan and Chongjin, and Inchon and Nampo as part of a  plan to devote all of Chongjin to free economic zones." [Citing  a Chinese source, Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 15 February  1994 p 7 adds: "North Korea reportedly launched a feasibility  study on opening Chongjin and Nampo as economic zones" and  "North Korea once reviewed opening Sinuiju as an economic zone,  only to withhold a final decision."]    Xianhu Business has been learned to have signed an exclusive  contract with the North Hamgyong Provincial Administrative and  Economic Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Co. of North  Korea to build a wharf for containers and cranes, a road  connecting Chongjin and Horyong, and to expand an open storage  yard to 237,000 sq. yds.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Publicans feel the draught: Philip Rawstorne finds that while bar prices are rising, many pubs face the threat of closure in a restructured environment MR GERALD Richardson, whose company runs nine pubs in London, likens himself to the proverbial duck. 'We've had to paddle like hell in this recession - but at least we've managed to keep our head above water,' he says. 'Since last April, we've worked harder on promotions than ever before but trade on average has fallen about 12 per cent. It's not been disastrous, but it's certainly been tough.' Mr Bruce Allen, whose Allen Partnership owns nearly 100 pubs throughout the country, says: 'Our beer volumes are down 8 per cent overall, and we've also reduced our profit margins.' The effect of the recession has varied from region to region. Scotland and northern England have generally fared better than the Midlands and the south. Business at the Five Pilchards in the Cornish village of Porthallow has fallen 15 per cent. The Three Moles in Selham, West Sussex, reports that trade has been flat. In the traditional Tap and Spile in Hexham, Northumberland, cask ale sales have risen profitably. But the snug bar has certainly shivered as never before in the economic draught. Many publicans have caught a cold. Of the 700 non-tied pubs on the market in January, about 50 were 'distress sales' by receivers, double the number in January 1991. Almost as many again were put up for auction by owners cutting their losses. Mr Barrie Lomas, of Inn Data, the pub trade researcher, says many of the pubs were bought three or four years ago at the top of the market. Profits no longer covered repayment of high-interest loans. The proportion of casualties is still relatively small but the numbers continue to rise. The cost of what many publicans describe as the worst trading conditions for 40 years has started to appear in the bad-debt provisions made by brewers against their loans to free-trade pubs. Whitbread last week raised its provisions to Pounds 37m, indicating that about a quarter of the 11,000 pubs and bars it supplies in the free trade were in financial difficulties. Bass has increased its bad-debt provisions to Pounds 16m and written off Pounds 2.6m. Marston has provided for more than Pounds 4m. Although pre-tax profits of those three companies have slipped, most brewers have so far been able to maintain or improve profits, and all have raised dividends. Customers may have ordered fewer beers last year but they paid more for them. Volume sales fell 7 per cent. Prices, excluding tax, rose by about 11 per cent. The price rises helped to compensate national brewers for a loss of volume that was exacerbated by the enforced sale of pubs to meet the requirements of the government's beer orders. Those lay down that by November this year all the national brewers have to free large numbers of pubs - about 11,000 in all - from 'tied' exclusive beer supplies. Bass has so far sold 2,200 pubs. Whitbread has sold almost 1,000 and Allied-Lyons and IEL, the Courage/GrandMet pub company, nearly 2,000 between them. The restructuring, they claim, is costing them Pounds 500m - equivalent to 5p a pint on annual beer sales. Regional brewers have seized the opportunity to strengthen their pub estates. Vaux has just added 113 pubs to its existing estate of 900. Morland bought 100 pubs for Pounds 16.4m from Courage to expand its Thames Valley estate by a third. Mansfield has acquired 115 Courage pubs to build its east Midlands trade and Marston consolidated its Midlands base by paying Pounds 7.6m for 49 Allied pubs. Brent Walker has leased 734 pubs from Allied, and Devenish has rented 115 from Whitbread. Hundreds of the pubs have been bought by sitting tenants. New pub companies have been formed. Century Inns, run by a former brewery manager, has acquired 270 pubs in north-east England within a few months, for example. There is no lack of faith, it seems, in the future of the pub trade, whatever its present difficulties. There is a down side, though. Many of the pubs on offer are unlikely to be viable as single units detached from the large brewers' estates. Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, says: 'There are many rural pubs on the market which should close because they are never going to make money.' Industry observers estimate that before the end of the decade 10,000 pubs will have closed. The survivors will face fresh challenges and a greater demand on their business skills during the 1990s. The demographic trend is unfavourable. There will be fewer young men regularly drinking pints of 'session' lagers. Older customers will be more discerning, value-for-money spenders, demanding a wide choice of branded drinks, good food and more comfortable surroundings. Increased competition will squeeze profit margins. The take-home trade, increasingly in the hands of the multiple grocers, is expected to grow from about 22 per cent to 40 per cent of the beer market. Some consumer resistance to the increases in pub prices was evident last year. With volume sales likely to fall again this year by about 4 per cent, there will be little scope to make up the shortfall through price rises. Pubs are going to find life in a cold climate much less comfortable than it has been in the past.</p>

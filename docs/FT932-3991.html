			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Disciplinarian for accountants MR BILL MORRISON, out-going deputy senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, is set to become chairman of the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary body. Morrison will be appointed to head the Joint Disciplinary Scheme in succession to Sir Anthony Wilson, who retires at the end of September after a three-year term. The scheme is operated jointly by the two chartered accountancy institutes covering Scotland, and England and Wales, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Wilson says he is pleased to have helped restructure and streamline the scheme during his term. 'The problem from the outside is that people see delays. But these big cases are very complex and justice has to be administered fairly and open-handedly.' The scheme has the power to examine and discipline member firms and any individual members in either public practice or commercial work. It only examines matters in which there is a high level of public interest. Current cases under review are the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Barlow Clowes. It is also shortly to announce an examination of the Maxwell affair. Morrison announced he was retiring from KPMG 'amicably' in February to pursue 'an alternative career', in advance of the appointment of Mr Colin Sharman as senior partner. He was also president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1984-85, and has been visiting professor in accountancy at the University of Strathclyde since 1983.</p>

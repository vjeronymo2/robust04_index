			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PAN AM READIES 10% STAFF CUT  </P> <P> Pan American World Airways is poised to cut up to 10% of its work force, or  about 2,800 workers nationwide, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Airline officials in New York declined to comment on the report but Bill  Genoese, director of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters, which represents about 6,500 Pan Am employees, said the cuts were  triggered by soaring fuel prices.  </P> <P> "Pan Am has plans to cut up to 10% due to the fuel crisis. The cuts will be  across the board," Genoese told the Miami Herald.  </P> <P> "Right now, I have no comment other than to say we are studying work force  levels," Pan Am spokeswoman Susan Timper said.  </P> <P> Pan Am could announce the cuts as early as Wednesday, when company Chairman  Thomas Plaskett is scheduled to address analysts in New York, the Herald said.  </P></p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shani Acquisitions boosted Shani Group, the fashion supplier, to pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.44m for the year to July 31, compared with Pounds 1.96m. Turnover advanced from Pounds 12m to Pounds 20m, including Pounds 7.98m from acquisitions. During the year the USM-quoted company acquired the Lampert and Admyra women's coat and suit businesses. The year end is being changed to October 31 because of the seasonal nature of the purchases' businesses. Operating profits from continuing businesses fell to Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 1.43m) but a Pounds 1.05m contribution from the acquisitions brought the total to Pounds 2.19m. From earnings per share of 11.3p (9.2p) the total dividend is raised to 5.3p (4.4p) with a proposed final of 3.5p.</p>

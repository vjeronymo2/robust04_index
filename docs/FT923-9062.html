			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's state mining company in joint venture MINERA TIWANACU, a subsidiary of Miami-based Jordex Resources, is to sign a joint venture contract with Comibol, the Bolivian state mining corporation, to exploit Bolivar, a polymetallic mine in the department of Oruro, in the south-west of the country. The deal should be finalised in the next three or four weeks, according to Mr Alfredo Rojas, Tiwanacu's executive president. Comibol has invested Dollars 14m in the mine over the past ten years and, under the terms of the contract, Tiwanacu will invest at least a further Dollars 14m. Production is estimated by Mr Rojas at 1,000 tonnes of ore a day, of which 400 tonnes will come from Tiwanacu's existing operations 10 miles away at Poopo. The plant at Poopo is to be valued and will form part of Tiwanacu's investment in Bolivar. Of the 1,000 tonnes of ore, some 15 per cent will be zinc and 1 per cent tin, plus 350 grams per tonne of silver. The resulting concentrate will be 50 per cent zinc, with 800 grams per tonne of silver. The project should be operating in 12 months, producing about 19,000 tonnes of concentrate a year. Mr Rojas said it should have a working life of about 15 years.</p>

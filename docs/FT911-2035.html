			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A flawed referendum TO JUDGE by the way the two larger parties have campaigned, today's local elections are regarded by both the leader of the opposition and the prime minister as a referendum, or super opinion poll, on whether the time is right for Mr John Major to call a general election. There is a precedent for this. The victories scored by Conservatives in the equivalent local contests four years ago helped to convince Mrs Margaret Thatcher that June would be a good time to go to the country. The portents were right: the Conservatives won handsomely. Yet if a judgement on the Tories' prospects of winning a fourth term in government was all that was required the prime minister could make do with the far less expensive series of sample polls available on a more or less continuous basis. Local elections should be about more than that. They do provide an opportunity to the electorate to hold local authorities to account. Today more than 12,250 council seats will be contested in 296 district councils in England and 37 in Wales, as well as in the 36 all-purpose metropolitan authorities. London and Scotland are in a fallow voting year, but this remains the biggest series of elections in the four-year cycle of local contests. It is also among the most complicated: in 124 of the districts and in all the larger authorities only a third of the incumbents must offer themselves for re-election each year. Financial muddle The complications extend beyond the generally opaque structure of local administration. Finance is a worse muddle. Most potential voters will be receiving Community Charge demands about now. The law provides that these state the name of the precepting authority - that is, whether it is the district, the county, the parish, or the borough. Citizens who possess magnifying glasses and unlimited spare time, not to mention advanced mathematical skills, may then calculate which council is responsible for which portion of the poll tax. This may be set against the individual's perception of the standard of service provided for the money demanded - although that too will be difficult if the unfortunate elector has not earned a degree in the functions of local government and is therefore not precisely aware of which service is the responsibility of which body. That hurdle surmounted, the responsible local voter may then sit down to estimate how much local expenditure is in fact locally financed and therefore likely to be affected by her or his vote and how much is either a normal government grant or the special Pounds 140 'vote Conservative' bribe proffered in the Budget. Voter apathy It is therefore hardly surprising that many voters do not bother to go to the polling booth at all. If the average turnout today is 40 per cent or more of the names on the registration lists the general verdict will be that turnout has been pretty good. This is not to say that there is no element of accountability. The expectation is that the Liberal Democrats, who have no chance of becoming the next government, may score more heavily in votes cast for them than they do in the current opinion polls. That implies that some of the minority of voters who take part in local elections do draw a distinction between local authorities and the standing of the parties nationally. This is not good enough. If Britain is to have a healthy local democracy it must be accountable to those who vote for it. Both main parties now propose to abolish county councils, which would be a useful simplification, but not enough in itself. There must be a relationship between the provision of services and their financing that the average voter can understand. The poll tax was designed to achieve that; it failed. In seeking a substitute the Liberal Democrats have proposed a local income tax. Labour proposes that the local determination of business rates be restored. But its proposals are heavily qualified. The Conservatives, by restricting the future financing of local government to a single 'council tax' that can encompass at best 11 per cent of costs, seem to have abandoned the search for genuine accountability.</p>

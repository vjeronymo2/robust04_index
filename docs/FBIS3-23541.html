			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-Geneal Boris Yevgenyevich Pyankov, </F> commander of coalition peacekeeping forces, by Yuriy Kushko,  Dushanbe; date of interview not given: "Blue Helmets Also Go  With Kyrgyz Boots"]    [Text] Were it not for the presence of Coalition  Peacekeeping Forces of the CIS in Tajikistan, local groupings  might have already yielded to the temptation of taking up arms.  The fact that the latter are still observing neutrality and are  restraining themselves from active operations on a large scale  is, in the opinion of Colonel-General B. Pyankov, the commander  of Coalition Peacekeeping Forces in this hot spot, one of the  chief results of the three months' stay of troops under his  command on Tajik soil.    [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, what made formation of the  Coalition Peacekeeping Forces (KMS) necessary?    [Pyankov] To answer this question I need to first carefully  explain the situation in which Tajikistan found itself with the  disintegration of the Soviet Union. Having divided political  power, the army and the plants with ease, the former Soviet  republics were unable to divide up their joint security just as  easily. This was chiefly true of Tajikistan, where internal  conflicts transformed into civil war, and threatened assumption  of a regional nature and spread to the borders of Russia itself.  External aggression also promoted development of the conflict.    All of this required CIS countries to take adequate steps to  provide assistance to our neighbor in misfortune. A decision to  establish coalition peacekeeping forces consisting of armed  forces from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and  Uzbekistan was made in September 1993 at a meeting of the  leaders of the Commonwealth in Moscow. The Treaty on Collective  Security signed a year and a half ago in Tashkent by six CIS  states was the basis for the decision.    Ideally, United Nations "blue helmets" should have taken on  the role of peacekeepers, but today the potential of this  organization is behind its growing peacekeeping responsibilities.    [Kushko] Sending peacekeeping forces into Tajikistan  generated a number of apprehensions. The Russians wonder if  their country is going to be drawn into a new Afghan history.  Citizens of other countries wonder if Russia is continuing to  demonstrate its imperial ambitions.    [Pyankov] We have a clear position in the Tajik conflict--we  are not interfering in any political scrapes, which differs  favorably from the position of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan,  where support was rendered to one of the dueling sides.    Our main objective is to provide assistance in protecting  and  defending the borders. That's precisely where over 20 percent of  the personnel of the peacekeeping forces are.    Our other functions include analyzing the military and  political situation in the region, protecting humanitarian aid  columns, and participating in the negotiation process with the  goal of stabilizing the situation. But in no way are we  providing any military assistance to local groupings.    As far as assertions of Russia's so-called imperial  ambitions  are concerned, such a statement of the question is wrong. The  fact that I am a citizen of Russia doesn't mean my unconditional  subordination only to Russian leadership. I bear equal  responsibility before the heads of state and defense ministers  of five countries.    At the same time Russia doubtlessly has its own interests  here as well. It cannot but be troubled by the position of the  Russian-speaking population. Around 200,000 Russian-speaking  citizens still live in Tajikistan. As we know, in May of last  year one of the leaders of the opposition already attempted to  declare them to be hostages.    [Kushko] What might the effect be of giving the Coalition  Peacekeeping Forces the status of "blue helmets" of the United  Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe?    [Pyankov] It seems to me that implementing such a proposal  would encourage the participants of the Tajik conflict to begin  negotiations. Moreover it would mean international support to  our actions. In this case we have no opposition at all to  international inspections or to participation of foreign  military contingents in our actions in Tajikistan. Unfortunately  our proposal regarding this matter was not supported at a  meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    [Kushko] To what extent is reliance being placed on weapons  in the actions of the peacekeeping forces, and to what extent on  political methods?    [Pyankov] Actions of the Tajik opposition in preparing for  new combat operations are evoking countermeasures from our side.  We are reinforcing the borders, we are undergoing planned combat  training, and we are undertaking various sorts of preventive  actions. The KMS have up to 25,000 personnel, up to 2,000 tanks,  350 infantry fighting vehicles, 350 artillery guns, and aviation  and helicopters. These forces are capable to opposing any enemy.  But we are not in any way placing our reliance solely on methods  of force.    [Kushko] To what extent are countries that signed the  agreement on the KMS fulfilling their obligations?    [Pyankov] Only Tajikistan and Russia have fulfilled their  obligations completely regarding allocation of the needed  quantity of men and equipment. Russia is having to carry the  main burden--up to 50 percent of all of the expenses. Russia  placed the 201st Motorized Rifle Division at the disposal of the  KMS as its "initial membership dues."    A separate motorized-rifle battalion was allocated from  Uzbek  armed forces. Operational use of one of the subunits of the  Kyrgyz contingent is difficult because it is based on its own  territory. The Kazakh contingent still hasn't arrived. Nor have  promised resources for the maintenance of the joint command of  the KMS arrived from Kazakhstan. However, my hope is that the  leadership of Kazakhstan will fulfill adopted obligations in the  immediate future.    [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you think the situation  will develop in Tajikistan in the immediate and remote future?    [Pyankov] The situation remains complex, despite the  apparent  lull. There are three main forces capable of destabilizing it.    First, the government in exile, operating from the Afghan  city of Talukan [transliteration]. It is openly preparing armed  detachments to fight the present leadership of Tajikistan. The  Talukan exiles, who have not received recognition from a single  state or support from their own people, may undertake harsh  steps.    The second force is the democratic opposition, which is  presently working underground in Tajikistan. It has the support  of the inhabitants of a number of regions, and it has contacts  with the Tajik opposition in Moscow. If the detachments of the  former People's Front that do not have a clear political  orientation go over to its side, its importance will increase  significantly.    I consider the armed detachments in the Pamirs and the  several large detachments operating in the mountains in the  vicinity of Garm to be the third force.    All of them may become active in spring in their struggle  for  power, which can seriously worsen the situation.    A more favorable scenario for the development of events is  also fully possible. Assuming presence of goodwill and a  readiness of dialogue among all participants of the Tajik  conflict, the situation may stabilize to such an extent here by  the end of 1994 that we would be able to begin reducing the KMS  contingent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean Leclerc du Sablon: "Chinese President </F> Expected in Paris This Fall -- Beijing's Revenge"]    [Text] Beijing -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin is due to  be Francois Mitterrand's guest in France in the fall and not  after the French presidential elections, as was suggested in  Edouard Balladur's entourage during the prime minister's visit  to Beijing in April. This is what French business circles and  some Chinese sources are reporting.    The Chinese leaders are, it seems, in a hurry to see this  visit materialize because it represents for them a source of  pride since it was Paris that most energetically condemned the 4  June 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre.    Beijing diplomacy has brought down the wall of condemnation  with which the West intended to isolate the regime. Jiang Zemin  was received by Bill Clinton in Seattle in November. In July,  Prime Minister Li Peng is expected in Austria and Germany, where  Chancellor Kohl intends to use the "Chinese card" to revive the  economy through contracts signed with Beijing.    Despite the speed with which the "normalization" of  Franco-Chinese relations, undermined by the 1989 protests and  then by the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan, is taking place,  the economic effects of this improvement in relations will take  a long time.  <H5>  Longuet's Mission in July </H5>   The chapter was "closed" in January thanks to secret  negotiations carried out by UAP [Paris Insurance Union]  President Jacques Friedmann, but the Chinese apparently wanted  to speed things up for political reasons. The timetable has  scarcely allowed time for the French to negotiate economic  compensation with the Chinese.    French officials are apprehensive about the approach of the  visit by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, who  is expected to arrive in early July with almost 150 businessmen:  The harvest of contracts promises to be small. A few good  deals have been concluded by Alcatel. Dumez has just won a  share of the construction of a hydroelectric power station on  the Yellow River, worth $130 million, but it lost the  construction of the dam proper which went to an Italian company.  However, some French industrialists working in China hope that  this visit will make it possible to prepare the ground for the  medium and long term, particularly in the areas of  telecommunications and energy.    Jiang Zemin, who is 68 years old, an electrical engineer and  former trainee at the Stalin autombile works in Moscow, became  head of the Communist Party and then the Army after the crushing  of the Tienanmen Square demonstrations five years ago. He then  replaced General Yang Shangkun as head of state in 1993. He is  the official heir of Deng Xiaoping, who will be 90 in August.  However, none of the successors appointed by Deng has survived  at the top.</p>

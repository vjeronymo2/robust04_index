			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Oilmen ignore Azerbaijan risks: Foreign oil companies are taking political turmoil in their stride EIGHT foreign oil companies yesterday took Azerbaijan's political crisis in their stride and advanced Dollars 70m (Pounds 46.6m) in good faith money to keep negotiating for the right to develop the Caspian Sea republic's oil fields. The advance adds to the tens of millions of dollars which the companies, including British Petroleum, Amoco and Pennzoil, have already paid out to the Azeri government in cash and in kind for the right to negotiate to exploit the country's estimated recoverable offshore oil reserves of at least 4bn barrels. Pennzoil, for instance, has already given the Azeri government the equivalent of about Dollars 90m in natural gas production equipment and pipeline. Senior oil company executives began meeting Azeri officials in London this week for what they hope will be the advanced stages of talks on exploitation rights which have dragged out for more than a year. By proceeding with the talks and paying out the collective ante, the companies - after long reflection - have implicitly decided that the economic risks of staying in Azerbaijan were outweighed by the potential billions to be earned in oil fields already proven to be substantial and easy to exploit. 'Seventy million dollars is a lot to you and me, but it's not that much to the companies,' said one executive. 'The real money is the billions it will take to actually develop the fields.' Another oil company executive said: 'The potential here is so high. There's never been a hole sunk here that didn't hit oil.' Azerbaijan's latest bout of political instability began on June 4 when a rebel military warlord, Mr Surat Husseinov, seized the country's second-largest city, Gyanja, and demanded President Abulfaz Elchebey's resignation. The president has since fled the capital and taken political refuge in his home village and some of Mr Husseinov's men have entered the capital, Baku, while others have dug in outside the city. Mr Husseinov has declared that he is ready to step into Azerbaijan's political vacuum to run the country. This power vacuum leaves the oil companies with no-one with enough authority to sign a deal. As the eventual contracts must be ratified by parliament, the political chaos also makes it unclear whether or when there will be an effective legislative body to endorse the deals. The companies have not taken the situation lightly. Pennzoil, for example, has sent 85 of its 88 expatriate employees out of the republic, and many of the other companies have followed suit. But the overall belief seems to be that, in the long term, the Azeri republic will stabilise and that, with hard currency infusions from foreign investors such as themselves, economic prosperity will calm the situation further. Yesterday's payment represents one-third of Dollars 210m that the companies must eventually pay up as a signing bonus to the cash-poor former Soviet republic. The money is the companies' financial contribution to a new Azeri oil development plan that was announced in the capital last month. Originally Amoco, Pennzoil and BP were negotiating to develop three of Azerbaijan's oil fields individually, with respective partners Ramco Energy, McDermott International, Statoil and Union Oil of California. Now, however, all the oil companies have decided to negotiate as a group to develop the three fields. Although the details of a work plan have not been finalised, each company has been awarded a percentage of the 'unitised' group, which will comprise its portion of development costs and its eventual profit. BP-Statoil has the largest share (36 per cent) and had to pay out Dollars 25m yesterday. Amoco, which contributed Dollars 17m, has the next highest investment which totals 24.3 per cent. Pennzoil has 14 per cent and paid Dollars 9.8m and Unico paid Dollars 11.2m for its 16 per cent share. Besides their own individual projects, the companies have an additional large expense to consider - a pipeline they must build to carry some 800,000 barrels of oil a day to the west. The companies have considered several pipeline routes, but appear to have all but decided on one passing through Turkey with a terminal on the Mediterranean, according to executives at two of the companies. The Dollars 1.4bn pipeline would go through Azerbaijan and split into two at the border with Iran. One loop would then go through northern Iran and another through Armenia before joining again in the ex-Soviet Nakhichdvan region and finally entering Turkey. 'That way neither Iran nor Armenia can hold us hostage,' an oil company official said. At Erzurum, the pipeline would lead into an existing Iraqi pipeline that was closed because of the 1990 Kuwaiti invasion.</p>

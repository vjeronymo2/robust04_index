			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Bombers injure Egyptian minister GENERAL Hassan al-Alfi, Egypt's minister of the interior, was seriously injured and four people killed yesterday in a bomb attack on his car in central Cairo. It was the latest in a wave of terrorist attacks on senior officials and tourist facilities during the past 18 months and was presumed to be the work of Islamic extremists. The blast came as the minister's car was within 500 metres of the Interior Ministry. Initially it was reported that gunmen had also opened fire on the motorcade, but this was later denied when it became known that the bomb had been packed with ball bearings. The area of the attack, close to the US embassy and Tahrir Square, was quickly sealed off by riot police and armoured personnel carriers. A woman who witnessed the blast said the minister was taken to hospital in a van which happened to be passing the scene. Gen Alfi, who took office only four months ago, has vowed to pursue a tough line against the terrorists. His predecessor, Mr Abdul Halim Moussa, was removed from the post for reportedly having sought to open a dialogue with militant Islamic groups. The determination of President Hosni Mubarak's government to respond harshly to the extremist threat has been brought home over the past two months by the execution of 15 convicted terrorists. Mr Mubarak has accused Iran of being behind the efforts to destabilise his regime. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, the minister of information, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in April, and earlier this week gunmen opened fire on a Nile cruise ship carrying British tourists.</p>

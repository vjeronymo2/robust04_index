			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Turkey offers Usas stake for sale THE Turkish government is to sell by local public offering its 30 per cent stake in Usas, the national airline caterer which is majority owned by Scandinavian Airline System. The deal is expected to raise TL192bn (Dollars 16m.) The government is selling 6m shares at TL32,000 a share, valuing the company at Dollars 200m. The government is to retain a golden share and the rights to 21 per cent of the net profits. Turkey has so far raised around TL5,000bn in 1993, against an initial target of TL15,000bn, which many analysts now believe is unrealistic. The Usas offer, which will be fully underwritten, will be co-led by Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest commercial bank, and Global Securities, a local broker. The offering is being made for three days from October 20. Dealing is expected to start on the Istanbul stock exchange by the end of the month. However, brokers believe that the offering represents a significant discount to the market. The deal puts the company on a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.5 on projected 1993 earnings. Usas reported pre-tax profits of TL205bn for 1992. The company reported real sales growth in 1992 of 138 per cent, against an average inflation rate of 60 per cent. SAS paid Dollars 14m for a 70 per cent stake in Usas in 1989, in what was one of the first state sales handled by the Public Participation Administration, the government privatisation agency.</p>

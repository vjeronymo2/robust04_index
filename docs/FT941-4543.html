			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Moving ahead in Warsaw - The market is growing up Poland's stock market is showing signs of maturity as local investors become more discerning. Until now, the rush was on to buy stocks irrespective of company results or price/earnings ratios, as many new investors entered the market. The apocryphal story of the elderly lady buying shares in a loss-making company, only because they 'did not cost much', is often repeated, and companies that have split their shares have seen additional turnover and price gains. But this week the trend appears to have changed as the Zywiec brewery stock rose by 32 per cent in value on the news that Heineken, the Dutch brewer, had decided on a Dollars 40m investment. Turnover also rose to twice the usual value and investor interest spilled over to Okocim, the exchange's other listed brewery. Last month Brau und Brunnen, the leading German brewer, astounded the industry when it took 25 per cent of Okocim's stock. That news brought little movement in the shares. Okocim's 1993 results had been poorer than those of Zywiec and it was only after Heineken made its announcement that the Okocim price also moved up, by 21 per cent in two sessions. One sobering moment this week was the stock market entry of Rafako, a boiler maker in southern Poland, whose initial price of 1.5m zlotys exceeded the public offer price by 25 per cent, and then only after the offer price was raised at the last moment from 700,000 zlotys a share to 1.2m zlotys. This is modest compared with results recently achieved by stocks such as the notorious Bank Slaski which, in spite of a steady decline since January, is still trading at 10 times its public offer price. The response of Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the new minister in charge of privatisation, has been an announcement that the disposals of the state-owned Jelfa pharmaceuticals plant and Polifarb Wroclaw, a paint producer, will be through the exchange, with shares going to investors offering the highest price. Meanwhile, continuing delays in the opening of investment accounts, without which shares cannot be bought and sold, mean that the flow of new money into the exchange is being slowed, thus depressing overall turnover and helping to calm the market.</p>

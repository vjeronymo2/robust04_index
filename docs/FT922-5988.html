			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Outlook for UK jobless bleak for two years THE OUTLOOK for Britain's unemployed looks bleak over the next two years because growth will be too weak to stop the number of people out of work climbing towards 3m. Moreover, the latest Financial Times survey of forecasts of the UK economy suggests inflation will stay stubbornly above the chancellor of the exchequer's goal of 2 per cent in spite of below-trend growth and a rising jobless total. The FT has polled 22 groups of economists at universities, independent think-tanks and City investment houses. The survey suggests the Treasury's March prediction of a 1 per cent rise in gross domestic product this year and 3 per cent in the first half of 1993 is slightly too optimistic. Instead the average forecast for output growth is about 0.8 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1993 with unemployment likely to reach 2.9m by the end of 1993. Looking further ahead, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research yesterday cast doubt on the Treasury's medium-term projections that GDP will grow by 3.5 per cent a year over the fiscal years 1994-95 to 1996-97. In a separate report, it projected no significant drop in UK unemployment below 2.7m before the end of the decade. The National Institute lays much of the blame for future slow growth on 'excessive' real interest rates in Europe. Details, Page 10</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / BT to protest at Alcatel's purchase of undersea cables BRITISH Telecommunications intends to lodge strong objections to Northern Telecom's sale of STC Submarine Systems to Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment supplier. BT believes the sale of STC Submarine Systems will reduce competition in the undersea cable market. BT is also concerned that the disposal could make it unduly reliant on AT&amp;T, the largest North American operator and equipment supplier. As an international operator, AT&amp;T is in increasingly fierce competition with BT. AT&amp;T's manufacturing arm is one of only four leading suppliers of long-distance undersea cables: if the sale goes ahead, it will be one of only three. As yet, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry has only consulted BT informally. It is awaiting a decision from the European Commission's competition directorate on whether the Pounds 600m sale falls within EC or UK merger rules. Either way, BT will oppose the deal on competition grounds. Mr Brian Rigby, BT's procurement director, said: 'Because of the developmental work necessary, buying cables means revealing more about forward intentions than we would like to give competitors.' STC estimates that it secured 23 per cent of the Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds 6.8bn) long-distance undersea cable market between 1985 and the end of last year. With an estimated 37 per cent, AT&amp;T was the market leader. Alcatel is believed to have taken 19 per cent, and NEC and Fujitsu of Japan 18 per cent between them. BT is concerned about the impact on prices if AT&amp;T and Alcatel dominate the market. The company always seeks competitive bids for undersea cable contracts, and faces growing price competition for its international traffic.</p>

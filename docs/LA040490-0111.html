			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A TASTY MIX OF SIN, SALVATION IN 'MOMMA DON'T'  </P> <P> It's difficult to ignore a show where Jesus Christ is billed as executive  producer, especially when the credit is not a put-on. And the black touring  gospel musical "Momma Don't" (as in "Momma, find the Lord, and lay off the  crack cocaine") is not a show you can dismiss.  </P> <P> Sophisticates may blink, but a packed house at the opening Sunday at the  Wilshire Ebell found the cornucopia of hookers, drugs, pimps, a church choir,  murder and resurrection irresistible.  </P> <P> The best way to write about a production like this is as a news report. Who  cares if the musical is overbaked, overripe, over-the-top, overlong? This show  is connecting. The only white person in the house was a reviewer, and he got  impatient with the message about the savior curing addiction, but he had a good  time too.  </P> <P> That's because writer-director-producer Michael Matthews doesn't take things  too seriously. He's not one to pass up a laugh, and there are plenty in the  show, especially in the outrageous costumes of the ladies of the night.  </P> <P> Matthews has been booking this show into big houses back East since last May,  and he has enjoyed success with a highly promotable idea: in each city, the  show features a romping, stomping local church choir. Here, it's the Greater  Bethany Mass Choir.  </P> <P> Nobody ever underestimated the box-office clout of sin and salvation, and this  show's strategy draws heavily from black church groups. The production's strong  suit is the pit orchestra, under Kenny Jackson's raucous musical direction, and  the vocalizing -- featuring, among others, the gospel trio the Clark Sisters.  Comedically, the nominal stars are Akosua Busia and Ernest Harden Jr.. Busia,  spilling out of her lipstick red fringe dress, is riotous.  </P> <P> When pistols go off, the whiff of the powder wafts over the house. There's even  a coffin with the body of a prostitute stretched out in it. As the reverend  says, "She was an upstanding member of the community. She was always standing  around a lot."  </P> <P>  At 4401 W. 8th St., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sunday, 3  p.m., through April 14. $18.50-$25.50. (213) 939-1128.  </P></p>

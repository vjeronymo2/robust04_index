			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: TWO COMPUTERS THAT SHINE IN DIFFERENT JOBS  </P> <P> Recently I had the opportunity to use two portable computers from opposite ends  of the price and power scale. Each serves a very different purpose, and each  does so delightfully well.  </P> <P> One, the Goupil Golf 386 SX, is a fast, sleek and innovative French-built  beauty aimed at users who want a single computer that has all the power and  features of a desktop machine yet is easy to take on the road.  </P> <P> The other, Tandy's 1100FD, is designed to be a low-priced second computer  mainly for use away from the office. It is light, runs about four hours on a  battery charge and comes loaded with plenty of software. It is a recent  introduction to fill the low end of Tandy's MS-DOS-compatible line of  portables.  </P> <P> The 1100FD, selling for $999 at any Radio Shack store, is a 6.4-pound machine  with a single floppy drive, a reflective screen that achieves good contrast  with blue characters against a greenish-yellow background and 640 kilobytes of  operating memory.  </P> <P> Goupil's Golf 386 SX, imported by Computer Peripherals of Newbury Park, is a  fully equipped 386-class computer with 1 megabyte of operating memory, a  high-resolution black and white screen, detached keyboard, internal expansion  slots and either 40 or 100 megabytes of hard disk storage.  </P> <P> It weighs 16.4 pounds and has a suggested retail price of $6,495 for the  40-megabyte model or $7,140 for the 100-megabyte unit. Substantial discounts  should reduce the street price of the Goupil Golf, while Tandy models are  seldom discounted.  </P> <P> With 100 megabytes of storage, a 16-megahertz Intel 80386 SX microprocessor for  operating power and up to 9 megabytes of on-board memory, the Golf is able to  handle any software application likely to be required of a desktop machine.  Whether the operating system is MS-DOS, which is shipped with the computer, or  OS/2 or even UNIX, the power to handle it is there.  </P> <P> Provision inside the low, satin-black case for two standard three-quarters-size  PC/XT-type expansion cards makes it easy to install both a modem and a network  card inside the machine. The inside of this machine is impressive. The case is  hinged, and just five screws hold everything in place.  </P> <P> The flat, "cold cathode backlit super-twist LCD" screen with eight shades of  gray graphics folds snugly against the top of the system unit when not in use,  or hinges upright. A panel of six buttons below the screen also allows you to  quickly adjust its appearance, so you can reverse black for white, control the  gray scales and set brightness and contrast.  </P> <P> The screen is the same size and aspect ratio as a standard computer monitor, so  there is no loss of definition or any deformation of the image. At the office,  it would be very simple to substitute a color monitor by simply leaving the  monochrome unit folded down and attaching the color monitor's cable to a  connector on the back of the computer.  </P> <P> The Golf's keyboard is unusual among portables because it is separate from the  computer unit. Its 101 keys are fully compatible with those of a standard PC  keyboard, but the layout is a little different because the keyboard is not as  wide. It does retain the separate cursor, editing keys and numerical keypad of  the standard unit. A 7-foot coiled cord attaches it to the back of the  computer.  </P> <P> Also on the computer are connectors for parallel and serial printers or other  devices, a mouse and an external 5 1/4-inch disk drive. A high-density,  1.44-megabyte 3 1/2-inch floppy drive is built in.  </P> <P> Rather than try to package the computer, screen and keyboard so that it folds  up into one unit for transport, Computer Peripherals' Goupil Golf relies on a  well-engineered carrying case to haul the separate computer and keyboard units.  The entire package has won design awards in Europe.  </P> <P> Reflecting its continental heritage, the Golf is a globe-trotting machine with  built-in ability to sense the electrical strength of the power source it is  connected to and adjust itself accordingly. There's no need to set switches. Of  course, with a computer of this magnitude, battery power is not practical, so  you'll have to wait until you get to an office or hotel room to use it while  you are on the road.  </P> <P> The Tandy 1100FD, on the other hand, is very practical to use with battery  power. It's just about ideal for working on your lap in a crowded conference  room or on the tray of an airline seat without disturbing your neighbors.  </P> <P> I got a little more than four hours out of its fully charged, sealed lead-acid  battery.  </P> <P> The Tandy keyboard is built in and the 4.75-by-7.69-inch screen folds flat to  cover the keys when not in use. The display technology is called "super-twisted  nematic LCD." There are 84 keys, and it is possible to use them in combination  to mimic all of the keys available on standard IBM and compatible keyboards.  But it isn't as convenient.  </P> <P> One thing that sets the Tandy apart from many other low-priced portables is the  built-in software, called DeskMate. It's really all you need on the road.  Included are the mainstay business applications: word processing, database,  spreadsheet and telecommunications. There also is a drawing program, a game  called "Hangman" and software to connect with an optional on-line electronic  information and entertainment service known as "PC-Link."  </P> <P> There is a collection of "desk accessories," too, including a calculator, a  spelling checker, a phone list, a place to store notes called "corkboard," a  calendar and scheduler with alarms and a to-do list.  </P> <P> Tandy keeps the 1100FD light in weight by equipping it with only a single 3  1/2-inch, 720-kilobyte floppy disk. A portion of the DeskMate software, along  with the basic functions of the MS-DOS operating system, are built into the  computer in what is known as "read-only memory," or ROM, where it can be used  but never altered or erased.  </P> <P> One of the DeskMate functions that is embedded in ROM is the word processing  software. Thus you can use the entire disk in the floppy drive for text  storage.  </P> <P> If Tandy had not built DeskMate and MS-DOS into the computer, it wouldn't be  very useful with just one floppy drive because most of the disk would be used  to store the operating system and program software, leaving little room for  data.  </P> <P> THE SPECS  </P> <P> Goupil Golf 386 SX  </P> <P> A $6,495 to $7,140 high-powered computer that doubles as a desktop machine and  a portable.  </P> <P> Features: Sleek design, three inches thick with fold-up screen, 16-megahertz  386 processor, hard disk of either 40 or 100 megabytes, 1.44-megabyte 3  1/2-inch floppy, two PC/XT compatible expansion slots, separate keyboard; can  attach a color monitor. No battery power.  </P> <P> Importer: Computer Peripherals, 667 Rancho Conejo Blvd., Newbury Park, Calif.  91320. Phone: (800) 854-7600.  </P> <P> Tandy 1100FD  </P> <P> A $999 lightweight portable with long battery life.  </P> <P> Features: Built-in DeskMate software for most business needs, 8-megahertz V20  processor, 720-kilobyte 3 1/2-inch floppy, connectors for printers, external  monitor, optional 2,400-baud internal modem available. Runs more than four  hours on fully charged battery.  </P> <P> Manufacturer: Tandy Corp., 700 One Tandy Center, Ft. Worth, Tex. 76102.  Available at Radio Shack dealers nationwide.  </P></p>

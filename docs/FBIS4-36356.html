			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, has stressed that our country welcomes UN Security  Council Resolution No. 924 and all its article. He said our  country has expressed readiness to cooperate with international  efforts to resolve the crisis in our country. Those remarks  were made during a news conference held by the brother president  at noon today. The news conference was attended by  correspondents of Arab and international news agencies and print  and electronic news media. The brother president explained said  that no dialogue is possible with the secessionist elements in  the command of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP], but with YSP  unionist elements. He explained that some unionist elements are  helpless and controlled by the secessionist elements. As soon  as the crisis is over, he explained, those unionist elements  will come out and make their stands public.    The brother president also noted that the entry of the  legitimate forces into Aden will be a political decision. He  said this is in order to avoid further material and human  losses, preserve human lives in Aden, and for humanitarian  reasons.    The brother president noted that the future of the genuine  Yemeni state will be prosperous and developed, based on the  state's institutions, represented by the legislative authority,  and on modern and developed laws regulating the activities of  the new state, such as the local government law, which gives  wide authorities to governorates, thus easing centralization.  At the same time, he stressed that promises for applying local  government jurisdiction will be honored. This is unlike the  behavior of some YSP leaders, who falsely raised the slogan of  giving power to local governments and demanded that strict  centralization be eased and authorities be granted to local  government.    The brother president stressed that the local government law  will be applied after order is restored and constitutional  amendments are held.    The brother president explained that the YSP secessionist  elements are demanding and appealing for a cease-fire at a time  when their warplanes are launching raids on the forces of unity  and constitutional legitimacy on the entrances of Aden. Their  appeals, he said, are only meant to draw the sympathy of foreign  public opinion and to portray themselves as being wronged.    The brother president indicated that in light of the new  world order, our country has welcomed UN Security Council  Resolution No. 924. This is despite the fact that this  resolution is considered interference in domestic affairs [words  indistinct] cease-fire resolution unless [words indistinct] the  legitimate forces.</p>

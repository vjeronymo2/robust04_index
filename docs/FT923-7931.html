			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Share issue by Zenith Electronics ZENITH Electronics, the troubled US television maker, has unveiled a new financing plan that may help steady the company following sev-eral years of debilitating losses. Zenith has been hit by losses in consumer electronics and investments in new technologies, such as high definition television. The financing plan includes a public offering of 8m shares of common stock, which will raise approximately Dollars 55m at the current share price, and a new three-year Dollars 60m working capital loan from the Bank of New York. The new credit facility will replace its existing agreement, which expires at the end of the year. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zenith said of the 8m shares to be sold, 1.2m would be offered outside the US. The company has 29.3m shares outstanding. It also said the underwriters will have the option to issue up to 1.2m more shares on the same terms to cover over-allotments. Salomon Brothers and The First Boston Corporation were named as managers of the underwriting group. The proceeds from the stock sale may be used to redeem some or all of the company's outstanding notes, and repay other debt for its working capital facility as well as research and development expenses. Although Zenith privately sold about 5 per cent of its shares to South Korea's Lucky Gold Star group last year, it has not sold shares to the public since July 1987.</p>

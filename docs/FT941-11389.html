			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions view challenged Sir, Commenting on Marks and Spencer's move into personal pensions, Lex writes (February 2): 'The mass market may be better served by a standardised M&amp;S financial product than the inappropriate personal pensions many have thus far been sold.' Why? Is he implying that M&amp;S's in-house pension quality will be as good as its knitwear? The M&amp;S unit trust performance figures hardly support that idea. Or is he implying that the strictly salaried salesforce will not use any of the usual selling techniques? Does he seriously believe that the salesforce will be free from all pressures of individual sales targets imposed by management? Your writers above all should know that independent financial advisers alone can provide informed and impartial advice across the whole of the pensions spectrum. Moreover, we are required by law to assess the whole of the marketplace when advising each individual. M&amp;S salesmen will, of course, be free from any such commercially onerous duty. What makes Lex think that M&amp;S financial products sold by its staff are, or will be, any whit less 'inappropriate' than those sold by any other tied salesforce?

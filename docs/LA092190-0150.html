			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC WINS BIDDING FOR MERCURY;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THE SALE OF THE INSOLVENT  S&amp;L'S 24 BRANCHES AND $2 BILLION IN ASSETS TODAY.  </P> <P> Federal regulators are expected to announce today the government sale of  insolvent Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to Los Angeles-based Security  Pacific Corp., which outbid several other institutions for the Orange County  thrift.  </P> <P> Industry sources said Thursday that the holding company for Security Pacific  National Bank earlier this week won the bidding to acquire Huntington  Beach-based Mercury's 24 branches and most of its $2 billion in assets.  </P> <P> The branches are expected to be reopened Monday as offices of Security Pacific.  Deposits will continue to be insured by the federal government up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Mercury, headquartered in Huntington Beach, was declared insolvent and seized  by federal regulators in February. It has been operated since then under  auspices of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with selling  or liquidating government-run S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> If the sale is completed today, it would mark one of the quickest sales ever of  a thrift under RTC supervision. The agency is overseeing several hundred  S&amp;Ls nationally, including 18 that have been offered for sale in California  since June.  </P> <P> Edward Carpenter, a banking consultant with Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa  Ana, said that several of his firm's clients were active bidders for Mercury  and valued the thrift for what is widely considered one of the industry's  better branch networks and customer bases.  </P> <P> Other bidders reportedly included Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly  Hills, American Savings Bank of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal  Savings Bank of California.  </P> <P> Officials at Security Pacific confirmed Thursday that the company, with nearly  $95 billion in assets, had submitted a bid for Mercury. They declined further  comment.  </P> <P> Security Pacific has been shopping for troubled thrifts this year. In June, the  company acquired 83 branches of Gibraltar S&amp;L.  </P> <P> At RTC regional headquarters in Denver, spokesman Kevin Shields would not  identify the winning bidder but confirmed that Mercury would be sold this  month.  </P> <P> In a typical government sale of an insolvent thrift, the government keeps the  S&amp;L's bad loans, repossessed real estate and other "bad" assets while the  acquiring institution gets the offices, equipment, deposits, and the "good"  loans, real estate and other investments.  </P> <P> Mercury, founded in 1964, had grown to nearly $5 billion in assets by the  mid-1980s and was considered a fairly conservative S&amp;L that eschewed some  of the more unusual investments possible under California's liberal thrift  investment laws at the time and stuck with single-family mortgage lending.  </P> <P> Mercury began reducing its assets in the late 1980s to help it meet tightening  government controls on capital. By the time it was seized in February, the  S&amp;L had $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits.  </P> <P> The losses that led to its insolvency didn't come from the insider dealing and  speculative investing that caused the ruin of many of the nation's S&amp;Ls.  Mercury was hurt by new federal accounting rules that required it to reduce the  value of a number of investments on its books and set aside capital-depleting  reserves to cover the difference.  </P></p>

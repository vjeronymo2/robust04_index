			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : SALSA CONCERT AT FORD THEATRE IS CALLED OFF; JAZZ SCORE TO BACK  'FELIX THE GREAT' RADIO STORY  </P> <P> The third annual L.A. Salsa Fest, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at the John  Anson Ford Theatre, has been canceled. According to Linda Mandel, one of the  event's promoters, poor advance ticket sales prompted the Ford managers -- the  Hasset family -- to withdraw the show.  </P> <P> Mandel thought the amount of salsa featured at several Cinco de Mayo events  over the May 5-7 weekend may have slowed ticket sales. "A lot of our audience  went to these events," Mandel said, "and hadn't gotten around to thinking about  ours. I was looking for a lot of last-week purchases and walk-ups, but I guess  the Ford Theatre (management) didn't want to take that chance."  </P> <P> Mandel discounted the outbreaks of violence at two recent events that  spotlighted salsa -- the appearance of El Gran Combo from Puerto Rico at the  Hollywood Palladium in mid-April and a Cinco de Mayo celebration at Lincoln  Park in East Los Angeles on May 7 -- as a reason the Salsa Fest had only modest  ticket sales. "I think most people are still going to come in droves (for salsa  shows)," she said, "even though I myself might stay away. I see these  (outbreaks of violence) not as a trend -- at least I hope they're not -- but  rather (spontaneous occurrences) that just happened in close proximity to each  other."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Ford management officials were not successful. Ticket holders  can obtain refunds at point of purchase.  </P> <P> FINALISTS ANNOUNCED: The five finalists in the fifth annual Hennessy Cognac  Jazz Search, who will engage in a playoff tonight at the Palace nightclub in  Hollywood, have been announced.  </P> <P> The groups -- who were selected in competitions held in Detroit, New Orleans,  New York and Los Angeles earlier this year -- include Quintessence (West  Columbia, S.C.), the Steve Wood Quintet (Detroit), Synthetic Earth (Toronto),  the Mel Brown Sextet (Portland) and the John Basile/Brad Terry Duo (New York).  More than 600 groups from the United States, Canada, Japan and Brazil entered  the competition by sending in audio tapes of their work. Semifinalists for the  live performances were then selected by panels of professional musicians.  </P> <P> The winner of tonight's battle of the bands -- which is open to the public on a  limited-seating, first-come, first-served basis -- receives a cash award and a  spot on the line-up of the Playboy Jazz Festival's June 18 show at the  Hollywood Bowl. Past winners include the Timothy Horner group, the a cappella  vocal ensemble Terra Nova and saxophonist Scott Kreitzer. Following his win  last year, Kreitzer, an impressive tenor saxophonist, made his recording debut  with "Kick n' Off" for locally based Cexton Records.  </P> <P> "Tonight Show" bandleader Doc Severinsen, keyboardist George Duke, record exec  Harold Childs and composer Allyn Ferguson will judge this evening's  contestants. KKGO's Chuck Niles will be the emcee.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 201-8888.  </P> <P> YOUTHFUL HONOREES: Two musicians and an instrumental group from Hamilton High  School in Los Angeles have received awards in the 12th annual down beat  magazine Student Music Awards. Pianist Vernal Brown, Jr. was chosen as best  Blues/Pop/Rock instrumentalist in the high school division, and the school's  combo was selected as the best Blues/Pop/Rock instrumental group. In addition  to a plaque, Brown earned a partial scholarship to Berklee School of Music in  Boston for his taped performance, which was judged on such qualities as overall  sound, presence or authority, technique, improvisation and phrasing by a panel  that included local composer/bandleader Les Hooper, producer/composer Teo  Macero and singer/musician Don Shelton (of the Hi-Lo's), among others.  </P> <P> Additionally, Hamilton's Julian Coryell, a guitarist, received an outstanding  performance citation in the Jazz Instrumental Soloist division.  </P> <P> JAZZ SOUND TRACK: Vermont-based writer-journalist Robert Shure has come up with  an interesting twist for his 26-part radio story, "Felix the Great," heard  locally on KLON-FM (88.1 FM), Monday-Friday, 11:45 p.m., through June 5. He's  backed his story, about "a guy who wants to be a great illusionist," with a  jazz score by Finnish composer-keyboardist Heikki Sarmanto's quintet. "The  story fits the various moods of jazz," said Shure, "so the music is not really  background music. The idea is that the story is to be told by both the music  and the words, so the music's a major part of it."  </P> <P> Shure met Sarmanto while doing some free-lance journalism in Finland a few  years ago, and collaborated with him on "Man With a Sax," a Shure story backed  by Sarmanto's music that was released on Cadence records in 1986. "So that  prompted us to do something like this, a story I wanted heard rather than read,  but much longer than 'Man with a Sax.' " Ultimately, six hours of music were  recorded for "Felix."  </P> <P> Each episode of the drama, which is heard nationally on such NPR stations as  WBUR-FM in Boston and WYET-FM in Pittsburgh, begins with an introduction that  brings the listener up to date, said Shure. But, he noted, KLON is the only  station airing the program nightly; other stations schedule it weekly.  </P> <P> **** 1/2 McCoy Tyner's "Revelations" (Blue Note), the pianist's first solo  album in a decade, documents his compelling orchestral approach in all its  splendor. Included are winsome versions of Coltrane's "Lazybird," the standard  "Don't Blame Me" and Tyner's "You Taught My Heart to Sing."  </P> <P> Recordings are graded on a five-star system. Five stars (*****) means all but  indispensable for your jazz library; one star (*) means forget it.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters expressed support for the existing definition of ``reasonable cost.'' However, other commenters thought that the definition should be revised so that the reasonableness of assessment costs is determined by comparing the cost of each component of the assessment to the anticipated damages to be determined by that component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``reasonable cost'' contained in &sect;11.14(ee) was upheld in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after thorough review. Revision of the definition is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters suggested that the Department add a list of specific practices that would render assessment costs unreasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 11.15(a)(3) of the rule specifies different types of expenses that constitute reasonable costs of an assessment. The only revision to &sect;11.15(a)(3) that is being made in this rulemaking is a substitution of the phrase ``restoration'' with the phrase ``restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.'' Additional changes to &sect;11.15(a)(3) are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that trustee officials might sacrifice scientific accuracy in order to meet the standards of reasonable cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department believes that the rule adequately ensures scientific accuracy. Also, as discussed above, the definition of ``reasonable cost'' contained in &sect;11.14(ee) was upheld in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after thorough review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters stated that reasonable assessment costs should include attorneys' fees. A few commenters thought that if attorneys' fees were included as recoverable assessment costs, then the Department should clarify that trustee officials may recover only those attorneys' fees necessary for the assessment not those related to preparation and litigation of a natural resource damage claim. One commenter expressed confusion about what the Department meant when it stated in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice that trustee officials may recover only those costs that are associated with the actual assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted in the August 1, 1986, and the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices, the Department believes that trustee officials will generally need the assistance of an interdisciplinary team of experts when performing natural resource damage assessments. The rule does not restrict recoverable assessment costs to the expenses of particular types of professionals. Section 11.60(d)(2), which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that recoverable assessment costs are ``limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable to, site specific efforts taken in the assessment of damages.'' Therefore, if attorneys are involved in work specifically allocable to an assessment, the resulting attorneys' fees are recoverable as assessment costs under the rule. The rule does not address the recovery of attorneys' fees incurred in litigation over the results of the damage assessment, as opposed to those incurred during the assessment itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Calculation of Baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were a variety of comments about the calculation of baseline. A number of commenters supported the Department's proposal to revise &sect;11.82(b)(1)(i) to clarify that baseline represents the conditions that would have existed had the release or discharge not occurred rather than the conditions that existed prior to the discharge or release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, the definition of baseline, which was not affected by this rulemaking, is set forth at &sect;11.14(e): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Baseline means the condition or conditions that would have existed at the assessment area had the discharge of oil or the release of the hazardous substance under investigation not occurred. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.82(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule inadvertently described restoration and rehabilitation actions as actions taken to return a resource to baseline as measured by ``the services previously provided.'' Section 11.82(b)(1)(i) of the final rule has been revised to conform with the definition in &sect;11.14(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

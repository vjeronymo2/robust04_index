			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: WINGING IT  </P> <P> The movie: "Harlem Nights"  </P> <P> The look: Gangster polish, circa 1938. Without relying on costume cliches,  tough guys Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx et al. move in a decadent  world without appearing boorish.  </P> <P> The costume designer: Joe I. Tompkins, two-time Emmy award winner for "Eleanor  and Franklin" and "Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years." Other credits  include "Swing Shift," "Betrayed," "Nuts," "The River," "Missing" and "True  Confessions."  </P> <P> The conflict: How to reinvent the gangster genre without regurgitating tired  old fashion idioms. As Tomkins puts it, the characters "don't have to run  around in black shirts and white ties" to identify their place and profession.  </P> <P> The plan: Murphy, the film's executive producer, writer, director and star,  told Tompkins he wanted the costumes to be not exactly understated, but "crisp  and smart, glamorous and good to look at," says the designer. Consequently, the  male characters, the real stars of this movie, rustle around in lush silk  smoking jackets; broad-shouldered, slim-hipped suits and tuxedos; brocade  tuxedo vests; perfectly cut cotton shirts, and handsome wide silk, faille and  satin ties. But we're not talking Fred Astaire time. This isn't understated  elegance; not with Eddie Murphy strutting in a snow white topcoat, white  fedora, cream dinner jacket and diamond studs. The women characters, including  Della Reese, Berlinda Tolbert and Jasmine Guy, are secondary. And their gowns  are imaginative, especially the maribou-trimmed numbers, but not nearly as  appealing as the menswear.  </P> <P> The program: Tompkins had all the principals' clothes custom made, including  suits, shirts, bow ties -- and it shows. Details are first rate. To wit,  underneath it all, Tompkins put the male stars in silk lisle or cotton lisle  socks, considered top of the line in the late '30s. He found them at Brooks  Brothers. Men's jewelry, including collar pins, tie bars, studs and watch fobs,  was found in local antique jewelry stores -- Repeat Performance in Los Angeles  and Marion's Chest of Jewels in Hollywood in particular. Many of the '30s ties  came from Tompkins' personal collection. For men's shoes, Tompkins maintains  that Ralph Lauren makes the best wing tips around.  </P> <P> The payoff: With New Year's Eve approaching, men in the audience can learn a  few basics about formal wear at this movie. So much of the '30s look,  especially the wing-collar shirts, are back in style today. Tompkins had all  his shirts custom-made, but he says that after the film wrapped he discovered,  too late, the "drop dead" wing-collar shirts made by Hugo Boss. And clip-on  ties were verboten. One of the film's dressers was strictly responsible for  hand-tying bow ties. According to Tompkins, the only cast member who could tie  his own was Redd Foxx. BETTY GOODWIN  </P></p>

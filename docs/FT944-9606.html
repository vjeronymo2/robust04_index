			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: The worst of all worlds Sir, In his article 'Painful rebirth from the ashes' (November 11), Anthony Robinson makes some valuable points about how much has been achieved by former communist countries in the transition from central planning to market economy, and how this is already giving pay-offs. It is useful to have such a 'half-full glass' perspective on the still difficult process of change in these countries. However, I would take issue with Robinson's too-simple analogy between the capital amassed there in recent years through 'often clandestine expropriation and export of raw materials, energy and other resources' and the US and European robber baron equivalents in the 19th century. The 19th century monopolists did not, on the whole, make their fortunes with the help of a highly interventionist government. US and European economies, while not paragons of free markets, were generally open, competitive economies, with free price-setting, very low government budgets (generally balanced) and a prudent money-creation environment. The transition economy robber barons base their profits on privileged access to low-priced materials, substantial and cheap credits, trade licenses (hence monopoly rights), and so on. The big difference therefore is that today's robber barons have become strong proponents of retaining the administered and distorted system that is neither central planning nor an open competitive market. For them, this is the best of both worlds, and they have plenty of influence to try to keep things that way. For the population at large, this partial step to the market is the worst of both worlds. It will not automatically happen that the accumulated capital (much of it abroad) will be reinvested in these economies. It will require a strong-willed leadership to break the system of interventions, create a competitive, open-market environment - and thereby attract back this amassed capital.

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> THIEVES CAN'T STEAL LIFE OUT OF SCIENCE CLASS  </P> <P> Seventh-graders at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School have been fascinated  by life science instructor Bill W. Anderson's "teaching tools" -- animals of  all kinds, including a 15-foot python, caged cockateels, wild deer mice, exotic  fish and more in two rooms used to expose his pupils to wildlife.  </P> <P> But in one corner, next to a wall covered with clippings from science  magazines, a glass aquarium marked "Haitian Boa" sits empty. The two specimens  that had lived there were among $2,200 worth of reptiles stolen from the Irvine  classroom earlier this week.  </P> <P> "They took some really unusual king snakes that you can't legally buy in  California," Anderson said. An albino corn snake and a western hognose snake  also were among the 23 snakes, 3 turtles and 2 lizards stolen Tuesday, he said.  Only about 15 of the reptiles remain.  </P> <P> Irvine Police Lt. Pat Rodgers said the suspects pried the classroom door open  with a blunt object sometime between midnight and 8 a.m. Tuesday. Officers were  unable to find any usable fingerprints Tuesday, but they are still  investigating the case.  </P> <P> Anderson said he had bought many of the missing reptiles with his own money.  Others he had found under rocks while on trips or morning runs. He added that  he spends much of his free time collecting and caring for the animals that  bring "life" to his science classes.  </P> <P> "This is what I love, and I put 100% into what I do," he said.  </P> <P> The reason for the elaborate exhibit, he said, is that most of his students,  about age 12, aren't really interested in "the booky stuff." But if they can be  made interested by looking at the actual creatures, "that's when they'll read,"  he said.  </P> <P> Anderson's approach seems to work. On Friday, students were planning a "snake  dance" and a candy sale to replace some of the stolen animals, school officials  said.  </P> <P> During class Friday, Anderson lifted one of the remaining snakes, a 15-foot  python, from its temporary home -- a green garbage pail, for about 35 wide-eyed  students.  </P> <P> "If you look inside his mouth," he said, holding the snake by its neck, "you'll  see a little hole. That's his breathing tube."  </P> <P> "Hey Mr. Anderson," one pupil called out. "What does that guy eat?"  </P> <P> Rabbits and chickens and such, Anderson responded. But watching the reptiles  eat is an experience he reserves for his advanced students. "A lot of the kids  couldn't handle it," he explained.  </P></p>

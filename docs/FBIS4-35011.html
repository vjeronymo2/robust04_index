			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The delegations have agreed in Norway that the Truth  Commission should not have judicial responsibilities or  functions, but that it should contribute to national  reconstruction. Notisiete has had access to the details of the  document the delegates have issued:    Purpose--To clarify, objectively, equitably, and  impartially,  the human rights violations and the deeds of violence related to  the armed confrontation, all of which have inflicted suffering  on the Guatemalan people.    Composition--The commission will consist of three members,  the current peace negotiations moderator, whose appointment will  be requested from the UN secretary general, a trustworthy and  upright person, designated by the mediator, and appointed by the  parties by consensus, and a professor selected from a three-name  list submitted by the university rectors and approved by the  parties by consensus. The commission will have the necessary  support personnel who must have the required qualifications to  perform their duties.    Installation and duration--The commission will be created,  installed, and begin to function on the day an agreement for a  firm and lasting peace is signed. The term of the commission  will last six months, beginning from the installation of the  commission. This period can be extended for six additional  months if the commission so decides.    Reports--The commission will prepare a report, a copy of  which will be given to the parties and the UN secretary general,  who will release it to the public. The fact it has been  impossible to look into every case presented to the commission  will not detract from the value of the report. The parties  pledge to cooperate with the commission in everything necessary  for the duties of the commission, particularly in creating,  before the creation of the commission and during its term of  operation, the essential conditions for the commission to meet  the requirements established in this agreement.    The commission shall prepare a report with the results of  the  investigations carried out during its term, including all  factors, both internal and external. The commission shall make  specific recommendations to pave the way for peace and national  harmony in Guatemala. In particular, the commission shall  recommend measures to preserve the memory of the victims to  encourage mutual respect, preserve human rights, and reinforce  the democratic process. The period that the commission will  investigate will span from the beginning of the armed conflict  to the signing of a firm and lasting peace agreement.    Operation--The commission will receive reports and  information from individuals or institutions that regard  themselves as affected. The commission must clarify these  situations, fully and in detail, and impartially study any  factors and circumstances that played a role in these cases.  The commission shall invite every person who might possess  pertinent information to present his version of the facts. The  absence of interested individuals shall not prevent the  commission from making a pronouncement on cases.    The commission's work, recommendations, and reports will not  be the responsibility of the individual members and will not  serve judicial purposes. The actions of the commission will  protect the identities of the sources, as well as witnesses and  informers. Once it is created, the commission will report on  its composition and the location of its headquarters through  every available means and will invite interested parties to  present their reports and accounts.    According to the Framework Agreement of 10 January 1994, the  fulfillment of this agreement is subject to international UN  verification. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general  to appoint the negotiations moderator, a member of the  commission. After he is appointed, this person will be empowered  to carry out all of the necessary procedures to ensure the  smooth operation of the commission once the commission is  created and installed according to this agreement.    Signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: The Caruso of rock 'n' roll ROY Kelton Orbison (1936-1988) was the unmistakable singer with the pasty complexion, the black Raybans and the ubiquitous voice. Only The Lonely at the Liverpool Playhouse is a tribute to Orbison, more musical than theatrical. It is, as Rob Reiner once said, not a documentary but a rockumentary, a welcome chance to hear the wonderful songs. It makes a vastly enjoyable evening: capacious, lyrical and exciting. The musical has arrived at an opportune time, with Grease bringing the 1950s to the West End and preparing the way for this 1960s collection. Yet Only The Lonely has no dramatic form other than a meeting between Orbison and his son in Ohio at Orbison's last concert. Author Laurence Ross had only to link the tunes. As Orbison explains himself to his son, the extraordinary serendipity of his life reveals itself. The Caruso of rock 'n' roll stumbled into his own image as if by chance. He first wore the dark glasses because he left his own on a plane when touring with the Beatles. He intended to give 'Only The Lonely' to Elvis Presley, but the King was sleeping when Orbison called, and he decided to record it himself. The habitual black clothes were almost an afterthought: Orbison's wife says unimaginatively 'You look great in black, Roy.' Orbison's sombre life bears an exact relation to the songs. His estranged and then reinstated wife Claudette died in a motorcycle crash, two of his three sons died in a basement fire, and Orbison underwent triple bypass surgery before his final seizure. He comes across as a passive, innocent man, more sung against than singing. Out of this misery came the fine 'In Dreams', 'Running Scared', 'Pretty Woman' and 'You Got It'. It is an ambitious musical which puts the Beatles on stage in Liverpool, but this Bill Kenright production offers Bob Dylan, kd lang and Bruce Springsteen as well. The impersonations work well, with Karl Lornie twitching the violin bass as he plays Paul McCartney and Martin Glyn Murray strumming nervously as John Lennon and then posturing with it as Bruce Springsteen. Larry Branson as Orbison is superb, looking and sounding like him, floating to the high notes and plummeting to the low growl. This is Branson's first acting role, since he usually has only to sing in his career as Roy Orbison; but luckily Orbison was undemonstrative to a fault. Even in the most frenetic numbers, Orbison allowed himself only a flexing of the right knee. Ian Kellgren's direction and Keith Strachan's musical direction give life and point to Orbison's songs, which remained the same while fashions changed around them. They are infectious and catchy here, tightly played and fully produced. Orbison recorded nothing between 1969 and 1988, when he reemerged with a TV special involving Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Jennifer Warnes. This in turn led to the Travelling Wilburys (with Bob Dylan and friends) and a revival of interest in Orbison. He died in December of that year. The Liverpool Playhouse until August 28</p>

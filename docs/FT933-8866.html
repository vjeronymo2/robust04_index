			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Survey shows accountants critical of new standards ACCOUNTANTS are highly critical of the effectiveness of the new standards being produced by the Auditing Practices Board, says a survey released yesterday. Fewer than half of about 100 auditors questioned believed any of the board's proposed guidelines were sufficiently precise to form the basis of audit regulation. The survey, published in the trade newsletter True &amp; Fair, is one of the first attempts to assess the work of the board, which was created two years ago to redraft auditing standards in the UK.</p>

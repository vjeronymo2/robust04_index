			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING FOR THE GOLD AGAIN  </P> <P> Five years after the Olympic spirit captivated Los Angeles, a new group of  Californians has dreams of the five encircled rings in its future, not to  mention the prospect of big dollar signs. Lake Tahoe officials from both  California and Nevada have joined with the Reno area to bid for the 1998 winter  Olympic Games. One of the ski areas involved is Squaw Valley, the site of the  1960 games in which the United States won the ice hockey gold medal and skiers  Billy Kidd and Jimmy Heuga made stunning medal-winning runs.  </P> <P> More is at stake than just the opportunity to host the 1998 games. When the  U.S. Olympic Committee selects the American competitor for the games in Des  Moines early next month, it also will be considering establishment of a  permanent winter sports training center. The competition from Denver, Salt Lake  City and Anchorage will be intense, but the Reno-Tahoe bid deserves the edge on  a number of counts, including the excellence of its developed ski areas and  proximity to a massive spectator population. With its casino industry, the  Reno-Tahoe area has the lodging. It also knows how to handle crowds and  entertain them.  </P> <P> Reno, the Olympic center, would host the Opening and Closing ceremonies, hockey  and ice skating. Alpine skiing would be in California, at Squaw Valley just  northwest of Lake Tahoe and at Heavenly Valley at South Lake Tahoe. The Tahoe  region also has some of the finest Nordic skiing in the world. The major  construction required would be ski jumps, luge and bobsled tracks, an ice rink  and speed skating oval. Start-up money would be provided by a 1% hotel room  surtax and a .01% increase in the sales tax in Washoe County, Nev.  </P> <P> There should be concern about what permanent effect the games would have on an  already-congested mountain environment, particularly the California shores of  Lake Tahoe. The major impact would be transportation improvements needed to get  contestants and spectators into and out of Lake Tahoe and Reno.  </P> <P> The California-Nevada Tahoe Regional Planning Commission would have to have a  critical role in such preparations. The prospect of the 1998 games could  present the Tahoe region with the opportunity for development of a  non-polluting public transportation system that would actually reduce auto use  in the Tahoe basin, where air pollution is a major problem. One major advantage  is that Amtrak passenger trains now run between Oakland and Reno via Donner  Summit and Truckee, on the north edge of the Tahoe basin.  </P> <P> If Reno-Tahoe wins the USOC endorsement, the state of California should begin  an assessment of the organizing committee's plans and projections to see what  transportation improvements can be made without tearing down mountains to build  freeways. Modern transit facilities will be needed to meet future demand  whether or not the Olympics come to the Reno-Tahoe area.  </P> <P> With the proper environmental protection and transportation planning,  Californians should be enthusiastic supporters of the Reno-Tahoe bid for the  1998 winter Olympic Games.  </P></p>

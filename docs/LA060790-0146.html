			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORGAN DECIDES THAT HE'LL APPEAL  </P> <P> Boston Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan changed course Wednesday and decided to  appeal his three-game suspension, leaving him in the dugout at least until a  hearing next week.  </P> <P> Morgan managed the Red Sox to a 4-1 victory over the New York Yankees Wednesday  night at Boston.  </P> <P> Morgan can stay with the Red Sox until he meets Tuesday in New York with  American League President Bobby Brown.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Brown suspended Morgan for supporting a brushback pitch that led to  a bench-clearing brawl Sunday in Cleveland. At the time, Morgan said he would  not contest the penalty.  </P> <P> Morgan appealed Wednesday. He did not offer an explanation.  </P> <P> "You'll have to talk to the other boys about it," he said, suggesting Boston's  front office.  </P> <P> In a statement, Brown said, "The fact that pitchers throw close to hitters and  sometimes deliberately hit them is a known fact."  </P> <P> "Nevertheless, it behooves the American League office to eliminate premeditated  and announced violence. This cannot be condoned, and increasing suspensions and  fines will be imposed if the practice continues," Brown said.  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's generally excellent foreign affairs series Assignment (7.45) asks whether colonialism is coming back into fashion, what with American marines in Somalia and the World Bank dictating terms in so many places. BBC1 shows the first episode of Luv by Carla Lane. They are still describing her work as 'family comedy' though ever since 'Butterflies' it has been moving closer to tragedy. It would be more honest to take off the laughter track and present it for what it is. This series is about a self-made man, played by Michael Angelis, who 'gives his wife and three adopted children everything money can buy, but doesn't realise money can't buy them what they really need' (8.00). ITV screens its pilot for a British version of 'The Golden Girls', Brighton Belles, within its 'Comedy Playhouse' season. Sheila Hancock, Sheila Gish and Wendy Craig play the younger trio and Jean Boht takes the mother role played by Estelle Getty in the US original (8.30). Channel 4's Without Walls examines the lives of early actresses who were assumed to be prostitutes; and invites George Melly to have a go at the later work of Henry Moore (9.00).</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Companies reappear from the long, dark winter FOLLOWING a long, dark winter in which corporations were notable by their absence from the international bond market, a steady stream of companies, many of them British, has recently re-emerged with public bond issues. UK companies including Sainsbury, Sears, British Petroleum, British Aerospace, British Gas, Guinness, National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank have issued straight debt securities in the international bond market in recent weeks. These deals, and others by overseas companies such as Daimler Benz and Electrolux, have broken a spell in which the domination of the bond market by sovereign-backed and supranational institutions was almost complete. In part, the absence of companies has been a pragmatic response to market conditions. As the UK, US and other economies swung into recession, international investors became wary of buying paper issued by companies. The corporate sector was seen as over-geared and vulnerable to a downturn. This paranoia concerning credit quality was reflected in a dramatic widening of yield spreads in all markets during the second half of last year. In the US market, for example, JP Morgan's index of bonds issued by industrial companies of Baa credit quality, around medium grade, shows yield spreads over US Treasury stock widening from 184 basis points in September to 266 basis points in December. However, such indexed figures disguise the fact that some sectors of the economy were hit harder than others. In the face of mounting loan losses, the banking industry was particularly hard hit. An extreme example is Standard Chartered, which saw the yield spread on its 12 7/8 per cent sterling bond issue maturing 2002/07 swing out from 250 basis points in September to 700 basis points in January. In this hostile environment, it was only the best quality credits that could raise finance at anything other than punitive rates. In addition, private sector companies with high capital requirements - such as utilities - have been able to channel their borrowing through supranational institutions, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Community. The EIB can issue long-date sterling bonds at a yield spread of perhaps 60 basis points over UK government bonds in the international market. In contrast, Anglian Water's Pounds 100m long-date Eurobond issue was launched in December at a spread of 150 basis points over gilts. Most EIB loans fall under the broad objective of regional development, although the bank will also finance environmental protection projects, investment in high technology and communications - as well as granting special loans to small and medium-size enterprises. The banks' capital, subscribed by EC governments was doubled to Ecu57.6bn last year. This raises the ceiling of loans which the EIB can make to Ecu144bn, against outstanding loans of Ecu61.5bn. Hence the EIB expects to lend around Ecu80bn between now and 1995. In the first quarter, the EIB extended loans totalling Ecu460m (Pounds 380m) to UK companies. One recipient was Southern Water, which signed a Pounds 55m loan facility with the EIB, adding to a Pounds 40m loan made last year. The 15-year facility carries a preferential interest rate fixed at around 11 per cent. Another potential source of finance is the EC, which lends to the private sector through the European Coal and Steel Community. Again, projects must meet lending criteria: job creation in areas hit by the fall of the coal and steel industries. In addition to direct loans, the ECSC provides lines of credit to banks through its global loans scheme. UK banks which participate in the scheme include Barclays, National Westminster, Midland, Bank of Scotland, TSB and Clydesdale. Each line of credit is up to Pounds 90m, which is drawn down as sub-loans to individual projects (up to Pounds 5.4m) are approved. Among UK companies, Tesco and Argyll stores groups were recently granted direct loans totalling Pounds 87m by the ECSC. The ECSC notes a sharp increase in loans made to companies this year. In the first quarter, Ecu145m of loans were granted to the UK corporate sector, against Ecu300m for the whole of last year. But, the EIB and ECSC will only meet up to 50 per cent of the cost of any project. Additional finance must come from either the banks or the capital market. Neither institution is keen to be seen as a lender of last resort. A further explanation for the absence of UK companies from the market is that demand for finance has been low on cyclical grounds. This is a view backed up by evidence from outside the bond markets. For example, in March the growth in UK bank lending stood at a 15-year low. Yet in surveys only 4 per cent of UK companies complain of difficulties in raising external finance. The highly-geared corporate sector has concentrated on equity and equity-linked funding (in the form of convertible bond issues) rather than debt finance. Hence the bond market and syndicated loans market have been largely deserted by UK companies. The test will come when demand for debt finance revives as economic activity picks up. The success of recent bond issues is encouraging. Corporate yield spreads have already passed their peak, a sign investors are more willing to buy paper issued by companies. JP Morgan's index of Baa-rated industrial bonds now shows a yield spread of 200 basis points over Treasuries. The yield spread on Standard Chartered's long-dated sterling paper has fallen to 300 basis points - back to the levels of the third quarter of last year. Greece has mandated Credit Suisse First Boston to lead manage its first Ecu-denominated Eurobond issue. Other banks participating in the deal are Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley Nomura International.</p>

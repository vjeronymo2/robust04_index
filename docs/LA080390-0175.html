			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXCHANGE HALTED BY 'CIRCUIT BREAKER'  </P> <P> A plunge in stock-index futures prices this morning on the Chicago Mercantile  Exchange triggered a two-minute trading halt that is one of the "circuit  breakers" intended to prevent a runaway stock-market collapse.  </P> <P> All Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contracts fell the permitted  opening limit of 5 points in the first 10 minutes, forcing exchange officials  to declare a trading halt from 9:40 a.m. to 9:42 a.m., according to an exchange  spokesman. He said prices continued to fall when trading resumed. The  near-month contract, for September delivery, came within 1/10th point of a  12-point loss, which is the next circuit-breaker limit, before prices rallied.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEST VIRGINIA TALKS WITH BIG TEN ABOUT JOINING CONFERENCE  </P> <P> West Virginia has talked with Big Ten officials about joining the conference  should it decide to expand its membership, Mountaineer Athletic Director Ed  Pastilong said.  </P> <P> "We have had informal talks with the Big Ten.  </P> <P> We have talked with (Big Ten Commissioner) Jim Delany and with some of the  other member schools," Pastilong said.  </P> <P> "I think if the Big Ten does consider adding a 12th team that we would be given  serious consideration," he told the Charleston Daily Mail.  </P> <P> The Big Ten presidents have invited Penn State to join the conference, but that  situation reportedly has grown shaky because of opposition from some members.  There also has been speculation, including a story in last week's Sports  Illustrated, that if Penn State gets in, the conference might add a 12th member  and go to divisional play.  </P></p>

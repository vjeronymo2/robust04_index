The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is an open-end diversified management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On March 4, 1988, applicant registered as an investment company under the Act, and filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on July 13, 1988, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On February 16,1994, applicant's board of directors approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'') between applicant and TCW Funds, Inc. (``TCW Funds''), a registered, open-end management company. The Plan provided for the transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of applicant's sole series, the Money Market Portfolio, in exchange for shares of TCW Galileo Money Market Fund (``Galileo''), a series of TCW Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Plan were filed with the SEC on March 23, 1994, and proxy materials were mailed to applicant's on or about March 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On April 6, 1994, the SEC issued an order <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  permitting applicant to exchange its assets and liabilities for shares of Galileo, provided that applicant's shareholders approved the exchange. In the application requesting that order, it was stated that the reason for the reorganization was to help reduce overall operating expenses because of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain management and administrative expenses over a larger asset base. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Plan at a special meeting of applicant's shareholders on April 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> TCW Investment Funds, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20130 (Mar. 11, 1994) (notice) and 20201 (Apr. 6, 1994) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. As of May 23, 1994, applicant had 87,893,619 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $87,893,619, and a per share net asset value of $1.00. On May 23, 1994, pursuant to the Plan, applicant transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the TCW Funds, Inc. in exchange for shares of Galileo. The aggregate net asset value of the Galileo shares received was equal to the net asset value of applicant's shares held. Applicant then distributed the Galileo shares it received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to its shareholders, in complete liquidation of applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The State Education Commission yesterday issued a  circular in which it set forth its opinions on the  implementation of new work hours in schools beginning on 1 March.    The circular stated: Following the nationwide implementation  of new work hours, it will be appropriate for various schools at  the secondary and above levels to first implement, on a trial  basis, a system of five-and-a-half-day work weeks, in light of  their special work conditions and teaching rules, provided there  are no particular problems in doing so. Schools in the same  district should try their best to implement a unified work-hour  system. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly  under the central government, or authorized prefectures and  cities should make unified plans. Schools should appropriately  modify the contents of their courses and curricula in accordance  with the guidelines of the new work-hour system.    The circular urged educational administrative departments at  all levels to make all kinds of preparations in earnest in  accordance with the demands of the new work-hour system so as to  ensure normal working and teaching order in schools after the  new work-hour system is implemented.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Uncertainty dogged stock index futures, with contrary views on market direction pulling against each other and stifling activity, Christine Buckley writes. The market struggled to develop a unified outlook on what one derivatives expert described as a very difficult day. Some traders were determined to forecast a rise in equity derivatives, while others remained convinced that the rally was definitely at an end. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 was further stymied by having only a few more working days until expiry. Investors have been steadily moving to roll over their positions into the September future. June again trailed the cash market for most of the day, although by a modest amount. At the close it was 5 points behind at 3,022. The trading range was tight, with the day's low at 3,017 and high at 3,039. September finished the session at 3,036. Volume was modest at 11,464 June contracts traded and 4,342 for the September future. Options maintained the steady level of activity of recent sessions, with 32,535 lots traded. Index options again formed about half of the day's trade. A spread trade in Guinness helped to make it the day's most heavily dealt stock option at 5,654 lots. Movement was from August puts to February puts.</p>

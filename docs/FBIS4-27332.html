			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial staffer Shunji Taoka: "If a </F> Special Demolition Force Attacks Japan, the Self-Defense Forces  Will Be Mobilized To Defend the Nation"]    [Text] The government is currently studying measures to  deal with the issue of DPRK's suspected nuclear development  program. Among these measures, those concerning the timing and  necessary conditions for ordering "the mobilization of troops  for defense [boei-shutsudo]" are most noticeable.    North Korea has a special force composed of about  60,000-100,000 troops, of which 2,000 allegedly specialize in  infiltration and subversive activities.    It has been argued that if the U.S. Forces make a bombing  raid on North Korea from Japan in the case of a contingency,  some of these specially trained soldiers might infiltrate Japan  with the aim of blowing up or attacking nuclear power plants,  Shinkansen bullet train lines, airports, military bases, and  government offices.    However, if they take off their coats and show uniforms of  the Korean People's Army just before they attack, Japan has to  treat them as prisoners in some cases in line with international  law.    The prime minister can order mobilization for defense "when  Japan is attacked by a foreign country" and "when there are  signs of armed attack against Japan." But as a rule, he needs  to obtain a prior Diet approval. In an emergency, he is allowed  to obtain the approval immediately after ordering mobilization  for defense. Without the order for mobilization for defense,  the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] cannot take defensive actions  outside bases. In this case, police carry out defense duties.  But it is impossible for police officers to fight against  specially trained soldiers just with guns and billy clubs.    This is the reason that the government stresses the need for  studying mobilization for defense in its documents on the DPRK  issue. Once mobilization for defense is ordered, Japan makes  combat preparations. The SDF is allowed to use force.  Meanwhile, the Defense Agency [DA] is authorized to control  private hospitals and clinics through prefectural governors,  expropriate land and houses, and give orders to people busy in  medicare, construction, and transport.    The SDF can also take over duties from police to maintain  public law and order. The Maritime Safety Agency falls under  the control of the DA director general. Local governments,  police, and fire fighters are obliged to cooperate with the SDF.  Procedures for wartime preparations and compensations will be  stipulated by government ordinances, which the government is  scheduled to issue when an emergency occurs.    The phrase "when there are signs of armed attack against  Japan" does not mean if there is the least probability of  attack, but means when there is high probability. This is the  interpretation of this phrase. However, it is difficult to know  the movements of a foreign special force. If the DA asserts  "various kinds of information show a high probability of  attack," the Diet will not be able to rebut it.    Some DA officials note that because the actions of special  forces are tantamount to criminal acts, the mobilization of  troops to maintain public peace and order [shian-shutsudo] is  more appropriate than mobilization for defense.    However, shian-shutsudo is ordered by governors and does not  require a Diet approval. Thus, it is feared that in a tense  situation, shian-shutsudo might be ordered easily.</p>

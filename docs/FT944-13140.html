			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Shares in Japan Tobacco slump on first day's trade Japan's ministry of finance, which has met strong criticism over the unpopular partial privatisation of Japan Tobacco, ran into further embarrassment yesterday as the stock fell sharply on its first day of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Shares in Japan Tobacco, the cigarette manufacturing monopoly, closed at Y1.1m, down 23.5 per cent from its publicly offered price of Y1.438m and wiping Y133bn (Dollars 1.4bn) off shareholders' investments. After failing to trade during the first few hours due to the lack of buyers, the stock finally changed hands at Y1.19m. Matsushita Electric Works, a subsidiary of the consumer electronics group, which bought 1,720 shares through the pre-offer auction at about Y1.35m per share, said it would maintain its holdings for now. Other corporate holders include Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, which bought 1,120 shares through the pre-offer auction. Brokers fear the sharp fall in the stock price will further hit sluggish retail investor confidence. Over 60 per cent of the small investors who were allotted the right to buy shares in the public offering forfeited their allocations due to concerns of the weak Tokyo stock market and the expensive offering price. The privatisation flop casts a shadow over future government flotations. 'People will not trust the government in future privatisations,' said one Japanese broker. However, amid the criticism the ministry of finance put on a brave face, and said it intended to go ahead with the sales of the partially privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares during the current year to March, since it was included in this year's budget. The transport ministry has taken a more cautious approach, and this week said it would review plans to list in February West Japan Railway, one of the six rail companies created by the 1987 break-up of Japanese National Railways. Meanwhile, the finance ministry has started to review its pricing method of shares in companies to be privatised. Rather than choosing a mid-price achieved in a pre-offer auction, Japanese and foreign brokers are calling for the adoption of the book-building system used in the US and Europe, where an offering price is chosen after financial advisers sound out the leading potential investors. The Tokyo stock market shrugged off Japan Tobacco's woes, and the Nikkei 225 index closed marginally higher gaining 50.01 to 19,796.36. See World Stock Markets</p>

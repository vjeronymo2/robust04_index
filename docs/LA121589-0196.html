			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INCHES UP  </P> <P> Industrial production edged up 0.1% in November, rebounding from the effects of  the Boeing aircraft strike and the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake a month  earlier, the government said today.  </P> <P> But without the one-time special effects, production would have been little  changed, and analysts said it reflected a growing sluggishness in the economy.  </P> <P> Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd,  Pa., said the sluggishness, which started in the auto industry several months  ago, is broad-based in the manufacturing sector of the economy.  </P> <P> "As a result, for the next several months, industrial production is going  nowhere and, if anything, going slightly down," he said.  </P> <P> Chimerine and other economists suggested that the Federal Reserve should ease  interest rates to stimulate the economy, particularly in view of recent reports  that inflation is moderating.  </P></p>

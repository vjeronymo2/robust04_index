We were discussing the underground economy, or the  submerged economy, as it is also called. I think there are many  people with doubts, and surely this program seeks to clear up  some of those doubts and explain some of these trends. I was  talking with an economics student about this program. She did  have the opportunity to listen. She said she was rather  surprised over your definition of this matter as an underground  economy, or black market, which are not the same. One is  implicit in the other, but they are not the same. I also think  this was the reason for an analysis of other subjects related to  this issue.    [Rodriguez] I can give you an additional definition: It is  also called an informal economy in other countries, namely in  Latin America. This submerged economy can be defined as an  aspect of the economics that are affecting Cuba at this moment.    [Roque] Yes, and in the previous program we said that this  is  not a problem in Cuba alone, but is a problem affecting all  societies. Also that it comes from a capitalist society.    [Rodriguez] Of course.    [Roque] This problem is a derivative of capitalist society,  and today this activity is at its peak in Latin American  economies. To define it, I was saying that transactions of goods  and services that are not officially authorized can be either  legal or illegal. Here is where some confusion can emerge  concerning the black market versus the underground economy. The  black market can be part of the underground economy, but it is  not the only thing within the underground economy.    Recently, in a program when my friend Renato Recio was  present, we were discussing the cigarette issue. We were saying  that a large number of people are assigned certain allocations  of cigarettes. One of the proposals submitted today in the  parliament is that in work places we should to try eliminate  these allocations. Well, according to a recent study conducted  by a group of friends from the Research Institute to which I had  access, they reached the conclusion that only 40 percent of the  people who receive normal and controlled allocations of  cigarettes are in fact smokers. The rest -- well, some of these  allocations go to the family, but others use them to sell in the  underground economy. This is the example I was giving the other  day, because if I, a nonsmoker, receive cigarettes that are  assigned to my house and I submit them to the informal economy,  either by selling or bartering them, it is neither an illegal,  nor a black-market activity. It is informal economics,  nonofficial economics. Of course, this situation does not affect  the economy as much as the black market because the black market  is within the underground economy. Well, to make it clearer, let  me tell you this: If I exchange one of my cigarette packs for a  bag of rice, it is not black market.    [Rodriguez] No, it is not black market, it is underground  economy; and if you sell that box of cigarettes, as usually  happens, at black-market price, it is not black market. It is  underground economy, but it does have an effect. The same thing  happens with those people who do not drink, but who sell their  rum at black-market prices.    [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy.  Osvaldo, why has this term emerged, and why has this phenomenon  occurred in the world economy?    [Rodriguez] First, let us begin with why it emerged in  Cuba. It was the shortage in state supplies to the population  that enlarged and consolidated this type of economy, which we  can call underground or informal economy. Undoubtedly, it is  nourished by excess currency that is not backed by goods. That  is its origin. I wish to point out that this existed or  coexisted before, with financial stability, when there were  undoubtedly deficiencies in the official market of products that  were in great demand. We could talk about shoes, for example.    [Roque] Yes, I believe that having discussed here the  concepts of black-market and underground economies, we can see  that it is not a phenomenon that has only now emerged, but as  you said, it existed in parallel with the stability of certain  years. I can remember that in the eighties -- I call this period  the golden decade because we were very stable, especially with  food products -- there were some products that were also sold on  the street in that way. It was not a black market, but you  needed to go to this underground economy to satisfy the need for  products that you could not find on the official market.    [Rodriguez] Yes, this study I was talking about makes an  interesting point: During the period of financial stability, the  population's expenses in the underground economy did not exceed  20 percent.    I would also like to answer the other part of your question  on how it emerged. I am sure that in your trips to Mexico you  have seen the illicit street vendors. This underground economy  is more prominent in Latin America and underdeveloped countries.  It is the economy of immigrants in developed countries.    [Roque] These people do not pay taxes. That is probably one  of the main things that make it an underground economy: It is  not controlled by the state.    [Rodriguez] Right, they are not officially authorized.    [Roque] There it has its beginnings. Here in Cuba it has a  different beginning.    [Rodriguez] Here it has other causes. Necessity is what  drives this economy. The main difference between the presence of  an underground economy in that market economy and in our economy  is that over there they compete below official prices.    [Roque] And the necessities are different.    [Rodriguez] Yes, of course. Here it is the speculators who  use the black market to try to get rich or to try to live better  than the average citizen.    [Roque] Something that stands out is that over there, it is  the complete opposite. There they lower the prices. In other  words, their prices are lower than those of the state.    [Rodriguez] Inside that economy, there is also a black  market  because many of the products that are sold at lower prices are  stolen, or are products that are smuggled into the country. They  therefore are not charged customs or taxes, and have a shady  origin.    [Roque] Let us talk about our problem. How can we resolve  this situation -- do away with the underground economy? We know  that the main factor is production. We must stabilize production  levels in general. Without goods to back the excess currency  circulating on the streets... [pauses] everything is connected  here. Everything is related to the other. People must accept  this information and these explanations in order to understand  the concepts of the economy.    [Rodriguez] I think you are right. We must first increase  our  production, as you said before, but we must also remember that  the official market will take some time to change. There is a  group of needs, especially services. The underground economy  involves not only the sale of goods, it also includes the sale  of services. That too forms part of the underground economy. It  is going to take some time to be able to solve that.    [Roque] And in this case of services, can the tax system  help, or contribute toward putting an end to this phenomenon?    [Rodriguez] Well, if it is organized, it can. We cannot say  that self-employed workers are part of the underground economy  because they are authorized and licensed by the state. They pay  taxes to the state and are authorized to produce and market  their product in determined places. They are not the problem.  The problem is those who do this illegally. It is those persons  who provide services or who sell their products illegally. We  cannot always call things illegal, because there are times when  there is no law, as in the example we mentioned of selling  something from our house. There is no law that prohibits me from  selling something from my house and there is no law that imposes  a tax on that sale. There are countries where that does exist.  Any transaction between two people requires a tax to the state  because it is a business transaction.    [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. I must  admit that this is a topic I do not know much about since I am  not an economist; but at the same time, I am very interested, as  are many of the listeners.    [Rodriguez] I am not an economist either, but I have read  some material that I have received and I believe it is an  interesting subject because it is a passionate subject. It is  something we are currently living.    [Roque] Let us look at this study that was conducted. I can  see that we are concerned about this problem. We are at least  studying the phenomenon and looking for ways or alternatives for  its solution.    [Rodriguez] Yes, this study has a series of proposals that  we  could leave for another program, because they are interesting  proposals.    [Roque] We are going to have to call them Underground  Economy  One, Underground Economy Two, and present a series of  programs....    [Rodriguez, interrupting] ... and proposals for solutions to  the underground economy. These researchers point out something  very interesting: They say that everytime there is a structural  imbalance between supply and demand, there will be economic  space for the underground economy, which is created through the  redistribution of income. Of course, we are talking about the  Cuban phenomenon. We are not talking about the underground  economy of other places where the prices are below those of the  official market. We are talking about our situation. We must  remember that people go to the underground economy to improve  the structure of consumption, due to deficiencies in the  assortment and existence of products from the state supply.  People also go to the underground economy in cases when they  have excess income, to try to increase satisfaction of their  needs. These are the reasons why people go to this underground  economy. Just recently, this was discussed on a Straight Talk  program.    For the most objective analysis of our current situation,  the  financial imbalance, we must look at the merchandise, not the  money. Money keeps accruing because there is a lack of goods. As  soon as these goods begin to appear, and these measures that we  are all waiting for are applied to balance our domestic economy,  the problems of this underground economy will also be solved. As  these products we are all hoping to produce begin appearing, we  start to hope that one day we will have the money to buy them.  As the excess currency begins disappearing, the black-market  prices will not be as high as those that the worker must pay  with their salaries.    [Roque] At least there can be an end to this black market.  Is  it the same for the underground economy, or is it a phenomenon  that will be with us for many years to come?    [Rodriguez] I believe that when the economy is stabilized  and  there is a balance between supply and demand, or when supply is  slightly higher than demand -- when that happens, and it happens  in any economy because there is always a supply facing the flow  of currency -- I believe, because I am realistic, that what is  happening in other countries will happen -- an underground  economy will exist and will be below the official market. I do  not think it will disappear.    [Roque] The most important thing now is to keep producing,  to  gradually restore the value of our money, and to achieve market  stability, as you said, so that people will feel relieved.    [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe this relief will be experienced  after a given period -- following the implementation of measures  -- not immediately. We have said several times on this program  that measures cannot be considered a magic wand to yield  immediate results in the economy. All economies have a delayed,  not an immediate effect, unless drastic shock measures are  adopted such as changing the monetary system.    [Roque] Yes. Well, I thank you for your participation in  this  program. Of course, I invite you to comment again on part three  of The Underground Economy.</p>

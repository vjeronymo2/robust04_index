			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Beta to launch fund for Cuba Beta Funds, a London-based company, is planning to launch a Dollars 50m investment fund for Cuba and has created the first investment management company to be represented on the island. Havana Asset Management, a new subsidiary of Beta Funds International, will manage the planned Cuba investment fund, which is expected to be established early next year. Mr Peter Scott, Beta's chief executive, said its expected areas of investment included hotels and tourism, mining, food and beverages, the high-tech pharmaceutical sector and specialised manufacturing. It would invest in new joint venture companies, existing Cuban companies and foreign companies with a significant exposure to Cuba. Beta specialises in spotting new markets and pioneered the creation of investment management companies in Vietnam and Poland. It has more than Dollars 230m invested in emerging markets. The Cuban government has opened up sectors of the economy to foreign investors. It has signed more than 100 new trade and investment deals, from oil exploration and mining to cosmetics and textiles. Mr Scott said the Cuba fund had aroused interested in the UK, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and Mexico. Besides Beta, the other shareholders in Havana Asset Management are Nueva Compania de Indias, a Spanish trading company operating in Cuba, and James Miura, of Ninecastle Overseas, a UK investment management company. Mr Scott said Cuba had provided legal safeguards for foreign investors by signing investment promotion and protection agreements with a number of countries, including the UK. Mr Scott said the fund's articles would not permit the participation of investors from the US, whose government maintains a trade and financial embargo against Cuba. He believed relations between Cuba and the US would follow the same path as Vietnam, against which Washington lifted a long-standing economic embargo earlier this year.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bucharest Radio Romania Network in  Romanian at 1005 GMT on 14 March carries a live relay from  Victoria Hall in Bucharest of a news conference by Prime  Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu on economic, agricultural, and reform  issues and the recent government reshuffle.    In his one-hour introductory statement, Nicolae Vacaroiu  discusses the government's activity over the past year and five  months and the "difficult period Romania experienced in 1993,"  which, he says, "will continue in 1994." He says that the  government carried out his activity on the "basis of the  government program and strategy" aimed at "implementing the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] policy, that of the  ruling party."    Vacaroiu says that 1993 was "the first year in which we  succeeded in stopping the decline of production." He stresses  that "Romania's foreign debts did not increase in 1993" and that  "priority was given to agriculture, which is the branch that has  to ensure the consumption base for the population." After  pointing out the potential that exists in this area, he stresses  that "the association and privatization process has to be  intensified" and "agricultural machinery and equipment have to  be ensured." Vacaroiu points out that "although we have  recorded an increase of 12 percent in agriculture on the whole,  we are still faced by particularly difficult problems,"  especially in the "animal-breeding sector."    After emphasizing that the transition process is much more  complex than expected and that one of the "essential problems is  changing the mentality of people, and their adjustment to a  market economy," Vacaroiu says that a "radical change" is needed  and trade companies have to adjust "while we move on."    Discussing 1994, he predicts a "slight economic increase."  He continues to say that the "GNP is estimated to grow by 1.5  percent in 1994, industrial output by 2 percent, and exports by  7 percent, while imports are expected to decrease by 2 percent."  He assesses that the unemployment rate will be 12 percent and  consumer costs will increase 15 percent. After stressing that  the price increase was 295.5 percent in 1993, while that of net  incomes was only 210.6 percent, thus causing a decline in the  standard of living, Vacaroiu says that at the end of 1993 the  average pay was 54 percent compared with that in 1990.    Discussing priority goals for 1994, Vacaroiu says that the  "main goal in 1994 is to relaunch and stabilize the economy,"  increase "the coherence of the economic and social reform  process," with "emphasis, of course, on the restructuring,  privatization process, and on social protection." He assesses  that the standard of living "will not deteriorate in the first  half of 1994," but that it will even "increase 10 percent" in  the second half of the year.    After stressing the need to "invigorate Romanian industry  along with the restructuring and privatization process,"  Vacaroiu mentions the "measures included in the memorandum with  the IMF."    Discussing industrial production in January, he says that it  "increased 1.8 percent compared with last December and 5.5  percent compared with the previous January," while "productivity  increased 1.6 percent compared with December and 10.1 percent  compared with January last year."    The prime minister warns, however, that this does not mean  that "things are back to normal," but that Romania is still  experiencing a "particularly drastic economic crisis" that may  still have "harsh negative effects on the economy and life in  general."    After discussing the "January surplus trade balance,"  Vacaroiu stresses that the foreign currency policy is of great  importance, since it is the one to "contribute to macroeconomic  stability." He continues to discuss other banking and state  budget issues.    Regarding the restructuring program and the privatization  process, Vacaroiu discusses procedural matters and the important  role to be played by the stock exchange.    At 1047 GMT Prime Minister Vacaroiu begins discussing the  recent government reshuffle, explaining the reasons behind the  replacement of the four ministers of defense, interior, justice,  and transportation.    He admits that "we are still facing great problems in the  area of corruption, violations, and tax evasion." In connection  with the replacement of the minister of defense, Vacaroiu says  that "Romania's Army has to represent a symbol of the country,  it has to guarantee stability, credibility, and must by no means  be involved in various disputes -- political or of any other  nature."    After presenting the merits of each newly appointed  minister,  Vacaroiu speaks about the problem of financial blockage and the  need to eliminate it.    Discussing agricultural issues, Vacaroiu points out actions  that have been taken to support this sector "with certain sums  of money from the budget," through the "sale of agricultural  machinery and equipment on credit," and through "priority  actions in the area of privatization."    Vacaroiu concludes his introductory statement by emphasizing  that "a number of actions have been taken" to "give an impetus  to small-and medium-sized private entrepreneurs" in order "to  guarantee their financial sources."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Realization of Peace Is the Response to </F> Violence"]    [Text] The mutual acts of violence in the arena of  struggle are making the situation worse and more complicated and  are casting a dark shadow on the stalled negotiating process.    These acts will not cease as long as the negotiating process  does not achieve practical results on the ground. The Oslo  accord set 13 April as the date for ending the occupation in  Gaza and Jericho as the first step toward beginning talks over a  final settlement. Evidence and facts indicate, however, that  this date will pass without the realization of a practical  achievement. Consequently, the cycle of violence will remain  and bloodshed will continue. This is something which we do not  desire, but condemnation and precautionary measures are  insufficient and will not stop acts of violence. The only way  to do that is by advancing in the negotiating process and  understanding the facts of the struggle. Delay in reaching  agreements on implementing the accord will leave the door open  for mutual acts of violence that we have always hoped will stop.    Israel is called upon to seriously accelerate the  negotiating  process, adhere to what it signed in Washington and Cairo,  refrain from engaging in procedural matters, and move toward the  achievement of practical steps leading to peace and stability,  so that calm will prevail and violence will end forever.    We strongly condemn acts of violence regardless of the party  that perpetrates them and look forward to the moment in which  the foundations of peace and stability are laid down.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Food: Come in for a ceili - Kieran Cooke recounts his experiences up a boreen THE Ceili House cafe and restaurant is not one of the world's busiest. Far from it. In two of the winter months last year, it only had three customers. But this is no reflection on the culinary skills of its owners, Willie and Jutta Kirrkamm. Rather, it is a matter of location. The Ceili is on a wild hillside, up a boreen - a small road - at Killadoon, on the coast of County Mayo in the west of Ireland. Willie and Jutta could have made life marginally more difficult for themselves by opening a takeaway on an iceberg or an oyster bar in the middle of the Sahara. 'The locals thought we were nuts when we started a cafe here a few years ago. Sometimes, we think they were right,' she says. To some, Jutta and Willie might appear slightly eccentric. Jutta is German with a distinct overlay of Irish. Willie was born in Germany of Irish parentage. Apart from the odd guttural, you would swear he was as Irish as the bog outside. The easiest way to the Ceili House would be to board a London/New York flight and, after about an hour, ask the pilot to drop you into the Atlantic, to be picked up by Willie in his boat. A more pedestrian route would be a flight to Knock, Mayo's international airport. You then drive two hours west, taking as a reference point the top of the Empire State building (distinctly visible from Ireland on a clear day). Just when you think you are going to encounter US immigration officials, you will see signs for the Ceili. Inside, you will sit next to a blazing fire or warm your toes beside the Modern Mistress - a Heath Robinson version of the Aga and a miracle of Victorian design. As the Ceili has no licence, you will then take a bottle of 1955 (wrapped carefully in your underwear) from your overnight bag, settle back and examine the menu. It might be fun to start with lamb dolmades or, in preparation for your onward journey to the Americas, some blinis. Or, perhaps, the locally-gathered wild oysters. The cock-a-leekie soup is recommended heartily, an excellent antidote to the Atlantic chill. Then you can move effortlessly, and rather dreamily, on to the Pheasant Foggy Dew or the Venison Chieftain or perhaps the Salmon and Silver Hake Granuaille. Granuaille (pronounced Gran-ya-wail-ah) was once the queen of the pirates in these parts: old men will tell you of a mighty slanging match between her and Elizabeth I. 'Sure, didn't I hear it myself?' they will say. Jutta and Willie are both gifted musicians and you suspect it would not take too much encouragement to have them spring into action. They have other interests. Both are involved in local environmental issues. She runs a craft shop. He worked for years as a cook on the Irish fishing boats but has now set up a homeopathy practice in the area. On the cooking side, he does the main dishes, she the starters and side-splitting desserts. Home-made halva served with 'tipsy figs' is as good a way to end as any. All food is produced organically. The Ceili started life as a cafe. Then, tourists visiting the nearby beaches  -some of the finest stretches of white sand in Europe and the setting of the famous horse race sequence in The Quiet Man film - hankered after more substantial fare. Jutta and Willie now do lunches and dinners year-round. They realise that they are just a little off the beaten track. 'Some people are afraid to come up the boreen for fear they would never see the real world again,' he says. One winter's night, an English honeymoon couple knocked on the door. 'They didn't seem to know whether they were in Dublin or Galway but they seemed to enjoy being lost.' Other visitors are more difficult. An American couple arrived, took considerable time examining the menu and then ordered one tea - with two cups. 'We really don't mind as long as people come and see what we have to offer,' says Jutta. 'One time, we had eight people for dinner and there was a power cut. We had only one torch. We'd be struggling to cook on the gas and someone would want it to go to the toilet outside. It took hours to get the meal ready. But, afterwards, people sent us letters saying, 'Thanks for the black-out.' You can go to the Ceili (Gaelic for a song and dance) in summer and, if the mists have not closed in, sample as spectacular view as you will find anywhere. Or, in winter you can feel the warmth of the fire and stare into the pitch blackness outside as you let the cock-a-leekie warm your insides. Either way, one of life's enduring experiences.

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARTISTS OFFER STUDENTS A BRUSH WITH CREATIVITY  </P> <P> The nation's largest privately funded effort to involve artists in public  schools has kicked into high gear in San Diego. More than 80 county artists  have been hired to stimulate children in the city district's 110 elementary  schools.  </P> <P> Through the $3.75-million largess of philanthropist Muriel Gluck, artists  already are teaching at schools from Torrey Pines to Paradise Hills, using a  variety of creative approaches for children -- designing murals, making masks,  sketching from observation and experience -- all while showing how art relates  to mathematics, problem solving, history and other disciplines.  </P> <P> And even as individual schools and faculties eagerly await their own  artists-in-residence, administrators are already thinking about how to sustain  the renewed interest in fine arts beyond the multi-year Gluck grant. Teachers  are being encouraged both to participate with students in the resident artists'  projects and to consider how they can continue an enhanced curriculum once the  artists are gone.  </P> <P> In addition, the schools program could heighten the visibility of many of the  hundreds of San Diego County artists who design and draw in relative obscurity  while supporting themselves through other full-time work. With almost $1  million in salaries being dispensed to artists -- an average of $16,800  annually for 20 hours of weekly work -- the grant provides some with their  first steady payments in their profession.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Director Envisions a 'Paris of the West'  </P> <P> "I want to keep all these artistic people in San Diego," vows Kay Wagner,  fine-arts education director for the San Diego Unified School District and who  oversees the Gluck Young At Art program. "I'd like to see San Diego become the  'Paris of the West,' and we can help through making these artists better known  in the community. . . . Art has the potential to change the world."  </P> <P> Already, several artists have garnered attention both for the school and  community where they have worked with major murals and sculptures intended to  boost neighborhood and student self-esteem as well as improve the aesthetics of  the physical plant, which at most schools are admittedly undistinguished.  </P> <P> "What amazes me is how well things have worked so far without my having set  down a lot of rules," Wagner said. "I've tried to have as few rules from the  top as possible, to instead let the schools and the artists decide together how  they want to proceed." Wagner's only stipulation is that she wants the artists  not to function merely as teachers but to serve as role models and build upon  the existing arts curriculum, however sparse in most schools.  </P> <P> "And I've been pleased at the willingness of schools to allow artists to come  in and share on that basis, because I guess I had the stereotype of schools as  not being flexible."  </P> <P> Wagner strongly backs the "studio" approach to arts instruction, which argues  that students learn best about art and its concepts by producing it. In  contrast, other educators, in particular the Getty Center for Education of the  Arts in Los Angeles, prefer the so-called discipline-based method of  instruction, which emphasizes art history, art criticism and the study of great  paintings.  </P> <P> While Wagner says there is room for both approaches, she and her artists  believe that students, particularly at the elementary level, need hands-on  experiences. Gluck reserved $1 million under her grant for the San Diego Museum  of Art, which includes museum visits and a special traveling art trailer that  tend more toward the discipline-based approach.  </P> <P> For the resident artists, each school is proving a different environment, but  the teachers at all sites have certain wish lists they hope the artists can  fulfill.  </P> <P> Artist Cindy Zimmerman said, "The schools want us to help improve skills of  (regular) teachers, give them logistical help in showing how to set up supplies  and deal with the mess of materials, and to show how art can build student  self-esteem, serve as a tool for social change, help with the human spirit, all  of that."  </P> <P> Along with colleague Darcy Alexander, Zimmerman visits all the schools to  explain the program and find out what teachers would like an artist to  emphasize.  </P> <P> "Of course, you can't expect artists to solve all the problems of the world,"  Zimmerman said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Deborah Felix has already shared her talent at four city schools, all of which  she said presented different challenges. Students at Vista Grande Elementary,  where many of the students have had some exposure to art through their parents,  worked with Felix on making large-scale quilts. At Jackson and Encanto  elementaries, both of which are heavily non-white, Felix carried out a variety  of projects in different areas of art.  </P> <P> "Of course, everywhere I try to show how art is part of my life and how it can  really be integrated into other things," Felix said. "We talk about what the  world would be like without art, how art can serve as a social message through  posters, how art is decorative at times, and functional at times. . . . I bring  in paintings, baskets, African art, things that the kids can touch since so  many have never touched any kind of art."  </P> <P> At Sherman Elementary near downtown, Pamela Kozminska is part of a contingent  working with students on ceramic tile designs that will then be molded into  chairs and benches for the campus. The students draw word pictures, designs and  games after envisioning how they would look as part of street furniture to sit  on or lean against.  </P> <P> "At first, we asked students if they would like to draw or write pictures to go  on the (ceramic) wall," Kozminska said. "The natural drawers volunteered right  away, and with others we had to ask them several times, or encourage them to go  beyond simple geometric shapes to something more personal, and some got real  personal."  </P> <P> Like many of her colleagues, Kozminska wants the concept of art considered in  the broadest strokes possible.  </P> <P> "I stress the holistic aspect to art, that pattern is math, that jokes and puns  and writing can be part of word games or a picture image, that art connects  with environmental issues like clean water, which they are going to deal with  as adults."  </P> <P> For the most part, the artists have found teachers more than willing to partake  of their lessons as well.  </P> <P> David Beck Brown, a sculptor who specializes in public art, said most artists  stress the need for teachers to participate with their students. Felix compiled  all of her lesson plans from Encanto into a booklet for the teachers to use.  </P> <P> "The artist-in-residence is here not only to give art experience to the student  but the teacher as well," said Carson Elementary Principal John Sullivan, who  hopes for a "dynamite art show" for parents and students in November as a  result of student projects with the school's artist.  </P> <P> "We're going to videotape all the lessons," Sullivan said. "Our teachers get  some art training in their teacher preparation, but they have nine other  subjects a day to teach. And let's face it, art has been put on the back burner  for a long time."  </P> <P> Teachers at Zamorano Elementary, the 4-year-old arts magnet school in South Bay  Terrace, say resident artists can be helpful even to those like themselves who  have some specialized art training.  </P> <P> "They share with us a lot and they are not set apart," Tony Dowling said. "In  most ways, they become part of the faculty, . . . and no matter your expertise,  the resident artists take some of the pressure off. And no matter how much  background you have in art, you still can learn new things."  </P> <P> Added Dowling's colleague, Pamela Stahlak: "Even someone with no experience and  great fear of teaching art" can pick up basic skills from watching a half-dozen  demonstrations by an artist.  </P> <P> "As teachers, we're all in this business to learn as well as provide for our  students," she said.  </P> <P> Assistant schools Supt. Catherine Hopper, aware that the Gluck donation will  not last forever, wants schools to begin thinking now of ways to continue a  strengthened program long after the resident artists leave. The district's  restructuring reforms, which allow individual schools to create their own  curriculums and methodologies -- within limits -- provide that opportunity,  Hopper said.  </P> <P> "An individual school can set up its own priorities if it believes art is  important," Hopper said. "They can teach classes in different sizes and  clusters."  </P> <P> Already, one or two teachers at certain schools have agreed to become art  specialists, taking students from two or more classes several times a week for  art instruction.  </P> <P> "All the answers aren't going to be addressed with more and more money," Hopper  said. "The positive feedback so far from the resident-artists program has to be  channeled or otherwise things will eventually die."  </P></p>

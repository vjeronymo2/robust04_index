			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- At regular meetings  today, the two major political forces, the Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS), discussed their stances on the motion of no  confidence in the government and the debates on the 1994 draft  national budget.    "The government will not fall before passing this year's  national budget," Socialist MP Rosen Khubenov told a scheduled  news briefing. In the course of the discussion on the  forthcoming vote of no confidence, the Socialists expressed  different views, but democratically arrived at the common view  in support of the government. "Constructive criticism" -- in  this way the Socialists describe their attitude to the 1994  draft national budget. They have serious remarks and  suggestions to amend the text as well as fears the budget is  unrealistic, and will urge the Council of Ministers to table a  bill on a Chamber of Accounts and take firm measures to collect  budgeted revenues.    SDS leaders would not tell the press what the coalition  would  do, if the SDS-sponsored motion of no confidence in the  government of non-partisan economist Lyuben Berov passes.  SDS-affiliated parties want SDS MP's to leave parliament, but  the leaders of the coalition have not yet taken a formal stand.  "You can't expect us to announce in public our cherished  plans," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, who today at noon came back  from the United States, told the press.    According to the SDS, this country is seeing a growing  recommunization. SDS officials quoted the personnel changes in  the Ministry of Industry, the changes in preparation at the  Committee of Tourism and changes in liquidation councils  (implementing the land reform). "What is happening at the  Committee on Tourism has been inspired by narrow mafia  interests. This government is subordinate to mafia groups and  the Communist Party," said Dimitrov. He thinks mafia groupings  are struggling with each other in Bulgaria and the government is  made to serve them all.    The personnel problem is national, according to the BSP.  According to Socialist MP Krasimir Premyanov, many of the people  appointed by SDS are incompetent and use power to gain personal  benefits, while skilled socialist party public servants have  been fired for political reasons and forced to earn a living by  taking low-skilled jobs.</p>

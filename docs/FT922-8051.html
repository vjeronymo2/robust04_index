			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Spain's inflationary pressures ease SPAIN'S cost of living index rose just 0.2 per cent in April marking the first slowdown in inflationary pressure this year, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Year-on-year inflation fell from 6.9 per cent to 6.5 per cent - the start, according to the finance ministry, of a gradual approach to its inflation estimate for the year of 5.8 per cent. That would still be a rise on the 5.5 per cent recorded in 1991 but there have been sharp VAT increases in the first quarter of this year.  Despite the good April figures, however, underlying inflation (which excludes energy and processed food prices) is still high at 6.8 per cent.</p>

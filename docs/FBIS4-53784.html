			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Chairman Kim Tae-chung of  the Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Region has dismissed  as "totally groundless" domestic reports that, in an interview  with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, he said North Korea's possession of  two or three nuclear weapons would pose no problem.    In a statement released through the foundation here Thursday  [19 May], Kim expressed regret at the incorrect reporting on his  interview with the U.S. newspaper and asked South Koreans not to  misunderstand him.    "I have persistently said North Korea's nuclear ambitions  must be completely done away with in tens of lectures, meetings  and interviews that I have had since my arrival in the United  States, " he said.    THE WASHINGTON TIMES' story contained none of his remarks'  true meaning, he stressed.    On his comments regarding a visit to the United States by  North Korean President Kim Il-song, he said he had never  proposed that President Bill Clinton invite Kim to visit  Washington. "But I have said that I strongly believe Kim's  participation in a U.N. General Assembly session as the head of  state of a member nation would have the positive effect of  solving the North Korean nuclear issue, promoting inter-Korean  cooperation and easing tension on the Korean peninsula," he  added.    Free discussion of various topics related to national  unification will help the government forge a unification policy  on the basis of a national consensus, he said, noting that all  programs derived from such a policy must be carried out solely  by the government.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DELAWARE;  </P> <P> NONE HURT AS CRUISE SHIP RUNS AGROUND  </P> <P> A luxury liner with 1,360 people aboard lost power and ran aground on a sand  bar 22 miles north of Cape May in the Delaware Bay separating Delaware and New  Jersey.  </P> <P> Nobody was in danger, the Coast Guard reported, and passengers on the 642-foot  Regent Star said they were enjoying free cocktails. A small electrical fire in  a switchboard apparently caused the power failure on what was to be the last  day of a seven-day trip from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Philadelphia. The Coast  Guard said initial attempts to free the ship with tugboats failed, and another  attempt would have to wait until high tide around midnight.  </P></p>

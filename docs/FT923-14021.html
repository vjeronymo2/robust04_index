			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (11): All quiet, for now - Prospects for bids and takeovers DUBLIN'S BUSINESS community is a cosy, informal fraternity, where an outsider can quickly be on first-name terms with the locals, and where his own business can equally as quickly become the knowledge of all. Corporate deals will often be decided over a pint and a handshake, with boardroom formalities conducted merely for the purposes of satisfying corporate legal departments. When a hostile takeover bid breaks the smooth surface of this tranquil dealing pond, however, it immediately provokes a stir of reaction and speculation. A small Irish engineering company, Barlo, last month staged a successful all-paper takeover bid for IRG, another Irish engineering concern. In itself, the takeover was of minor importance, creating a combined group with an annual turnover of IPounds 70m and a market capitalisation of some IPounds 50m. But it has prompted speculation as to whether this is the long-awaited start of a consolidation of the Irish corporate sector. Mr Tom Healey, general manager of the Irish stock exchange, says: 'Over two-thirds of the dealings are in just the top 10 stocks.' This has resulted in the smaller companies finding it difficult to raise new funds on the stock market in order to grow - 'the magic figure for market capitalisation is around IPounds 100m. It is at this point the institutions take an interest.' Mr Brian O'Loughlin, the investment strategy director of Irish Life, one of Ireland's big four institutional investors, believes the economy and the market would be better off with more medium-sized companies benefiting from strong management and good growth prospects. At the end of last year, only 13 of the 77 currently quoted stocks on the Dublin Stock exchange fell into the IPounds 50-60m capitalisation category. Without institutional interest in their shares, smaller companies face serious restraints on their growth; brokers have been trying to impress upon their managements the need for merger or acquisition. There are doubts whether the Barlo/IRG takeover will lead to a trend. According to Mr O'Loughlin: 'Economic convergence in Europe puts pressure on people to be more efficient and to think about alliances, but I don't think there will be a major spate of activity.' He believes the larger Irish companies prefer to look abroad, to reduce their exposure to the Irish market, while UK and European companies will have little interest in picking off the minnows. The expanding larger companies are more likely to be the subject of foreign takeover bids. The profitable and rapidly growing food companies, which have generated strong cashflows and good marketing outlets, have been identified as possible targets. So have the big financial groups, Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life, as well as some of the building societies. Any European bank or insurance company looking for market share in Ireland might consider them tempting. Of the Irish financials, Bank of Ireland appears the most vulnerable. But Mr Des Doran, the investment manager in Ireland for Standard Life, believes that the government would attempt to block a foreign takeover of one of the large financial institutions. According to Dublin's Business and Finance magazine, French companies have spent more than IPounds 600m buying into Irish businesses over the past five years. This began with Pernod's IPounds 285m takeover of Irish Distillers in 1988. Market sentiment at present is that no large takeovers or mergers are in the immediate offing, but that a rationale for consolidation exists which will push players in that direction, with Irish companies becoming both predators and prey.</p>

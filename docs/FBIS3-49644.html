			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Joze Skok asked Boris Sovic, state secretary for  energy, to comment on the statement by Jakov Sinovcic, Croatian  duty officer at the Krsko power plant.    [Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Sovic, what will Slovenia do  if Croatia takes 50 percent of the electricity produced in the  Krsko power plant for its own network?    [Sovic] The mutual agreement that has been applied for some  time, which governs the operation and exchange of power between  the Croatian and Slovene electrical power systems, envisages  that the so-called schedule is coordinated, and that  coordination of the schedules is in fact the basis of  cooperation of the two networks. In the case of the Croatian  side failing to respect the Slovene quota of electricity, that  is, if the schedule proposed by the Slovene side is violated, it  is envisaged that, in the case of minor differences of up to  20-30 megawatts, it could be corrected within the system, but if  the differences go over this limit, then the Croatian side will  be warned that there is a violation of the schedule, of the  available quantity.    So far, international practice has shown that, in such  cases,  solutions have always been found, that a joint agreement has  been found. If this does not happen in this case, it would be a  precedent that will present the behavior of an energetic system  in an unusual light.    [Skok] The Krsko power plant should resume work today after  1500. In order to operate fully, it would need some four days.  What would that mean regarding the dispatch of electricity to  neighboring Croatia?    [Sovic] The fact is that the Croatian Electricity Board has  not reduced, and even less settled, the debt to the Krsko power  plant. However, one should tell the public that the reports we  have heard to the effect that these are debts from before 1991  are not true. The nuclear power plant says that what are  involved are debts that were incurred from June to November  1993, that is, last year. The report for December will be  presented soon. So far, the Croatian side has not denied this.    If the Croatian side uses the electricity, that is, if the  schedule is not respected and a disproportion occurs in the  system, decisions will be made accordingly. [end recording]</p>

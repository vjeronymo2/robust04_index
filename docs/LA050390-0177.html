			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA MAKES NEW BID TO END CRISIS;  </P> <P> SECESSION: THE PRESIDENT OFFERS TO SUSPEND SOME MEASURES. LATVIA'S PARLIAMENT  IS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENCE.  </P> <P> Lithuania, bitten hard by Soviet sanctions that forced rationing of some  foodstuffs beginning this week, made a new bid Wednesday to end the crisis  through negotiations, calling on Western countries to serve as its  intermediaries with the Kremlin.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lithuania's neighboring republic, Latvia, prepared for a  parliamentary session that is expected to lead to a vote also proclaiming a  restoration of the independence snuffed out when Josef Stalin forcibly took  over the Baltic lands half a century ago.  </P> <P> Lawmakers in the third Baltic republic, Estonia, have already voted for the  eventual restoration of sovereignty. So Latvia's declaration, expected Friday,  will confront Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with an entire region of  about 9 million people legislatively on record as wanting to leave the Soviet  Union -- and the worry that pro-independence sentiment will snowball elsewhere  in this increasingly restive country.  </P> <P> The prime minister of breakaway Lithuania's government, Kazimiera Prunskiene,  will call at the White House today for talks with President Bush. Bush last  week decided not to impose sanctions for now to punish the Soviets for the way  they have treated Lithuania since the republic's legislature voted March 11 to  secede.  </P> <P> The Lithuanians have been dismayed and angered by the reluctance of Bush and  other Western leaders to bolster them against Soviet pressure and intimidation  to withdraw that declaration. But on Wednesday, President Vytautas Landsbergis,  in a letter to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois  Mitterrand, called on Western democracies to inform the Kremlin that Lithuania  is ready to consider a "temporary suspension of the effects of decisions taken  by the Parliament . . . which could bother Soviet authorities."  </P> <P> "Everything is negotiable save a questioning of the restored independence of  the Lithuanian state on March 11, 1990," said the letter, made public by the  republic's information service.  </P> <P> Landsbergis was responding to a proposal from Kohl and Mitterrand that  Lithuania suspend laws it passed to implement its independence declaration, in  return for which the Kremlin presumably would agree to ease an economic embargo  it imposed last month.  </P> <P> Soviet authorities had reacted favorably to the Kohl-Mitterrand proposal, but  it was unclear whether Landsbergis' offer to place a moratorium on the new  laws' operation would satisfy Gorbachev. The Soviet president has denounced the  independence move as illegal and wants the independence proclamation itself  frozen or suspended. The phrasing of Landsbergis' letter apparently did not  include that possibility.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, food rationing went into effect in the republic of 3.8 million  people, limiting the amount of sugar, noodles, margarine and some other  foodstuffs that consumers can buy. Oil and gas deliveries from the Soviet  Union, upon which Lithuania is totally dependent, also have been cut by the  central government.  </P> <P> Prunskiene, who was visiting Canada with a delegation to try to drum up trade  before flying to the United States, said Tuesday in Toronto that she will ask  Bush to try to persuade Gorbachev to end the economic blockade of her homeland.  The superpower leaders are to hold a summit meeting in Washington beginning May  30.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in the Baltic port of Riga, the stage was being set for a bitter  parliamentary battle over the re-establishment of Latvian independence. Many  there are fearful that the action will draw the Kremlin's ire, as the  Lithuanian secession vote did.  </P> <P> "The example of Lithuania is plainly visible," Viktors Alksnis, a Latvian  lawmaker in the Supreme Soviet, the Moscow-based national legislature, told an  anti-independence rally in the Latvian capital this week. "They made a decision  in haste, and suddenly now it becomes clear that the cost of independence is $1  billion a year for oil."  </P> <P> However, Sarmite Elerte, a spokeswoman for the pro-secession Latvian People's  Front, said the independence proclamation that has been drafted, unlike  Lithuania's, mandates a "transitional period" before complete local control is  established or even claimed.  </P> <P> "We all realize there is a difference between announcing independence and  realizing it."  </P> <P> That, and the fact Latvian leaders have already held talks with Gorbachev and  Soviet officials about their goals and intent, are reasons they believe there  will be no explosion of Moscow's fury.  </P> <P> The Latvian legislature is also supposed to vote on sending aid to Lithuania,  but even People's Front leaders, whose candidates dominate the body, are  uncertain that they can have their way on that. Deputies from the grass-roots  group are a few seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass such major  legislation as the independence declaration.  </P> <P> Although Latvian People's Front officials say they have lined up support from  seven or eight other deputies -- enough, they say, to pass the laws -- they  cannot guarantee it.  </P> <P> "Sometimes someone will say they will vote for something, but whether he does  it or not is another question," Elerte said.  </P> <P> Latvia's Parliament opens today, but it is not likely to tackle the  independence issue before Friday. The initial hours of the session are expected  to be taken up with choosing a credentials commission and secretariat, and  election of the republic's president.  </P> <P> Gorbachev wants independence-minded republics to secede by following steps  mandated by a recently passed law that requires approval of two-thirds of the  voters in the republic. The Latvians, however, like their Baltic neighbors, say  they are not governed by those procedures, since their homelands were annexed  by Moscow and never voluntarily joined the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In Latvia, however, demographics are a further reason for the Latvians to  insist on other procedures. Latvia is the most heavily Russified of the Baltic  republics, and ethnic Latvians barely form a majority of the 2.7 million  inhabitants, with Russians counting for at least a third. So it is highly  questionable whether pro-independence forces could muster a two-thirds majority  at the polls.  </P> <P> However, an unlikely source recently reported that independence seems to be  backed by many non-Latvians. A survey in Latvia of about 25,000 residents found  that 92% of the Latvians and 45% of the non-Latvians support the break, the  Soviet newspaper Izvestia revealed last week.  </P> <P> "It's likely (that) many of the Russians and other ethnic groups who live here  have come to believe that no change is likely and no improvement in their  living standard possible as long as Latvia remains part of the Soviet Union,"  Elerte said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN HAS SCAR TISSUE  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan has developed scar tissue, or adhesions, in his  intestine, which his physicians believe resulted from his 1985 colon cancer  surgery, a spokesman for Reagan said.  </P> <P> The spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Friday that tests at St. John's Hospital in  Santa Monica, including a CAT scan and blood tests, had "revealed no evidence  of cancer or any other disease" and that "neither surgery nor hospitalization  is contemplated at this time."  </P> <P> "Such adhesions are not uncommon and are not dangerous and the president's  physicians consider him to be in otherwise excellent health," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the 79-year-old former President has been advised to "limit his  traveling for the next several weeks," Weinberg said, adding that the Reagan's  planned trip to Europe next month "will be postponed."  </P> <P> Adhesions -- bands of scar tissue that binds two surfaces that are normally  separated -- frequently develop after surgery as part of the normal healing  process. But they are only a problem when they are severe enough to cause  kinking or obstruction of the intestine.  </P> <P> Symptoms of severe adhesions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or  constipation. In such cases, surgery is usually required to cut the scar tissue  and free the loops.  </P> <P> "Everyone I see with adhesions usually has some symptoms and is hospitalized,"  said Dr. Steven Stain, a general surgeon at USC Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Stain, who is not treating Reagan, said he "may have a partial intermittent  obstruction of his intestine that causes him minimum symptoms."  </P> <P> Weinberg said Reagan's physicians were "monitoring and evaluating his condition  consistent with standard medical procedures," including a check-up conducted  Friday.  </P> <P> He would not say whether Reagan was receiving any specific therapy for the  adhesions. He also said he had no information about whether the adhesions were  diagnosed in response to specific symptoms.  </P></p>

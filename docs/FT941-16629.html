			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How to beat the fuel tax With less than three months before value added tax is imposed on fuel, electricity companies appear to have realised the cash-flow benefits of letting customers pay in advance, so avoiding VAT. Several regional companies are sending out information on the tax dodge with their quarterly accounts, and some have printed forms for customers who want to pay a lump sum in March to cover bills a year or two ahead. British Gas is not encouraging pre-payment but will accept it. VAT will be charged at 8 per cent on domestic fuel bills - now zero rated - from April 1 and 17.5 per cent from the same date next year. But advance payments avoid the tax. The savings from paying in advance outweigh the interest lost by taking your money out of the building society at present interest rates. Maurice Fitzpatrick, a VAT specialist at accountant Chantrey Vellacott, estimates the return on paying in advance for two year's worth of fuel at about 10 per cent, compared with perhaps 3 per cent net from an average building society account. Higher-rate taxpayers could do even better than those on the basic rate, as their net returns from money on deposit are even lower. It is probably worth paying in advance if: You have money sitting on deposit at standard interest rates which you are not likely to need for anything else. You do not intend to move house in the near future. You use mainly gas and/or electricity. If your electricity company has not made special arrangements, you will need to attach an explanatory letter to the cheque for your over-payment, to make sure it is dealt with as you intend. If you are not intending to pay in advance, but receive an estimated gas or electricity bill this quarter which is lower than your actual meter reading, make a point of sending back the reply card and asking for your bill to be adjusted. This way, you do not end up paying VAT on fuel actually consumed before April. The benefits to users of solid fuels are rather less clear-cut than for those of gas and electricity. Paying for two year's worth of heating oil before April would indeed avoid VAT - but few households have oil tanks large enough to cope with two year's supply. So, they would be paying for goods not yet delivered. If you paid for a large amount in advance, but had taken delivery of perhaps only a third when the supply company collapsed, you would be left as an unsecured creditor, with little chance of recovering much of your money. Large privatised utilities stand less chance of going bust in the space of two years than small suppliers. 'It is all very well putting a deposit with a blue chip plc, but perhaps not so good putting a deposit with a local fuel oil company,' says Fitzpatrick. 'I think one would have to exercise considerable caution.' There is, however, every reason to refill your oil tank by the end of March rather than waiting for the autumn as you might do normally.</p>

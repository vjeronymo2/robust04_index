			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the Middle East  peace talks, noting that Syria has always taken the lead in  efforts to promote peace in the region. It has done its utmost  to nurture the peace process and ensure the implementation of  the relevant international legitimacy resolutions in a manner  that would guarantee the restoration of all Arab territories and  rights to their rightful owners.    The paper adds: The ball is now in the Israeli court. For  the future of the peace process, as well as the future of  security and stability in the region hinge upon the moves the  Rabin government might make. Hence, this government must  declare its clear and open commitment to the bases and terms of  reference enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions to  help achieve a true and durable peace.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: But, if Israel resorts to its old  well-known tactics, then the international community must  shoulder its responsibilities and perform its role of curbing  Israeli belligerence and removing all the difficulties  obstructing the peace talks. This is essential if this  community really wants this region to enjoy security and peace.    The newspaper TISHRIN affirms Syria's commitment to the  requirements of achieving just and comprehensive peace, arguing  that partial settlements and separate deals will neither achieve  peace, nor ensure security, as the course of events has shown,  particularly in the aftermath of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho  accord. As a matter of fact, they have only exacerbated the  regional situation and derailed the peace process, the paper  notes.    TISHRIN adds: Syria has explained its positions, which  advocate the attainment of just and comprehensive peace, with  all clarity during the Geneva summit. Consequently, it has  affirmed that the party that is promoting comprehensive peace is  the very party that is eager to see the region enjoy stability,  the party that is committed to the components of comprehensive  peace. As for the U.S. peace initiative, which is grounded in  the principle of trading land for peace; the relevant UN  Security Council resolutions; and the concept of comprehensive,  just, durable, and true peace, they should not be looked at as  useless instruments. As a matter of fact, these instruments  reflect concrete positions that should shape the peace to be  achieved. Syria has underscored all this when it upheld the  concept of full withdrawal in return for full peace, and spelled  out its objectives, as explained in the document it submitted to  the Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington  bilateral talks. This document has continued until this moment  to constitute a true and objective basis for just and  comprehensive peace.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: Syria, which is  eager to achieve peace and working to attain it, has reiterated  that just and comprehensive peace is its strategic option.  Hence, it has become extremely necessary and important for the  peace process to achieve its objectives. It has become  extremely necessary for it to make positive and constructive  progress, which is contingent, first and foremost, upon Israeli  acceptance of complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories, Israeli commitment to the implementation of the  relevant international legitimacy resolutions, and Israeli  subscription to the principle of trading land for peace.</p>

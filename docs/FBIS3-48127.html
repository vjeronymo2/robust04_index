The officials said top party executives and the party's central  executive committee met and agreed that the SDP will continue to  support a package of four government-proposed bills, which fell  through in the House of Councillors on Friday.    The LDP bills allow corporations to give donations to  individual politicians, while the government bills ban such  donations and allow only corporate donations to political  parties.    On Friday, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa hinted  at accepting the LDP package as a compromise to enact political  reform before the current extraordinary session of the Diet  expires January 29. But the SDP strongly opposes easing  proposed controls on political funding.    The SDP also decided to severely punish the 17 SDP  legislators who voted against the package in defiance of the  party leadership, and did not exclude the possibility that the  legislators may be expelled from the party. It also recommended  that Yutaka Shitoma, one of the rebels and the head of the  party's election committee, give up his seat on the central  executive committee, the officials said.    The House of Councillors dismissed the government package  with 130 to 118 votes mainly due to the unexpectedly high number  of SDP dissidents which substantially outnumbered the five LDP  members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. SDP  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at the central executive  committee session, acknowledged the SDP's responsibility for the  defeat of the reform bills and said, "We firmly support the  coalition government, and want to live up to our  responsibilities by tackling the remaining problems."    Many political sources have expected the party leadership to  resign sooner or later because of failure to unite its members  behind the government bills.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcan blames glut for losses Alcan Aluminium, one of the world's biggest aluminium producers, blamed the world aluminium glut for a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 36m, or 17 cents a share, including a rationalisation charge of USDollars 25m. This compared with a Dollars 56m loss equal to 29 cents a share in the 1992 quarter, including Dollars 49m of special charges. Revenues in the latest quarter were Dollars 1.8bn, down slightly. Alcan's loss for all 1993 was Dollars 104m, or 54 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 112m, or 60 cents. Special charges were Dollars 37m against Dollars 58m. Revenues were down slightly at Dollars 7.23bn. Mr Jacques Bougie, president, blamed massive CIS exports for creating the overcapacity crisis. LME spot ingot prices touched a new low (after inflation) of 46 US cents per pound in December. The price has since risen to 54.5 US cents yesterday on hopes of an international agreement on global production cutbacks. Alcan last week decided to close temporarily another 156,000 tonnes of ingot capacity in north America, Brazil and Britain. Fabricated product volumes hit new highs in the fourth quarter and 1993, but prices fell through the year. Ingot shipments were lower in the fourth quarter but higher for the year, but prices weakened. But Alcan's operating results benefited from cost reductions and lower interest costs. The year-to-year losses were reduced in Canada, Latin America and the Pacific area, but were higher in the US, Europe and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling's dark side Yesterday's producer prices were always likely to attract attention as a first indication of the extent to which New Year price adjustments reflected sterling's devaluation. On that basis the news is both good and bad. Manufacturers' input prices rose 1.5 per cent over the month. Thanks to falling unit labour costs as well as slack demand, the increase in output prices was confined to 0.8 per cent. That is still a relatively large increase, however, which implies a degree of inflationary pressure in the economy. It would certainly be reasonable to expect that companies will move quickly to rebuild their margins once demand resurfaces. For the time being, though, the pressures are unlikely to deter the government from cutting interest rates again. All of which makes it perplexing that the equity market should fall by 39 points on a day when sterling was also weak. Recent experience suggests the prospect of weak sterling and lower interest rates is a recipe for higher share prices. Perhaps investors felt it was time for some profit-taking, especially since rights issue fears remain. Perhaps the market is also watching political developments. Talk of cutting welfare spending is a reminder that Mr Major must deliver the occasional sop to the right as well as the left wing of the party. That could mean eventual action to head off a protracted fall in sterling. A weak currency will cease to be a blessing for shares the moment it becomes politically unacceptable.</p>

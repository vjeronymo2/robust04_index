			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Sport: Breakfast with a champion - Golf GARY Player was face down on the floor of his hotel room. He had one hand resting in the small of his back while the other supported him as he did one-arm press ups. His mouth was no more than an inch or two from the carpet as he talked. 'When you do a one-arm press up you have got to have your belly button and your nose on the ground at the same time.' Up and down went the figure on the floor as if it was the easiest exercise in the world. 'You must keep your back straight otherwise it does not do you any good.' Then Player sprang to his feet, a blob of colour in his cheeks betraying the exertions. He will be 57 tomorrow but he looked ten years younger. He sat on the edge of his bed and peered critically at the breakfast that had just been brought to his room. He did not like what he saw. 'Did I ask for butter and white toast? I was sure I wanted wholewheat toast. And cornflakes and sliced banana.' He sighed. 'At least they did not bring me coffee.' Food is a fetish with Player, not the quantity but the quality. 'Many people eat so much junk food they might as well poison themselves,' he said. 'I avoid animal fats, bacon, sausages, ice cream. I eat meat once every three weeks. Same with butter. If I do not stay fit I cannot play golf. I have a beer every two months and a whisky every three months. I drink herbal teas. At 50 I vowed I would start to lose weight, not put it on. And I have done that. I weighed 165lbs in 1965 and 150lbs last year.' On his visit to London his face was tanned from a brief stay at a coastal resort in South Africa. His black hair, with its high parting, was neatly combed. He looked dated, like a 1950s film star. His dark brown eyes were clear, his hands as leathery as a worn saddle. Player was on his way to the US for a long tilt at the US Senior tour, which has proved such an attraction for so many golfers once they pass their 50th birthday. Player, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus once formed the Big Three in golf and Player was by no means overshadowed by the Americans. He is one of only four men to have won the US Masters, US Open, US PGA and the Open titles at least once. In all, he has won nine major titles. Somehow, though, the overriding image of him is of a small, determined man who has had to fight for everything. Player has such a positive view about life he could almost be Norman Vincent Peale reincarnated. Nothing is ever wrong in Player's world. There is some merit in everything. Every golf course he has ever played on has something good about it. He once said that the flagsticks on a certain course were the finest he had ever seen. Aphorisms and homilies and plain old wives' talk all tumble from Player's mouth. In crises he quotes Psalm 23 to himself, particularly the section about walking through the valley of the shadow of death. He reads and rereads the Book of Proverbs. 'There is no gain without pain' is one of his favourite sayings. 'If you don't stay fit you can't perform' is another. 'Don't write me off' has practically become his battle cry. 'Golf is a friend-making machine,' he says. 'It's funny isn't it that the harder I practise, the luckier I get.' If this suggests a man who sees his life as a series of challenges that he has to overcome, then that is not far from the truth. Indeed he admits as much. 'When I go to the first tee I am getting into the ring,' he has said. 'I am climbing through the ropes. There is no difference between me and a champion boxer.' Player has been travelling for 33 years and estimates he has covered 8m miles. He has won nearly 200 tournaments around the world. He has always been a driven man; he remains a driven man. 'I employ 150 staff worldwide. That is quite a pay cheque for a little old country boy,' he says. He has a design company building courses around the world, owns farms in South Africa and has horses in training. A company of his makes golf clubs bearing the legend 'The Black Knight'. Much of the success or otherwise of these ventures rested on the shoulders of this man in a blue blazer and flannels sitting in an hotel room near London airport. 'When I first started travelling we had 32 pieces of luggage, an English nurse and we needed three taxis to get us all around.' He smiled and stood up. His breakfast lay untouched. One suitcase and a big bag of clubs stood near the door. Another aeroplane was waiting. Another journey was about to begin.</p>

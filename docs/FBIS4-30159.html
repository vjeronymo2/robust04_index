			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign news media  reported news of the visit to the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.    Showing a scene of the great leader President Kim Il-song  talking with Carter, Swedish TV June 16 stressed it is only  President Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people,  who could have a decisive influence in solving the crisis  created on the Korean peninsula surrounding the nuclear issue.    President Kim Il-song expressed optimism about the prospect  of solving the crisis surrounding the Korean peninsula, the TV  reported.    On the same day, Norwegian TV said only President Kim  Il-song  could indicate the way of solving the present crisis of the  Korean peninsula.    The Italian paper LA STAMPA spotlighted a picture the great  leader had taken with Carter and said a heated atmosphere  between Pyongyang and Washington was removed after President Kim  Il-song received Carter for hours.    Noting that Carter described his Pyongyang visit as a  fruitful visit which brought about an important progress, the  paper said this was a good news for the United States when the  U.S. plan of "sanctions" against North Korea virtually touched  off strong reaction in the United Nations and Washington was in  a difficult position.    XINHUA News Agency June 18 quoted Carter as telling  President  Kim Il-song that the United States has stopped its activity for  "sanctions" against the DPRK.    The Danish Central Radio June 17 said Carter visited North  Korea with a mission of solving the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula.    Carter told that the United States would begin a new  negotiation with North Korea and was ready to openly declare the  non-use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, the radio said.    The Chinese PEOPLE'S DAILY June 20 quoted Carter as saying  at  a press conference in Seoul on June 18 that establishment of  diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea  will be useful in promoting understanding and exchange between  the two countries.    Carter said if talks are held, they should shift from  "sanctions" to the third-round talks and stop urging "sanctions"  at the UN Security Council from this point of view, the U.S.  Radio Voice of America reported June 20.    The radio also quoted Gallucci as saying he hopes the U.S.  Administration will continue following the content of talks  between Carter and President Kim Il-song at this point.    The Japanese NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN June 18 said the Clinton  administration began to move toward full resumption of the  U.S.-DPRK dialogue after President Kim Il-song received former  President Carter twice.    The United States manifested its stance actually not to call  in question the past "nuclear development issue" of North Korea  but solve the issue between the two countries, excluding the  International Atomic Energy Agency, the paper wrote.    It can be said that the U.S. Administration took the hand  held out by President Kim Il-song in the last moment without  delay, added the paper.</p>

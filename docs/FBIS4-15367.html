			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Chairman of the board of the scandalous Rahva Haal  newspaper Veiko Jurisson told ETA that starting Friday [8  April], the present editor-in-chief of Estonian News Agency  Peeter Tali will fulfill the responsibilities of the acting  editor-in-chief of the paper.    Tali will continue working at ETA as a consultant. As an  acting editor-in-chief of Rahva Haal he has all authorities to  put together the new staff of Rahva Haal, Jurisson said.    Peeter Tali (29) has graduated from Tartu University  department of journalism and has worked for the Edasi\Postimees  daily and as an editor-in-chief of ETA since last summer.    Scandal over the second biggest Estonian daily Rahva Haal  started already in May last year when Estonian Privatization  Agency decided to privatize the state-owned newspaper, the  results of which were disputed at court and the privatization of  the daily stopped.    In October last year the board of the daily was changed with  majority given to representatives of the government coalition.  On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the statutes  of the company, abolishing the institution of editor-in-chief  and creating a new institution of publisher-in-chief. Majority  of the staff of the paper, in protest to the decision, resigned  and decided to join AS RH, formed by the Rahva Haal staff last  year to participate at the privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas  Leito was dismissed by the board "for loss of trust" and not  preserving "political balance" of the paper. Toomas Leito told  ETA that the decisions of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been  of "purely political" nature.    The former staff of Rahva Haal started to publish their own  paper Eesti Sunumid. Rahva Haal is published, at present, by RAS  Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS Hommikuleht, another Estonian  daily.    On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a  letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja, that  administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest  newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders"  (meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to  RAS Rahva Haal. Phones were cut off and the staff let into the  rooms only in twos to fetch their private things.    World Press Freedom Committee, which includes 36 leading  journalistic organisations on five continents, sent a letter to  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar on Thursday, saying that the  Committee was dismayed over Estonian government's "forcible  eviction" from their premises of the editor and staff of the  newspaper Rahva Haal.    "This attack on the journalistic independence of a newspaper  critical of your administration can only harm the hard won image  of the new Estonia as a working democracy," Ronald Koven, the  European representative of the Committee, stated on behalf of  the organization, adding that it is particularly distressing to  those who have seen Estonia as a "leading exponent of free  speech and press freedom in East and Central Europe".    The notion of "political balance" invoked to attempt to  justify governmental dismissal of the editor, cutting off the  newspaper's telephone lines and threats to prosecute the editor,  all violate the principles of press freedom, the letter stresses.    The committee urges Estonian Prime Minister to refrain from  placing further obstacles in the way of the staff's publication  of their newspaper (i.e. Eesti Sunumid) and to proceed with  speedy privatization of the paper without attempting to maintain  control indirectly. "The steps taken so far plainly demonstrate  the threat to a free press of state ownership," the letter says,  adding that Estonia's democratic credentials are threatened by  these actions against the press.</p>

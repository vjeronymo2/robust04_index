			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES TO BAN WOOD SHINGLE ROOFS  </P> <P> The City Council on Wednesday tentatively banned new wood shingle roofs  citywide, putting Los Angeles on target to become the first major city in the  nation to outlaw the popular roofing material.  </P> <P> The action came on a 12-1 vote, virtually ensuring passage when the measure  comes up for final approval next week.  </P> <P> The vote, bolstered by fire officials' warnings that even treated wood roofs  can greatly increase fire losses, was a stunning blow to the wood shingle  industry, which claims that the Los Angeles area provides at least 75% of its  $50 million in annual sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobs Could Be Lost  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau, a trade organization  representing 250 manufacturers of the roofing products, said hundreds of  workers -- primarily in the states of Washington and Oregon and the Western  provinces of Canada -- could lose their jobs and multimillion dollar plants  constructed to satisfy the demand of Los Angeles home builders for specially  treated wood shingles could be closed.  </P> <P> Michael Westfall, president of the trade organization, said his group will urge  Mayor Tom Bradley to veto the measure, which he called "unwarranted and  discriminatory." If that fails, he said, the group will sue.  </P> <P> Westfall said he feared a "spirit of one-upmanships" would spread through  California, causing other city and county governments to follow suit. San  Clemente is currently the only city in California with a ban on wood roofs.  </P> <P> The vote, the most dramatic in the 30 years of debate over the safety of wood  roofs, was a showdown between the Fire Department and the industry. It came  three days after a blaze in the unincorporated Puente Hills area. Of the 35  buildings destroyed or damaged in the fire, Los Angeles County Fire Department  officials said, 13 had wood shingles, 9 had composition roofing material, 9 had  metal roofs, 4 had tile or slate.  </P> <P> If the Los Angeles ordinance becomes law, wood shingle roofs would be banned in  all new home construction. Wood materials would also be banned in roof  replacements and repairs affecting more than 10% of the roof's area. Existing  wood roofs would not otherwise be affected.  </P> <P> Fire Department officials have long maintained that wood shake and shingle  roofs -- even if treated with fire retardant material -- are extremely  dangerous since they are prone to catch fire from falling sparks and to throw  off embers. Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Davis Parsons said 931  Los Angeles homes have been damaged or destroyed in fires that involved wood  shingle roofs of all kinds since 1961 when the damaging Bel-Air fire awakened  fire officials to the danger of wood roofs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Require Treatment  </P> <P> The city has for several years required that wood roofs be treated with  fire-retardant chemicals, but Councilman Hal Bernson had proposed that they be  banned altogether in the city's so-called mountain fire zones. Two weeks ago,  Councilman Marvin Braude, long a proponent of banning wood roofs, surprised the  industry by amending Bernson's motion to include the entire city.  </P> <P> The industry called on the Canadian Consulate to help in its lobbying effort,  and the trade group hosted a special test in an effort to demonstrate for city  officials how safe their materials are.  </P> <P> Council members expressed sympathy for the plight of the industry and bemoaned  the economic hardship the ordinance might cause, but the Fire Department was  ultimately able to persuade the council that it knows what is best for Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Although wood shingle roofs have been popular in Los Angeles since their  introduction in the 1950s (roughly 30% of all homes in Los Angeles have such  roofs, industry officials estimate), the Fire Department has long blamed them  for boosting the damage toll of periodic brush fires.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bel-Air Fire  </P> <P> Los Angeles first banned untreated wood shingle materials in high fire-risk  areas in 1961 after the Bel-Air fire. In 1982, after the Mandeville Canyon  fire, the city required use citywide of fire-retardant-treated cedar shingles.  </P> <P> Those materials have a fairly good track record, with only one fire nationwide  believed to have been spread by such materials. But city fire officials  maintain that they still have not been properly tested. For the unincorporated  areas, county supervisors are considering extending the requirement that wood  roofs in hillside areas be treated with fire retardants.  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a former builder, cast the only "no" vote, calling  the ban "unnecessary." But, he said, it "scares the life out of you" to see how  many homes have wooden roofs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEATTLE MARINERS READY TO GET TO WORK, TURN THINGS AROUND  </P> <P> The Mariners open their spring training camp today in Arizona for players in  the area, with the official opening set for Tuesday now that the players'  lockout has ended.  </P> <P> Team spokesman Dave Aust said the first formal workouts with all players on  hand would be held after equipment is hauled by truck to Tempe, Ariz., probably  Wednesday or Thursday.  </P> <P> The lockout ended Sunday with agreement between major league owners and the  players' union.  </P> <P> "Now we can get down to the business of playing baseball," said Mariners  President Woody Woodward.  </P> <P> "We understand a lot of adjustments to the normal routines have to be made, but  we have no doubt that our ballclub will be ready to go whenever everybody else  is."  </P> <P> "It's been a long wait, and I think this is like lifting some huge weight off  all of us," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "Now we can get to work."  </P> <P> Before the settlement was announced, new club owner Jeff Smulyan said he feared  an extended stalemate would hamper his group's efforts to turn around a team  that never has had a winning season.  </P> <P> "Other towns, other teams have tradition, histories of success. There is a good  chance their fans will forgive and forget," he said. "In Seattle, we are in a  building situation.  </P> <P> "We have been trying to turn things around, to build a winner and tradition. We  can do this, but this is no way to start."  </P></p>

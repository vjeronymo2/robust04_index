			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MCRAE'S MISS PROVED TO BE BIG HIT  </P> <P> Cleveland High Coach Marc Paez says with a very straight face that the play  "set the tone for the game."  </P> <P> Tone? If this were music, the tone would be an off-the-scale Z-flat, a definite  "clang." If it were color, the tone would be something between metallic gray  and smog-bound brown.  </P> <P> In terms of the ebb and flow of basketball, however, Paez says that the word  means establishing presence with authority.  </P> <P> In this case, the coach insists that Bobby McRae definitely wrote a tome on  tone.  </P> <P> The scene: A showdown with highly regarded Antelope Valley in a semifinal game  of the Hart tournament. Antelope Valley had been installed as the  pre-tournament favorite by many.  </P> <P> The set-up: Cleveland center Trenton Cornelius swats the opening tip to McRae,  who gathers the ball and makes a power move to the hoop.  </P> <P> McRae, who last week was selected the most valuable player of the Hart  tournament, attempts to dunk the ball a scant two or three seconds into the  game.  </P> <P> The result: The ball hits the iron harder than a steroid-chomping weightlifter  and ricochets into the lights.  </P> <P> McRae might have learned a lesson about the gravity of gravity, but he showed  Antelope Valley that Cleveland meant business. The Cavaliers dashed past  Antelope Valley, 26-9, in the first quarter en route to a 92-46 win.  </P> <P> How lopsided was it? Antelope Valley Coach Skip Adams said that his team had  been "embarrassed" by the Cavaliers.  </P> <P> "He missed the dunk," Paez said of McRae, "but he established that we were  going to play our game."  </P> <P> McRae didn't miss much of anything else in the tournament, leading Cleveland to  the title by scoring a team-high 15 points in a 71-61 victory over stubborn  Hart in the final.  </P> <P> However, McRae said that after averaging a steady-but-unspectacular 14 points  over four tournament games, he found his selection as MVP a little surprising.  He expected the honor to go to one of Cleveland's many flashy, ubiquitous  guards.  </P> <P> "I think I did it as much with my defense and rebounding," said McRae, who  averaged 11 rebounds in the tournament. "My scoring was pretty average, but I  rebounded good."  </P> <P> Good, for McRae, is when he's bad. Or more accurately, when he's mad.  </P> <P> Last year, former Coach Bob Braswell likened McRae's on-the-floor countenance  to that of former NBA enforcer Maurice Lucas, whose legendary scowl could melt  an opponent's shoelaces.  </P> <P> "That's because I always look mad," McRae said with a grin. "He said that my  game face reminded him of (Lucas), that I never smiled."  </P> <P> Things have been a little more cheerful this season for McRae, a two-year  starter and three-year letterman.  </P> <P> As a sophomore, McRae spent most of the season on the bench in what he termed a  "watch-and-learn season."  </P> <P> The primary object of his court-side vision, as often as not, was Cal-bound  power forward Rich Branham.  </P> <P> Last season, McRae learned just as much starting alongside front-liners Lucious  Harris (Cal State Long Beach) and Warren Harrell (New Mexico State). Hardly bad  role models.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, he improved by osmosis, if nothing else. In his first two  years on the team, McRae's main contribution offensively was an occasional  15-foot jump shot from near the free-throw line.  </P> <P> As a senior, he has scored most of his points inside, ripping down offensive  rebounds and knocking in the put-back.  </P> <P> "I'm hitting the boards harder, trailing on the break, helping out however I  can," said McRae, 6-foot-5, 185 pounds. "I want to be more in the offense this  year."  </P> <P> Paez found that McRae's presence is worth more than a few points. McRae was  absent for much of the summer-league schedule after suffering a broken right  wrist -- just as Paez was taking over for Braswell.  </P> <P> "When he came back," Paez said, "there was an immediate upswing in the  confidence of the other players."  </P> <P> McRae's emergence has sparked an about-face in the team's overall performance  too. Cleveland struggled to a 1-3 start but has bounced back to win nine of 10.  </P> <P> "He does so many things that aren't in the score book," Paez said. "His  defense, rebounding, his intensity and leadership . . . He leads both by  example and by exhorting his teammates."  </P> <P> And the coach isn't talking about the proverbial, rah-rah stuff. Sometimes,  exhortation can take the form of a missed dunk.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, he said everything we wanted to say on that one  play," Paez said. "Who cares if he missed?"  </P></p>

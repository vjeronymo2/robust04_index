The fifth round of talks, which took  place on Tuesday [22 February], ended the negotiations," Iwo  Byczewski, deputy foreign affairs minister of the Polish  Republic, and his Lithuanian counterpart Vladislavas Domarkas  announced on 22 February.    Both parties reached a compromise on the controversial issue  concerning the evaluation of past Polish-Lithuanian relations.  According to the negotiators, the treaty will not include any  dates or references to historic figures. The problem, of  course, was about the so-called rebellion of General Zeligowski  and the invasion of Vilnius, which the Lithuanians wanted  condemned during the negotiations which lasted more than 12  months. Poland firmly rejected these demands and argued that  the evaluation of the past should be left to historians. It was  eventually decided that a few general sentences concerning the  past would be written in the preamble to the treaty.    Characterizing the wording of the preamble, Deputy Minister  Byczewski said that it was stated there that "both nations had  easier and more difficult times in their history. The point is  that good conclusions be drawn from this bad past for a good  future."    Lithuania is currently the only neighboring country with  which Poland has not signed a treaty. "The treaty, which was  agreed to yesterday, might be signed as soon as March, during  President Lech Walesa's visit to Vilnius," say the Lithuanians.  The visit of the president to Lithuania has recently been  discussed in the talks between Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski,  Walesa's envoy, and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.  However, the information on the visit has not yet been  confirmed by the President's Chancellery.</p>

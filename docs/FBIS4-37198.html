			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpt] Government elements have recently started  drafting a detailed offer for an interim arrangement with  Lebanon. The arrangement aims at attaining calm on the northern  border, pulling the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] out of the  security zone, and establishing security arrangements as a first  stage toward signing a peace arrangement and normalizing the  relations with Lebanon.    The offered arrangement will be based on the principles  Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has set for the negotiations with  Lebanon. Israel will demand that the military capability of  Hizballah and other rejectionist fronts operating against it  from Lebanon be disassembled; that the Lebanese Army be deployed  in south Lebanon; and that its ability to impose order be tested  over a period of six months, after which the IDF will withdraw  from Lebanese territory. Security and coordination arrangements  between the IDF and the Lebanese Army will also be introduced.  Israel will also demand that Lebanon make a commitment to  maintain the well-being of SLA [South Lebanese Army] men and  other Lebanese who collaborated with Israel.    The offer formalized at this time includes an outline of the  security arrangements that will prevail along the border and of  the apparatuses that will supervise the agreement. Apparently,  a UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] unit will remain in the  area. Senior Israeli officials have said that making an interim  agreement with Lebanon will only be possible if progress is made  in the negotiations with Syria. Lebanon has rejected an Israeli  offer to launch security talks at the level of army officers  because Syria was opposed.    Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the  United States and head of the delegation for talks with Syria,  arrived in Israel over the weekend for his daughter's wedding.  Last night he met with the prime minister and briefed him on  the progress of the talks with Syria.    Discreet negotiations were held over the past several weeks  between Rabinovich and the Syrian Ambassador in Washington Walid  al-Mu'allim. Dennis Ross, head of the U.S. peace team, mediated  by meeting each of the ambassadors separately. In the past,  Rabinovich and al-Mu'allim held a series of secret meeting, but  Israeli sources claim that they have not met for several weeks  and only held indirect talks through the Americans.    A member of the U.S. peace team last week told WASHINGTON  JEWISH WEEK that, despite the negative statements from Jerusalem  and Damascus, constant progress is being made in the secret  channel between them, and that it is possible that a joint  declaration of principles toward peace will be signed by the end  of this year.    Israeli officials confirmed the remarks, but said that the  talks make "positive but insufficient progress." Rabinovich and  al-Mu'allim are trying to bridge the gaps between the Israeli  and Syrian stands and prepare for a visit here by U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, but have not yet begun dealing with  a detailed draft of a declaration of principles. Israeli  sources said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has not allowed  al-Mu'allim to make much progress. According to them, the  progress on the Jordanian track made the Syrians very angry and,  over the past two weeks, they prevented progress. [passage  omitted]</p>

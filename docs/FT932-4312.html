			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Russia wants change in G7 aid RUSSIA would like to use part of its Dollars 43.4bn aid package from the Group of Seven industrialised countries to help cover some of its Dollars 6bn unpaid debts to western companies, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister, indicated yesterday. Speaking in Paris after the first meeting of the World Bank's consultative group of 21 aid donors to Russia, Mr Shokhin was not precise about his request for changes in the G7 aid package agreed in April and due to be endorsed at next month's Tokyo economic summit. But he said that Russia's inability to pay western companies was now leading to litigation, raising at the very least the problem for Moscow of how to pay legal fees. He acknowledged that 'the G7 tell us not to change the (aid) package'. But, he added, 'we feel that we need to be able to react' to developing problems. Mr Shokhin also said that Russia 'will not be able to use about Dollars 5bn of the Dollars 10bn it has been offered in bilateral credit, because it is on purely commercial terms'. If Moscow were to take up the entire Dollars 43bn in aid and credit this year, it would add Dollars 3.5bn to the country's debt servicing next year, he said. He said Russia hoped to receive the first Dollars 1.5bn, half of its special loan from the International Monetary Fund, by the end of this month. He suggested that much of the second Dollars 1.5bn instalment might be used to finance trade between Russia and its ex-Soviet partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, the World Bank chairman of the consultative group, said that Mr Shokhin had strengthened donors' confidence in the Moscow authorities' determination to proceed with reform, fight inflation and curb money growth, and that the World Bank now planned to disburse its Dollars 4bn portion of the G7 package in 12 projects over the next 15 months.</p>

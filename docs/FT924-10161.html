			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Leasehold reform under pressure THE GOVERNMENT is under intense pressure to improve landlords' rights by amending its legislation giving private-sector tenants the right to buy the properties in which they live. The measure returns to the Commons for debate tomorrow and while few believe there is any chance of the leasehold reforms being dropped altogether, several Tory MPs are supporting landlords' efforts to narrow the criteria by which tenants acquire the right to purchase their properties. They are also determined to raise the level of compensation paid to owners to reflect more accurately the market value of the asset they are being forced to surrender. The controversy over the leasehold provisions in the Housing and Urban Development Bill first centred on the very notion that a Conservative government would consider undermining property rights. But in spite of fierce opposition from such groups as the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estates Holdings, many Tory MPs pushed successfully to have leasehold reform included in the party's general-election manifesto. Backed by a strong lobby of Tory-voting tenants - pre-dominantly in London and south-east England - they argued that it was unacceptable for council tenants to have a right to buy their homes while denying them to those living in properties leased from private owners. Under pressure from objectors, the government has shelved its commitment made in July last year to create a new 'commonhold' ownership category whereby groups of tenants would own a joint share of a building's common parts. Tory backbenchers are pressing for changes in the bill that would further restrict the numbers of tenants to whom the law would apply - thought to be about 750,000. One proposal is that the bill should be altered to ensure that only those who can establish that their leasehold property is their primary residence should be entitled to buy out their landlords. Another change sought by the landlords' lobby centres on the 'marriage value' derived from the combination of leaseholds with freeholds. Under the present provisions, that sum would be, in effect, divided equally by purchasing tenant and vendor landlord. Opponents say that as the landlord is being obliged to sell he should receive nothing less than the whole sum to compensate him fully for his loss.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TAPER'S 'VISIONS' MAKES CONNECTIONS;  </P> <P> THEATER: A STRONG START FOR THE FESTIVAL OF SO-CALLED ABSURDIST AND  QUASI-ABSURDIST PLAYS. THE WORKS SEEM FUNNIER, MORE ACCESSIBLE TODAY.  </P> <P> Are we ready for this? Thirteen plays from the '50s and '60s, undiluted,  unupdated, unmolested by self-important directors and relatively untampered  with?  </P> <P> This writer is. For one.  </P> <P> A look back is almost always an enhancement to looking ahead. It makes for  interesting connections. And Edward Parone, who conceived and produced "50/60  Vision," the festival of so-called absurdist and quasi-absurdist plays at the  Mark Taper Forum, has been picky about which ones to include (less picky about  which ones to exclude, but we can't have everything). The first three -- Harold  Pinter's "The Collection" and Samuel Beckett's "Play" and "Krapp's Last Tape"  -- kicked off the event at a press preview Tuesday, attended by an enthusiastic  but smallish audience. Why?  </P> <P> Is anyone out there intimidated by these plays? No need to be.  </P> <P> If anything, the passage of time has only magnified their large quotient of  humor, and changing theatrical conventions -- new then but familiar now, their  mold forever shattered by some of these very plays -- have made them  accessible. Starting with Beckett's 30-minute "Play." What comedy could be more  human than that of three people standing in their funerary urns, only their  talking heads exposed, endlessly regurgitating the important events in their  lives -- events that also happened to link them to one another and may have  provoked their deaths?  </P> <P> These dead persons, who may not know they're dead, were once in love or at  least in lust. The man (John Nesci) is eternally (and interchangeably) flanked  by his mistress and his wife (Teri Garr and Gloria Mann). They speak a mile a  minute and it's nearly impossible to follow what they say, except that they say  it three times and eventually you get it -- or the hang of it. It is about  nothing less ordinary than a garden variety menage a trois, with the usual  lies, deceptions, omissions and double-dealings. But it's amazing how funny  they look in perspective, let alone the perspective of the "other" side --  particularly when the man can't get rid of the final vestige of his fleshly  existence: a totally silly hiccup.  </P> <P> It's salvation humor, the laughter one chooses when one is well beyond tears.  As in Krapp's case.  </P> <P> The ruined old man at the center of "Krapp's Last Tape" is still trying to  figure out what hit him. Where did his youth, ambition, affirmation and energy  all go? We hear their former presence in the arrogant timbre of his voice  resurrected on the old spoooooools (a word he rolls around his mouth like  butterscotch candy) on his battered reel-to-reel, as he sits disheveled in his  disheveled room. (True, despite their decrepit condition, the recorder and  tapes sound very state-of-the-art, but let's leave it at dramatic license -- or  excusable trompe l'oreille.)  </P> <P>  Nesci plays Krapp as a booming King Lear, sneaking bananas and stealing nips  from a bottle he keeps under lock and key. In his solitary state, Krapp -- the  name is not an onomatopoeic accident -- is reduced to concealing his drinking  from himself. Tears would be an unthinkable alternative in such a state of  terminal self-derision. So Krapp opts for fierceness -- a railing legacy on his  "last" tape.  </P> <P> When it comes to Pinter, the interplay becomes more circumspect and more  weighted with earthly preoccupations.  </P> <P> In "The Collection," directed by Carey Perloff, we confront the instability of  truth. James (Christopher Allport) has reason to believe that his wife Stella  (Maria O'Brien) has fooled around with Bill (Michael Tulin), a young man who  lives with an older man named Harry (Alan Oppenheimer).  </P> <P> The pace is deliberate, the action pregnant with those notorious Pinter pauses,  the air fraught with confrontation and repressed violence, the language  laconic.  </P> <P> The humor? Implicit in re-experiencing a situation where everything is visible  and nothing is clear. Is Bill bisexual? Did he have an affair with Stella? Did  he not? Why is James so fascinated with Bill? How far will he push it? How far  will Harry let him push it? And what of Stella, about whom nobody seems to care  very much at all?  </P> <P> There are no answers. This is a theater that loves to ask questions, earthly  and not-so-earthly. It is not about sets (though Yael Pardess has provided  perfectly decent ones) or lights (Paulie Jenkins delivers the requisite ones)  or costumes (no one looks out of place in Julie Weiss' costumes).  </P> <P> And it is not about directors. Perloff, Michael Arabian (he staged "Krapp's  Last Tape") and Daniel O'Connor ("Play") are to be commended for the extent to  which they remain invisible. "50/60 Vision" is about writers. Ten more plays to  go.  </P> <P>  At 135 N. Grand Ave., April 13, 19, 25, 29, May 1 and 12 at 8 p.m. Matinees  March 31 and May 6 at 2:30 p.m. Ends May 12.

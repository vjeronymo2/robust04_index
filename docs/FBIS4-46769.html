			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "Once Again, One Less </F> Shakhray..."]    [Text] We may already compose proverbs about the  resignations of Sergey Shakhray. Something like: "May has  come--Shakhray has gone." This is because two years ago, also in  May, Sergey Mikhaylovich had already submitted his resignation  from the position of deputy chairman of the government.    At that time he left for the president's circle, to engage  in  the creation of the GPU [expansion not given], and returned to  the government only after a year-and-a-half and "through the  Caucasus," where he tried to smoothe over the sins of another  deputy chairman of the government, trying to somehow extinguish  the fire of the Osetin-Ingush conflict.    Sergey Mikhaylovich recalls that voluntary resignation  without any satisfaction. He says, "I demonstrated that I did  not have a death grip on the minister's portfolio. And what did  I have to gain? Only a sense of my own moral satisfaction from  the fact that I showed character." There is some logic in this:  When you answer for some serious matter, stop and think how your  personal ambitions will be reflected in this matter. But quite  recently, last December, Shakhray was once again deprived of the  post of deputy chairman of the government, and this time not  through his own will. (Chernomyrdin was ready to take him into  his renewed command only in the rank of minister), and Sergey  Mikhaylovich agreed, justifying his decision, among other  things, by his desire simply to remain on the political scene:  "If one expects a political future, one cannot absolutely  distance oneself from power."    Five more months went by--and again a resignation. Again a  voluntary one. "In connection with the appointment of a new  minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy even  without a formal consideration of the opinion of the deputy  chairman of the government who deals with national and regional  policy, I ask to be relieved of my duties as deputy chairman of  the Russian Federation Government."    So, think what you like about these politicians. He had just  achieved Chernomyrdin's recognition, gotten back the deputy  chairmanship, and was introduced into the Security Council. It  is true, they deprived him of the minister's portfolio, but  three other "deputies" also do not have one--Oleg Soskovets,  Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and Yuriy Yarov. Yet Nikolay Travkin, who  had just been brought into the government as who knows what,  agreed to the position of "minister without a portfolio."  Meanwhile, Shakhray retained relations with the mass media on  the government line (the dream of any politician--to be in  charge of the press!), interaction with public organizations and  parties (i.e., the full opportunity to strengthen his own PRES  [Party for Russian Unity and Accord] at state expense), and also  no one removed Sergey Mikhaylovich from treatment of questions  of national and regional policy.    "When they dismissed me from the deputy chairmanship, I  stayed on to work because I had in my hands a ministry which is  becoming a real instrument for implementation of regional and  national policy," explained Shakhray. "For the first time the  ministry had in its hands real levers--money--7.3 trillion  rubles (R) for food to be brought into the rayons of the Far  North, R40 billion for aid to Germans in Russia, R20 billion in  budget funds for the national-cultural rebirth of the peoples of  Russia..."    All of this was "hammered out" by Shakhray. And suddenly  this  was "all" given to someone else. And not just to anyone, but in  essence to his political rival--the head of administration of  Krasnodar Kray, Nikolay Yegorov, with whom Shakhray had long  "not formed relations." In such a situation, how can the deputy  chairman of government be in charge of a minister if the  minister occupies "an independent place in the structure of  state power" (that is the status that Shakhray was also  "hammering out"), and who must even replace his own curator in  the President's Council on Cadre Policy--a position defined at  Shakhray's request as being ministerial "in duty," but not  falling under the deputy chairman of government. In other words,  now there are no real levers for influencing events in the  country. It is true, there is a broad field of activity for  political intrigues. Vladimir Shumeyko, for example, had been in  such a situation and emerged from it with a large gain. And what  about Shakhray--did he become insulted?    "My resignation does not mean a departure to the opposition  of the president and the government," Shakhray explained to  journalists. "It also does not signify any personal insult,  although I am also a human being and react to the situation as  any normal person would."    Here we should note in parentheses that the PRES leader did  not coordinate his decision either with the party or with the  party's faction in the Duma. Even that Tuesday morning, Sergey  Stankevich announced to journalists that the faction's council  had decided to forbid Shakhray from leaving the government. At  the same time, Shakhray himself was already submitting his  resignation to the chairman of the government. Which, it seems,  did not make Chernomyrdin very happy. Although Viktor  Stepanovich had to know what Shakhray's replacement with Yegorov  in the ministerial post might mean. But...    "From a constitutional standpoint, the appointment and  dismissal of ministers is the prerogative of the president. He  can do so only at the written nomination of the chairman of  government. These formalities were upheld, but no more than  that," Sergey Mikhaylovich explained certain details of his  resignation from the ministerial post, clearly hinting that  Chernomyrdin "was not to blame." Then who was?    "I would like to hope that the appointment of a new minister  is not associated with my directive regarding a financial  investigation within the system of the former Goskomsever [State  Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North], just  as it is not associated with pressure by various groups in  Krasnodar Kray and their representatives in Moscow," Shakhray  stated in his supplemental announcement regarding the reasons  for his resignation. This phrase can also be called nothing  other than a hint. Especially its second part--about the "Moscow  representatives of Kuban," of which Vladimir Shumeyko is  deservedly considered the leader (and, we might add, a long-time  patron of Nikolay Yegorov). He has repeatedly announced that  Boris Yeltsin "consults on cadre questions" specifically with  him.    Then again, Sergey Mikhaylovich has a number of ill-wishers  also in the president's administration, which would itself like  to manage and direct the policy in relations with the regions.  Shakhray believes that the presidential administration's  management of work with the territories must move away from  petty patronage of the regions and concentrate on the  development of political decisions, but... Even the chief of  this administration, Nikolay Medvedev, who was recently removed  at the demand of the governors, has once again been appointed as  acting chief of this same administration. And the edict on  appointment of a new minister in Shakhray's place was approved  by Sergey Filatov, with whom Shakhray recently waged a stubborn  struggle over the conditions of agreement with Chechnya and over  who, Filatov or Shakhray, should head up the Russian delegation  at the negotiations.    "In principle I never became one of the president's own  men,"  Sergey Shakhray said almost two years ago, after that first  resignation. "They reconciled themselves with me, admitted that  sometimes I would give sound advice and propose fairly good  draft laws. But on a personal plane, I annoyed many..." We will  add to this that Sergey Mikhaylovich "annoyed," as a rule, not  so much his enemies as the people whom he should have considered  "his own," people from the presidential command, from the  governmental command. Even at the very beginning of his joint  work with Boris Yeltsin, when there was a full opportunity to  select the "lawful" Shakhray as first deputy chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of Russia, he did not get to become even  Yeltsin's deputy, "and not without the `help' of Yeltsin's  closest advisors" (Shakhray's own words).    Even later, working within the make-up of the Gaydar and  Chernomyrdin governments, he often saw (or felt?) what steps  were being taken by his supposed comrades in arms to move the  competitor away from the president or the chairman of  government. "It is not only the jealousy which exists in the  apparatus that is unpleasant. It is much more unpleasant to  encounter those methods which the apparatus is ready to use  under the influence of this jealousy...", admitted Shakhray. But  he did not go into detail, did not divulge the secrets of the  "kitchen." "I know everything--I will say nothing!", he once  waved reporters away at one of the press conferences.    Of course, politics has its secrets, and one who has "sold"  them will later be shunned both by his own and by others. Yet  one cannot help but ask: What is this "Kremlin kitchen," if  Shakhray, who even in the Caucasus was more or less able to get  along with the mutually hostile sides of the Osetin-Ingush  conflict, could not find even long-term partners in Moscow, in  the "circles close to the ruling circles."    It is true, he was not the only one. A recent study  conducted  by the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Sociology Institute  regarding the fates of the old nomenklatura in the current  echelons of power showed how the "old tried and true cadres" are  invariably returning to their circles, and how the new ones are  being forced out. Already today among those surrounding Yeltsin  there are only 10.5 percent of the people who came to power with  Yeltsin himself or during his time. Thirty-seven percent are  still holdovers from the Brezhnev era, and 39 percent--from  Gorbachev's. Even two years ago the picture was entirely  different. But today there is a definition about the "newcomers"  as being "democratic flies who have gotten bogged down in the  thick soup of autocratism." Although by a large account, even  among the "new flies" far from all are "democrats."    We might add that even quite recently the views of Sergey  Shakhray himself, with only a big stretch, could be called  "fully democratic." It is enough to remember at least the draft  law prepared by him in January of '92, "On Ensuring the Effect  of Russian Federation Legislation," with its specific  responsibility for actions contradicting the edicts of the  president and the interests of the Russian Federation. "Under  this law, if it were adopted now, one could today expand  whatever one liked, political and physical annihilation of the  opposition," the then-Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov said  in horror, and ultimately persuaded the president to recall this  draft law.    In Spring of that same year, Shakhray prepared an analytical  paper for the president, in which he proposed to Boris Yeltsin  that he announce the possible declaration of a state of  emergency in the country, although, it is true, in the most  extreme case. A year later these recommendations became the  basis for the famous OPUS [Osoboye Poryadok Upravleniya  Stranoy-play on word ~opus", meaning "work"]. And only now, it  seems, has Sergey Mikhaylovich's militancy declined, and his  desire to reach national and social reconciliation has increased.    Announcing his resignation, Shakhray advised the president  and the government to first of all "activate the Agreement on  Civic Accord so that it would not remain merely on paper, so  that the coordinating commission which is being created would  force everyone who signed this agreement to really work..."  Having listed several other points of the program of action  which the authorities should have implemented "even yesterday,"  Shakhray predicted that otherwise...    "...In July--the first wave of discontent in the defense  industry collectives and the demonstrations by part of the  military servicemen and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs].  The problem, it is true, will resolve itself thanks to vacations  and summer in general."    "But as of August the situation may go into the next phase,  under which Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to retire. Moreover,  he will himself have to announce his retirement so as to diffuse  the situation in society as a whole and in the State Duma in  particular. Efforts at coordinating the Duma of the new prime  minister--and there are only three real candidacies: Luzhkov,  Soskovets and Skokov--these efforts under conditions when the  Duma will be "revving up" in opposition to the president, will  lead to activization of the scenarios for disbanding the Duma  with an effort to announce new elections. Or more precisely, to  put off the elections altogether in view of the low activity of  the population."    "But suddenly it will turn out that the Duna does not intend  to disband itself. The Federation Council, upon change of the  role of the government and the relationship between the  government and the president, will go over to the president's  opposition. And the October-December scenario, when the radical  opposition will act under the principle of "the worse it is, the  better," raising up the people to a social riot, may repeat the  worst variant of October of last year..."    This is what Sergey Shakhray predicted, stipulating, it is  true, that this is the "blackest" of all possible scenarios,  that the president, government and parliament will not allow  such a thing. He personally remains an optimist and even intends  to go on his scheduled vacation.    Until August?</p>

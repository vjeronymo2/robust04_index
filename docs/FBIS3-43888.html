			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Republican Democratic Movement [MDR],  Liberal Party [PL], Social Democrat Party [PSD], and Christian  Democratic Party [PDC] political parties held a news conference  at Umubano Meridien Hotel in Kigali yesterday. The news  conference focused on the head of state's 15 January speech and  also gave suggestions on preparations for the swearing in  ceremony of members of parliament and members of the broad-based  transitional government.    In a press release, the political parties expressed  satisfaction with the president of the Republic's decision to  give a specific date for the swearing in of MP's and ministers.  They requested that the protocol of the ceremonies must be  agreed jointly between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] and that the UN secretary general's special  representative to Rwanda should be kept informed of it. The  rest of the communique is read to us by Landuald Ndasingwa,  first deputy chairman of the PL:    [Begin recording] The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political  parties  state that the program of the swearing-in ceremony must be  agreed between the Rwandan Government and the RPF and that the  UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda should be notified of it. The  president of the Republic, for his part, should not intervene in  the ceremonies. He should only intervene on a symbolic basis in  accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arusha peace  accord.    The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call once again  on the president of the Republic to stop interfering in the  selection of ministers of the broad-based transitional  government. In fact, this prerogative is that of the prime  minister designate in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph Two,  and Article 52 of the protocol on power-sharing. It is  therefore clear that the president of the Republic is not  empowered to approve or reject names of ministers submitted to  him by the prime minister for appointment after having selected  them in consultation with the relevant authorities.    On the establishment of the Transitional National Assembly,  the MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call on the  president of the Republic to respect scrupulously the principle  which he himself evoked in his 15 January message, and we quote  him: The peace accord does not empower a person or body to  remove from political bodies the prerogatives given to them by  the same accord, end of quote.    The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties hope that this  time the president of the Republic will respect the program of  the ceremony establishing the remaining transitional  institutions. [passage omitted]    The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties remind the  president of the Republic that from the date he was sworn in on  5 January, he is expected to respect the provisions of Articles  Four and 12 of the protocol on power-sharing which says that he  no longer has the capacity to make decisions outside the  broad-based transitional government and that the content of  messages he addresses to the nation must first be approved by  the Council of Ministers. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

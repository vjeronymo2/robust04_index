			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Haeco profits rise 21% to HKDollars 387m HONG KONG Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), a Swire Pacific group company which holds the monopoly on commercial aircraft maintenance and engineering in the colony, yesterday posted a 21 per cent rise in net profits for 1992 to HKDollars 387.9m (USDollars 50m), from HKDollars 320.6m in 1991. The profits were struck on a 16 per cent increase in turnover to HKDollars 2bn, from HKDollars 1.8bn. The company said there had been good use of its airframe maintenance facilities and increased activity in its overhaul division. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said the volume of work passing through Haeco was expected to be satisfactory during 1993. To maintain competitiveness, the company was focusing on improvements in productivity and a drive to improve quality, he said. These measures were expected to produce an acceptable result in 1993, despite high inflation in Hong Kong. Haeco is 51.85 per cent owned by Swire Pacific and 25.04 per cent owned by Cathay Pacific, the main customer for its services.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taking the heat out of diamond fever - The Australian Stock Exchange's new code for reporting discoveries Diamonds, always a girl's best friend, have in recent months also become a stock market speculator's dream. So much so that the Australian Stock Exchange has quietly adopted a new reporting code for diamond exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves. This has been devised by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee - a standard-setting body formed in the nickel boom days of the early-1970s and backed by the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists. The code, says the committee, represents the first time anyone has attempted to standardise the way in which diamond discoveries should be reported and ensure that investors are given a reasonable idea of the commercial significance of exploration results. The problem is simple: diamonds, by their nature, are easy to find, but discovering a large-scale, economically-viable diamond resource is another matter entirely. 'To the best of my knowledge, it's also the first time such a standard has been adopted by a stock exchange,' adds Mr Ray Schoer, director of operations at the ASX. The Australian exchange, however, may not be out on a limb for long: the JORC reports inquiries and requests for copies of the code from both the US and Canada, where a diamond rush has been under way for a couple of years. Laudable though the initiative may be, it comes not a moment too soon. Two recent incidents in Australia have demonstrated all-too-clearly the volatility which can surround diamond-related stocks. The first was Great Central Mines, a Melbourne-based exploration business whose shares jumped from around the ADollars 7 to as much as Dollars 19 last spring, capitalising the loss-making company at a staggering ADollars 1bn-plus. That performance was influenced by a discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the Greater Nabberu region of Western Australia, which GCM's chairman and managing director, Mr Joseph Gutnick, described as 'significant' but was judged uneconomic by the company's joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers, the South African mining house. Today the twinkle has faded. GCM's shares are back in the ADollars 9.50-Dollars 10 range, despite some institutional support in the wake of a rather more substantial gold discovery. The second instance of runaway diamond shares occured only last month, and concerned Cambridge Gulf Exploration, a stockmarket newcomer. Cambridge shares, which had been issued at 25 cents in July, surged above ADollars 4 in mid-December on news that the company had found diamonds in the Bonaparte Gulf, off Western Australia. When Cambridge released the details of this discovery - stemming from a small sample of sea-bed gravel - the ASX demanded more information about the sampling methods, the location of the discovery, and so on. Today, the shares are trading at about ADollars 2.20. But, while GCM and Cambridge have grabbed the headlines, one JORC member says that the lack of guidelines on diamond-related reporting was a much more fundamental problem. 'GCM and Cambridge were just a manifestations of the fact that diamonds were becoming hot news. But a dozen other companies, perfectly straightforward, were also unsure how to present their results'. In essence, the new code aims to ensure that anyone reporting diamond exploration results gives investors some clues as to the commercial significance of the find. It carries a cautionary note, for example, stating that diamond valuations 'have only been considered reliable on parcels of at least 2,000 carats of diamonds from a single deposit'. 'Valuations placed on a small number of diamonds from exploration samples become meaningless and are likely to be misleading,' it continues. The code goes on to require details of the professional valuation experience of anyone reporting on a parcel of diamonds; to set out sampling information required; to insist that reports of indicator minerals be prepared 'by a suitably qualified person; and formally to define 'microdiamonds' as those being less than 0.4mm in size and weighing less than 0.001 carats. 'By definition, pre-resource mineralisation must be considered to be mineralisation of significance,' states the code. 'The occurence of individual diamonds or microdiamonds in surficial desposits or from inadequately-sized samples from a primary or secondary rock source would not usually qualify as pre-resource mineralisation'. In short, while the outback may glitter, that, in itself, does not mean anything of substance. For all practical purposes, says Mr Schoer, the new strictures come into effect immediately. Existing listing rules demand that the market be kept informed. So, citing this broad requirement, the ASX will require exploration companies to meet the best practice levels set down in the code. Analysts are generally grateful. 'I think it will be a great help to investors,' says Mr David Kauler at Pru-Bache, for example. 'I think it is fair to say that there is a problem in industry reporting, especially with the junior explorers. This will go a long way to improving the quality of the results.'</p>

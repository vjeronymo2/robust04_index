			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>   [Text] Gerardo Gonzalez, president of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party, soon to be ruling party, has said that as  long as the lines followed by the party's Political Committee  and National Directorate remain unchanged, they will reject the  amendments being suggested to the Constitution.    In 1992, the PRD spearheaded the group that foiled the  government's hopes, and in particular the Christian Democratic  Party's hopes, of approving amendments to the Constitution that  included the elimination of the concept of an army and almost  100 other changes.    Gonzalez said that those amendments to the Constitution were  discussed months before the 1992 referendum and were rejected.  Now, the Executive Branch is introducing amendments similar to  those rejected in the referendum. "I personally reject what was  already rejected, by vote, by our people," Gonzalez said.    When asked if his rejection contradicts what President-elect  Ernesto Perez Balladares has said about these amendments,  Gonzalez said that Perez' words have been misinterpreted. "It  is one thing for the president-elect to say that he is  interested in seeing the Constitution adjusted to eliminate all  reference to the National Guard (Army) and create a law for the  National Police (thus solving the lack of protection experienced  by our people) and another to put something over on someone  [meter gato por liebre] leaving this country a colony," Gonzalez  added.    According to the PRD president, what is sought is to  eliminate from the Constitution the duties that the members of  the Public Force have and the duty of the Panamanian citizens to  defend their country, including the protection of the Canal as  well as our borders. Gonzalez explained that if an  international incident should occur along our borders, incidents  that could involve unconventional forces, the policemen would  not be obligated to take action because their duty is restricted  to maintaining public order. "The constitutional reform is clear  in stating that the police will have Dobermans [former Panama  Defense Force riot squad] to repress demonstrations and units to  capture thieves and investigate crimes, and that is it."    In light of a suggestion presented by Legislator Milton  Henriquez to form a Constituent Assembly that will completely  change the Constitution, Gonzalez said "those defeated Christian  Democrats are always setting little traps for the future,"  because a Constituent Assembly would solve nothing. Following  the idea of a Constituent Assembly, Gonzalez said that a  solution to the problem would be to give the next Legislative  Assembly a six-month period, or as long as it needs, to act as a  Constituent Assembly and make the necessary changes to the  Constitution, changes that all the political forces will have  agreed on.</p>

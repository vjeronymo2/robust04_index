			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ON THE PREP PATH: FOOTBALL PLAYOFF PAIRINGS WON'T PLEASE ALL COACHES ALL THE  TIME  </P> <P> In just four days, football coaches from around the county will make their  annual pilgrimage to the Southern Section office in Cerritos to learn their  fate. Palms will sweat, brows will furrow and teeth will gnash as they  nervously brace themselves for that dramatic moment when . . .  </P> <P>  Playoff pairings are announced!  </P> <P>  OK, maybe it doesn't match the anticipation of Rocky XXXIII. But playoff  possibilities are always intriguing.  </P> <P> Heading into the final weekend of the regular season, here's the Who's Who of  What's What:  </P> <P> Santa Margarita. Heading into Thursday's game against Warren, Santa Margarita,  which plays a freelance schedule, is 9-0. The Eagles' schedule was no fruit  cup, either. They beat Pasadena and Gahr, both Division II teams, and shut out  four other opponents.  </P> <P> The question: In which playoff division will Santa Margarita be placed?  </P> <P> Sure, the Eagles -- who advanced to the Division IX title game in 1989, their  first year of varsity play -- might have a better chance in some piddling  division such as VIII or IX. But they are capable of competing on much higher  levels.  </P> <P> Division VI is the natural -- four of the five leagues are from Orange County.  </P> <P> Interesting note for the money-monger set: Large-school divisions bring larger  gate receipts, so Santa Margarita could benefit financially from taking a big  leap to the top.  </P> <P> Of course, when you're a $26 million school such as nta Margarita, who's  worried about those kinds of details?  </P> <P> "As long as we get into the playoffs, we don't care," Athletic Director Rich  Schaaf said. "We just want to get in."  </P> <P> My guess: Santa Margarita will be placed in Division VI and make it to the  title game, where the team bus will be picketed by those opposed to parochial  schools playing in the same division as public schools.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa. Speaking of just getting in, Mustang Coach Tom Baldwin's team  already has clinched third place in the Pacific Coast League . . . but it's not  guaranteed a playoff spot.  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast is in Division VII, which has six leagues instead of the  usual five, and can guarantee berths only to the top two teams in each.  </P> <P> Unless Costa Mesa beats Trabuco Hills Thursday, the Mustangs will have to hope  for a wild-card berth.  </P> <P> My guess: Costa Mesa will win but will be denied a wild-card berth nonetheless.  Wanting revenge, Baldwin will wait for the Division VII title game, rent the  Goodyear blimp and pour 10 tons of melted marshmallow goo on the stadium during  halftime.  </P> <P> Buena Park. Buena Park? Yes, the long-time Freeway League cellar-dweller has  been resurrected into a playoff-bound team by Coach Marty Luczaj. The Coyotes,  led by running back Angel Barrios, play Thursday at Fullerton for the league's  No. 2 spot.  </P> <P> My guess: The (Wile E.) Coyotes will win and then, in a public relations move,  change their nickname to Roadrunners.  </P> <P> Mater Dei. The Monarchs must beat St. John Bosco Friday to be guaranteed a  playoff spot. If Mater Dei doesn't make it, the Derek Sparks debate -- Will he  stay or will he transfer? -- will be back in full swing.  </P> <P> My guess: Monarchs win, Sparks stays, Mater Dei administrators do the  boogie-woogie.  </P> <P> Valencia. A 23-21 loss to Brea-Olinda Friday stopped the Tigers' Orange League  winning streak at 17. If Brea beats Western this week, Valencia will fail to  win the league title for the first time since 1981.  </P> <P> My guess: Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo, famous for downplaying his team's  chances, will enroll in a joint Dale Carnegie-Dick Vitale seminar and, after  many hours of practice, learn to shout at his opponents, "We be better than  you, Baby!"  </P> <P> Santa Ana. At 2-3 going into their Sunset League final Thursday against  Westminster, the Saints are out of playoff contention, but a victory would be  Coach Dick Hill's 192nd. That would establish him as Orange County's winningest  football coach.  </P> <P> My guess: Hill gets the victory, the key to the city and a lifetime supply of  Raisin Bran -- his pregame cereal choice for the past few decades.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar. The Sea Kings have managed some impressive turnarounds -- in  1989, they entered the playoffs as a wild-card team and won the Division VI  title -- but with the loss of quarterback Todd Kehrli to a finger injury, the  odds are stacked higher than a complete collection of Elvis albums. Corona del  Mar has to beat University Thursday to advance as the Sea View League's No. 3  representative.  </P> <P> My guess: Elvis will return from the dead and sing a rap version of "Love Me  Tender" before Corona del Mar wins the Southern Section title this year.  </P> <P> Trivia question: Which four current Orange County high school coaches were  assistants under Dick Hill when he was at Santa Ana Valley in the 1960s and  '70s?  </P> <P> Santa Margarita is one of four undefeated county football teams; the others are  La Quinta, Esperanza and Tustin.  </P> <P> Their secrets?  </P> <P> At La Quinta, Coach Roger Takahashi -- one of the county's sharpest minds --  has a zinger list of plays that keeps the opponents guessing and Aztec fans  cheering.  </P> <P> Esperanza, traditionally known for its mammoth linemen, features a slightly  smaller, slightly quicker package that has proved even more effective.  </P> <P> And at Tustin, running back Ron Goods and fullback Visko Ancich make up one of  the best backfield tandems in the county. Goods, a top sprinter, makes cuts  like a skier in a giant slalom race, and Ancich plays human battering ram.  </P> <P> Which will go the farthest in the playoffs?  </P> <P> Tustin -- the run-and-ram team.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Mike Rush (Mission Viejo), Gary Meek (Esperanza), Tom Baldwin  (Costa Mesa) and Tom Meiss (Orange).  </P></p>

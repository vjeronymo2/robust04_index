			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: A lucky break - Off the Wall Here is some good news for the arts. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, which was conceived by the pools promoters in a last minute bid to ward off a national lottery, is to continue when the Lottery finally starts spouting money next year. The Foundation has turned into the proverbial Fairy Godmother. Thousands of arts organisations, from the low-liest amateur dramatic group, like Peterborough Opera, which has just received Pounds 3,096 to spice up productions this season, to English National Opera at the Coliseum, which was given Pounds 2.4m towards computerising its box office and buying its freehold, have benefitted since the Foundation got going in 1991. There was a fear that the pools promoters (basically Littlewoods) would wind up the Foundation when the Lottery began as a competitor for the gambling pennies of the nation, but now the pools' companies hope to continue to finance the Foundation, unless, against their best research estimates, they suffer the loss of 30 per cent or more of their revenue. When launched the Foundation expected to distribute Pounds 60m a year, Pounds 40m to sport (there cannot be a cricket club in the country that has been slow-minded enough not to apply for funds towards a new pavilion) and Pounds 20m to the arts. In fact it has done better than that. It gets its money from a reduction in government betting tax and a levy on pools turnover. This has exceeded expectation and the honey pot totalled Pounds 63.5m last year. Grattan Endicott, who runs the Foundation, expects to distribute almost Pounds 70m this year, with the arts receiving around Pounds 23m. The advent of the Lottery is bound to hit the Foundation's income, perhaps reducing its funding of the arts to nearer Pounds 15m a year, but it is already seeking a niche in the new situation. Endicott is talking to the Arts Council, which will handle the Lottery money earmarked for the arts, estimated between Pounds 70m and Pounds 200m a year, to map out areas of interest. It is likely that Lottery money will go towards the major projects  -a new dance house for London; an opera house for Manchester - while the Foundation concentrates on grass roots arts, organisations seeking Pounds 35,000 or less. In preparation for the switch the Foundation has stopped its breath-taking Pounds 500,000 hand outs, which brought joy to RADA, the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and Birmingham Rep, among others, and has fixed a top limit of Pounds 150,000. Since most pools punters, who finance the scheme, are not natural opera-goers Endicott thinks it fairer that the Pounds 1.3m cheque he receives each Thursday should be distributed around sports and arts activities likely to involve the greatest number of participants at local level. Perhaps the most traditionally English fair of the year is the World of Drawings and Watercolours, which closes at London's Park Lane Hotel on Sunday evening. This is was the occasion when, in times past, collectors from the shires invested their Lloyds Bonus in a new watercolour. That might be only a fond memory, but with interest rates so low, art lovers are once again preferring to turn spare capital into antiques and business for the 45 exhibitors is proving surprisingly brisk. It has been helped by a technical breakthrough, glass which keeps out ultra violet rays and prevents fading. This could transform the popularity of watercolours and drawings. The fact that many owners had to hide them away from sunlight often in folders, detracted from their appeal. Dealer John Spink has covered all his stock with Tru View, a glass developed in the US. He reckons that the glass is invisible, and makes watercolours as easy to keep as oils. It has enabled him to make sales to Spanish and Italian buyers whose Mediterannean sunshine was anathema to the art form. At a cost of around Pounds 120 for an average picture it is a modest investment for peace of mind. The most expensive picture on offer at the fair, a Turner watercolour of Conway Castle which Leger Galleries is offering for Pounds 400,000, is also covered by the new glass, this time a German version. It is a pity that the British, who pioneered the watercolour, should now depend on foreign breakthroughs for their continued popularity. The Tate Gallery's policy of switching around its stock each January a has done wonders for attendances. They have risen by over half a million, to 1.76m last year, since 1990. What has not changed is the popularity of the Tate's pictures as reflected in the sales of post cards at its shop. This beauty parade seems changeless. Last year the list was headed as always by that popular favourite, Millais' floating Ophelia, followed by Waterhouse's equally romantic and escapist Lady of Shalott.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GADFLY SUES CITY OFFICIALS OVER ARREST  </P> <P> Gadfly Stanley Wantuch has filed a lawsuit in Norwalk Superior Court against  Downey Councilman Robert G. Cormack and other city officials, accusing them of  false arrest, assault and battery and of depriving him of his First Amendment  rights.  </P> <P> Police dragged Wantuch out of the Downey City Council chamber and arrested him  last November after Cormack and other officials claimed he was disrupting a  council meeting. Wantuch had been ejected from a council meeting the month  before for videotaping from an aisle in violation of a city ordinance.  </P> <P> Last May, a Municipal Court jury found Wantuch innocent of disrupting the  council meetings and obstructing a police officer. The judge in the case  criticized Cormack for depriving Wantuch of his freedom to speak and called the  arrest unlawful and unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Wantuch said he suffered neck, shoulder and back injuries when he was removed.  </P> <P> The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. It also seeks an injunction to prohibit  armed, uniformed police officers from serving as sergeants-at-arms at the  council meetings -- the city's current practice. The lawsuit alleges that the  presence of an armed police officer inhibits free speech during council  meetings.  </P> <P> Downey City Atty. Peter Thorson could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

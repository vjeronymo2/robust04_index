			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Hanson power provokes concern HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is facing growing shareholder concern over its proposals to give its chairman, Lord Hanson, greater control over its annual general meetings. The proposals, which need the support of 75 per cent of investors, will be put to an extraordinary general meeting on June 25. Some of Hanson's biggest shareholders have raised the matter with the National Association of Pension Funds. Mr John Rogers, secretary of the association's investment committee said: 'A number of large institutional shareholders are concerned about the proposals and have raised the matter with Hanson.' The EGM was called to approve a scrip dividend plan which requires the modification of the company's articles of association. Lord Hanson, in a letter to shareholders, said: 'At the same time we are proposing to introduce a number of other alterations to the articles.' These are 'mainly designed to facilitate the orderly conduct of meetings' by giving the chairman of Hanson's AGM (which is always Lord Hanson) greater powers. Under the new articles, the chairman would be able to prevent shareholders speaking more than once on any item of business; prevent a member from speaking if it was 'prejudicing the orderly conduct' and reject any demand for polls which in his opinion is 'irrelevant, or vexatious to, or inconsistent with, the business of the meeting'. Shareholders would no longer be able to nominate directors unless supported by 10 per cent of the share capital. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'We are tidying up matters by helping improve the efficiency of our meetings.' Some of the proposed changes, such as the retirement by rotation and re-election of directors, are supported by shareholders, as is the scrip dividend plan. However, some big shareholders, including Postel, the UK's biggest pension fund, are seeking meetings with Hanson to discuss the proposed changes. Ms Anne Simpson, joint managing director of the Pension Investment Research Consultants, said: 'The spirit of Cadbury needs to be taken on board by extending shareholders rights not by restricting them.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Doubles Aid to South </F> Africa"]    [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands is normalizing its  relations with South Africa. Next year the country will get 30  million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last  year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization  process, education, "marginalized" youth and employment.    This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday  by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister  Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The  Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when  a new government has been formed on the basis of the  parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April.    The ministers' document covers political relations, economic  relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with  South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form  would depend above all on developments in the near future. They  have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up  with the country because the Netherlands "has historical and  cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good  contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight  against apartheid."    The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship  with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private  organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary  before the end of the year to consult the new South African  Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a  country in transition, and consequently will receive no  large-scale or long-term aid.    Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the  "South African economy, which in principle is very promising."  Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment  delegations and -- "when the time is ripe" -- more flexible  policies on export credit insurance.</p>

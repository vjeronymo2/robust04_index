			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Margolis: "Polluting Cars Escape in </F> Cloud of Confusion"]    [Text] With evidence growing that motor exhaust fumes are  behind Britain's asthma epidemic, it has emerged that not a  single car, bus or lorry owner has been prosecuted for having a  dirty exhaust since it became an offence eight years ago.    Under the Construction and Use Regulations a polluting car  owner can be fined up to &pound;1,000 and the owner of a bus or  lorry up to &pound;2,500.    Yet only one car driver is believed to have been stopped by  police for suspected pollution -- an Edinburgh man questioned  last year because of his black exhaust. He was charged, however,  only with having bald tyres and no insurance.    Although most people breathing in exhaust fumes feel that  polluters must be breaking the law, there is widespread  ignorance among experts about even the existence of legislation.    An Environment Department press spokeswoman emphatically  denied that it is possible to be fined for polluting. Even  Friends of the Earth believes drivers of the fume-belching cars  are untouchable.    Mr Doug Parr, the environment group's atmosphere and  transport campaigner, said he was "pretty sure" a polluting  motorist could not be prosecuted.    The recession has led to an estimated one in 10 drivers  skimping on car servicing, with buses increasingly spewing black  smoke. The link with asthma was highlighted in last week's BBC1  Panorama programme and a report from the  Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology.    Panorama said that the number of pre-school  children with asthma had risen tenfold in 30 years, and that the  Government was considering banning cars not fitted with a  catalytic converter during smog alerts such as the climatic  inversion over London in December 1991, when hospitals were  swamped by children suffering from asthma.    A prime reason for lack of prosecution of polluting drivers  is bureaucratic gridlock between interested government  departments. Only the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate can  stop and check polluting cars. Police traffic patrols do not  carry testing equipment, however, and the inspectorate has a  policy of not prosecuting.    Local authorities, led by Westminster City Council, are  lobbying for powers to stop and fine polluting motorists.    Sporadic roadside emission checks on buses, coaches and  lorries -- but not cars -- by the inspectorate have led to  around 600 lorry operators a year being warned and 500 bus  companies. Owners are given 10 days to adjust their engines.    Vehicle emission checks introduced to the MoT test in 1991  are not working, say some experts. A British chemist, Prof Don  Stedman, of Denver University, Colorado, who has studied road  pollution in Britain, says drivers with dirty exhausts have  learned how to cheat on the test.    Prof Stedman has tested exhausts in 12 countries and says  British cities are worse than congested places such as Seoul and  Hong Kong.    "We know from testing 100,000 cars in London, Leicester and  Edinburgh that half of the pollution comes from eight per cent  of cars."    He believes one badly adjusted petrol car can emit 40 times  as many pollutants as one clean engine.    Prof Stedman says only fines can persuade polluters to  adjust  their engines. In Los Angeles, a taxi firm with 75 polluting  cabs was fined $250,000 last April. Many other U.S. cities now  prosecute for polluting.</p>

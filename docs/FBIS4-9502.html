			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Radu Tudor and Daniel Capatos: "Yevgeniy </F> Primakov, Head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Visited  Bucharest Yesterday"]    [Text] At the invitation of Virgil Magureanu, SRI  [Romanian Intelligence Service] director, Yevgeniy Primakov,  chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service [SVR], made a  24-hour visit to Romania on 22 April 1994. The distinguished  Russian guest did not meet with President Ion Iliescu.    Primakov's visit again finds Magureanu again in a state that  has had precedence: The head of the Romanian  counterintelligence service holds discussions -- in an  unexplainable way -- not with his counterpart in the Russian  Federation but with the head of the Intelligence Service in  Moscow.    Among the issues discussed, one can note Russia's  involvement  in the conflict in Bosnia and its repercussions on Romania.  Other issues discussed by Primakov and Magureanu were  terrorism, drug smuggling, and a relative "nonaggression treaty"  between the SRI and the SVR.  <H5>  The Military Air and Naval Attache of the Russian Federation </H5> in Bucharest, Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, Declares That He Did Not  See Yevgeniy Primakov Yesterday    Confidential sources reported that on 22 April the lack of  Primakov-Talpes and Primakov-Iliescu meetings raised certain  already existing problems to the level of diplomatic  difficulties. Yevgeniy Primakov's visit was in response to the  visit recently paid by Virgil Magureanu to Moscow. Thus, it is  certain that as a result of this visit there will be more  evident disputes between Ion Iliescu and Virgil Magureanu.    Last night we contacted Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, air and  naval military attache of the Russian Federation to Bucharest,  who said that he personally had not seen the SVR chief yesterday  and that he represents the Russian defense minister and not  Moscow's civil intelligence service.    Yesterday, the only flight from Moscow that arrived at  Otopeni Airport was the regular Aeroflot flight, which landed at  0930 and then took off at 1150. No other special plane arrived  from Moscow yesterday.  <H5>  AFP Promptly Reports That For the First Time Since </H5> Ceausescu's Fall, a Head of the Russian Secret Services Visits  Romania.    Only two hours after the national news agency ROMPRES  announced that the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service  Yevgeniy Primakov paid a flash visit to Romania, AFP took the  piece of news and disseminated it together with its normal news  items.    The news item broadcast by AFP mentions that Yevgeniy  Primakov's visit was made at the invitation of SRI Director  Virgil Magureanu and that this is the first such visit since  Ceausescu's fall in December 1989.    "The talks focused on the issue of fighting terrorism and  organized crime" read the text of the official release, as is  usually the practice in case of such meetings.</p>

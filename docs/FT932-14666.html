			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wharfedale restructure hits Verity PROBLEMS AT Wharfedale Loudspeakers, which were more intransigent and deep rooted than earlier thought, were the main reason behind continuing pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.54m at Verity Group in the six months to December 31, against Pounds 1.71m. In addition the expected launch of the car alarm was delayed due to design and licensing problems. On turnover of Pounds 6.84m (Pounds 4.75m) the USM-quoted electronics products producer incurred operating losses 69 per cent higher at Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 597,000). The figures included a contribution from the Mission companies from their acquisition in October which contributed turnover of Pounds 3.13m. Net interest payable was Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 299,000) and there were exceptional charges of Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 809,000) relating to costs of reorganising Wharfedale. Further costs of Pounds 750,000 are expected in the second half. The figures are produced in accordance with FRS 3. Last year's reported interim pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.34m. On prospects Sir Gordon Brunton, chairman, said that the board was confident the problems at Wharfedale had been largely resolved and in the third quarter the core audio business was trading profitably at the operating level. Losses per share came out at 2.2p (7.7p).</p>

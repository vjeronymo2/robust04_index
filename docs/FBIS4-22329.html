			<p>Production   Decline   <F P=102> 944E0622A Moscow EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN in Russian No 11, Mar 94  p 1 </F>  <F P=103> 944E0622A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Report from data of the Russian Federation State Committee </F> on Statistics: "Industry: The Decline Continues"]    [Text] In January-February of this year, Russia's industry  yielded production output amounting to 34 trillion rubles [R] in  current prices, including about R18 trillion in the month of  February. Physical volume of production decreased by 23.6  percent as compared with January-February of last year,  including by 23.1 percent in January and by 24.1 percent in  February.    In January-February 1994, of 406 of the most important  production varieties taken into periodic-accounting  consideration, production volume increased over January-February  1993 levels for 37 entries and decreased for 362 entries.    Over the first two months of this year, 50.5 million tonnes  of oil, including gas condensate, were extracted--13 percent  less than the January-February 1993 level. Some 50.3 million  tonnes of coal were extracted (8 percent less) and 109 billion  cubic meters of gas (on the level of the first two months of  last year).    In ferrous metallurgy, the production lag in  January-February  1994 behind last year's levels were as follows: for output of  cast iron--20 percent, steel--26 percent, finished rolled  metal--22 percent, and steel pipe--48 percent.    In machine building over the January-February period of this  year, production output constituted 50 percent or less of the  level for the same period of last year for half the products  taken into account (metal-cutting machine tools, forging and  pressing machines, bulldozers, freight cars, tractors, trucks,  grain-harvesting combines, forage harvesters, and others).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry, the production  decline continued in February of this year for the majority of  the most important production varieties. In general over the  two-month period, output of synthetic ammonia decreased by 26  percent, sulfuric acid--by 30 percent, soda ash--by 53 percent,  mineral fertilizers--by 29 percent, chemical fibers and  filaments--by 49 percent, and motor vehicle tires--by 41  percent. A reduction of more than half was seen with respect to  the production of thermoplastic pipe and pipeline components,  fiberglass and fiberglass products; output of chemical plant  protection preparations was reduced by two-thirds. The  production of tires for agricultural machinery came to less than  a third of last year's level.    In January-February 1994, production of consumer goods  decreased 27 percent from the level of the same period last  year, including by 31 percent for nonfood products and by 17  percent for food products.    In light industry, the output of socks, hosiery, and knitted  articles decreased by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent,  woolen fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics--by 61 percent,  flax, hemp, and jute fabrics--by 45 percent. The production of  cotton fabrics increased 22 percent.    A significant reduction was seen in January-February of this  year as compared to the same period of last year in the  production output of most garments: overcoats and light  overcoats--by two-thirds, jackets, raincoats, suits, trousers,  and skirts--by almost half, shirts and dresses--by 22-28 percent.    The chief reason for the production decline remains  enterprises' lack of working capital and problems in production  output sales due to the high prices.    Diminished production volume was seen with respect to the  majority of cultural and domestic items over the first two  months of the year: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent,  washing machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent,  television sets--by 17 percent, porcelain, pottery, and majolica  dishware--by 22 percent.    In January-February of this year, the output of two- and  three-compartment refrigerators and freezers increased over the  level for the same period of last year.    The production volume of most food products was lower than  in  January-February of 1993: of meat--by 26 percent, whole milk  production--by 17 percent, butter--by 31 percent, flour--by 17  percent, cereals--by 34 percent.    Significant reductions over last year were seen with respect  to the output of macaroni products, lump sugar, starch, and  concentrated foods (by 37-50 percent), confectionery items and  baker's yeast (by 15-20 percent). Output of baked bread and  other bakery products was reduced by 13 percent.    Only half the production output of January-February 1993  levels was attained with respect to vodka and vodka-based  liquor, including 44 percent for February.    In February of this year, 4,300 enterprises in Russia had  lengthy production stoppages for all or certain varieties of  output. Work-time losses amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18  percent of the time-sheet resources of these enterprises  (analogous figures for February of last year: 2,400 enterprises,  6 million man-days, 8.6 percent of time-sheet resources).    Some 22 percent of the workers at enterprises where work was  discontinued were directed to take supplemental unpaid or  partially paid leave in February at the initiative of management.    Twenty-eight enterprises of the fuel industry conducted  strikes over the past month, resulting in a labor-time loss of  60,000 man-days.</p>

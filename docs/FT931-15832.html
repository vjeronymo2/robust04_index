			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Testing times ahead for Kenya observers: Michael Holman on doubts over Commonwealth group's judgment in the election IT IS not only the Kenyan government that will come under close scrutiny following disclosures about the country's electoral commission. Also under the spotlight will be the Commonwealth observers sent to monitor Kenya's first multi-party elections in 26 years. The 38-member group charged with assessing whether the poll was 'free and fair' now faces searching questions about judgment and performance. The scrutiny is prompted by the disclosure of a confidential file which casts doubt on the suitability of Mr Zachaeus Chesoni as the choice to head Kenya's electoral commission. The Commonwealth group chose not to make public its anxieties about the key post, while the preliminary report on the poll also makes clear their unease about other aspects of the election. The observers' concerns included the conduct of the registration process in many parts of the country; the nomination process, which saw 16 ruling party MPs unopposed; the intimidation, administrative obstacles and violence that marked the political campaign; the partisanship of state-owned radio and television; the reluctance of the government to separate itself from the ruling Kanu party; and the 'lack of transparency' on the part of the electoral commission. Failure to express a specific concern about Mr Chesoni has puzzled opposition politicians who have been campaigning for his dismissal. Mr Paul Muite, a lawyer and senior official in the FORD Kenya party, wrote in the July 13 issue of Society, a Nairobi weekly, that Mr Chesoni was 'totally unsuited' to the post. 'He has been twice removed from his position as a judge in the court of appeal and the High Court', for reasons that Mr Muite said had yet to be officially disclosed. Mr Muite also noted that 'before (Mr Chesoni's) appointment as the chairman of the electoral commission, there was a bankruptcy petition against him pending before the High Court.' It was alleged, the article continued, that Mr Chesoni 'owed close to Ks30m (Pounds 555,000) to the Kenya Commercial Bank'. Mr Muite asked whether the money was still unpaid and, if paid, how? Opposition leaders were not surprised that calls for Mr Chesoni to be replaced were ignored by the government. 'But what astonished us was that we got no backing from the Commonwealth secretariat or western governments,' said Mr Muite yesterday.' I have no doubt that Commonwealth officials were able to confirm our information with the British and US diplomats.' Spokesmen at the two missions said they were aware of the allegations but did not have proof. As the election process got under way, the electoral commission came under increasing criticism. Some of the most scathing comments came from Mr Hilary Ng'weno, editor of the Nairobi-based Weekly Review. 'According to the Commonwealth election observer team,' Mr Ng'weno wrote in an editorial on November 20, 'a lot of work has already been done by the commission in preparation for the elections. But you would not know it. The commission seems incapable of, or unwilling, to tell the public what is going on. 'It holds every bit of information as if it is secret information. It won't let opposition leaders view ballot boxes. Only after pressure does it release the names of people it has appointed as presiding officers. This is not as it should be.' Widespread complaints prompted a Commonwealth intervention in mid-November. But calls for Mr Chesoni's removal were resisted. When Justice Telford Georges, leader of the Commonwealth group, was presented with the 'Chesoni dossier' he was outraged by what he read, according to Commonwealth officials. But he gave little public hint of it; nor did the remaining 37 observers, all of whom were aware of the file and its contents, according to Commonwealth officials. At the heart of the problem, say some critics, was the Commonwealth group's uncertainty about its mandate as monitor, which in turn led to some confusion about its responsibilities. Its terms of reference oblige it only to say whether the poll was 'free and fair'. The Commonwealth's own catalogue of 'irregularities' make No the only answer. But as one observer put it, the unwritten question that weighed heavily throughout the exercise was: 'What is in the best interests of Kenya?' The answer, the observer implied, could override strict application of the 'free and fair' yardstick. The question may well have dominated consideration of Mr Chesoni's file. An answer may come when the group's 100-page assessment of the conduct of the election process is published later this week. It is too late for the observers to change their minds - but the report may show the results of a post mortem on the Kenyan experience which could fundamentally affect the Commonwealth's definition of its monitoring role in the future.</p>

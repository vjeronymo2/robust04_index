			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Canadian insurer to set up bank after deregulation MANULIFE Financial is the first Canadian life insurer to set up a bank under federal financial services deregulation. It is fully owned by Manulife, and it starts with nearly CDollars 1bn (USDollars 786m) assets and 14 branches. But it will not compete directly with the Big Six Canadian national chartered banks. Manulife Financial is the holding company for Manufacturers Life Insurance, Canada's second-largest life insurer. The new Manulife Bank of Canada is being built on a base of three small trust companies. At December 31 1991, Manulife Financial's total assets were CDollars 33bn and 1991 profit was CDollars 209m. The insurance operations are being aggressively expanded across Canada with new products. The company said formation of the bank is aimed at delivering a broader range of products and services to Manulife clients, including personal, consumer and commercial loans. 'We can use our banking powers to help clients achieve financial security,' said Mr Thomas Di Giacomo, chairman. Banks, insurers and trust companies can now enter into each other's business fields, with few restrictions.</p>

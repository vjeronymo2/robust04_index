			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sandvik and Atlas Copco ahead on higher volumes Two of Sweden's leading engineering groups, Sandvik and Atlas Copco, yesterday announced better-than-expected first-half figures on the back of a sharp upturn in volumes. Both companies highlighted better demand from the automotive sector but noted continuing weakness in the mining and construction sectors. Buoyed by an improving economic climate in Europe, they forecast full-year earnings 'significantly better' than in 1993. Sandvik saw its result jump 53 per cent to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 194m) while Atlas Copco, the Wallenberg-sphere industrial components group, lifted profits by 29 per cent to SKr852m. Sandvik said currencies accounted for just three percentage points of a 12 per cent rise in sales to SKr11.99bn. The group's order intake was 18 per cent higher at SKr13.4bn. All four divisions posted improved results. Higher volumes and good productivity lifted cemented carbide division profits by 50 per cent to SKr962m. The steel division, where profits rose to SKr376m from SKr231m, benefited from higher capacity utilisation. The group said strong demand from the automotive and engineering industries contrasted with a difficult market for sales to the mining, construction, chemical and energy sectors. Atlas Copco said it was at last seeing an extensive investment programme pay off due to rising volumes and better utilisation rates. But while there was a clear improvement in its compressor and industrial technique divisions, profits fell within the compressor and mining business. A combination of higher volumes, currency effects, acquisitions and price increases helped lift invoiced sales by 12 per cent to SKr10bn, while the order intake expanded by 14 per cent to SKr10.7bn. The volume increase was greater for orders than for sales, the group said, noting a clear break with the trend which took volumes down by 25 per cent between 1990 and 1993. Industrial technique benefited from a turnround in the automobile industry, with profits rising to SKr203m from SKr138m. Profits in compressor technique were also higher, advancing to SKr646m from SKr466m, helped by a SKr700m investment programme at an Antwerp plant. But compressor and mining technique profits dropped from SKr86m to SKr62m after being depressed by a drop in volumes and restructuring costs.</p>

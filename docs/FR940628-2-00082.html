			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disclosure of Ties of Immediate Family and Close Business Associates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters believe the Policy should not require disclosure of the financial interests of an investigator's immediate family, and nineteen thought it should not require disclosure of the financial interests of close business associates. These commenters cited privacy concerns, and, for close business associates, argued that it is inappropriate to require confidential information from these individuals, it might not be possible to elicit it in any event, and it is too difficult to determine what constitutes a close business associate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSF's Policy is meant to ensure that institutions have enough information to determine whether conflicts exist, and to impose appropriate safeguards. Clearly, financial interests of individuals other than the investigators themselves can, under certain circumstances, affect the objectivity with which the investigators conduct their research. This is particularly true where there is a close personal or business relationship between the investigator and another individual. However, NSF recognizes that requiring financial disclosure from all such persons presents certain difficulties and raises privacy concerns. NSF believes it reasonable to require disclosure of the relevant financial ties of an investigator's spouse and dependent children, but the relationship between an investigator and his or her ``close business associate'' is more attenuated. As a result, in light of concerns raised by commenters, the final Policy does not require that their financial interests be disclosed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One state institution pointed out that its institutional conflict of interest rules must be part of the state's administrative code, and this would require new legislation. The effective date for NSF's Policy will be one year following the date of its publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . NSF hopes that this will provide institutions with sufficient time to implement required policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters believe institutions do not have sufficient expertise to conduct the types of investigations necessary to assure the reliability of investigator financial disclosure. NSF does not expect institutions to undertake herculean efforts to verify the accuracy of all disclosures. However, institutional policies should include viable and reasonable methods for enforcing those policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters asked whether NSF's Policy applies to subrecipients of grant funds. It does not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked whether the disclosure requirements apply to current financial ties, or to those which existed over some period of time. The requirements apply to current ties, but institutions must maintain records of disclosures until three years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving the records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the disclosure requirements might conflict with consulting arrangements that prevent investigators from disclosing the name of companies for whom they consult. In such cases, in order to receive Federal funds, investigators would have to obtain permission to make the required disclosures, or discontinue the consulting arrangements. Investigators who enter into consulting arrangements that prevent disclosure could seek agreements with their institutions to maintain the confidentiality of arrangements they disclose to those institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt the guidelines for product evaluations should differ from those for basic research. NSF's Policy allows institutions to develop differing guidelines if they believe it appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many comments specifically related to the proposed Policy's requirement of financial disclosure to NSF. Because this disclosure is not required by the final Policy, these comments are not discussed individually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork and Recordkeeping Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed Policy, NSF estimated that it would take each investigator listed on a grant proposal 20 minutes to prepare the required financial disclosures. Many commenters believed this seriously underestimated the actual paperwork burden associated with Policy, and several pointed out that it did not take into account the institutional burden associated with reviewing the disclosures. Few commenters provided suggestions for formulating a more accurate estimate. However, NSF has revised its estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden to take into account changes from the proposed Policy. NSF's revised estimates are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

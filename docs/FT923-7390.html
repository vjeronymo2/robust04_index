			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Business ethics professor chosen ONE OF the UK's first professorships in corporate responsibility was filled yesterday with the appointment of Mr Brian Harvey at Manchester Business School. Mr Harvey, who is reader in management studies at the University of Nottingham, will take up the Co-operative Bank chair this autumn. Several British institutions have laid claim to creating the first academic position in the ethics of business, including London Business School, which received Pounds 1m for the study of the area last month from Mr Stanley Kalms, the founder of the Dixons electronics dealership. This position has not yet been filled. Mr Harvey, an economist by training, is the author of several publications on ethical concerns in business and is a founder member and the honorary secretary of the European Business Ethics Network. He said: 'I am not interested in wagging a finger at business but corporate responsibility is as important in practice for business as it is in theory for business schools. 'The role of business is guided by the market. Where the market doesn't work, the gap is made up by the law. But there is an area of discretion, which is where ethics should fit in.' He said his main priority would be to build on existing corporate responsibility and environmental issues courses at Manchester, with an emphasis on applied research.</p>

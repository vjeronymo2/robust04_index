			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Resignation at Salomon SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, said Mr Eric Rosenfeld, the co-head of its fixed-income department, is resigning from the firm. Mr Rosenfeld, who took over Salomon's bond department in the immediate aftermath of the Treasury auction bidding scandal in August 1991, said he was leaving for personal reasons. He also said his departure, which he had been considering for some time, was not related to the speculation that Salomon may rehire Mr John Meriwether, the bond trader who resigned as vice-chairman of the firm soon after the Treasury scandal broke. Mr William McIntosh will assume sole for the department.</p>

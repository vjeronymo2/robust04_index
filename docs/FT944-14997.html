			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK housing The gap between the bulls and bears on the outlook for the currently moribund UK housing market is surprisingly wide. Predictions for house price inflation range from a 30 per cent increase by the end of 1999 to nearly 50 per cent. Bulls and bears alike can root out evidence to support their forecasts. The bears stress falling tax privileges for mortgage holders, high levels of indebtedness and negative equity, and a weak demographic outlook. The continuing fall in numbers employed is still undermining job security and confidence. Finally, they argue there has been a structural shift in attitudes: low inflation provides little incentive to see housing as a speculative asset rather than a living space. The bulls, led by UBS, question the weight given to such factors and say underlying macro-economic growth will drive house prices upwards. Most importantly, they believe the UK's historic inability to hold down prices during economic upturns guarantees galloping house inflation. The bulls' scenario would be undermined if the government delivers on its rhetoric. If inflation remains low, then housebuilders, DIY merchants, white goods manufacturers and the like face a gloomy end to the century. No matter which scenario proves accurate, the mortgage lenders, geared for a peak of 2m property transactions a year, look chronically over-staffed. Even UBS's optimistic model predicts only 1.8m transactions by 1997. With high operational gearing, the lenders should be seeking to cut at least 10 per cent of overheads, if not more.</p>

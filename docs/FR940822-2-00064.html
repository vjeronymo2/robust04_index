			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of a proposed class exemption from certain of the restrictions of sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and from certain taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application dated March 25, 1994, submitted by the American Council of Life Insurance (the ACLI) <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with procedures set forth in 29 CFR section 2570 subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). In addition, the Department is proposing additional relief on its own motion pursuant to the authority described above. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ACLI is the major trade association of the life insurance business, representing 640 life insurance companies. these companies hold, in the aggregate, approximately 89% of the assets of all life insurance companies and 94% of the pension business with insurance companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978), effective December 31, 1978 (44 FR 1065, January 3, 1979), generally transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code to the Secretary of Labor. In the discussion of the exemption, references to sections 406 and 408 of the Act should be read to refer as well as to the corresponding provisions of section 4975 of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Life insurance companies issue a variety of group contracts for use in connection with employee pension benefit plans, some of which provide benefits the amount of which is guaranteed, some of which provide benefits that may fluctuate with the investment performance of the insurance company, and some of which offer elements of both. Under section 401(b)(2) of ERISA, if an insurance company issues a ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to a plan, the assets of the plan are deemed to include the policy, but do no, solely by reason of the issuance of the policy, include any of the assets of the insurance company. Section 401(b)(2)(B) defines the term ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to mean an insurance policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer. In addition, in ERISA Interpretive Bulletin 75&hyph;2, 29 CFR 2509.75&hyph;2, the Department stated that if an insurance company issues a contract or policy of insurance to a plan and places the consideration for such contract or policy in its general asset account, the assets in such account shall not be considered to be plan assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 13, 1993, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 114 S. Ct. 517 (1993) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Supreme Court held that those funds allocated to an insurer's general account pursuant to a contract with a plan that vary with the investment experience of the insurance company are ``plan assets'' under ERISA. As a result, the Court concluded that Hancock was a fiduciary with respect to the management and disposition of such funds. Under the reasoning of this decision, a broad range of activities involving insurance company general accounts are subject to ERISA's fiduciary standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> decision, the insurance industry, following adoption of IB 75&hyph;2, operated under the assumption that general account assets were not plan assets, and thus, were not subject to ERISA's fiduciary responsibility provisions. As a result of the retroactive effect of the Supreme Court decision, numerous transactions engaged in by insurance company general accounts may have violated ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions. The insurance industry believes that, absent exemptive relief, it will be subject to significant additional litigation with respect to the operation of its general accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the underlying assets of a general account include plan assets, persons who have engaged in transactions with such general account may be viewed as parties in interest, including fiduciaries, with respect to plans which have interests as contractholders in the general account. Lastly, the underlying assets of an entity in which a general account acquired an equity interest may include plan assets as a result of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application contains facts and representations with regard to the requested exemption that are summarized below.

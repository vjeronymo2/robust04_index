"I am a  candidate to pull the country out of economic difficulties," he  said. "I have already told the president, in a letter I  addressed to him, that I have no candidacy plan."    Concerning a possible presidential candidacy by Cardoso,  President Itamar Franco said he received a letter from the  finance minister in November saying he is not a candidate. "The  important thing is the letter. The minister is thinking of his  economic policy, his plan, particularly the plan we have  submitted to Congress. The important thing is the letter I have.  This does not mean he lost his citizen's rights, his right to  vote and to be voted for. At this moment he is not a candidate,  and he intends to finish his work at the Finance Ministry. Now  if tomorrow he believes he has to step down, it is up to him."    According to the BRASIL news agency, Cardoso explained that  sometimes it is necessary to make statements like "I will think  about it at the right time," in order to courteously reply to a  public demonstration promoted by his party (PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party]), like a recent demonstration in Goiania.    According to the minister, he never put the political  timetable ahead of the economic timetable, and he is certain  that Congress will adopt the same behavior during the vote on  the government's economic program. "There are no children in  Congress," the minister said. He added that everyone knows that  the country needs the program: "It is not a personal matter.  Everyone knows I have not taken any step toward a candidacy."  <H5>  Hargreaves </H5>   Concerning the return to his post of former Civilian  Household chief Henrique Hargreaves, the president said he has  not talked about the issue. "Nothing has been agreed upon. I  talked with Minister Hargreaves over the phone. I must know  Hargreaves' feelings to know whether he would like to return.  The president cannot make a unilateral decision."  <H5>  Lula Says the Minister Is Campaigning </H5>   The GLOBO news agency reported that PT [Workers Party]  President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva on 17 January rebutted the  charges pressed by Minister Cardoso, who said over the weekend  that the PT has not designed a government plan for Brazil yet  because it is still talking with several sectors of society.  Lula claimed that the two popular programs under implementation  by the Franco government -- food insurance and the  transportation fund -- are PT programs. Lula believes Cardoso is  campaigning.    During a news conference, Lula said the PT National  Executive  Board has proposed that the CPI's [Congressional Investigating  Committee] that will investigate the CUT [Sole Workers Center]  and PT campaigns should merge into a single one and should be  set in motion as soon as possible.</p>

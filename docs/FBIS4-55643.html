			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 14 (ATA) -- The president of the  Republic of Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova, considered as very dangerous  the warning made by the Serbian authorities for banning the  Democratic League [LDK], the main Albanian party in Kosova.  Speaking at a press conference in Prishtina, President Rugova  said yesterday that "this is a tendency for disintegration of  the political life in Kosova and if the Democratic League will  be banned, this act would have been one of the grave provocation  to the Albanian population in Kosova. Mr. Rugova said also that  "it will not be a good step nor for the Serbian regime nor for  the Serbians.    President Rugova pointed out that the Democratic League of  Kosova is the biggest party of Albanians in Kosova and it has  been registered since 1990 in the former Yugoslav Federation in  which Kosova was a constitutive unit.    President Rugova spoke also of the Serbian military  exercises  in Kosova in which the Serbian defence minister, Bulatovic,  participated. Mr. Rugova considered the exercises as "a grave  signal at this moment."</p>

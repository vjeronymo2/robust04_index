			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / South-east leads US recovery: A look at the advantages of a diverse economic base WHILE Washington frets about lagging job creation in the nation's glacially paced economic recovery, the South-east of the US is looking rosy on this score: the region is leading the country in job growth and its economy is rebounding faster than most others. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the region's eight states gained 30 per cent of all the 516,000 new jobs generated nationally during the first quarter, the latest period analysed. The region also accounted for 75 per cent of 28,000 new manufacturing jobs added nationally in the period. The South-east's employment gains earlier this year were not just a fortuitous blip. The trend appeared to continue through the second quarter, according to Mr Donald Ratajczak, chief of the economic forecasting centre at Georgia State University. He said that, unlike the nation, which struggled at an overall economic growth rate of only 1.6 per cent during the second quarter, the South-east expanded at about 3 per cent. The South-east's comparative prosperity is a feature of the unusually slow and very uneven national recovery, according to the Conference Board, the New York-based business think-tank. The organisation says that, unlike past, more robust recoveries, this one lacks a federal fiscal stimulus that helps the economy across the board. Consequently, 'divergent regional trends are dominating the economic landscape.' The sharp differences in regional fortunes have led many to ask why some areas are prospering so disproportionately. Aside from the South-east, the Rocky Mountain states and the Mid-west have also fared relatively well since the recession of 1990-1991. In the South-east, where job growth is strongest, analysts say that a diverse economic base is what has helped most. The region has a substantial amount of manufacturing in auto assembly, transportation equipment, building materials, home furnishings, textiles, chemicals, and food processing. It has also been less dependent on military contracting than other areas being hit with defence industry shrinkage. The construction of BMW's new plant in western South Carolina is a boon in that state. Rising US car and truck sales are benefiting Japan's Nissan and GM's Saturn plants in Tennessee and Daimler Benz's truck assembly operation in North Carolina, which also appears poised to win the contest for Daimler Benz's new US car plant. The company, which is expected to make an announcement about its site selection by the end of this year, has been buying up land options near its truck plant. The region, especially the Carolinas, has been a magnet for foreign manufacturing investment because of relatively low production costs and wages. Service employment, up strongly, is also fairly well spread among banking, insurance, retail, communications, transportation, biotechnology and other sectors. But the region's exceptional growth is in large measure being fuelled by construction. According to Mr Thomas Cunningham, chief regional economist at the Atlanta Federal Reserve, it has a concentration of the industries that benefit most from the early stages of recovery. The region's building materials, textiles, furniture and white goods sectors have all been boosted by a nation-wide recuperation of the housing market. The South has in fact led the surge in new home buying, thanks partly to migration from less prosperous regions. In addition, rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew last year in Florida has helped lift regional construction businesses. Mr Cunningham also points out that, while the South-east is faring better than most other areas on job growth, the national figures on employment gains are being brought down by large job losses in just five big states, California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. Nonetheless, attitudes in the South-east also seems distinct from the rest of the nation. Consumer spending has been outpacing the nation as a whole. Even the political mindset appears to be a factor: 'You don't have the yo-yo effect of consumers in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ratajczak. 'We were never that thrilled with Clinton's victory or chagrined with his policy.'</p>

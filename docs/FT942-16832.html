			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Japanese groups in Thai steel venture Thailand's largest cement and building materials conglomerate, Siam Cement, has tentatively agreed to build a steel plant in a joint venture with Nippon Steel and Mitsui &amp; Co of Japan, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The Dollars 580m (Pounds 395m) plant would supply up to 1m tonnes of cold-rolled steel a year by 1997 to Japanese car-makers in Thailand and south-east Asia's booming construction industries. Siam Cement is already setting up a hot-rolled steel factory called Siam Yamato with Mitsui, Yamato Kogyo and Sumitomo Corp. Siam Cement and its prospective partners appear confident that Thailand's Sahaviriya Steel Industry Co will not be able to make the government enforce a 10-year protective ban on rival domestic competition for its new Dollars 504m hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel plant. There is speculation the ban will have to be lifted shortly to comply with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; at least one other group is known to have asked for a steel-making licence.</p>

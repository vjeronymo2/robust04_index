			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS SLOWLY GAINING GROUND WITH CITY HALL;  </P> <P> OXNARD: LA COLONIA, CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE CITY BY RAILROAD TRACKS, HAS  BECOME THE FOCAL POINT OF A NEW ACTIVISM.  </P> <P> La Colonia -- a gritty, working-class neighborhood in Oxnard with the city's  highest concentration of Latinos -- shares the many typical barrio problems of  gangs, drugs and crime.  </P> <P> Residents complain of too few police patrols, poorly maintained roads and no  place but the streets for youngsters to spend their afternoons. These problems,  they say, are part of a larger issue: the Latino community's difficulty in  getting the attention of Oxnard City Hall.  </P> <P> But that appears to be changing in the neighborhood that needs the most  attention. La Colonia, cut off from the rest of the city by railroad tracks,  has become the focal point of a new Latino activism that organizers say may  ultimately change the complexion of city politics.  </P> <P> Since April, 1989, the number of participants in La Colonia's neighborhood  council has jumped from about 20 to more than 100. "We are struggling but we  are coming along little by little," said Ignacio Carmona, former vice chairman  of La Colonia's neighborhood council.  </P> <P> Proving that there is power in numbers, La Colonia residents have since started  to feel that City Hall is paying more attention to their concerns, Carmona  said.  </P> <P> For example, he said Police Chief Robert Owens recently met with the council to  talk about crime in the neighborhood, and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell lobbied  for and won a $450,000 state grant to build a youth gym in La Colonia. The  Oxnard Public Works Department recently solved a longtime parking problem that  caused congestion in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We had issues that needed to be taken care of," Carmona said. "But I guess it  was just the case of the wheel that squeaks the loudest gets the oil."  </P> <P> There are about 35 active neighborhood councils in Oxnard, said Eleanor  Branthoover, chairwoman of the Inter Neighborhood Council Committee. The  grass-roots organization is designed to give residents a coordinated way to  express their concerns to City Hall.  </P> <P> She said she is impressed by the number of residents who now show up at La  Colonia's neighborhood council meetings. "That's a really good turnout," she  said.  </P> <P> The city began encouraging Latino activism after La Colonia residents asked the  City Council for more representation and better city services. City officials  assigned the job of encouraging Latino representation to Karl Lawson, a  community relations specialist who worked for the United Farm Workers Union for  11 years before he was hired by the city.  </P> <P> Lawson, who said he learned Spanish on the streets of Oxnard, organized a  door-to-door campaign to encourage Latino participation and promoted the  neighborhood council in ads in newspapers and on Spanish-language radio  stations.  </P> <P> However, Latino advocates and city officials believe Latino representation in  Oxnard is still inadequate.  </P> <P> "This is just a first step," said Marco Antonio Abarca, an attorney for the  California Rural League Assistance in Oxnard. "It's really a modest step if you  think about it. But at least it's a step in the right direction."  </P> <P> Abarca pointed out that more than half of Oxnard's population is Latino, yet  only one City Council post is occupied by a Latino. Last year, when the council  appointed 22 citizens to an economic advisory committee it selected only three  Latinos, he said.  </P> <P> "We make a pretense of being a democracy, but democracy means the  representation of every person," he said.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi said he sees the growth of La Colonia's neighborhood council  as a good sign, but he agrees that much more needs to be done to establish fair  Latino representation in Oxnard.  </P> <P> "We don't want any part of the city to feel neglected or cut out," he said.  </P> <P> Takasugi said La Colonia -- a neighborhood of mostly older, single-family homes  in the northeast section of Oxnard -- is physically cut off from the rest of  the city by the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks.  </P> <P> Takasugi said he believes the tracks not only form a physical barrier for the  residents, but a psychological one as well.  </P> <P> During his last campaign effort, Takasugi talked to many residents in La  Colonia who, he said, "feel they have been cut off from the rest of the city."  </P> <P> For the most part, he said, residents have complained about deteriorating  streets, old and leaky pipes and problems with utilities.  </P> <P> Councilman Manuel Lopez, the third Latino elected to the council since the city  was incorporated in 1903, said the problem of Latino under-representation is  not unique to Oxnard.  </P> <P> "There is a tremendous under-representation in all governments," he said. "A  lot of strides have been made, but not enough."  </P> <P> He said part of the problem is getting Latinos to believe their voices can make  a difference. "I think they feel alienated; they feel there is nothing they can  do," he said.  </P> <P> Lopez attributes the feeling of powerlessness partly to racism. For example,  Lopez said, when he ran for the mayor's seat two years ago, representatives of  one of his opponents asked voters if they would be ready to have a "Mexican  mayor."  </P> <P> "People are always looking for reasons not to grant the people their rights,"  he said.  </P> <P> Lopez predicts that Latino representation on the City Council will not change  significantly until the city is required by a court decision to elect council  members by district. Considering recent court decisions involving redistricting  in Watsonville and Los Angeles, Lopez said district elections may come sooner  than most anticipate.  </P> <P> So far, no such court challenge has been filed.  </P> <P> But last year, a citizens group tried unsuccessfully to gather enough  signatures to challenge the city's at-large election system, which is accused  of diluting minority voting strength.  </P> <P> Gilbert G. Breezley, an Oxnard paralegal who had headed the Council District  Initiative Committee, said the group gathered about 3,000 signatures, short of  the 7,300 needed to put a measure on the ballot that would carve the city into  six council districts.  </P> <P> The ballot measure, if approved, would have gradually replaced all of Oxnard's  four council members, who live in the same predominantly white, upscale  neighborhood, with six council members from districts of about equal population  throughout the city.  </P> <P> Breezley said the signature drive failed partly because of opposition from  incumbent council members.  </P> <P> But he has not given up. Breezley is now considering a petition that seeks  approval of a 15-member city charter commission, which would be asked to draft  new guidelines for city elections.  </P> <P> The guidelines could include district elections as well as the election of a  full-time mayor who would act as the city's top administrator, Breezley said.  </P> <P> He said he and a committee of 40 residents would begin circulating the petition  within two months.  </P> <P> "I feel very good about it," Breezley said.  </P></p>

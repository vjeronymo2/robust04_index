			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Peter Black drops to Pounds 4.52m THE ILL effects of recession on the footwear and accessories business of Peter Black Holdings showed through in a 15 per cent fall to Pounds 4.52m pre-tax profit in the six months to November 30. The reduction, from Pounds 5.31m, came on turnover of Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 77m). About Pounds 14m of the sales fall was accounted for by shedding the home furnishings and rubber-soled slipper activities. Mr Stephen Lister, finance director of the Keighley-based company, said that turnover on a like-for-like basis was down 5 per cent. Sales to Marks and Spencer, which accounted for about 60 per cent of last year's total, had been less badly affected than those to other retailers. Net debt had been reduced by a further Pounds 4m to Pounds 10.5m, which meant it had virtually halved since November 1990. Gearing had come down to 29 per cent. Stocks had been reduced from Pounds 23m to Pounds 16m. A little more than half the turnover lay in the footwear and accessories division. Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman with his brother Thomas, said accessories had been the worst affected by recession. The group's share of the footwear market had been maintained and he was optimistic about demand from Marks and Spencer, which was increasing its presence in women's shoes. The division's operating margin was below the group average of 9.5 per cent. A better return was made by personal care, including toiletries, cosmetics and dietary supplements, accounting for 35 per cent of sales. Its half-year result was, however, affected by the Pounds 200,000 cost of closing a factory and transferring production to Trowbridge. At English Grains, the private label business was being developed alongside such brands as Natracalm and Red Kooga Ginseng. Mr Black said no improvement in trading was expected until well into this year, leaving profit prospects flat for the second half. Earnings per share fell to 5.56p (6.63p). The interim dividend is held at 0.77p.</p>

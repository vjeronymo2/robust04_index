			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Sinan, master builder of the Ottomans - Patricia Morison on the life of an architect who reinvented the mosque and influenced the cathedral and church builders of Europe OTTOMAN ARCHITECTURE AND ITS VALUES TODAY G Goodwin Saqi Books Pounds 29.95 132 Pages IF AN arrow had despatched the young Sinan as he marched with the janissaries across Hungary, it would have been as great a loss as if Leonardo, Michelangelo or Bramante had never lived. This is the contention of a book which is no narrow academic study but a deeply perceptive inquiry into the nature of architectural achievement. Not a lot is known about the life of Sinan, a boy from a Christian village in Anatolia who was recruited into the Ottoman army. He became Royal Architect and died in 1588 aged 100. Building bridges and siege warfare taught Sinan his craft. In Istanbul and Edirne he went on to build mosques and public buildings which were brilliantly engineered to withstand earthquakes. (Gleefully, Goodwin points out that master masons achieved a less impressive record for Gothic cathedrals.) Ironically, Europeans may have appreciated Sinan's achievement more in times when it was harder for infidels to see his buildings at first hand. Wren, pondering the dome of St Paul's, interrogated the Turkey merchant Roger North about the construction of the mosque of Suleyman. 'Oxford would never have been the same,' says Goodwin of Hawksmoor's plan to build a version of the Suleymaniye on the site where the Radcliffe Camera was later built. For the supreme achievement of Sinan one must visit the Thracian city of Edirne and the mosque of Selim II, the Sot. Here is 'the dome to end all domes', the climax of a building which Sinan named as his finest. The second half of the book analyses what it is that sets this masterpiece apart as a breakthrough in the history of architecture. Ottoman mosques before Sinan had reached an aesthetic dead-end because of architects' rigorous focus on 'the elemental symbolism of the perfect hemisphere set on a cube'. Sinan unified the pleasing disparate elements - the slender stone minaret, the domes, semi-domes and the courtyard - and then set free interior space and exterior forms. A short, easy-to-read book on Sinan was badly needed because, as many among this year's crop of tourists will surely discover, being frog-marched by a guide around the mosques of Istanbul is not an enlightening experience. To get the best from Rustem Pasha means waiting until light filtering from the dome brings out the richness of superb glass and tiles. Sheltering from the sun under a portico is the way to appreciate the particular grace of Shezade Cami's courtyard. Moreover, it is time well spent to observe a foreign mode of worship. At least now and again, we should watch discreetly as someone makes their namaz and linger as the courtyard of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha fills with the babble of boys in black pinafores memorising the Koran. Western church architecture is dominated by the idea of procession to the altar. Mosques, however, require that the worshipper stays on one spot to perform his prayers on one spot from where he should see the mihrab, symbolic of the door to Paradise. Another fundamental difference between church and mosque is in the experience of light. Whereas Byzantine churches had been places of shadow, Sinan's mosques were filled to the greatest possible extent with light, symbolic of the divine enlightenment possible for all believers. Admiring the shafts of light which strike down into the immensity of Aya Sofya, we should remember that Sinan had the windows enlarged. To the layman, Turkey's classical mosques appear timeless. Goodwin shows that this is not so. Sinan's original decorations have been crudely over-painted. It is impossible for us to imagine his domes when they were lit by the beautiful oil-lamps which now sit 'like dumb nightingales' in museums. Columns and pavements used to be polished, an effect which can still be appreciated after rain. Minarets equipped with tape-recorders by lazy muezzins are 'as dead as drained teeth.' Goodwin is entitled to protest, after doing so much in his scholarly career to introduce a wide audience to Ottoman culture. Thanks to his books, many visitors to Turkey have found their way to obscure mosques and bath-houses. Moreover, he has provided the kind of insight which helps to bridge the gap between alien traditions and alien faiths. Sinan is the culmination of this achievement, a book which no one who loves Turkey should miss.</p>

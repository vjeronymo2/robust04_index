			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Thames divides stormy voting waters: Controversy and apathy may wash away ruling parties The inner London boroughs of Lambeth and Westminster, facing each other across the Thames, have both in the past year been the subject of damning reports from the Audit Commission, the government's watchdog for councils. It is now up to their voters to decide whether these 'local' issues are important. The councils are political opposites. Lambeth gained notoriety as a 'loony left' Labour council during the 1980s, while Westminster, under the leadership of Dame Shirley Porter, was a Conservative flagship. According to the district auditor, Lambeth made more than Pounds 20m in unlawful payments to contractors. The council is making efforts to put its house in order, but Liberal Democrats still hope to take advantage, claiming that victories in six local by-elections have put them on course to capture the borough. They claim they have 'Big Mo' on their side  - a reference to the 'momentum' US presidential candidates try to achieve in primary elections  - while a 'scandal-plagued and exhausted' Labour is 'running scared'. In January, the auditor gave a provisional opinion that Westminster City Council was guilty of 'gerrymandering' by selling council houses in marginal wards to Tory voters. Dame Shirley and nine other officials and councillors, one of whom has since committed suicide, were found provisionally liable for repaying Pounds 21.5m. Labour is the only other party on the council, and could gain. But most local elections are decided on national issues, and that looks likely to happen in both Lambeth and Westminster this time. Scandals seem to have served only to increase disillusionment with the political system as a whole. On the Lambeth Walk estate, typical of the council blocks run by Lambeth, canvassers are putting the scandal factor to the test. Through the bars of his door, one man voiced his hatred for the Labour council to Ms Sally Prentice, a Liberal Democrat councillor: 'You want to get them out. It's murder around here.' A woman, angry about problems in buying her flat, said she opposed the Labour administration in Lambeth, but not the national party, and would vote Liberal Democrat 'for the council, but not for parliament'. Disillusionment prevails. One white-haired woman rasped: 'I don't think it makes any difference who runs it, do you?' Gesturing angrily at a broken window catch, awaiting repair for more than five years, she said: 'Last time I even voted for the Militant.' Like many others on the estate, she disliked the Labour council but was planning not to vote at all. The Liberal Democrats could break through, but mobilising the doubters will be a tough task. In Westminster, Labour activists are cautious about their chances of winning the borough. Millbank was the only ward allegedly gerrymandered by the Conservatives which Labour managed to hold in 1990. With Victorian terraced homes of the wealthy and influential  - including several Tory MPs  - backing on to inner city estates it appears a world away from Lambeth. But canvassing the neighbourhood last week, Mr Peter Bradley, a Labour councillor, met with similar anger, disillusionment and uncertainty. Mr Buckfield, 47, a resident in the Tachbrook Estate, a block of social housing in Pimlico funded by the Peabody Trust, told him he had grown tired of the scandals. 'I have stopped voting. I am disillusioned. What's the difference if you're in power or the Conservatives?' he asked, before cheerfully promising his wife's vote for Labour. Referring to an earlier controversy when Westminster sold three cemeteries for 15p, he said: 'Lady Porter got away with selling the graveyards and moving people out. You can't reverse these things.' In Ponsonby Place, an elegant street of family homes near the Tate Gallery, residents were surprised to see Mr Bradley on the doorstep because they did not realise an election was imminent. 'I have not given it much thought yet,' said Ms Atlanta Pollock, a young professional who thought that 'local government is hideously corrupt'. And she added: 'Sorry, what is gerrymandering?'</p>

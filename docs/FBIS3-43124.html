			<p>Reflecting     the determination of party reformers to implement a  new round of market reforms, Beijing recently signaled its  intention to remove price controls in selected areas of China's  heavily subsidized energy sector.  A 23 December Renmin Ribao  article announced that, pending approval by the State Council,  the Ministry of Coal Industry will remove "all restrictions on  coal prices" on 1 January 1994.  Similarly, a 28 December article  in the English-language paper China Daily stated that the price  of electricity will be freed "within two to three years."  The  Renmin Ribao article on coal attempted to allay persistent  concerns that price liberalization will engender inflation,  asserting that "drastic" rises in coal prices will not occur in  1994 and that "stable supply and demand" of coal and "increasing  coal reserves" will mitigate the inflationary impact of price  reform.  The article went on to say that state control over the  production and distribution of coal will also be relaxed so that  enterprises can "adapt themselves to market demands" and  "organize production according to market needs."  The China Daily  article on electricity, on the other hand, blamed "uneconomically  low prices" for "power shortages that have plagued the country  for 23 years" and argued that without market-based pricing, power  production could not keep pace with economic growth.  It quoted a  power industry official as calling for "new regulations on  electricity prices" this year.  Despite the freeing of prices on  coal and electricity, the leadership is moving more cautiously on  other energy prices.  In an interview with Xinhua publicized on 2  January, Premier Li Peng warned that even though the oil industry  "cannot possibly be developed without readjustment of oil  prices," such a readjustment would "affect the prices of oil  products" and must be done "step by step and in a very prudent  manner."      The timing of these changes suggests that reformers are moving  quickly to implement a recent Central Committee plenum decision  loosening state control over prices in key sectors in order to  facilitate new market reforms.  A document adopted by the plenum  stated that "market prices are seldom applied to production  factors" and vowed that "on the premise of keeping the general  price level relatively stable" the party will "accelerate the  marketization of prices" in this area (Renmin Ribao, 17  November).  Apparently reflecting efforts by reformers to step up  price reform, the Renmin Ribao article of 23 December confirmed  that the freeing of coal prices in 1994 was done "ahead of  schedule."  Until August of last year, PRC media reports  consistently held that full liberalization of coal prices would  not occur until 1995.  Concerned with inflation, the party  leadership has been slow to institute meaningful price reforms in  coal despite the burden of substantial state subsidies to  unprofitable coal-producing enterprises hamstrung by low state-  set prices and tight administrative control.  Initial attempts at  price reform in this sector reportedly did not come until  December 1991 (Liaowang, 31 August 1992).  Further measures were  taken in 1992 and 1993 to increase state purchasing prices and  reduce the amount of coal purchased by the state at those prices.  As for electricity prices, the 28 December China Daily article  stated that they were raised "by a narrow margin" early last year  but that "the adjustment was far from enough" to spur power  production or "encourage foreign investment."

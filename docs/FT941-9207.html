			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BT to test video supply system British Telecommunications will officially confirm today that it is pushing ahead with trials of its new video-on-demand system using ordinary telephone lines. BT will test the system, which sends television pictures down telephone lines, in about 100 homes in Essex this spring. Programmes are being provided for the experiment by organisations including the BBC, London Weekend Television, retail group Kingfisher, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Video-on-demand allows consumers to order programmes and films of their choice from a central database. If the spring experiment goes well BT will move to the next stage towards the end of this year - a commercial experiment around Colchester, Essex, which could involve as many as a quarter of a million homes. The Advertising Standards Authority will today uphold a complaint by BT about claims by its rival Mercury. BT complained about two newspaper advertisements in which Mercury compared call charges in 1982 and 1993. One stated that by 1993 Mercury had become 'best known for driving down the cost of everybody's long-distance and international calls by an average of 40 per cent'. BT said the advertisement failed to acknowledge that other factors, such as tighter government controls over BT's prices and changes in the regulation of international calls, had played a part in the reduction of charges. The ASA said Mercury 'went too far in implying that Mercury was the sole reason for the reduction in BT's call charges'.</p>

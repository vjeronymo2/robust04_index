			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Liang Chun (2733 </F> 6511): "Guangdong Retains 80 Development Zones Involving  Investment of 100 Billion Yuan"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 7 June -- From 1984, when the State  Council established the first development zones, until 1992, a  total of 300 development zones have been set up in Guangdong.  Since these development zones appeared in large numbers on a  large scale and were poorly managed, land use management was in  chaos. Since 1993, Guangdong began screening various types of  development zones. Yuan Zheng, director of the provincial State  Land Department, briefed this reporter a few days ago on how  development zones in the province have been straightened out and  how things stand now.    According to Yuan, after a year of comprehensive overhaul,  Guangdong has closed down and merged a total of 228 development  zones established by townships and towns without authorization  or which were approved by cities and counties. The province has  decided to retain 83 development zones, of which 11 were  approved by the central government, 45 approved by the  provincial government, and 28 approved after applications were  submitted anew.    Yuan pointed out that the area approved for development  zones  by the central and provincial government had been limited. An  overall plan has been worked out. Under the plan, an area  measuring 1,560 square km of land will be assigned for  development zones. Infrastructure and land developments in most  development zones are roughly in place, which has created a  favorable investment environment. In most development zones,  transport and telecommunications services and electricity and  water supplies are basically available, and large stretches of  land have been cleared. Statistics show that 260,000 mu of land  has been assigned for development zones at the provincial level  and above, and of this, 120,000 mu has been developed. About  5,000 projects have been introduced into development zones at  the provincial level and above, involving an investment of 110  billion yuan. For now, a total of 20 billion yuan has been  spent on construction and a number of projects have gone on  stream. For example, a total of 148 projects have been  introduced into the Qingyuan Experimental Economic Development  Zone to support poor areas, involving an investment of 1.8  billion yuan. The realized output value of 32 completed  projects, which represented an investment of 800 million yuan,  amounted to 200 million yuan last year and will increase to 1  billion this year. The Jiedong Development Zone has introduced  135 projects with a planned investment of 5 billion yuan, of  which 400 million has been injected. A number of development  zones are entering into negotiations with investors about  introducing a number of major construction projects. For  instance, the Shuidong Development Zone is planning to build a  refinery producing 20 million tonnes of oil each year and an  ethylene plant with an annual production capacity of 45 tonnes  of ethylene [figure as published], and the Zhanjiang Donghaidao  Development Zone plans a steel works with an annual production  capacity of 10 million tonnes.    The development zones feature new methods of operation, new  management techniques, and new approaches to land development,  utilization, and management. Yuan said that the development  zones have rationally arranged land for construction projects  according to the basic state policy of ensuring arable land is  not reduced. The planned area for development zones at  provincial level and above throughout the province totals 2.34  million mu, of which 820,000 mu is under cultivation, accounting  for 3.5 percent of the total, less than the national average.  The planned area of the Shuidong Development Zone is 120,000  mu, of which 16,000 mu is arable land, 1.3 percent of the total.  The Yuebei Industrial Development Zone has obtained land for  construction projects by making use of marshland and has  reclaimed 70 hectares of land.    The development zones also feature a centralized monopoly of  land. The local city or county government or the development  zone management committee sees to it that land comes under  unified planning, unified requisition, unified development,  unified transfer, and unified management. This ensures smooth  implementation of construction plans and that sufficient land is  assigned for projects.    Yuan said that a series of preferential policies also helped  the development zones in land development. The development zone  management can make its own decision on land use, including  giving priority to certain projects. The development zone  management is also allowed to adopt flexible land pricing  policies. Land for industrial and high-tech projects will be  transferred at cost price or at cost price plus an appropriate  amount of subsidy. The buyer is allowed to develop the whole  stretch of land through construction projects on an appropriate  scale and to accept or transfer land use rights in the form of  rent in kind, including exchanging highways or bridges for land.  There are no restrictions on selling commodity houses abroad,  and the client is exempt from land use charges for a number of  years. With these preferential policies, the development zones  have made great progress in land development and utilization.    The current situation with regard to the development,  utilization, and management of land in development zones is very  good on the whole. However, major problems still exist. For  instance, disorderly land management in one or two development  zones, an excessive area of idle land, and defective land  management systems. Therefore, the provincial state land  department has stressed the need to manage land in development  zones according to the law, approve land for development zones  strictly according to state regulations, improve the operating  mechanism of the market for development zone land, and further  enforce a land management system characterized by "unified  planning, unified requisition, unified development, unified  transfer, and unified management" so that land use in  development zones will be legalized and standardized.</p>

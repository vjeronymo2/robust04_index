			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Map poses dilemma for Izetbegovic WHEN Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic headed for peace talks in Geneva a month ago, he said: 'We will do everything to reach peace, but also to preserve the state and the nation.' In the next week he has to decide whether to back the deal that could offer him peace and lose him the state. On the table is the map put forward by international mediators which partitions his republic in an effort to end 17 months of war. While the peace envoys explained how they tried to wring concessions from the Serb and Croat sides in order to salvage a viable republic for the Bosnian Moslems, the compromise map sanctions Serb and Croat military victory in Bosnia. In statements remarkable for their similiarity, Serb and Croat leaders welcomed the proposed plan as a 'compromise which could bring an end to the war'. They are likely to put their signatures to the Geneva agreement. But Mr Izetbegovic is faced with a plan that leaves his Bosnian republic virtually land-locked and geographically disjointed. Moslems, the biggest ethnic group in Bosnia, will stand slim chance of preserving their bizarrely shaped republic and national identity sandwiched between the new Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia. Serb enthusiasm for the plan appears to reflect this: 'The Turks (a derogatory term for Bosnia's Moslems) are going to be like walnuts in a Serbo-Croat nutcracker,' a member of the Bosnian Serb delegation on Friday night in Geneva gleefully boasted after the proposal was announced. But if Mr Izetbegovic rejects the proposal next Monday, he risks losing the already dwindling support of the international community. He and his Bosnian assembly, which this week will consider the plan, will be seen as opting for more war over the 'compromise' solution brokered by mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. In remarks which reveal the intense pressure on Mr Izetbegovic, Serbian foreign minister Vladislav Jovanovic said yesterday in an interview with Radio Belgrade that the European Community had threatened Mr Izetbegovic that western governments would cut off finances for the UN peacekeepers and humanitarian aid if he rejected the plan. In addition, if the war continues, the outgunned and exhausted Bosnian army could be totally defeated. Croats and Serbs in the mostly Moslem republic may be left without a homeland, forced to take sides amid the dwindling resources and the collapse of a multi-ethnic Bosnia. Since the war erupted in April 1992, Mr Izetbegovic has made clear that he was fighting for the survival of a Bosnian state as well as the Moslem nation. But the map fails to restore territory which was mostly Moslem before the war to Bosnian government control. The three remaining pockets in eastern Bosnia, proclaimed 'safe areas' by the UN, are joined by a tenuous route. The road is designated for Moslem control but it runs through Serb-held Trnovo, which is part of the Sarajevo district. The temporary solution on Sarajevo freezes current frontlines and the fate of the Bosnia capital depends on the overall success of the peace settlement. Access routes and fly-overs etched on the map to link the mostly Moslem republic to ports on the northern River Sava and the Adriatic show the state as unlikely to survive in the hostile climate of the aggressive Balkan nationalism. The only real chance for Mr Izetbegovic and his future mostly Moslem Bosnian republic rests with the international community's will to pour in generous amounts of aid to pave the way for the gradual re-integration of the territory into the Balkans and Europe.</p>

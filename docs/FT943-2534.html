			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Duty-free shopping Drinkers should head for Milan and smokers for Madrid, according to a survey of duty-free shopping in the European Union. But they should steer clear of London, which the European Consumers' Organisation found to be the most expensive place for either commodity. The survey also found that Dublin was the cheapest place to buy duty-free perfume and Paris the best for cameras. Lisbon was the most expensive for perfume, with at least one brand found to be markedly cheaper if bought in town rather than duty-free. Frankfurt and Copenhagen were the two most expensive duty-free shops for cameras.</p>

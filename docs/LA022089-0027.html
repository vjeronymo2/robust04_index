			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL POLY TENNIS STAR DIES AFTER A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Xenia Anastasiadou, two-time Division II national champion in tennis for Cal  Poly Pomona, died early Sunday from injuries she suffered in a Saturday  automobile accident at Diamond Bar. She was 22.  </P> <P> Anastasiadou, one of Greece's best female players, was the No. 1-ranked singles  player in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division II this season.  </P> <P> Her automobile was struck in an intersection by a car that apparently had brake  failure, Cal Poly Pomona officials said in a statement Sunday. She was taken to  San Dimas Community Hospital where she died Sunday morning.  </P> <P> Anastasiadou, a senior, was trying to become the first woman to win three  consecutive single titles in Division II, said Ron Fremont, Cal Poly Pomona  spokesman.  </P> <P> "She was not looking past this season," said Ann Lebedeff, Pomona's first-year  coach. "We had recently talked about whether she wanted to get on to the (pro)  circuit or graduate. She wanted to finish school."  </P> <P> Lebedeff said Anastasiadou was earning a degree in physical education, and was  considering a career in coaching.  </P> <P> "She probably would have been an assistant coach here next season," Lebedeff  said.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona, which has three matches this week, plays host to Brigham Young  Hawaii today.  </P> <P> Lebedeff said Anastasiadou would expect the team, ranked No. 6 nationally, to  continue playing as hard as she always did.  </P> <P> "This is going to have an effect on the kids," she said. "They are despondent,  but they know that she would want them to go on."  </P> <P> Anastasiadou, who has a sister living near Cal Poly Pomona, decided to attend  the school three years ago.  </P> <P> Mary Holycross, a former Cal Poly player who met Anastasiadou in Italy the  summer before the Athens player entered Pomona, was surprised to learn they  would be teammates.  </P> <P> Though an aggressive player, she was a warm personality off the court,  Holycross said.  </P> <P> "Her family was the most important thing in her life," she said. "Her family  came first. If she was your friend she would do anything for you."  </P> <P> Memorial services are pending as her family is en route from Athens.  </P></p>

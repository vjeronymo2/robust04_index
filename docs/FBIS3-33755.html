			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the PLO </F> delegation to United Nations, by Umberto de Giovannangeli; place  and date not given: "The Palestinians Are Running Out of Time"  -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] "No, the hopes that the agreement between Rabin and  'Arafat gave rise to have not vanished, but disappointment is  increasingly spreading in the occupied territories because of  the delay in implementing the agreement. Israel must understand  that time is a decisive factor for a landless people." At this  crucial stage in the Middle East peace negotiations, Hanan  'Ashrawi's words provide an insight into what is happening in  the Palestinian camp.    [Giovannangeli] What is the prevailing mood today in the  occupied territories?    ['Ashrawi] Disappointment, no doubt, and a lot of  skepticism,  but not only about the possibility of reaching a peace agreement  with Israel quickly. In fact, I would even say that this is a  secondary aspect in relation to the outbreak of internal  problems within our own camp.    [Giovannangeli] What sort of problems?    ['Ashrawi] The crucial issue is that of democracy -- how  decisions are made which affect the Palestinian people's future.  Many of us are aware of the risk of not being ready for autonomy  when we get there. We must build our institutions, form a new  ruling class, and this is a task which we cannot delegate to  someone else or postpone until a vague "future."    [Giovannangeli] Is it this shortfall in democracy which lies  at the heart of the clash within the PLO?    ['Ashrawi] Rather than a clash, I would speak of a difficult  self-reform process aiming to strengthen Palestinian democratic  structures. In other words, the question is not to remove  'Arafat, but to reconsider his role as an unchallenged leader  who takes upon himself all the burdens -- and the honors -- of  decisionmaking.    [Giovannangeli] What does this mean exactly?    ['Ashrawi] This means creating a new ruling class that can  give shape and substance to the Palestinian nation. This is the  challenge which the PLO is now facing: To change from being a  national liberation movement into the embryo of the future  Palestinian state.    [Giovannangeli] How did 'Arafat respond to your requests for  greater democracy?    ['Ashrawi] Disagreement concerns the "two-stage" policy  advocated by 'Arafat: first achieving independence, and then  everything else. I have voiced my dissent in this respect. If  we do not already make use of all the energies and intellectual  resources available to us today, we risk giving birth to an  authoritarian state, and this is not what we have been fighting  for over the past 50 years.    [Giovannangeli] However, on the road leading to a  Palestinian  state there is Israel, which is accusing the PLO of attempting  to disrupt the negotiations' timing agreed in the "statement of  principles."    ['Ashrawi] This stage of the negotiations reflects the  essence of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is not  "good" and "evil" which are opposing each other, but two equally  legitimate sets of reasons, of rights. I am perfectly aware of  the importance the security issue has for the Israelis, I know  and understand their fears. But Rabin must understand that for  my people, as much as for his own, symbols have great  importance. The Israeli prime minister is right to say that  what is at issue today is Gaza and Jericho's autonomy, but he  cannot dismiss as being "tendentious" our request to highlight  immediately, also in material terms, the actual link between the  transitional stage and the negotiations' final outcome. I have  never advocated an "everything now" position. I have always  been convinced, and still am, that peace with Israel can only be  achieved gradually, one stage at the time. Because of this  position, I was threatened by "Hamas," but I am not afraid of  being accused of treason. My fear is that autonomy may end up  becoming a sort of self-imposed ghetto.    [Giovannangeli] Mrs. 'Ashrawi, let us go back for a moment  to  13 September 1993. What aspect of that "Declaration of  Principles" do you regard as being the most valid four months  later, and which, on the contrary, do you consider to be the  most fragile?    ['Ashrawi] The agreement contains an element of strategic  importance: the explicit recognition of the PLO by Israel and  the international community as a whole and, therefore, the  recognition of the Palestinian problem as a national question.  The agreement's limitations concern the ambiguity of certain  formulations included in it, particularly as regards the  withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, and the  future of the Jewish settlements. The risk that I perceive  today is that such ambiguities will be resolved only on the  basis of the balance of forces, which is clearly to Israel's  advantage.    [Giovannangeli] Are you therefore pessimistic about  negotiations being continued?    ['Ashrawi] Despite everything, I still believe that the  negotiations can be resumed, finally leading to the  establishment of our self-government. The news from Davos is  encouraging in this sense. I had the opportunity of meeting  Israeli Prime Minister Peres several times, and I am convinced  that he genuinely wishes to achieve a fair peace in the region...    [Giovannangeli] Is time an obstacle to peace?    ['Ashrawi] You see, the Israelis, like the Syrians or the  Jordanians, can afford the luxury of procrastinating when it  comes to looking for a peace settlement. At any rate, they have  a state, a land to live on, a recognized national identity. We  have nothing of all this. It was not easy -- believe me -- to  convince the kids in the refugee camps that we must continue to  believe in dialogue. However, we managed to do so, just as we  managed to give back some hope to our elders by promising them  that they would see their lifetime's dream come true: national  independence. Today, they are asking us to justify such  promises, they are asking us when all this will begin to happen.  Unfortunately, we still live in the present, under Israeli  occupation.    [Giovannangeli] What about your own political future, Mrs.  'Ashrawi?    ['Ashrawi] I intend to strengthen the Palestine Human Rights  Committee, which was set up less than a month ago in the  territories. This body will closely monitor the Palestinian  leadership's actions, ensuring that respect for human and civil  rights does not remain a statement of principles and nothing  more.</p>

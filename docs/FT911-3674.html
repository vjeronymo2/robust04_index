			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / French minister heads into education minefield: Everyone agrees the system needs reforming, but no one agrees how WHEN Mr Michel Rocard's government was appointed three years ago, it made modernisation of the education system its top domestic priority. Mr Lionel Jospin, a leading light in the Socialist party, was give the job of education minister, and the number two spot in the cabinet, to symbolise this priority. Most people greeted the government's declaration of commitment with a mixture of respect and scepticism. For while everybody agrees that French education needs reforming, everybody also knows that education is a daunting political minefield; recent French history is littered with education ministers who attempted to tamper with the entrenched traditions of the education system, and who paid dearly for their temerity. It now begins to look, however, as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to reform the hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to the heart of the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling baccalaureat school-leaving examination. These reforms are designed to simplify the syllabuses of the different baccalaureats, to shorten and above all to alleviate the school working week, and to modernise teaching methods. Whether the package will make any headway is still uncertain: the main parents' association has voiced its approval, but the main secondary school teachers' union has condemned it outright. The complaint most frequently levelled against the traditional baccalaureat is that it is an elitist, intellectual examination, ill-adapted for mass education. Twenty years ago, 40 per cent of 17-year-olds were still at school; today the figure is over 70 per cent. Twenty years ago, 25 per cent of the school-leaving generation were aiming for the 'bac'; today the figure is 55 per cent; by the end of the century the government aims to raise the proportion to 80 per cent. The traditional baccalaureat continues to be the yardstick of attainment and the principal door for future advancement, and it continues to be the main target for a growing number of French school students. And yet the expansion in numbers has left it largely unchanged either in content or in method: it remains a traditional intellectual examination, taught with traditional class-room methods, and in theory (but only in theory) it is taught by traditional French intellectuals. France is now probably the only country where philosophy is still one of the obligatory subjects in the main school-leaving examination. The most revolutionary element in the Jospin package is the proposal that the lycees should set aside three hours a week for informal 'modules', small class-groups devoted either to catch-up work for slow students, or to the acquisition of learning and research techniques for the fast. This is an iconoclastic innovation because, while the work carried on in these modules would be part of the core curriculum, it would not be marked. Two of the most notorious weaknesses of the French education system are that it has the shortest school year in Europe, but the longest school week. For some technical baccalaureats the school week now lasts 40 hours, plus several hours' home-work every night. Mr Jospin is now proposing a maximum of 35 hours. The third component of the Jospin reforms is a simplification of the baccalaureat syllabuses, so as to get away from the current scourge of hyper-specialisation. At present there are eight different subject groups for the general baccalaureat, and 17 for the technological bac; both would be simplified into three broad streams. In the general bac, the choice would be letters, social science, and science, though the curriculum would continue to include subjects outside the main specialisation. The main stumbling block for all previous reform efforts has been the resistance of the many teaching unions, and this one is not likely to be an exception. Mr Jospin has carefully kept away from any detailed proposals on the content of the baccalaureats; this is the most treacherous ground because it affects the vested interests of teachers of philosophy, geography, maths, etc. But if Mr Jospin's modest reform is to be implemented, it may require a revolution in the attitudes and methods of France's teachers. It looks as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to reform the hydra-headed monster. He has just tabled proposals which go to the heart of the system, because they are aimed at humanising the gruelling baccalaureat school-leaving examination.</p>

That was the assessment made by Prime Minister Carl Bildt  when commenting on the agreement between Sweden and the EU at a  news conference yesterday afternoon.    "Many of the myths that the no side has lived on can now be  consigned to the trash can. The whole of the negotiating  process shows that the EU takes account of our views," said  Bildt, who claimed that in the negotiations the EU has accepted  the majority of Sweden's demands.    The prime minister stressed that this will be an important  argument when it comes to persuading hesitant voters prior to  the referendum.    "I believe that there will be a yes in the referendum  because  the negotiations show that in European cooperation account is  taken of national demands.    ``We know one thing for certain and that is that outside the  EU we will have no influence at all.    ``We would become a peripheral state,'' Carl Bildt said.    Not surprisingly, the prime minister was very pleased with  the day's agreement in Brussels.    "It is a very, very satisfactory result from the  negotiations. This is the most important international agreement  for Sweden this century," Bildt said.    He praised the Swedish negotiators in Brussels who were led  by European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel and called them  diplomacy's answer to Sweden's national ice hockey team.    Carl Bildt was unwilling, however, to discuss when a Swedish  referendum should be held. This will now be decided in  consultations among the parties represented in the Riksdag, he  said.    "But we should not drag our feet unnecessarily."    Carl Bildt said that he was not unhappy that in a phasing-in  period the reduction in Sweden's membership contribution to the  EU will be less than what Sweden's negotiators had initially  been demanding.    "This is something that can of course always be discussed,  but we did after all get half of what we demanded."    Today at 0900 Carl Bildt will brief the Riksdag on the  agreement in Brussels and answer the questions of Riksdag  deputies.</p>

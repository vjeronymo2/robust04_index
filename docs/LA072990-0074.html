Yenckel's June 24 story, "Touring the European Countryside by Foot  Offers Memorable Images," the accompanying photo of Chambord Chateau contains  an interesting aspect. The rooftops of Chambord are a replica of Paris of the  period when Chambord was built. Also, the unique double spiral staircase was  reputedly designed by Leonardo da Vinci during his exile in France.  </P> <P> SHARLENE G. ROTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

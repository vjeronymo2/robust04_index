			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'AMERICA'S CUP DECISION'  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "The America's Cup Decision," March 30:  </P> <P> To characterize the San Diego Yacht Club's choice of a catamaran in response to  Michael Fay's maverick challenge as "smart aleck" is ridiculous. If anyone is  the smart aleck here it's Michael Fay for breaking with tradition and  challenging between races.  </P> <P> Dennis Conner and crew won the cup in international competition in 1987 and  deserve to keep it until the next international competition in 1991. That's  tradition.  </P> <P> Fay should be a good sport and sit tight until 1991 like everybody else. The  heck with the small print in the old Deed of Gift!  </P> <P> If the San Diego Yacht Club must hand over the cup to Fay, I'm hoping the club  challenges him to another race. A maverick challenge. And if we lose, no  problem, just challenge him again . . . that seems to be in keeping with the  new spirit of the America's Cup as defined by Fay and New York Supreme Court  Judge Carmen Ciparick.  </P> <P> STEVEN FOSTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Peru tightens up on import cheats - Efforts to cut corruption and inefficiency PERU has turned to four European companies to spearhead a drive to improve foreign trade efficiency and increase revenue from customs duties. The new import-supervision scheme aims to end the widespread practice of undervaluing goods to avoid duties. A new law requires importers bringing in consignments worth more than Dollars 5,000 to arrange pre-shipment inspection and certification. The Geneva-based Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), with nearly 30 years' experience in Peru, expects to capture much of the new supervision business. The three other companies to win authorisation from Sunad, the Peruvian customs authority, are Specialist Services International (SSI) of Britain, Cotecna of Switzerland and Bureau Veritas of France. The costs of the new system - a maximum of 1 per cent of fob (free on board) value, and 0.5 per cent for commodities - are borne by the importer. While this is lower than the 1.2-to-1.8 per cent normally charged on higher-volume operations in other countries, Peruvian importers are grumbling. 'But,' says Mr Ricardo Tirado of SGS, 'they'll soon realise that we can be more of a help than a hindrance.' Although about 85 per cent of SGS business worldwide is with the private sector and international organisations (they supervise, for example, virtually all food aid to Peru), the company has around the world about 25 contracts similar to Peru's. Their Peruvian operation employs more than 200 people, but only in a co-ordination capacity. All physical supervision is carried out at point of origin, either at factory or port. SGS's reputation in Peru grew between 1987 and 1989, when the government contracted them to combat capital flight. Local businesses, blocked from remitting profits legally, regularly over-valued both imports and exports, taking advantage of a complex differential exchange rate system. Poor co-ordination between the authorities in such a complex system encouraged illegal double invoicing - one copy for the central bank and another, much lower, for customs purposes. The SGS payroll for the period swelled to almost 800, and the company says its supervision saved Peru Dollars 200m in two years. In newly liberalised Peru, the focus of the problem has shifted. Anyone may now import anything, profits can be freely remitted and foreign exchange is readily available. The central bank is no longer a significant participant in capital inflow and outflow. However, evasion of duties and taxes is widespread. While almost 90 per cent of imports entering Peru pay only 15 per cent, the fob invoice triggers a cascade of other internal taxes, making under-invoicing attractive. And with a fiscal deficit which could reach 4 per cent of GDP this year, the government is seeking to close as many loopholes as possible. Customs duties bring in around Dollars 90m a month on legally declared imports of around Dollars 3bn, but officials believe the real imports total could be above Dollars 5bn. Spot checks have revealed merchandise is often declared at only a third of its real value. 'We can't really tell what has been going on for the past couple of years,' says Mr Tirado. 'But we've heard plenty of hair-raising gossip about some particularly scandalous cases.' Officials believe that underpaid customs officers and profiteering customs agents have made a lucrative living from turning a blind eye to sharp practice. SGS points to Indonesian experience, where supervision dramatically cut disembarcation time, pushed-up customs revenue and ultimately saved importers around a fifth in costs.</p>

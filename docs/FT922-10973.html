			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group After yesterday's 7 per cent jump in Blenheim Group shares, the exhibition group's market value has risen almost a hundred-fold since its Pounds 5.8m flotation in late 1986. Over the same period, the shares have outperformed the market by a rather less startling five times. Given that Blenheim has been conspicuously successful during the recession - interim pre-tax profits rose by more than half - it seems churlish to ask whether it is in danger of running out of steam. But it is not obviously geared to economic recovery, so the question is perhaps more relevant than at past moments in its history. The group has been strengthening management of what it rightly describes as its brands - the big annual trade fairs, such as Batimat in France, which have proved their reliability in a downturn. It claims there is demand for extra space which should feed straight through to profits. In addition, its strategy is to increase margins by cutting spending on promotions and to export successful exhibitions to new markets. There looks to be plenty of room for growth. Thus, the answer is that although its momentum probably will slow, Blenheim is unlikely to grind to a halt. Other media companies, particularly pure publishers, stand to gain more immediately from recovery, so the comparison may test the rating; Blenheim's shares are on a current year multiple of more than 20, which looks fully valued for now.</p>

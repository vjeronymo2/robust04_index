			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Gore gives Clinton victory in Senate on budget bill PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night scored a crucial political victory when his compromise budget bill cleared its final congressional hurdle. After a tense day of debate and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, the Senate approved the measure by the narrowest possible margin - the casting vote of Vice-President Al Gore. The victory was even narrower than the one achieved on Thursday night in the House of Representatives, when the bill was passed by a majority of just two votes. Until the last minute the Senate vote was in doubt, with everything resting on the decision of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who, despite a 90-minute meeting with Mr Clinton earlier in the day, had refused to make his position known. In his speech to the Senate, Mr Kerrey conceded he had taken 'too long' to reach his decision. 'My head, I can say, aches with all the thinking, but my heart aches with the conclusion - that I will vote yes for a bill which challenges America too little,' he said. The pressure on Mr Kerrey from fellow Democrats and promises from Mr Clinton that further spending cuts would be considered later this year finally swung him to cast his vote in favour of the legislation. The passage of the bill, which aims to narrow the budget deficit by Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, was seen by many leading Democrats as critical to Mr Clinton's political authority and to his campaign pledges to turn the American economy around. The president had argued that the bill was needed to create the momentum for further reform proposals, especially on health and welfare. It also represented an at least temporary end to the 'gridlock' which had for the past 12 years bedevilled relations between the president and Congress. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, stressed yesterday that winning the vote was the best chance for the Democrats to show that they could govern the country even without a single Republican vote. The result in the House the night before had been in doubt with Mr Clinton making a vital telephone call to a wavering congresswoman only 15 minutes before the vote. Mrs Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who had said she would vote against the bill, then switched sides and to Democrat applause gave Mr Clinton his majority, 218-216. Had she kept to her original intention, the bill would have been a vote short of the required 218. Mr Clinton has campaigned intensively for the bill which will raise Dollars 241bn in revenue, largely by raising income tax for the wealthiest Americans, and imposing Dollars 255bn in spending cuts, to fall heavily on the military. But he has faced opposition within the conservative wing of his own party, which wants deeper spending cuts to achieve a more substantial deficit reduction. On Thursday night in the House, 41 Democrats opposed the compromise bill compared with 38 when the first version of the legislation was passed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. SIP Creditability and Audit/Reconciliation Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A SIP revision that contains an EIP must include projections of the emissions reductions the State expects to achieve through the implementation of the program. The projections may be based on federally-enforceable limits on mass emissions or on other emission-related parameters, estimates of market response, economic modelling, or other relevant information. The State does not have to project emission changes for each source, unless that is how the State chooses to estimate the emissions reduction from the program. All EIP submittals must include documentation which clearly states how sources in an EIP are or will be addressed in the emissions inventory, RFP plan, and attainment or maintenance plan, as applicable. This documentation should include a description of the assumptions used in measuring emissions and emissions reductions from affected sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credit in a nonattainment SIP may be taken for emission limiting programs (e.g., emissions trading) and market-response programs (e.g., emissions fees). Credit may not be taken for directionally-sound programs until experience with such programs makes quantification possible, at which time the program could be reclassified into one of the other categories for which credit may be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For determining SIP credit, the projected emissions reductions must be adjusted to reflect the uncertainties inherent in EIP's. This adjustment is currently done for traditional stationary source control measures through the use of a rule effectiveness factor, developed from experience with traditional regulatory control programs. For EIP's, the State must use two uncertainty adjustment factors, as appropriate, to calculate creditable emissions reductions. The sources of uncertainty that must be separately addressed are compliance uncertainty (i.e., the extent to which sources will actually comply with program requirements) and programmatic uncertainties (e.g., the extent to which voluntary market responses to incentives actually occur and/or the use of various quantification methods with differing confidence levels). These sources of uncertainty must be accounted for through the use of a rule compliance factor and a program uncertainty factor, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State must specify values for rule compliance and program uncertainty factors, based on program elements such as the quantification and enforcement procedures, and on the predictive quality of the information used by the State to develop the projected emissions reductions. Inherent in the way in which these factors are defined, the value of either factor must be less than or equal to one. The State must include with its EIP submittal a justification for the values assigned to these factors. The State must use these factors in determining the SIP credit for the program as a whole, or for each source-specific trade, if appropriate, to ensure that quantification uncertainties not lessen a source's emissions reductions requirements. The uncertainty factors should be developed and justified by the State by taking into account various aspects of the design of the EIP, including but not limited to, the type of incentive mechanism upon which the program is based; the variability in emissions from affected sources and the nature and extent of uncertainty in the emissions quantification procedures required by the program; the frequency and type of MRR required by the program; sanctions for noncompliance; the frequency, scope and committed responses to program audits; and the nature of administrative procedures to be used by the State in implementing and enforcing the program (see paragraph IV.F.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless otherwise provided in program-specific guidance issued by the EPA, EIP's for which SIP credit is taken must also contain program audit procedures designed to evaluate program implementation and track program results in terms of both actual emissions reductions and, to the extent practicable, cost savings realized during program implementation. The auditing methods and the timing of the audits must be specified in the EIP. The maximum time interval for conducting such audits is 3 years, although States are encouraged to consider more frequent audits. Further, the State must provide timely post-audit reports to the EPA. For emission-limiting EIP's, program audit provisions must include a State commitment to ensure timely implementation of programmatic revisions or other measures which the State, in response to the audit, deems necessary for the successful operation of the program (see paragraph IV.G.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

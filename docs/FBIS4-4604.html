			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets on 1 April perpetrated  another round of provocative joint air war exercises against the  North.    That day, formations of overseas-based pursuit-assault  planes  and VTOL [vertical take off and landing] assault planes of the  U.S. Marines frenziedly staged surprise attack exercises on  strategic objects in the Northern half of the Republic in  coordination with airplanes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea  and the puppet Air Force, thus instigating an atmosphere of war.    This frenzied playing with fire, staged for a long in the  skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Oeyon islet and Chongju, was  designed to examine coordination striking capabilities of  various types of military aircraft of the U.S. Marines and  airplanes of the U.S. Air Force and the puppet Air Force against  the North.    Meanwhile, tank groups of the puppet Army, which were  mobilized and deployed in Kumpari, Paju County, fired scores of  tank guns at areas in Hapo-ri on the other side of Imjin River,  and armed hooligans of the puppet Army who occupied combat  positions in Pangmong-ri fired hundreds of large-caliber machine  gun bullets while advancing toward the Military Demarcation Line.    This shows that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets are recklessly rushing ahead toward a war against the  North.</p>

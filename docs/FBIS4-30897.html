			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- Former Chilean President  Augusto Pinochet should not have been granted an entry visa to  the Czech Republic, Interior Minister Jan Ruml told Czech  Television today. A Chilean military delegation arrived today  in Prague to negotiate arms deals with the Omnipol company, but  the arrival of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto  Pinochet has not been confirmed although it had been notified.    "However, if he got it and is here, I will not draw any  conclusion as interior minister," Ruml added. The Interior  Ministry will not provide protection to Pinochet because his  visit is private and the Foreign Ministry has not asked for it,  Ruml said.</p>

As of today, 521 cases of the disease have been  noted. In the opinion of epidemiologists, the current growth in  the number of patients is directly linked to the unjustifiable  sensation over diptheria vaccine that occurred several years  ago. Because parents refused to have their children vaccinated,  the rising generation's immunity against a number of diseases,  including diptheria, is extremely low.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Sirab from the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Text] In a sudden turn of events, the Sudanese People's  Liberation Movement [SPLM], led by Colonel John Garang, has  announced the formation of a new political and administrative  entity it has christened "New Sudan." At the end of its  general congress meetings, held near the Sudanese border with  Uganda last week, the SPLM issued a statement. According to the  statement, the SPLM congress formed an executive council and  instructed it:    1. To seek self-determination for the "New Sudan" people.    2. To mobilize the country's resources for the war effort.    3. To separate civilian from military administration.    4. To create the necessary infrastructure for "New Sudan."    5. To create an independent judicial system.    6. To respect the law and protect human rights.    7. To issue a general amnesty for former insurgents.    With these seven tasks and the announcement of this new  organization, the SPLM has taken a serious step toward the  formation of a state completely separate from north Sudan. The  statement defines the borders of New Sudan as those areas in  south Kurdufan in western Sudan, areas south of the Blue Nile in  eastern Sudan, and the three south districts of Upper Nile,  Equatoria, and Bahr al-Ghazal.    According to political observers, the above resolutions run  counter to all the agreements endorsed by the National  Democratic Grouping [al-tajammu' al-watani al-dimuqrati; NDG].  The NDG's charter, which the SPLM had signed, calls for  replacing the current regime in Sudan with a transitional  democratic government and a multiparty system.    Observers say that the views of several northern political  organizations, who support self-determination in south Sudan,  have encouraged the SPLM to make this difficult decision.    According to African observers, Garang was under heavy  pressure to take such a step. There has been unprecedented  pressure for secession and the formation of an independent state  in the south. Observers say that the 10-year war has taken its  toll on the SPLM.    The sudden tack by Garang's group coincides with mounting  unrest in Sudan. Antigovernment demonstrations were reported in  Madani and al-Qadarif. The protests could threaten the regime's  survival if they spread to Khartoum.    Observers say that the opening a new dialogue with Garang's  SPLM would be useless so long as the National Islamic Front is  in power. They add that Sudan's unity can only be preserved  through swift action to bring down the regime.</p>

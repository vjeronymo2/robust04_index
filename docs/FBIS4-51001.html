			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Renan Huang and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] New York, May 23 (CNA) -- Tang Feng, deputy  director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Committee for  Aviation and Space Industry Development, visited Grumman  International Inc. to discuss future cooperation prospects  Monday [23 May].    Tang, who led a four-man group here Saturday, said that the  main purpose of his trip was to learn more about Grumman, meet  its suppliers, introduce the aviation and space development  projects in Taiwan, and seek technology transfers from Grumman.    Tang said that he met with two Grumman suppliers in Long  Island in the afternoon. The two suppliers showed keen interest  in proposed cooperation between Taiwan and Grumman.    Tang and his group will meet again with Grumman officials  Tuesday. Taiwan is reportedly most concerned about getting  technology transfers from the company if any deals are made.  They are also working to allow Taiwan companies to sell parts  and components to Grumman.    Tang and his group will travel to California later this week  before going home in early June.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The executive council of the All Parties Hurriyat  Kashmir Conference at its meeting in Muzaffarabad today reviewed  the latest political situation prevailing in the occupied Jammu  and Kashmir. The council strongly rebutted Indian claims that  the leadership of the conference was engaged in secret  negotiations with the Indian authorities. The council said this  is a technique used to mislead the Kashmiri people, which are  engaged in relentless struggle against repressive measures of  Indian forces in occupied territory. The council said that the  Kashmiri people will not be affected through such unfounded and  fabricated media tricks aimed at spreading disinformation. The  executive council of All Parties Hurriyat Conference called upon  the Kashmiri people to step up their struggle against Indian  subjugation till their rights are achieved.</p>

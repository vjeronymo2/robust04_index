			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Third woman faces test for Justice post PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, twice frustrated in his search for an attorney general, last night nominated Ms Janet Reno, a criminal lawyer from Miami, to run his Justice Department. Ms Reno, 54, has an Ivy League education (Cornell and Harvard Law School) and has been state prosecutor for Dade County, Florida, for 15 years. Introducing her in the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr Clinton praised her legal and administrative experience. He described her as 'a tough crime fighter and a caring public servant'. He insisted he had 'somewhat, but not entirely' wanted to appoint the first woman attorney general but in this latest search had given 'very serious consideration' to four male candidates before settling on Ms Reno. She is unmarried and childless and enjoys a 'squeaky clean' reputation in Miami. In response to the inevitable question, she asserted that she had never hired illegal immigrants and had paid all appropriate taxes. Ms Zoe Baird, first nominated by Mr Clinton, withdrew after disclosing she had broken the law in employing two illegal immigrants as household help. Judge Kimba Wood, top of the president's next short list but not nominated, also backed out because of controversy over her nanny. Ms Reno appears to bring to bear some qualifications lacked by both Ms Baird, predominantly a corporate lawyer with no trial experience, and Judge Wood, appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan and best known for presiding over the trial of Mr Michael Milken, the Wall Street financier. She has been, by all accounts, an extremely successful court attorney, with a number of notable criminal convictions under her belt in cases involving child abuse, sexual harassment and racial discrimination. She said yesterday that she was 'personally opposed' to capital punishment, which Mr Clinton supports, but had sought the death penalty in some of the cases she had prosecuted. She runs a 900-strong department in Miami, handling, Mr Clinton said, 120,000 cases a year, and thus has the administrative experience less evident in the other two. She has also been active in various local drug prevention programmes. These qualities should appeal to the Senate judiciary committee when it considers her nomination. Her political connections also seem far stronger than those of Ms Baird and Judge Wood, both largely unknown to the Democratic party.</p>

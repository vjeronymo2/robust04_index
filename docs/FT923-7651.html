			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Mutual suspicion across the causeway: A look at the climate of mistrust between Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore SINGAPORE'S parliament this month approved the construction of a second bridge across the narrow stretch of water separating Singapore from the state of Johor in Malaysia. The SDollars 169m (Pounds 59m) project, already approved by Malaysia, is due for completion in early 1995 and marks another step towards closer economic links between the two countries. But news of the bridge comes at a time of tense and difficult relations between them. The immediate and most visible argument between Singapore and Malaysia concerns a bleak island about 50km north-east of Singapore. Administered by Singapore for more than 100 years, the island sits on an important shipping lane and has a lighthouse and radar station. The Singaporeans call the guano-covered rock by its Portuguese name, Pedra Branca. To Malaysia, it is Batu Puteh. In the early 1970s Malaysia lodged a claim to the island. This year a group of Malaysians from Johor made an abortive attempt to plant a flag on it. A shouting match developed between the two countries after a series of tit-for-tat arrests of fishermen. The Malaysians accused Singapore of being high-handed and arrogant: there was talk in Singapore of Singaporeans being maltreated in Johor. An MP of the governing People's Action party in Singapore advised his compatriots against visiting Malaysia. While senior government officials on both sides have acted to calm things down, other issues have raised hackles. In the latest incident, Malaysians were angered by a guide book published in Singapore and depicting the Malaysian town of Johor Bahru, just across the causeway from Singapore, as a sexual pleasure haunt, full of 'love hotels'. The book was mistaken, they said. Furthermore, Singapore was allowing writers licence abroad it would never permit at home. The publishers withdrew the book. Underlying these quarrels, some petty, some more substantial, are broader problems of history and race. In the early 1960s, Singapore was part of the post-colonial Malaysian Federation. Malaysia is more than 50 per cent Malay but has a large Chinese minority. Singapore is 76 per cent Chinese but 15 per cent of its 2.7m people are Malay. Even before the days of the federation, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former Singaporean prime minister, had campaigned for 'A Malaysian Malaysia, not a Malay Malaysia'. In turn the Malays, already fearful of Chinese economic domination, saw the rise of a Chinese city state - 'A Chinese nut in a Malay nutcracker'. Malaysia's rulers warned of bloodshed. Singapore left the federation after less than two years. Since then the two countries have gone their own ways. Malaysia is governed by Malays: the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) has had uninterrupted control of government for nearly 20 years. Singapore, though its politics are not divided on such sharply racial lines as in Malaysia, is run predominantly by the Chinese. Each country is acutely sensitive to issues of race. Though only a few hundred yards of water separates them, neither country allows the sale of each other's newspapers. There are other restrictions. The many thousands of Singaporeans who travel to Malaysia each week have to pay their government an exit tax. Singapore also insists motorists have at least half a tank of petrol, lest they take advantage of cheaper prices in Malaysia. Singapore recently caused a furore in Malaysia when it introduced a daily SDollars 20 charge for Malaysian vehicles travelling into the island republic. Such measures seem to fly in the face of the increasing economic interdependence between Singapore and the south of Malaysia. Singapore imports water and natural gas from Johor. Many Singaporean companies have their main manufacturing base across the causeway. Over the past 10 years Singaporean companies have invested nearly MDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 312m) in 540 projects in the state. To some in Malaysia this is evidence of creeping Singaporean - that is, Chinese - economic control. 'We must guard against Johor becoming Singapore's Kowloon,' says one senior Malaysian official. Singapore maintains what is generally perceived to be one of the best equipped and trained military machines in the Asian region. It spends 6 per cent of its GDP each year on defence, one of the highest ratios in the world. Though a fraction the size of its neighbours, Singapore has a bigger air force than Malaysia and Indonesia combined. Military analysts are also impressed with the Singapore army's more than 300 light tanks. Government advertising often reminds people of the fate of Kuwait and other small states. By contrast, Malaysia's armed forces have been starved of funds and badly equipped. In what seems in part a reaction to Singapore's defence build-up, Malaysia has recently embarked on a multi-million dollar defence procurement programme, much of the equipment being supplied by Britain. Mr Musa Hitam, once a contender for power in Malaysia and a former special envoy to the UN, is concerned about what he sees as a lack of sensitivity on the part of an up-and-coming generation of leaders on both sides of the causeway. 'I worry when I see the new leaders in Singapore and Malaysia responding to events in both countries not in the manner handled by the old guard. If this level of tolerance is lowered, we are going to have problems.'</p>

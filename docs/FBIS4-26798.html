			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Rong Song: "Only Those Without Human Nature </F> Plant Bombs"]    [Text] Tehran, June 24 (XINHUA) -- "Only those people who  have no human nature planted bombs in holy places like the  shrine of Imam Reza" in the time of Ashura when people were  commemorating the fourth Shi'ite Imam Hussein, a pilgrim told  XINHUA Thursday [23 June] in Mashhad.    A group of foreign correspondents visited Mashhad Thursday  and Friday at the invitation of the Iranian Ministry of Culture  and Islamic Guidance, however, non-Moslem correspondents were  rejected entry to the shrine to see the bombing spot.    A bomb exploded Monday inside the shrine of Imam Reza,  killing 24 people and injuring more than 100 others.    In Qha'em hospital, Ahmad Amir Dervari, a worker of the  hospital, said that no one could imagine that a bomb exploded in  the holiest place of the shrine of Imam Reza.    Telling correspondents that his legs were wounded by broken  glasses and the bomb fire and his right ear deafened by the bomb  sound, Dervari said he did not believe that it was a bomb at  first but thought it was something dropping from the ceiling of  the shrine.    "When other people told me a bomb exploded I found I could  not breathe," Dervari said. "I crawled to the door and was  rescued by the people outside."    Mohammad Reza Mahdavian told correspondents tearfully that  when he heard the explosion he felt that his back was burned and  after touching his back he found his backing was bleeding.    He said he was lucky because the bomb was planted some  distance away from him and urged the foreign correspondents to  tell the world that the Iranian people are not afraid of dying.    "Only the MKO (Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization) and the  enemies of Islam can do such things," he said. "They want to  root out Islam."    Davud Ariyannejad, 20-years-old middle school student, was  burned totally from head to toe and his right eye was blinded by  the bomb.    He was only one meter away from the bomb, he said, adding  that he went the shrine to pray with one of his classmates and  his classmate was also injured and hospitalized in another  hospital.    In Imam Reza Hospital, a 14-year-old boy showed foreign  correspondents the wound in his stomach, saying that he and his  cousin were praying in the shrine when the bomb exploded and  after three hours his parents got the news that he was wounded  in the explosion.    Ghasemian, a 54-year-old worker from Iran's northwestern  city  of Tabriz, said that he came to the shrine with his family, his  7-year- old daughter was killed and his left leg was cut off in  the explosion.    Doctors in the hospital told correspondents that his another  son was also killed in the explosion and four members of his  family were injured in the bomb blast.    A doctor said that 25 people were hospitalized in his  section  after the explosion and many others left the hospital after the  treatment of their minor injures.    In a press conference Thursday night, Ayatollah Abbas Vaez  Tabassi, the custodian of the shrine of Imam Reza, said that 24  people were killed and 120-130 others wounded in the explosion,  adding that the figure of the wounded may be even higher.    It is difficult to count because some people left after  treatment of minor injuries at hospital, the representative of  Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i said.    He denied any involvement of Sunni people in the bomb blast,  saying that it was the MKO members that engineered and carried  out the preplanned explosion.    The Iranian authorities have undeniable evidence that the  explosion was carried by the MKO members, he said, the evidence  will be announced to the public.</p>

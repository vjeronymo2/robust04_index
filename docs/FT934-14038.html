			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Euro Disney to shed 950 jobs as part of corporate review EURO Disney, the financially troubled leisure group, plans to cut 950 of the 11,100 jobs at EuroDisneyland, its lavish theme park near Paris, as part of a corporate restructuring plan. The proposed job cuts form part of Euro Disney's increasingly desperate efforts to haul itself out of the red. The group, which has been badly affected by the European recession and adverse currency changes, has asked Walt Disney, its US parent company, for a guarantee of financial support while it tries to restructure its finances. Euro Disney has already made substantial job cuts since Euro-Disneyland opened in April 1992. The number of employees peaked at 19,000 in summer 1992, but had fallen to 16,000 by summer this year. Most of those cuts concerned seasonal staff employed on short-term contracts, whereas the new cutbacks will dramatically reduce the number of full-time employees. Yesterday's rationalisation package, which will mainly affect Euro Disney's administrative staff rather than the operational workforce at the park and hotels, is the result of a comprehensive review of the group's corporate structure. Euro Disney, which is expected next month to disclose a net loss of about FFr1.8bn (Pounds 209m) for the year to September 30, plans to merge the management of the theme park and the hotels, which have previously been run separately. It will also forge closer links between the marketing and sales operations of the EuroDisneyland complex. The group will on Friday present the job cut proposals to its trade unions for approval. Under French law, any job losses must be sanctioned by a complex legal procedure which, Euro Disney estimated, would take about three months. In the meantime, Euro Disney is continuing negotiations with Walt Disney, the powerful US leisure and entertainment group which is its 49 per cent shareholder, over the terms of its restructuring. Euro Disney, which is threatened by serious cashflow problems as business slows during the slack winter season, needs an injection of capital to reduce its debts and to stabilise its finances. The company yesterday declined to comment on the progress of the negotiations. However, the final restructuring package, which it initially hoped to complete by early next year, could include a rights issue and possibly an additional injection of capital from Walt Disney.</p>

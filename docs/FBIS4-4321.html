			<p>CSO     [Text] Foreigners do not understand ABRI's [Republic of  Indonesia Armed Forces] role in East Timor. They think that it  has the same function as their own military, whose only tasks  are security and making war, and so they think that that is  ABRI's function in East Timor.    The Governor of East Timor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares made  that statement in response to questions from reporters in Dili  yesterday morning after inaugurating and swearing in Drs  Sudarmadi as the head of the East Timor Regional Office of the  Department of Information. Sudarmadi is replacing Drs Amir Ali  Nasution. The inauguration and transfer of power was at the  direction of Minister of Information H. Harmoko Directive Number  202-A/SK/BK/JB/1993 dated 19 December 1993.    The new official was formerly the head of the Department of  Information's Surakarta District Office (Central Java), and the  former official will be transferred to Jakarta.    Governor Abilio said that ABRI's presence is still needed in  East Timor because out of the approximately seven ABRI  battalions serving in East Timor only one has security duties  for stabilizing the region and the other six are territorial  battalions whose function is to aid the villagers.    The governor also made this assertion in response to several  western countries which have warned ABRI to withdraw immediately  from East Timor. Governor Abilio added that East Timor needs  ABRI very much. The facts show that ABRI's presence in East  Timor is helping to advance the welfare of the people in the  countryside because ABRI lives with the villagers.    Antonio Freitas Parada, chairman of the East Timor DPRD  [Provincial Parliament] made a similar statement when he was  interviewed by PEMBARUAN at Comoro Airport in Dili before he and  the governor left for Denpasar, Bali, to attend the Udayana IX  Military District Command transfer of power ceremony.    Parada said that foreigners might still think that East  Timor  is like Bosnia or Cambodia and that ABRI is just fighting here.  On the contrary, ABRI is the people's workmate in the gardens,  in the rice fields and in the villages.    He said that the residents of East Timor have only been  Indonesian citizens for 18 years. There are still many things  that the people of East Timor need to learn from ABRI in order  to become good Indonesian citizens; for example, they are  learning many things from ABRI's territorial activities in the  villages about how the land is cultivated in other provinces,  about how to speak the national language and about Indonesian  culture, which the people of East Timor must still learn to  understand.    "Believe it or not, the villagers speak better Indonesian  than the city dwellers because they associate with ABRI every  day," said Parada.</p>

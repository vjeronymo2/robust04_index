			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- A Bank of Japan [BOJ]  source on Friday [4 March] welcomed the decline in the U.S.  jobless rate for February as good for bilateral relations and  the global economy as well. "This could be a factor which  softens the recent stiff bilateral relations (between Japan and  the United States), and it's a stabilizing factor for the world  economy," the source said.    The labor department reported the U.S. jobless rate fell to  6.5 percent in February from 6.7 percent in January, with  nonfarm payrolls growing by 217,000.    The central bank source said the February increase in  nonfarm  payrolls was larger than expected despite cold weather for that  month.    "This points to a recovery of the U.S. economy and an  increase in competitiveness in the U.S. Manufacturing sector,"  he said. He did not elaborate.</p>

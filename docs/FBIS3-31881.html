			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Popularity of Party List Leaders"] </F>   [Text] At the request of MAGYAR HIRLAP, the Median Public  Opinion and Market Research Institute will, until the elections,  regularly examine the popularity or the parties' list leaders  and how well they are known.    At the top of the list, no move has been made from December  1993 to January 1994: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party  (MSZP) chairman], [Republic Party (KP) Chairman] Janos Palotas,  and Zoltan Kiraly [Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP)  chairman] continue to be in the first three places.    However, it cannot be ignored that these politicians are not  in the same position: In the case of the Socialists, the party  and its first man are equally popular, but the very popular  Palotas and Kiraly lead parties whose support does not even  reach the minimum required to get into parliament. People link  Horn to his party with rather big certainty, while the party  links to the other two popular politicians are unknown to many  people.    By the beginning of 1994, almost all significant political  parties named their leading person on the election list. From  now on, it is of outstanding importance on the basis of what  information the citizens will make their decision on 8 May,  whether they know who the main actors of political life are,  what they represent, and how popular they are.    Since the beginning of December, Peter Boross who was  elected  prime minister in the meantime, has become known virtually to  the whole adult population. Although he had previously also  been among the known politicians, in the first month as prime  minister, this increased by almost 10 percent and reached the  virtual maximum. The level of how well known the other list  leaders are has not changed in the past month apart from  accidental variations, and Gabor Kuncze's [list leader of the  Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] popularity and how well he is  known, which had formerly increased fast, has also stagnated.    On the basis of how well they know the politicians, the  citizens can be put into three groups: The first group consists  of people who know the politician, have an opinion about him,  and are aware of which party he belongs to; the second group  consists of those who know the politician's name, can express  their opinion on him, but do not know, or incorrectly know, his  party affiliation; and people in the third group have heard of  the politician's name but will not form a view on him and do not  know where he belongs.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Knowledge About the Parties' List Leaders (as percentage of the questioned |  |people)                                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name              |Knows His Party   |Has a View on Him |Knows His Name    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozsef Torgyan    |80                |92                |97                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Viktor Orban      |77                |89                |94                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Boross      |71                |92                |97                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gyula Horn        |68                |92                |95                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Laszlo Surjan     |50                |88                |92                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gabor Kuncze      |36                |64                |65                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Istvan Csurka     |34                |88                |93                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Janos Palotas     |33                |90                |93                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zoltan Kiraly     |20                |82                |83                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tamas Nagy        |17                |44                |45                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Out of the 10 list leaders, people know the party  affiliation  of five on the average (12 percent could not name the party of  any of the politicians and no one was able to name them all).    Four-fifths of the people who were surveyed know about the  best-known Jozsef Torgyan and that he belongs to the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP]. Viktor Orban's party [Federation of  Young Democrats (Fidesz)] membership is also well known. A  quarter of the questioned people were unable to link Gyula Horn  and Peter Boross to a party, but the number of people who gave  the wrong party name is negligible in the case of these two.    The party link of Laszlo Surjan [Christian Democratic  People's Party (KDNP) chairman] is only known correctly by 53  percent of those who know him, 37 percent cannot link him to any  party, and 8 percent gave the wrong party name (out of this, 5  percent said he was an MDF member). Only a little more than  half of the people who know Gabor Kuncze are also aware that he  is the prime minister candidate of the SZDSZ, and the proportion  of the wrong answers is similar in his case, 7 percent, but  there is not a typical wrong answer.    Few people know which parties the otherwise popular leaders  of the smaller parties represent. Half of the people who know  Istvan Csurka [chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party,  MIEP] do not know to which party he belongs, and 12 percent gave  incorrect answers (9 percent of these still think he is an MDF  member). More than one-third of the questioned people cannot  place Janos Palotas on the party palette, and one-quarter link  him to the wrong party (19 percent of these said he is a member  of the Entrepreneurs' Party). Zoltan Kiraly's party position is  the least known for the public, almost two-thirds of the people  did not even attempt to place him anywhere, and 19 percent gave  the wrong party name.    The popularity of politicians is shown on the following  table.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Popularity of Party List Leaders Among Those Who Know the Politician         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name                                  |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gyula Horn                            |65                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Janos Palotas                         |64                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zoltan Kiraly                         |60                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Laszlo Surjan                         |57                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Viktor Orban                          |56                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gabor Kuncze                          |52                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Boross                          |51                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tamas Nagy                            |46                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozsef Torgyan                        |29                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Istvan Csurka                         |21                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      On this question, people were allowed to give their views  on all politicians, and as can be seen, the popularity of most  of the list leaders was said to be average or a little better  than average. However, when people said whom they would welcome  at the head of the government after the next elections -- that  is, when they were only able to select one person for this  important political role -- most named Horn.    Although there is little difference in the general views on  most leading politicians, these differ as regards their  suitability for the prime ministerial position.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who Should Be the Next Prime Minister? (percent)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gyula Horn                            |22                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Boross                          |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Janos Palotas                         |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Viktor Orban                          |8                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gabor Kuncze                          |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Laszlo Surjan                         |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zoltan Kiraly                         |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozsef Torgyan                        |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Istvan Csurka                         |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tamas Nagy                            |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |None of them                          |10                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Does not know                         |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Nine percent more people would welcome the current prime  minister back in his position than the number of people who  would vote for his party. Horn would also be welcome as prime  minister by 4 percent more people than who would vote for the  MSZP. However, 3-4 percent fewer people can see the leaders of  the liberal parties as prime minister than the number of people  who would vote for their parties.    Although Palotas continues to be popular and, for many  people, appears to be a politician suitable to be leader, his  party has not yet been able to utilize this popularity. The  situation is similar in the case of the MSZDP where the party  chairman is considered to be popular by many people but this  sympathy does not come across to his party -- although it is  true that not many people would like him to be prime minister  either.</p>

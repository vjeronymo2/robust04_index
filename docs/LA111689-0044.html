Kern County Superior Court Judge Clarence Westra Jr. said he  accepted a plea bargain involving Robert Lee Crosswhite with the knowledge that  because of Crosswhite's age and health problems, he is unlikely to go free  again. Crosswhite was accused of molesting six children, ages 8 to 13.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): New mood of austerity - Everywhere, companies are putting production lines on short time / Spain THE multinationals manufacturing cars in Spain tell a common tale of losses and, also, of big investments geared to put their operations back into the black. The two themes of the tale run in parallel. The losses are as much a product of depressed markets as of continuing capital investment programmes. The investments firmly underline the shared belief in Spain's future as one of Europe's leading car producing centres. Nissan Motor Iberica, which is 66 per cent owned by the Japanese car manufacturer, posted losses of Pta14.3bn last year. Profits at Ford fell by 47.8 per cent to Pta10.7bn and Seat, Volkswagen's 100 per cent-owned Spanish subsidiary went into the red for the first time in four years, registering 1992 losses of Pta12.7bn. By the first quarter of this year, Nissan was preparing the markets for even greater losses. At the end of March the Spanish company's losses topped Pta11bn, against Pta1.7bn in the first three months of last year, and Nissan, the parent company, announced it would would wholly subscribe an immediate capital increase of Pta5bn, at par, for the Barcelona-based producer . Nissan Motor Iberica's board approved further capital increases up to a maximum of Pta27.8bn and the parent company said it was studying a further Pta5bn capital injection this year and an equivalent investment in 1994. The pattern of losses plus greater investment was evident elsewhere in the domestic car sector. Seat, which expects to post further losses this year, has invested a total of Pta244.5bn in a new plant, also near Barcelona, which was inaugurated last spring. The plant, possibly the last great car production centre to be built in western Europe, is destined to manufacture a new Ibiza model. Ford had earlier chosen Spain as the production centre for its 'Sigma' motors. This involves investment in the region of Pta70bn and the addition of 800 highly qualified employees to the US company's 12,000 labour force at its plant near Valencia. The 'Sigma' motors are based on a four-cylinder, 16-valve prototype and consist of a full range of models up to 1,400cc. Such investments amount to a courageous long-term bet. Already at the begining of this year domestic industry experts were forecasting a fall of between 5 and 7 per cent for 1993 in the internal car market. The final figures could be a lot worse than the most pessimistic estimates in that initial forecast. Recession continues to make big inroads on the Spanish economy and the government is now saying that that 1993 GDP will show a negative growth of 0.5 per cent. Independent economists say the GDP is likely to closer to minus 1 per cent. The Spain-based manufacturers are even more concerned about the economic stagnation elsewhere in Europe. This is because Europe is the domestic industry's main client and has in the past absorbed as much as 70 per cent the sector's output. To a degree, the falling demand in Europe will be compensated by the shrinking value of the peseta which has depreciated by more than 20 per cent ion the past 12 months against most leading currencies. The investments however, in the main, date back to the buoyant late 1980s period and it would prove even more costly to stop them short at this stage. Just as Seat has its hopes fixed on the models that will roll out of its new plant early next year and as Ford linked up a good measure of its future in Spain to the 'Sigma' motor, so Nissan Motor Iberica has set great store by the launch this year of a four-wheel vehicle called Terrena II and of a people carrier vehicle named Serena. Both the Japanese subsidiary's products are aimed at fast-growing niche markets and the Terrena II will have the added boost of a joint marketing effort that will involve Ford's pan-European distribution networks. Car manufacturers in Spain, as elsewhere, are nevertheless taking no chances. Across the board, the companies are placing production lines on short time to cut down on stocks, reducing their labour force and negotiating hard to force unions to moderate wage increases. Indicative of the new mood of austerity was Seat's decision this year to freeze executive salaries until further notice.</p>

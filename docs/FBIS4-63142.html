			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report in the "Regions" column: "Mintimer </F> Shaymiyev Is Against the Idea of Creating a Volga Peoples  Confederation"]    [Text] A a press conference in Kazan, Tatarstan President  Mintimer Shaymiyev first commented on the idea of establishing a  Confederation of Volga Peoples which has been repeatedly  proposed by national movements in the Volga republics.  According to the Tatarstan President, "this idea is unfeasible  and nonviable because the majority of the republics and oblasts  in the Volga area (excluding Tatarstan) have signed the  Federation Treaty." "It is primarily up to the Russian  leadership to think about such problems and also to make sure in  particular that the treaties and agreements already signed  should work. If these documents only remain on paper, such  ideas are bound to persist," Mintimer Shaymiyev said.    True, such a position, according to Mr. Shaymiyev, does not  refer to the sphere of "small-time diplomacy" -- the conclusion  of horizontal accords with neighboring republics and oblasts.  Here, on the other hand, in his opinion, "a very interesting  development occurs." After the privatization of local  enterprises, a substantial portion of shares is retained by the  republics' governments.    According to Mintimer Shaymiyev, in the very near future "we  should think what to do with these shares" and whether it is not  a good idea to trade part of them, for instance, for shares of  related enterprises in neighboring regions. This form of  cooperation and integration, in the Tatarstan President's  opinion, will be most effective.</p>

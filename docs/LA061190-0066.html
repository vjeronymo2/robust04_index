			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY DIGEST: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> TEACHERS, DISTRICT TO DISCUSS REPAYMENT  </P> <P> Representatives of the Simi Valley teachers union will meet with district  officials today to discuss how to repay an estimated $300,000 in salary  overpayments to instructors caused by a clerical error.  </P> <P> Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Valley Educators Assn., said that one  option would be to cut back a projected 11% raise for teachers next year as a  way to reimburse the district.  </P> <P> "It's a possibility," Davenport said. "We have made a proposal to them, and now  we need to talk about the figures. We're going to meet Monday to see if we can  resolve the situation."  </P> <P> A recent in-house audit revealed that the district's 750 teachers were overpaid  $200 to $400 during the 1989-1990 school year as a result of a clerical error.  School officials said someone apparently misread the teachers' salary schedule  when the district was putting together its budget last June.  </P> <P> "It was a mistake, and now we're rectifying it," said Dan Hill, district  director of personnel.  </P> <P> Hill declined to talk about details of the upcoming meeting with union  officials or the proposed cutback in the teachers' raise.  </P> <P> "They're willing to work with us," Hill said.  </P> <P> "They're very cooperative."  </P> <P> The discovery of the salary error comes at a time when the district is  struggling to cope with a projected $8-million deficit for next year. The  district has proposed to lay off 32 temporary teachers and reassign dozens of  administrators to lower-level positions with reduced salaries to offset the  deficit. CARLOS LOZANO  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S GOLF;  </P> <P> SHEEHAN STAGGERS, BUT STILL WINS EASILY  </P> <P> All Patty Sheehan was trying to do was hold on. And she did, despite a final  round of four-over-par 75 in the Jamaica Classic.  </P> <P> It was still good enough to get the job done by three strokes in the first LPGA  tournament of the year.  </P> <P> Sheehan began the day with a five-shot cushion and easily won the 54-hole  tournament with a 1-under 212 total. She earned the $75,000 first prize plus a  bonus of $60,000.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley, Lynn Connelly and Jane Geddes tied for second at 215. Patti Rizzo  and Muffin Spencer-Devlin were at 216.  </P> <P> Sheehan, who shot 69 on the first day and 68 on the second, began the final day  well. But after she birdied the par-five fifth hole, she got bogeys on four of  the next six holes.  </P> <P> Sheehan, 33, recovered and parred the next six holes. With her victory almost  assured, she finished the tournament with another bogey.  </P> <P> Bradley made a late bid with a four-under 67 that included three birdies and  six pars on the front nine.  </P> <P> Spencer-Devlin and Maggie Will finished with 68s and Geddes and Rizzo ended at  69.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel shot the best round of the tournament, a 65, but finished at 219.  Defending champion Betsy King shot 77 and wound up at 224.  </P></p>

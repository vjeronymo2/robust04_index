			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evcon commented that vent dampers are inappropriate designs because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damper location and isolated combustion design. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered combustion box dampers instead of vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dampers. The Department knows of no design considerations that would render  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion box dampers inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evcon also suggested that condensing designs and intermittent ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices are inappropriate because of excessive cost. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1&hyph;2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has incorporated the costs for materials, components,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance, and installation into the Engineering Analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evcon further commented that expense and noise problems exist with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulsed combustion furnaces. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department acknowledges these points and notes that pulsed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion is no longer on the list of design options. In eliminating this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design option, the Department reasoned that non-pulsed combustion technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can achieve efficiencies equivalent to pulsed-combustion technology at a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost. This is particularly true for manufacturers having to pay patent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> royalties for pulse combustion technology. Manufacturing cost data from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers supported this conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, Evcon commented that corrosion and cost problems exist with two-stage and modulating burner designs. (Evcon, No. 76 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Engineering Analysis, the Department assumed that material costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for the concentric flue/supply air assembly) would increase because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to design for possible intermittent condensation in two-stage non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensing furnaces. Non-condensing modulating furnaces are not included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present list of design options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement furnaces must be able to fit into the same spaces as the units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being replaced. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not believe that any of the studied design options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in significant space problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evcon also commented that American Society of Heating, Refrigerating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Air-conditioning Engineers Standard 103&hyph;1982 is inadequate for the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of various design options and urged that American National Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineers Standard 103&hyph;88 be adopted. (Evcon, No. 76 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modifications to the test procedures for furnaces, which address these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Kitchen Ranges and Ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments on classes for conventional ranges and ovens ranged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Aloha Systems Inc.'s recommendation that all electric cooktops be one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product class to Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's proposal to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several classes to those proposed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking. Specifically, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that DOE add, as classes, electric cooktops with grill/griddle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without downdraft feature, and for gas cooktops_grill/griddle with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downdraft feature, grill/griddle without downdraft feature with and without an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric cord, and warming/simmer burners. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 38).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments supported the range/oven product classes that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Four gas utilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Gas Association, Energen, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company -  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Operations, and the Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., all supported the classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected by DOE for gas cooktops and gas ovens. (Southern Gas Association,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 4 at 7; Energen, No. 12 at 14; South Carolina Electric and Gas Company -  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Operations, No. 34 at 6; and the Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., No. 57 at 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

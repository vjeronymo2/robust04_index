Among those attending the opening ceremony were Li Ruihuan,  member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and chairman  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, and Li Peiyao, vice-chairman of the  Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress. They  cut the ribbon for the festival.    The whole city was on holiday today, and residents thronged  to view the ice lanterns and ice carvings.    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication today issued  special postcards in honor of the festival.    About 20,000 cu m [cubic meters] of ice were used to make  the  ice carvings, and new technologies, light sources and materials  were also employed to make the exhibits more attractive.    In addition, trading activities will be held during the  festival. Commodities for trading will be worth tens of billions  of yuan, more than at any of the previous festivals.    It is expected that hundreds of thousands of visitors from  other parts of China as well as from the United States, Japan,  the Republic of Korea, Canada, Singapore, Pakistan, Switzerland  and other countries will attend the festival.    The first ice and snow festival was held in 1985.</p>

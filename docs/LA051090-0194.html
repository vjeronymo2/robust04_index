			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FUND DRIVE: Momentum is building at UC Irvine to create a $250,000 endowed  professorship in Jewish history, long on UCI's wish list. . . . The county's  Jewish community already has raised $190,000, with an ultimate goal of $500,000  for a more prestigious endowed chair. One big gift -- $125,000 -- came from  Orange County swap meet chieftain Robert Teller and his wife, Rita. History  chair Michael Johnson wants a "really dynamic" professor for the post.

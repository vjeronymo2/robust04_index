			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH LAKE TAHOE;  </P> <P> 140 CAMP IN SNOW FOR CHANCE AT HOMES  </P> <P> Driven by a rare chance for permission to build homes in this scenic ski and  gambling resort, about 140 people spent a fourth day camped outside the city  library in snow and sub-zero temperatures. The would-be builders -- some  huddled in crudely built igloos and snow caves -- held their ground even though  the county government Friday withdrew a plan to issue 123 coveted permits on a  first-come, first-served basis this morning. A smaller contingent waited  outside City Hall, hoping for a chance at a separate batch of permits  controlled by the city government.  </P></p>

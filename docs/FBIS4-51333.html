			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao He: "State to Expand Post-Doctoral Work"] </F>   [Text] China plans to expand the enrolment of  post-doctoral scholars to train more young talent for the  country's long-term development.    The move, covering the social and natural sciences, aims to  raise the number in post-doctoral programmes from 1,500 to 3,000  by the year 2000, said Cheng Lianzhang, the Vice-Minister of  Personnel.    In January, the government raised annual funding for  post-doctoral scholars from 15,000 yuan ($1,700) to 20,000 yuan  ($2,300).    Last year 728 post-doctoral scholars were recruited by  almost  300 work stations in 165 higher-education and research  institutes nationwide.    Enrolment of such scholars has increased 27 percent annually  since 1988, according to the Ministry of Personnel.    The increase shows the importance the State pays to the work  of post-doctoral scholars, Cheng said.    The fund covers the salary and preliminary research  expenditures of scholars, who usually undertake two to three  research projects, including key State undertakings, during  their two-year training.    While enterprises and public organizations are donating more  money to post-doctoral projects, government funds have increased  by 30 per cent annually.    Since the post-doctoral system was introduced in 1985, China  has poured 115.56 million yuan ($13.34 million) to support  research.    And more than 1,300 post-doctoral scholars have come out of  the two-year training programmes at the stations.    Most of them have been employed as senior researchers and 32  became tutors for doctorate students, said Zhang Xiaowen. Vice  Minister of the State Education Commission.</p>

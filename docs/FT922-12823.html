			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Mount Etna experts claim success EXPERTS battling the flow of lava on Mount Etna have claimed their first victory after explosives appeared to have slowed the river of molten rock threatening the village of Zafferana, Reuter reports. Italian navy experts set off 400lbs of explosives to break open the walls of a channel down which the lava is flowing from the volcano at a rate of five yards an hour. Much of the lava then poured out of the channel and dispersed, considerably reducing the main flow. Mr Nicola Capria, civil protection minister, said: 'The situation is now less dramatic but. . . the monster is very, very strong.' Further down Etna, the lava engulfed a small white-walled cottage within 1,000 yards of the outskirts of Zafferana.</p>

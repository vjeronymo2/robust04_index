			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: JAL set to reveal heavy unrealised forex loss Japan Airlines is poised to disclose a long-suspected unrealised foreign exchange loss amounting to many billions of yen, the result of a misjudged currency hedge. The group, Japan's largest airline, refused to confirm reports that its unrealised loss stood at Y45bn (Dollars 450m). It said details of its finances would be published with the interim earnings report on October 28. A company official did confirm the existence of a 10-year Dollars 3.6bn forward currency contract, taken out in 1986. JAL began taking out forward dollar agreements after the 1985 Plaza Accord to curb the dollar, at that time valued at Y240. According to market reports, unconfirmed by JAL, the airline contracted to buy dollars at an average rate of Y185, against the current rate of Y99.58. JAL is among several large Japanese companies expected to declare heavy currency losses when they report first-half results at the end of this month and early in November. Until now, companies have been able to subsume currency losses in depreciation and operating costs. However, the finance ministry has demanded that listed companies declare unrealised profits or losses from forward currency trading, starting in the current tax year. JAL needs to raise an average of Dollars 800m a year for buying aircraft, about 40 per cent of which it finances through forward rate agreements such as this, with the remainder raised at current exchange rates, said the official. The aim of the new disclosure rules, introduced from the end of March, is to avoid shocks such as the Y165bn foreign exchange loss on unauthorised dealings at Showa Shell, an oil refiner, in February last year and the Y152.5bn currency deficit from Kashima Oil, another refiner, in April. The early indications of JAL's loss have already caused a mild shock, sending the share price down 1.3 per cent to Y737 in Tokyo yesterday.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Housing recovery reinforced Further evidence of recovery in the housing market came yesterday from a Law Society study showing a steady increase in the number of conveyancing transactions and from architects. The society said the number of transactions was likely to return this year to 1990 levels at about 1.4m. The number peaked in 1988 at 2.15m and fell to 1.1m in 1991. The number of solicitors' firms in business continued to rise during the recession while conveyancing prices and overall income from conveyancing fell sharply. Since 1986 the real cost of conveying an averagely-priced house in the Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 50,000 bracket has fallen 53 per cent. For houses in the Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 range the fall is 45 per cent. Meanwhile, a survey published by the Royal Institute of British Architects said the outlook for architects' workloads was the best for five years. The survey said 40 per cent of architects expected their workload to increase in the next six months compared with 18 per cent who expected output to fall.</p>

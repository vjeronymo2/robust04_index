			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Russian crisis boosts platinum PLATINUM PRICES were given two shots in the arm this week, first by concern about supplies from crisis-ridden Russia, and then by news that the biggest producer was cutting output. Boris Yeltsin's troubles had already pushed the price up by nearly Dollars 4 a troy ounce when Rustenburg Platinum of South Africa announced on Tuesday that it had decided to close the Boschfontein trackless mining shaft because the low level of platinum and rhodium prices had made its operation uneconomic. News of the cut, which analysts estimated would reduce production by between 140,000 and 200,000 ounces, 3.6 to 5.1 per cent of western world supply, helped the platinum price up to Dollars 357.30 an ounce before it slipped back yesterday to Dollars 355.60 yesterday, up Dollars 5.35 on the week. With Impala Platinum, South Africa's second biggest producer, saying it was not planning, at this stage, to follow Rustenburg's lead a London dealer commented that the news was 'good for Dollars 2 or Dollars 4'. He added, however, that there was 'some pretty stiff resistance at Dollars 358'. At the London Metal Exchange nickel prices were also influenced by the Russian crisis and the resulting uptrend was hardly dented by yesterday's news that Falconbridge of Canada had decided to cut production this year by much less than had previously been planned. The cash quotation closed at Dollars 6,095 a tonne, up Dollars 40 on the day and Dollars 147.50 on the week. Falconbridge said it would shut its nickel mining and smelter operations at Sudbury, Ontario, for only two weeks instead of the ten. 'The company has reassessed its strategy of assisting to rebalance the markets through an extended shutdown. It is now apparent that this goal cannot be achieved,' it explained. The company now plans to make the most of its advantage as a low-cost producer to compete for business in the heavily oversupplied nickel market. Stocks in LME registered warehouses, which have been swollen by metal flooding out of the former Soviet Union, rose another 798 tonnes this week to a record 86,538 tonnes. The rest of the LME metals ended lower on the week, the biggest fall being in three months delivery copper, which closed last night at Pounds 1,465 a tonne, down Pounds 30.50 on the day and Pounds 18.50 on the week. The firmer early tone had been bolstered by the Russian factor, but gains were lost as concern about Chilean labour problems faded. A dispute over production bonuses at Chile Copper Corporation's Chuquicamata, the world's largest copper mine, ended yesterday when the company agreed to payment reviews, union leaders said. Surging shipments from the former eastern bloc countries have also been weighing down lead prices at the LME, where the cash quotation fell in mid-week to Pounds 266 a tonne, the lowest level for six and a half years. The price recovered somewhat, closing yesterday at Pounds 2169.75 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 2.25 down on the week. At prices like that, suggested Mr Stephen Briggs of Minerals &amp; Metals Research Services, not one lead producer in the world was making a profit. He expected substantial production cuts to be made before long, but warned: 'There will be no substantial price rise until we see a solid, sustained increase in demand'. The London robusta coffee market put in a firmer performance, though it failed in successive attempts to break back above Dollars 900 a tonne for May futures, the support level that was breached last week. Yesterday the price eased Dollars 8 to Dollars 890 a tonne, up Dollars 10 on the week. Coffee investors were given little encouragement by the proceedings at the International Coffee Organisation council meeting in London, where little progress appeared to be being made towards agreeing a price-supporting International Coffee Agreement based on a revived export quota system. The sugar market spent the first half of the week carrying out the price 'correction' that many traders thought was overdue following the recent sustained rise. The July futures position in New York, which ended last week at a three-year peak of 12.54 cents a lb, slipped to 11.75 cents at one point before recovering to 12.13 cents in late trading yesterday. Traders said the market was still supported by supply tightness and bullish chart patterns. Yesterday traders in New York were encouraged by a newspaper report that Cuban sugar mills had been operating at less than half their capacity in the middle of this month. Attention has been focussed on Cuba by hopeful sugar bulls since it was hit two weeks ago by the storms that swept the eastern seaboard of the US. The earlier stages in this year's price rise were chiefly influenced by drought-induced cuts in Thai crop forecasts - down from the initial 5m tonnes to 3.51m, which would be the lowest level for five years. The cocoa market had a see-sawing week that ended with the May position exactly in the middle of its Pounds 24 trading range at Pounds 687 a tonne, down Pounds 10 on balance. It started with a sharpish retreat in response to the failure of last week's attempt to negotiate an International Cocoa Agreement with economic clauses. That fall was recovered in mid-week before the downtrend was renewed yesterday. A forecast by London trader Gill &amp; Duffus of a 118,000-tonnes production deficit in the 1992-93 season did little to support the market.  ---------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------- Aluminium  +8,975 to 1,725,300 Copper     +3,425 to   354,700 Lead       +2,150 to   245,425 Nickel       +528 to    86,538 Zinc         +300 to   595,825 Tin           -95 to    18,955  ----------------------------------</p>

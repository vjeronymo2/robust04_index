			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Kabannikov: "Chinese Mafiosi Have Begun </F> To Speak Russian"]    [Text] Beijing -- U.S. State Department specialists  studying the problem of illegal immigration consider that Russia  has become a new center for the Chinese mafia's activities.  They estimate that around 60,000 Chinese are presently waiting  their turn to cross over to the countries of Europe and America  from Russia.    But the Americans complain that it is difficult to work with  the Russian authorities as the latter show no interest in this  problem. Russian border guards are easily bought off and they  agree to let illegal immigrants through the border. Nobody  wants to be involved in sending immigrants back to China. State  Department representatives are going to discuss these problems  in the next few days with their Russian colleagues in Moscow.</p>

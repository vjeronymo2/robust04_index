			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 27 (A.A.) -- Deputy Prime Minister  Murat Karayalcin described the decision of the U.S. House of  Representatives to slash by 25 percent the 453 million U.S.  dollars in military aid to Turkey as being `regrettable and  unjust.'    He told a press conference today that Turkey did not need  U.S. ultimatums to practice human rights and implement  democratic freedoms.    Evaluating the House's Wednesday decision which also asked  Turkey to review its human rights practices and improve the  situation regarding Cyprus, Karayalcin said that the government  was spending efforts to establish human rights and freedoms in  Turkey and a recent democratization package aimed to improve  these in Turkey.    `Turkey does not need another country's ultimatum to defend  human rights in the country and it is capable of improving such  issues within its own dynamics,' Karayalcin said.    `These kinds of preconditions draw angry reactions,' he  said.</p>

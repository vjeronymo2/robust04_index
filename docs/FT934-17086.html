			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Diners Club loses US account: American Express to pay Dollars 18m in federal travel deal WASHINGTON will echo to the sound of hundreds of thousands of plastic cards being cut in half on November 30. On that day, 900,000 federal government employees in the US and around the world will rip up their blue and silver Diners Club cards and slip the green of American Express into their card wallets instead. The US government's travel card account is reckoned to be the biggest commercial charge card account in the world. After 10 years, Diners Club, which is owned by Citicorp, has been outbid for the business by an American Express deal which is expected to save US taxpayers Dollars 120m (Pounds 77.9m) over the next five years. To grab the US government's charge card business, American Express hit on a novel idea. Rather than charge the usual annual fee for its cards, it will pay the US government a one-off fee of Dollars 20 for each card issued. American Express calls this sum, expected to total Dollars 18m, a 'conversion fee', a payment to cover the US General Services Administration's costs of switching card issuers. The GSA, on the other hand, says the money will pay its overheads for the next five years and save it going to Congress to ask for cash. Sweeteners from American Express, based on a percentage of the Dollars 2.5bn annual travel spending of US government employees, could amount to a further Dollars 100m over the next five years, according to the GSA. While it is a prestige account, the US government business is unlikely to boost American Express's bottom line. Diners Club says the business, which represents about 10 per cent of the Dollars 22bn volume on its charge cards last year, was only marginally profitable. Mr Roger Ballou, president of American Express's US travel services group, said the company would make money out of its relationship with the government, but refused to say how much. The people who could end up footing the bill for the shift from Diners Club to American Express are the travel companies, hotels and restaurants used by US government employees. American Express charges the retailers which accept its cards an average of 2.9 per cent. Diners Club says its own merchant discounts, as they are known, are pitched between this and the 2 per cent typically charged by bank card issuers. 'The merchants get value from American Express,' said Mr Ballou. 'They wouldn't use us otherwise.'</p>

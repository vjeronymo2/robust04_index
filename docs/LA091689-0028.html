			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES' SPOILER ROLE SOURS AS CUBS EXTEND WINNING STREAK TO SIX  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Pirates, who were out of the National League East race by early  May, are having quite a bit to say about who will win the division.  </P> <P> Last weekend the Pirates, hampered by injuries most of the season, gave the New  York Mets a jolt by winning two out of three in New York.  </P> <P> Earlier this week they put the St. Louis Cardinals into a tailspin by sweeping  a three-game series at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Then along came the Chicago Cubs. But the story was different Friday night at  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Shortstop Shawon Dunston hit his first grand slam and the Cubs beat the  Pirates, 7-2, for their sixth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Rick Sutcliffe (15-5) complained earlier in the week of a sore right arm, but  he didn't pitch as though there was a problem. Although he gave up nine hits in  eight innings, he struck out 10 and became the third Cub pitcher -- after Greg  Maddux and Mike Bielecki -- to reach the 15-victory mark.  </P> <P> The Pirates were hanging tough through five innings. But with the score, 1-1,  Manager Jim Leyland lifted Neal Heaton, starting after only three days' rest.  </P> <P> That's when the trouble began. A walk, an error and another walk finished  rookie Stan Belinda (0-1). He was replaced by Bob Patterson, who retired one  batter Thursday to get the victory over the Cardinals.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Luis Salazar then beat out an infield hit to break the tie and  Dunston hit an 0-and-1 pitch into the left-field seats.  </P> <P> Said Leyland, whose club was eliminated from the race: "It looks like they're  going to win it. They're the best team in the division by far now. That's why  they're far out in front. They had a good club in the spring and they knew it.  </P> <P> "Their one problem was whether they could hold leads. And Mitch Williams and  Les Lancaster have given them the support from the bullpen to win it."  </P> <P> San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 -- Garry Templeton drove in the tiebreaking run in  the sixth inning with a double and Benito Santiago followed with a two-run  homer, leading the Padres at San Francisco as they pulled within five games of  the first-place Giants.  </P> <P> The Padres have five games remaining with the Giants, two more this weekend at  Candlestick Park and the final three of the season at San Diego.  </P> <P> The Padres have won 18 of 22 to move into the race.  </P> <P> Dennis Rasmussen (9-10) won his fourth game in his last five decisions,  allowing six hits in five-plus innings.  </P> <P> Bob Knepper (7-12) lost for the first time since Aug. 12 and is 2-2 since  joining the Giants after his release from Houston.  </P> <P> Santiago, who has 13 homers this season, has seven in his last 25 games.  </P> <P> The Padres' Bip Roberts was carried out of the Padres' dugout on a stretcher in  the fifth inning when he experienced spasms in his rib cage. He was taken to a  hospital for further examination.  </P> <P> New York 5, Montreal 0 -- Keith Hernandez kept the Mets alive in the East race.  </P> <P> David Cone (13-7) gave up seven hits in eight innings at Montreal to hand the  faltering Expos their fifth consecutive loss. Dennis Martinez held the Mets  hitless until Darryl Strawberry singled to open the fourth. Hernandez,  sidelined much of the season because of a broken kneecap, hit his fourth home  run of the season and first since April 28. That was enough support for Cone.  </P> <P> Strawberry, who has not hit a home run since Aug. 16, drove in only his fifth  run in the last 25 games with a sacrifice fly in the fifth.  </P> <P> The Mets have 16 games to play but play the Cubs only twice, next Monday and  Tuesday at Chicago.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 2-6, St. Louis 0-7 -- When the Cardinals left Chicago Sunday they  were 2 1/2 games out of first and getting ready to play the two worst teams in  the East.  </P> <P> But Philadelphia and Pittsburgh proceeded to knock the Cardinals out of the  race.  </P> <P> When rookie Pat Combs (2-0) pitched a four-hitter in the opener at  Philadelphia, it was the Cardinals' sixth consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> Despite two home runs by Von Hayes, the Cardinals scored two runs in the ninth  to get a split. However, they trail the Cubs by six games with 15 remaining.  </P> <P> Pedro Guerrero, who hit his 16th home run of the season in the first inning of  the second game, started the rally with a single. The tying run came in on a  passed ball, and Milt Thompson's infield hit drove in the winning run.  </P> <P> In the opener, Combs extended his string since coming up from the minors to one  earned run in 22 innings.  </P> <P> Houston 4, Cincinnati 1 -- Glenn Davis' 33rd home run helped Rick Rhoden to his  second victory of the season in this game at Houston.  </P> <P> Only Jimmy Wynn, who hit 37 in 1969, has hit more home runs for Houston in a  season.  </P> <P> Rhoden (2-6) gave up only two hits in seven innings.

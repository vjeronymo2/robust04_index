			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares lower after an erratic session THE reduction in Bundesbank interest rates failed yesterday to bring the buyers back into a UK stock market still focused around company results and the indications of political disagreement within Mr John Major's government over tax policies in the November Budget. Further cuts in rates in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been widely discounted in London, where investors still believe that a reduction in UK base rates may be held back until the autumn Budget. The timing of the cuts in German discount and Lombard rates, followed by similar moves elsewhere in continental Europe, came as a mild surprise in London and share prices bounced from a dull start, replacing a 10-point fall on the Footsie with a gain of the same proportions. But while the retail and consumer stocks hung on to an early improvement prompted by a favourable survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry, the broad range of equities soon turned back. The second half of the trading session proved erratic, with the UK market nervously watching Wall Street, which was a couple of Dow points ahead in UK hours. Weakness in the US dollar revived caution on the outlook for New York markets. Volatility in UK stock index futures played a part in moving blue chip share prices. At its final reading of 3,031.2, the FT-SE 100 Index was down 4.2 on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which contains many stocks more closely linked to the domestic economy, gained 6.5 points to 3,468.9. But non-Footsie stocks made up only about 53 per cent of the day's total business. Much of the day's trend reflected trading statements from a large number of leading British companies, which continued to provide a somewhat mixed lead for the stock market. Companies representing around ten per cent of the FT-SE market capitaliation reported yesterday. The most outstanding was Glaxo, which traded very heavily and finally showed a gain worth around plus 5.3 points on the Footsie Index. Higher profits from Cadbury Schweppes, however, were balanced by a Pounds 324m rights issue, albeit well-discounted to market price. Blue Circle Industries, Britain's largest cement producer, delivered a highly favourable report on the UK industry. But statements from both BTR and Babcock International were less encouraging. The mixture of company results and interest rate plays boosted Seaq turnover to 726.8m shares from the 600.4m of the previous session; on Wednesday, retail or customer business continued to hold up well, returning value of Pounds 1.27bn. Retail business in London has for a year held comfortably above the Pounds 1bn daily mark regarded as the basis of a profitable market for the London-based securities houses. However, this did nothing to restrain renewed, and apparently stronger, suggestions that a London agency broker would close its doors today. Market strategists continued to ask, in the words of the equity team at Kleinwort Benson, the London based house, ' ..just how far this setback will go.' Although Kleinwort believes that overseas buying may now have moved on other markets, it says the downside for London should be limited.</p>

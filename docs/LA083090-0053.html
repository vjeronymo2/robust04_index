			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFEREE STOPS FIGHT AS LOBBYIST WILSON, SENATOR SQUARE OFF  </P> <P> The state Senate's chief sergeant-at-arms said Wednesday that he prevented  lobbyist Bob Wilson, a former state senator from San Diego, from slugging a  state senator during an argument over a judges' pension bill.  </P> <P> Sergeant-at-Arms Tony Beard said the incident took place Tuesday afternoon in a  hallway outside the Senate chamber.  </P> <P> Beard said he was talking to someone else when he overheard a conversation  between Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) and Wilson become "more personal than  normal."  </P> <P> Wilson started to take a swing at Lockyer, Beard said, but he grabbed Wilson's  arm and prevented him from landing the blow.  </P> <P> "I leaped and grabbed him by the biceps and held him up against the wall,"  Beard said, adding that he walked Wilson down the hall to calm him down.  </P> <P> Neither Wilson nor Lockyer wanted to talk about the incident.  </P> <P> "The president pro tem (of the Senate) has suggested that it would be better  not to have a lot of comment . . . ," Lockyer said. "I prefer to not say  anything and let the wounds heal."  </P> <P> He did say that the dispute was over legislation dealing with whether counties  should be allowed to pay judges' share of payments to the judges' retirement  system.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the behest of its chairman,  Lockyer, had fashioned legislative language that officially rescinded an  agreement calling for San Diego County to pay for $800,000 in annual pension  contributions that would otherwise come out of the pockets of its 127 Municipal  and Superior Court judges.  </P> <P> The special agreement was contained in a bill sponsored last year by former  Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), who saw the measure signed into law a few  months before he left the Legislature to become a municipal judge himself.  </P> <P> Stirling said he has also talked with his former colleagues, arguing against  the pension change.  </P> <P> Wilson also wouldn't discuss the incident in detail.  </P> <P> "Tempers flare at the end of the session," Wilson said. "I feel bad about it.  We've been friends. I guess it's been 17 years. We'll continue to be friends,  I'm sure.  </P> <P> "My temper got the best of me."  </P></p>

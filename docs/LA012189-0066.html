			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE INAUGURATION OF GEORGE BUSH;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY LEFT BEHIND AS QUAYLE TAKES ON ROLE OF BUSH UNDERSTUDY  </P> <P> James Danforth Quayle assumed the vice presidency Friday with pomp and  celebration, on a sun-streaked day virtually without the contentiousness and  controversy that marred his five-month transformation from little-known Indiana  senator to the second-highest official in the land.  </P> <P> And while clearly elated, Quayle early on assumed the role of loyal understudy  he will have to play as President Bush's second-in-command. He smiled and waved  reservedly, occasionally jumped out of his parade limousine to greet crowds --  following the same gesture from Bush -- and otherwise added little to the  public record of the day's events.  </P> <P> In short, he became George Bush's George Bush -- the 44th vice president of the  United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> O'Connor Recites Oath  </P> <P> Officially, the shift to high office came moments before noon, when Supreme  Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor recited the vice presidential oath to Quayle,  standing on a massive podium before the majestic west front of the Capitol.  </P> <P> Next to the vice president stood his wife, Marilyn Tucker Quayle, smiling  proudly as she held the family's 1890 Bible, and their children -- Tucker, 14,  Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 10.  </P> <P> "I, James Danforth Quayle, swear that I will support and defend the  Constitution of the United States," Quayle declared.  </P> <P> O'Connor unintentionally omitted the next line of the oath -- "against all  enemies foreign and domestic" -- leading Quayle to do the same. But after  reciting the rest of the pledge, O'Connor added a hasty "Congratulations."  Quayle beamed.  </P> <P> In the other major public event of the day, Quayle won warm reviews from the  crowds that stretched along the inaugural parade route from the  bunting-bedecked Capitol to the White House, the new home of Quayle's senior  partner, Bush.  </P> <P> And Quayle, 41, returned their fervor by three times jumping out of his  limousine. Their three children preceding them, Quayle and his wife held hands  and walked down the street, waving shyly in comparison to the more physically  exuberant Bushes.  </P> <P> Later, using a loudspeaker built into his black limousine, Quayle saluted the  crowd.  </P> <P> "Have a great day!" he exclaimed. "See a lot of smiles!"  </P> <P> Coatless, Quayle also offered a mock-serious warning to parade-goers perched on  nearby roofs and windowsills. "Don't fall off -- you might hurt someone," he  chided.  </P> <P> Amid the crowd, Quayle supporters were plentiful.  </P> <P> "This is great. Exciting! It is history," said 33-year-old Ray Frye of  Harrisonburg, Va. "We like George Bush. And we like Dan Quayle, too. They will  be a great team."  </P> <P> Added 13-year-old Lauren Rubin, a schoolgirl from Rockville, Md.:  </P> <P> "We came because we wanted to see Bush . . . and so we could get out of school.  And Quayle is kind of cute, too."  </P> <P> But at least one protester tried to resurrect the discord that has marked  Quayle's entry into national politics. Carrying a sign that proclaimed, "Dan  Quayle for President," the man offered a caustic explanation for his support:  "We need a draft dodger in the White House." Quayle was besieged during the  campaign with questions about his enlistment in the National Guard during the  Vietnam War, when Guard enlistments were often seen as a means of avoiding  service in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> The beginning of Quayle's day, as routine as when he was Indiana's junior  senator, stood in stark contrast to the regal traditions to follow.  </P> <P> Dining on a simple breakfast of Grape Nuts, orange juice and a sip of coffee at  his McLean, Va., home, Quayle early Friday turned to his first decision of the  day: picking the passage to which he would open the 1890 family Bible when he  took his oath.  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle, a devout Christian, chose three finalists, leaving the vice  president to select his favorite. He picked the final verse of the 29th Psalm:  "The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people  with peace."  </P> <P> After the inaugural parade, the Quayles were to attend the 12 inaugural balls,  dancing along with the Bushes. Marilyn Quayle was not expecting much from her  partner, Quayle joked recently, despite the two years he spent in dancing  school as a boy.  </P> <P> "Marilyn thinks I'm terrible," he said, adding bemusedly that he could find no  reason to disagree.  </P> <P> Although Friday marked Quayle for new duties, not all of the routines will  change. The Quayles will remain in their McLean, Va., home, pending renovations  to the vice president's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. The residence, as it  was configured before the Bushes' departure, does not have adequate space for  the three Quayle children, aides to the new vice president have said. The  family expects to make its formal move in early February.  </P> <P> As for the job, Quayle said Thursday that he intends to make a substantive mark  on the vice presidency, despite the predictions by some in the new  Administration that he will disappear entirely from view for long stretches of  time.  </P> <P> Staff writer David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P></p>

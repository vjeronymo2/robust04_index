For purposes of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples, assume that paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section do not apply. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Rate based on LIBOR.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X issues a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of the 1-year London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of each year. Variations in the value of 1-year LIBOR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the term of the debt instrument can reasonably be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowed funds over that term. Accordingly, the rate is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Rate increased by a fixed amount.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X issues a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument that provides for annual payments of interest at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rate equal to 200 basis points (2 percent) plus the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value, at the end of each year, of the average yield on 1-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury securities as published in Federal Reserve bulletins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Variations in the value of this interest rate can reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Rate based on commercial paper rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X issues a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument that provides for a rate of interest that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodically adjusted to equal the current interest rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's commercial paper. Variations in the value of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rate can reasonably be expected to measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the rate is a qualified floating rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Rate based on changes in the value of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodity index.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X issues a debt instrument that provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the percentage increase, if any, in the value of an index for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year immediately preceding the payment. The index is based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the prices of several actively traded commodities. Variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating rate. However, because the rate is based on changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prices of actively traded property, the rate is an objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. Rate based on a percentage of S&amp;P 500 Index.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments at the end of each year based on a fixed percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Variations in the value of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, therefore, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, because the interest rate is based on the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S&amp;P 500 Index rather than on changes in that value, the rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not an objective rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. Rate based on issuer's profits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Z issues a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that provides for annual interest payments equal to 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of Z's net profits earned during the year immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the payment. Variations in the value of this interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate is not a qualified floating rate. In addition, because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated rate is neither based on the yield or changes in the price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of actively traded property nor based on a qualified floating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate, the rate is not an objective rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 7. Rate based on a multiple of an interest index.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Z issues a debt instrument with annual interest payments at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate equal to two times the value of 1-year LIBOR as of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment date. Because the rate is a multiple greater than 1.35  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times a qualified floating rate, the rate is not a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating rate. However, because the stated rate is based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate using a single fixed formula, the rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an objective rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

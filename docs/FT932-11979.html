			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd firm on Bosnia arms embargo THE GOVERNMENT'S implacable opposition to the lifting of the embargo on arms sales to the former Yugoslavia was underlined yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd. In a Commons debate which saw the Labour party call for the west to threaten air strikes on Serbian supply lines, the foreign secretary stressed that there could no military solution to the civil war in Bosnia. Speaking as Whitehall officials said negotiations with Washington over the Bosnian crisis were still far from reaching a conclusion, Mr Hurd said that in the end a negotiated political settlement would provide the only durable answer. But acknowledging the intense frustration in Washington at the refusal of the Serbs to respond to sanctions, he made it clear that the threat of air strikes remained a live option to intensify pressure on Serbia. In a carefully crafted speech which sought to balance anxiety to avoid an open rift with Washington with scepticism over the effectiveness of military action, Mr Hurd said that 'the only alternative to a real negotiated solution is indefinite fighting and suffering'. His remarks came as Conservative backbench MPs warned against the risk of military entanglement in the civil war. The overwhelming mood among MPs was that air strikes should be used only as a last resort. There were repeated calls - accepted by the foreign secretary - that the British troops serving with the United Nations in Bosnia should be withdrawn if they risked coming under direct attack from Serbian forces. Mr Hurd, echoing the sentiments expressed by Mr John Major in earlier exchanges with Labour leader Mr John Smith, set out four clear priorities for policy towards Serbia: To provide a framework, through the Vance-Owen plan, for a political solution. To apply pressure to end Serbian aggression. To maintain the humanitarian aid effort. To prevent the fighting from spreading to other provinces of the former Yugoslavia and beyond. Stressing that international solidarity was 'essential' if peace was to be restored, Mr Hurd said that if the political and military objectives were carefully defined 'air strikes might have a value as a threat, to deter the Bosnian Serbs from certain strategies. If defied, actual strikes could prevent them from adopting those strategies.' The foreign secretary won support from Labour for an unequivocal rejection of any move to lift the arms embargo. That would risk spreading the conflict and 'far from tilting the balance towards the Bosnian Moslems, lifting the embargo could lead to an increase in the supply of weapons to the Serbs and Croats'. Mr Smith told the House that the acknowledged risks of limited air strikes were increasingly outweighed by the real dangers of inaction. He said the Serbs would continue to flout the UN's authority unless subjected to an ultimatum backed by a credible threat to their lines of communication and supply. Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, clashed with Ms Clare Short (Lab Birmingham Ladywood) who argued that if there was no willingness to create 'safe havens' and no willingness to stop Serb aggression the Bosnians were entitled to arms to defend themselves. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said inaction had closed off the best and less risky options, and that continued failure of leadership would lead to a completely uncontrollable situation. Replying to the debate, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the Serbs should not be allowed to take for granted certain forms of policy or inaction on the part of the international community. The debate, on a technical motion for the adjournment, ended without a division.</p>

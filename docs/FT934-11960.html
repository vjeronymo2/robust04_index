			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich again defies bourse downtrend ANOTHER day of profit-taking left most bourses lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH moved against the trend for a second day, the SMI index closing 15.7 higher at 2,715.9 on its relatively high context of dollar earners, and the prospect of more liquidity entering the equity market with interest rates on the decline. In banks, Union Bank saw good business on its talk, strong for Swiss bankers, said Mr Jim Hyde at Williams de Broe, of favourable conditions and a substantial increase in profits in prospect. UBS bearers rose SFr11 to SFr1,297 while SBC put on SFr9 at SFr507. Among cyclicals rising on the dollar theme, Schindler rose SFr140 to SFr6,650. In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy climbed SFr12 to SFr782. FRANKFURT continued its consolidation, the DAX index falling 15.64 to 2,043.08 and turnover from DM8.8bn to DM7.3bn. There were some economic consolations. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said that last week's surprise key interest cuts reflected prospects for existing trends in money supply and inflation; and Mr Julian Callow, an economist with Kleinwort Bension, that headline inflation in October would have been 3.1 per cent (0.8 points lower than the actual figure) were it not for tax increases this year. However, at corporate level, Volkswagen slid DM6.50 on plans for a four day working week, and steady earnings at RWE, the engineering and energy group, left the shares DM5 lower at DM473.50. AMSTERDAM saw fresh pressure in the options exchange lead the cash market lower and the CBS Tendency index lost 2.0 or 1.5 per cent to 133.8. Turnover remained strong at around Fl 1bn. Ahold, the retailer, lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 93.10 after Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock to a 'trading sell'. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, retailing analyst at Lehman, explained that it appeared that trading conditions in the US, which accounted for some 48 per cent of Ahold's profits, had not stabilised following an aggressive price war with competitors. Consequently, he had reduced his eps forecast for 1993 to Fl 6.00 from Fl 6.20. PARIS was forced lower by weakness in the bond market and a general round of profit-taking triggered by the government's decision to withdraw its controversial cost-cutting package at Air France. The CAC-40 index skidded through the 2,200 support level to close off 18.35 at 2,192.02. Turnover was FFr3.8bn. EuroDisney was among the day's biggest losers, down FFr3.45 or 6.5 per cent at FFr49.15, on fears that the strike at Air France may furtherreduce attendance figures. MADRID reflected a number of corporate stories as profit-taking left the general index 3.32 lower at 303.81 in turnover of Pta23bn. In foods and tobaccos, Tabacalera fell Pta40 to Pta3,660 on expectations of poor 1993 profits. In retailing, Pryca dropped 3.8 per cent, taking its fall to 7 per cent this year against a rise of over 40 per cent in the market. Anti-Sunday opening legislation passed in Catalonia was put forward as one reason for yesterday's weakness. However, James Capel put out a buy note on Cepsa, the refiner and marketer of oil products, saying that strong third quarter 1993 results should mark the end to its recent underperformance. The shares rose Pta35 to Pta2,400. MILAN remained uncertain as political worries relating to both the passage of the 1994 budget and privatisation plans continued to develop. The Comit index lost 9.39 to 576.14.

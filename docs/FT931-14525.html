			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Observer: With friends like that . . . If any US newspaper might be expected to welcome a Democrat to the White House, it is surely the principled and liberal New York Times. Not so, however, if the editorials of America's most respected daily are a guide. In rapid succession they have condemned the Clintons for sending their daughter to a private school in Washington, virtually called on Ron Brown to withdraw as commerce secretary because of his lobbying business, and said nearly the same about designated attorney general Zoe Baird for having employed illegal immigrants as housekeepers. Yet a better summary of the paper's attitude to the incoming president may be provided by two other strictures. One is that he should set about soaking the rich and seeking ever bigger cuts in defence. The other is that reuniting Fleetwood Mac for his Inaugural shows appalling musical taste. Could it be that The New York Times has finally woken up to the fact that Clinton is not a liberal? After all, Jimmy Carter wasn't either, and Fleetwood Mac were at their zenith when he held sway. As if that weren't enough, the paper is now suggesting that the president-elect has been giving chosen Vice-president Al Gore the cold shoulder, not only squeezing him out of consultations about senior appointments, but even initially forgetting to invite the Gores to last month's glittering Washington dinner party. Who knows, the next thing Clinton forgets may be to invite The New York Times to the White House. If so, the presidential honeymoon will be well and truly over.</p>

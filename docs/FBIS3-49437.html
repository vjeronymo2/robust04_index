Nikola Koljevic, the deputy president of the Srpska  republic;  Belgian General Francis Briquemont, UNPROFOR commander for the  former Bosnia-Hercegovina; and Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN  secretary general's special envoy, also took part in the talks.    After the talks, both sides expressed satisfaction and hope  that today's constructive dialogue on humanitarian problems and  the ways to resolve the Bosnian crisis would stimulate the peace  process and speed up the efforts which are being made to ensure  the respect of obligations which have been undertaken,  particularly regarding the observations of cease-fires.</p>

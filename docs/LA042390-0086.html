			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ACCENT COULD BE AN INVITATION TO BIAS;  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION: HOW A PERSON TALKS COULD GIVE BOSSES AND OTHERS A CHANCE TO  EXERCISE PREJUDICE, IMMIGRANT-RIGHTS ADVOCATES SAY.  </P> <P> As toddlers struggle toward the ability to speak, the first lessons are as much  physical as intellectual. Breathing, positioning of tongue, teeth and lips,  rhythm -- these naturally occurring linguistic skills make the sounds that  later will form words.  </P> <P> It is a sort of programming that carries over when a person learns a second  language, and the result is an accent: speaking one language with the traits of  another. Native English-speakers, for instance, must work to move their tongue  to trill the "r" when learning Spanish, just as Chinese speakers struggle with  the English "z" sound.  </P> <P> Southern California, with its rich ethnic diversity, is something of a test  ground for accommodating accents. While thick accents enhance the region's  cosmopolitan flavor, they also can be perceived as an encumbrance, a roadblock  to career advancement, an easy target for those who would ridicule or  discriminate.  </P> <P> "Even though we are a melting pot, and we welcome everyone from all walks of  life, if someone cannot make himself understood, that breeds prejudice," said  Lillian Glass, a speech and communication specialist who practices in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> Examples abound. A Chinese-born accountant for a federal agency is told the way  she speaks English is difficult to understand and will limit her professional  opportunities. A Mexican-born salesman for a soft drink bottler is hired to  court Spanish-speaking clients, but then believes he cannot move up in the  company because of his accent. For a study, people posing as job seekers with  foreign accents answer help-wanted ads by telephone but are told the posts are  already filled; when unaccented English speakers call, they are invited for job  interviews.  </P> <P> Many people, rather than endure the frustration, take specialized classes to  soften or eliminate their accents and dialects -- a field of speech instruction  that has evolved into a fast-growing industry. Doctors, business executives and  performers throughout Southern California spend hours with coaches to polish  their locution.  </P> <P> Last week, the issue of accents in the workplace became more complicated. The  U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling that allows an employer to deny a job or  promotion to someone whose accent significantly interferes with his or her  performance.  </P> <P> In the case, a 66-year-old Filipino was denied a job with the Hawaii Department  of Motor Vehicles because, in the opinion of his interviewers, his heavily  accented English was difficult to understand.  </P> <P> By refusing to hear the man's appeal, the Supreme Court let stand a lower  court's ruling that said the DMV's actions did not violate the 1964 Civil  Rights Act, which outlaws job discrimination on the basis of national origin,  race, sex or religion.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court decision raised many questions: How strong of an accent is  considered detrimental to the performance of a job? Who can set an objective  standard for how a person's English should sound?  </P> <P> Immigrant-rights advocates decried the Supreme Court action, saying it gives  employers subjective leeway to deny someone a job and then blame it on his or  her accent. An employer could all too easily maintain that someone's English is  incomprehensible merely as a cover for more entrenched discrimination, the  advocates say.  </P> <P> The danger, said the critics, is that employers might use accents as a  screening mechanism: They'll simply refuse to hire people with accents they  don't like.  </P> <P> "Employers will see this as a green light to discriminate," said Linda E.  Mitchell of the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles. "We are  legitimizing discrimination in our society."  </P> <P> Accents, of course, are not limited to the foreign-born. Regions of the  country, such as the New York area or the South, have distinctive accents.  Blacks and U.S.-born Chicanos may speak with certain accents or favor  particular dialects. But most problems seem to involve immigrants.  </P> <P> A 33-year-old Upland woman who was born in China and moved to California in  1970 said in an interview that she fears her job is in jeopardy because of a  supervisor's reaction to her accent. She has worked as an accountant and  auditor for a federal regulatory agency -- a job that requires oral  presentations to managerial groups -- during the last 4 1/2 years.  </P> <P> After several positive evaluations, she said, she is now being denied a  promised promotion. Her supervisor has blamed the "impact" of her accent on her  communications skills.  </P> <P> "When I came here (to the United States), I did not speak a word of English,"  she said. "I worked doubly hard, I learned doubly hard. . . . I do have an  accent; I never denied that. (But) if they felt I had such a problem, why was  it never put as an issue? . . . I never had a complaint."  </P> <P> The woman, who speaks with a thick accent but is generally intelligible, asked  that her name not be published because she is in a legal battle with the  federal agency. A grievance filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission was rejected, but she is appealing.  </P> <P> Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center,  said his organization has received similar, informal complaints from several  Chinese-born engineers who work at some of Southern California's aerospace  firms and believe their accents are being used to relegate them to mid-level  positions.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that anytime a person has an accent, an employer can use that  to deny a promotion or a job," Kwoh said. "Los Angeles has so many different  groups and is so diverse now that if we play favorites, if we start choosing  the accent we like as the standard, . . . it gets very dangerous."  </P> <P> Mitchell, of the rights coalition, is counseling a Mexican-born salesman for a  major soft drink company. Hired in part because he spoke Spanish and could work  with Spanish-speaking businesses, he now feels his accent is being used to deny  him advancement in the company, Mitchell said.  </P> <P> In a study conducted last year by the Humane Immigration Rights coalition and  the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, five pairs of people posing as job  applicants answered help-wanted ads placed in local newspapers. In each pair, a  person speaking English with a Spanish accent answered the ad first, followed  by the partner, a less-qualified applicant who spoke unaccented English.  </P> <P> According to the study, 20% of the accented callers were not considered for the  job, but their less-qualified unaccented partners were. In several cases, the  accented applicant was told the job was filled but the unaccented applicant,  calling later, was told the job was available.  </P> <P> In nearly one-third of the cases, the accented speaker was treated less  favorably, the study found.  </P> <P> In California, numerous large companies and government agencies said that while  they do not consider national origin or ethnic background when examining a job  applicant, they do make it clear that the applicants' "ability to communicate"  is a factor in whether they get hired -- especially when the position is one  that requires talking to the public.  </P> <P> "What we look at is (the applicant's) knowledge, skill and ability to do that  job," said Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell. "Part of that  ability is to be understood by our customers."  </P> <P> At a state bureaucracy like the Department of Motor Vehicles, hiring someone  for a front-office job who could not communicate clearly "would cause more  problems than the hiring would be worth," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said.  </P> <P> "We need to have people who can communicate clearly with the public," he said.  "Vehicle registration and licensing . . . are a very serious thing. If the  employee cannot communicate with the public, then the public is going to be  shortchanged."  </P> <P> At Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Fontana, administrators offer special  "accent-reduction" tutoring to foreign-born physicians as a way to help them  communicate better with their patients.  </P> <P> About 45 doctors have passed through the program in the last four years,  spokeswoman Gail Henderson-Peter said.  </P> <P> In one session last week, an internist born in Bangkok diligently practiced the  "th" sound, repeating, "the, this, them." He stumbled later over the word  "tests," the juxtaposition of two "S's" and a "T" posing something of a  tongue-twister.  </P> <P> Under the guidance of speech specialist Ruth Forman, the Thai doctor, who has  lived in California for 13 years, was taught to speak more slowly, enunciate  more clearly and project his words, even his own name.  </P> <P> Forman, director of the Sherman Oaks-based Communication Enhancement Inc., said  many of the difficulties in communication are directly tied to cultural  differences, such as eye contact and projection.  </P> <P> She said in some Asian cultures it is considered impolite "to open (the lips)  and project." In contrast, others, such as Russians and Germans, sometimes  project so forcefully that they must be toned down, she said.  </P> <P> At the session at Kaiser, some of Forman's students seemed to have special  trouble with one word in particular: "physician."  </P> <P> One of the Taiwanese doctors, who has lived in Los Angeles for 10 years, said  the coaching has made him more confident. "I (seem) more sincere to my  patients," he said.  </P> <P> Forman says the goal of her program is not to rob the foreign-born of their  culture, nor to eliminate accents in an effort to homogenize the way Southern  California speaks.  </P> <P> "In reality, you don't ever get rid of the accent," she said. "What this  program does is reduce the accent so that communication is not a problem. . . .  Each culture brings something special to this country. I hope that never  fades."  </P></p>

Shortly before a visit by the U.S.  secretary of state to Beijing, this appears to be a challenge.  The United States has again and again threatened to withdraw  the most-favored-nation status from China, but that is usually  it. The Chinese market is too enticing. Europeans are behaving  in a similar way. It has been argued that the closer the  economic ties, the greater the chances for loosening up the  rigid political system in China. Time and again, this has  proved to be wrong. Nevertheless, the West is sticking to this  illusionary policy. Even this time, officials will find an  excuse. Maybe the dissidents will be released again after the  People's Congress, due to open next week and which must not be  disturbed by requests for more democracy. Maybe. At any rate,  for the sake of economic interests, the West will again and  again turn a blind eye to political suppression in China, and  even more so in Tibet.</p>

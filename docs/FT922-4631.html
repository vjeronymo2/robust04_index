			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Top banker casualty of India share scandal THE CHAIRMAN of India's largest bank became the latest casualty of the widening securities scandal yesterday after the bank was fiercely criticised in an official report. The report, published by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said funds had been diverted from the banking system through 'massive collusion' between banks and brokers. The scandal has exposed banks to losses of as much as Rs30.8bn (Pounds 610m). Mr MN Goiporia, chairman of State Bank of India, was not personally named in the report. But he was told by the Reserve Bank to go on holiday until the end of next month. His retirement had been scheduled for July 31. The report, from a committee appointed by the Reserve Bank and headed by its deputy governor, Mr R Janakiraman, said the State Bank had allowed Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, to use the bank's securities account with the central bank 'virtually . . . as if it is (his) investment account'. The bank had channelled Rs170bn of transactions through Mr Mehta to the beginning of April. Last month, another senior State Bank official, deputy managing director Mr CL Khemani, was also asked to go on leave indefinitely. State Bank accounts for about one-third of commercial banking assets in India. Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, said yesterday that it expected to recover most of the Rs10.55bn which the Reserve Bank says is its exposure to the affair. The Reserve Bank report was critical of another foreign bank, ANZ Grindlays, for paying cheques totalling Rs5bn, which were made out in its own name, into an account belonging to Mr Mehta. Grindlays is refusing to refund the money to the National Housing Bank, which issued the cheques.</p>

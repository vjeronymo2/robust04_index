			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (11): Disclosure is now a way of life - Attitudes to public information have changed The chemical industry is at a crossroads in environmental reporting. After a burst of enthusiasm comes the need for consolid- ation and improvement in the quality and consistency of what it says. Just a few years ago, the sector was as uncom- municative and inactive as many other types of company. When it came to public information, there was next to none. Now it stands ahead of most of the rest. 'It's hard to think of any major international chemical company that does not provide some form of environmental information,' says Mr John Elkington, head of Sustain- ability, an environmental consultancy based in London, and joint author of a recent study of green reporting. 'The industry has been in the lead in the whole area of disclosure.' Suddenly, there is a separate sub-industry growing up around environmental consulting, auditing and training. The Institute of Chemical Engineers, for instance, recently felt the need to produce a training package on environmental auditing. Part of the change in attitude to public information reflects the existing internal work being conducted by the industry. Effective management systems have been introduced over a long period for economic reasons of waste minimisation. Recycling has made sound business sense. On toxic emissions and other pollutants, part of the change also reflects the growing interest, regulatory requirements and public and peer pressure for greater green disclosure. But Mr Elkington highlights two key events which have brought about greater disclosure in the industry within the last decade. The first was the leakage of toxic gas from the Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal in India in 1984, which is estimated to have killed more than 3,800 people. He says that left many companies feeling very exposed, and led to a wave of environmental audits of their operations. Monsanto even issued what it called the 'Monsanto pledge' on the control of emissions. Other companies followed this lead. Bhopal particularly affected US-based chemical groups. Norsk Hydro is feted for its environmental reporting, but Mr Elkington points to another embarrassing incident in the past which helped spark this approach: a break-in at one of the company's sites by a Norwegian green pressure group called Bellona, which publicised high levels of soil contamination. While the incidents sparking greater disclosure have been so negative, they have at least brought about considerable positive change through increased disclosure. Several recent surveys suggest that chemicals now provide more environmental information than most other sectors. 'Over the last few years the chemical industry has certainly realised that its bottom line is affected by its public reputation, and has paid a lot more attention to communicating with its audience,' says Mr Guy Liardet of the Chemical Industries Association. Mr Elkington says: 'I think there has been a very significant shift in thinking about disclosure since 1989. Before then, most companies felt it would be undesirable. Now we have gone beyond the watershed.' Initial fears that reporting, fuelled by the consumer pressures of the late 1980s, would die away in the harsher economic conditions of the 1990s seem to be unfounded, he adds. 'But environmentalism hit its high water mark in 1990,' he warns. That does not mean the results of greater reporting have been uniform. The first environmental document produced by ICI, for instance, was criticised for highlighting the good news and neglecting to mention more critical information such as fines and court hearings against it. Mr Elkington points to Dow Europe as the model for better reporting, primarily for two reasons: the publication of environmental data site-by-site rather than lumped together; and for providing comparative figures on previous performance and projected targets for the future. He says there are two principal issues after the floodgates on disclosure among chemical companies: first, that it is confined to that sector with relatively little from other sectors; and second, that there is a lack of standardisation which makes comparisons fraught even between those which do produce public reports. He would like to see regulations and legislation to bring about greater consistency in reporting. But others are less sure. Mr Liardet, of the Chemical Industries Association, argues that would be too complex to introduce, difficult to police, and would reduce the flexibility in reporting the most relevant information on the enormous range of chemical products and byproducts generated. Instead, he cites voluntary guidelines to be launched at the end of June by Cefic, the European chemical industry council of which the CIA is a member. These are likely to include information on accidents, complaints, energy consumed, and details of particularly hazardous types of waste. That reflects the general tenor in Europe of voluntary guidelines in contrast to the regulation-driven system in the US. Attempts to emulate such a system on the eastern side of the Atlantic have foundered, with few exceptions. Emas, the European Commission's guidelines on ecological management and audit scheme, released in final version this spring, is a case in point. It began as a mandatory scheme across all of a company's operations. It ended up being voluntary and site-by-site. Regulation gave way to the argument that competitive pressure alone would bring about compliance. Mr Elkington highlights another big problem over environmental reporting in Europe. In spite of the pressure in the past for greater information, there has been little attempt to react to the published numbers by users of this information. In the US and Canada organisations have been active in building up databases to make comparisons between different companies. In Europe, that is far less the case. 'So far the response from non-governmental organisations has been relatively disappointing,' he says. 'They called for data for many years. But their reaction has been fairly mute.'</p>

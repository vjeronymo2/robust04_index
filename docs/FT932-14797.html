			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Posco may face anti-trust rules POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), South Korea's largest steel company, may become subject to anti-trust restrictions, a government official said yesterday. Posco is exempt from the anti-trust rules because it is state-run. The government recently introduced regulations limiting cross-holdings among subsidiaries belonging to chaebol, the country's 30 biggest business groups. It also imposed a ceiling on mutual loan guarantees among chaebol subsidiaries as part of its policy to limit the expansion of the business groups and reduce their dominance in the nation's economy. Mr Han Lee-huan, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, said there was little reason to exempt Posco from these restrictions since it was the fifth or sixth-largest Korean company in terms of assets, with 20 subsidiaries. Posco, which enjoyed strong backing from previous governments, has come under official scrutiny recently after its founder, Mr Park Tae-joon, opposed the election of the country's new president, Mr Kim Young-sam. The government recently launched a tax investigation of Posco for possible illegal use of company funds for political purposes. The tax audit, which has not been completed, has already forced the resignation of Mr Park and other senior executives from Posco.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc venture raises Dollars 182m in IPO Rhodia-Ster, a Brazilian joint venture controlled by the French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc, -Poulenc, raised Dollars 182m from its global initial public offering launched on Monday, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo. The offer was oversubscribed and sold at the maximum price of Dollars 13.50 per global depositary share. Strong demand in Brazil, where the issue was oversubscribed by six times, led global co-ordinator Paribas Capital Markets to increase the Brazilian tranche to about 40 per cent from 33 per cent, with about 30 per cent each going to the US and Europe. The global depositary shares are listed on the Luxembourg stock market and on the Portal system in the US. The Brazilian shares will begin trading on December 28.</p>

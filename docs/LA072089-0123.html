			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: NATIONAL EDUCATION NAMES ACTING CHIEF IN SHAKE-UP  </P> <P> In a management shake-up just two days after it reported an unexpected  $1.5-million second-quarter loss, National Education Corp. announced that a  former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been named to replace longtime  top executive H. David Bright as chairman.  </P> <P> Gen. David C. Jones -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 1978 to 1982 -- also  will replace Bright as acting chief executive until a permanent CEO is found,  according to a statement released by the Irvine-based company -- the nation's  largest provider of educational training services.  </P> <P> Jones, 68, has served as a director of National Education since 1983.  </P> <P> National Education executives were unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> And Bright, reached at his home, hung up after stating that he had "no comment  to make."  </P> <P> During the past year, National Education has suffered a series of setbacks. On  Monday, the company reported a $1.5-million loss for the quarter ended June 30,  contrasted with a $7.6-million profit in the same period a year earlier.  Revenue was down 8% to $96.6 million from $105 million.  </P> <P> The root of the problems, according to analysts, is the company's largest  subsidiary, Applied Learning International. National Education formed the  company from several acquisitions it made in the mid-1980s. The goal was to  become a major player in the corporate training industry, but numerous  problems, including computer snafus and a disorganized sales staff, have  stymied that effort.  </P> <P> Applied Learning's president William Roach resigned last September after  bitterly clashing with Bright over the direction of the firm.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, National Education's core business -- vocational schools -- is  suffering, too. Enrollments have been flat for most of the year, and the  company is having to spend more on marketing to attract students.  </P> <P> Bright was hired in 1972 by company founder John J. McNaughton to help the  company reverse a string of losses. He was successful in overhauling National  Education and was named its chairman in 1988. Bright will remain a director of  the company.  </P> <P> Although the management change was not announced until after the stock market  closed Wednesday, National Education's common shares -- which took a drubbing  Tuesday -- rebounded a bit to close at $15, up 50 cents for the day in light  trading. The stock had closed Tuesday at $14.50, down $2.25, with nearly 2.3  million shares changing hands. GREGORY CROUCH  </P></p>

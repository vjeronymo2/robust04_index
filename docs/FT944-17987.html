			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (2): A new way to do business - Privatisation, impact assessment / The liberalisation of national trading regimes has provided the impetus for exporters to acquire fixed assets in their target markets, where previously they were content only to ship goods in pure trade transactions The privatisation fever which has increasingly gripped developing and former command economies has had more profound consequences for exporting outside the OECD region than even the global debt crisis of the 1950s. In Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe, multinational companies and small and medium-sized enterprises must deal with clients with private sector perceptions and problems, rather than the state procurement agencies and distribution companies which dominated in centralised economies. 'The chief feature of privatisation regarding trade is that the channels of supply have changed,' says Hans Peter Lankes, an economist with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The privatisation of public companies and the introduction of market rules to formerly state-dominated economies has also resulted in investment following trade in regions such as Latin America. The liberalisation of national trading regimes has given new impetus to exporters to acquire fixed assets in target markets, where previously they were content only to ship goods in pure trade transactions. This has the advantage of securing important markets and may provide a regional base for exporting from within the target market to neighbouring economies. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, has established manufacturing and sales operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador are serviced from these countries, says Bill Dobson, a P&amp;G executive - 'we can sell into these markets primarily because of their size, and we can now handle their needs from Argentina and Brazil.' The emerging business classes of newly industrialising countries also see the benefits of the private way of doing business. In Argentina, an enthusiastic privatiser, privatised companies claim to be paying some 30 per cent less for their inputs, compared to the levels paid by their former public sector managements. The experience of privatisation has political ramifications, in some cases weakening governments' ability to wield the trade weapon in disputes as in the past. The Malaysian boycott of British goods over the Pergau dam affair was arguably weakened by the sanctions being applied only to public sector contracts. During the decade or so of IMF and World Bank-sponsored structural adjustment, many governments have been reluctant to follow the privatised trade route. But the number of converts has risen sharply with the realisation that only by promoting private business could budget deficits and debt burdens be realistically reduced and economies become more competitive. In sectors such as telecommunications, the need to keep pace with rapid technological advances has forced the pace and opened markets to multinationals. This is now seen as an essential trend even without the multilateral pressure to liberalise from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and other organisations. The scale of demand for infrastructure in newly industrialising economies means that private projects are becoming as important as public sector schemes in many such countries. As a result build-operate-transfer (Bot), build-operate-own (Boo) and other private alternatives to sovereign financing for projects have begun to take root. Not long ago, private projects such as the 1,230-MW Paiton power plant in Indonesia - costing Dollars 1.8bn and financed by a consortium of international banks and lending organisations - would only have been carried out by the state. There are pitfalls associated with the break with well-established patterns in financing exports. In many difficult markets, obtaining financing is far from easy and the intervention of multilateral and state agencies remains essential. Private capital 'continues to exhibit great reluctance to provide regular access to the likely amount of finance needed,' to fund exports to many developing markets, according to a draft report presented to Congress by the Export-Import Bank of the US (Eximbank), this summer. Consequently, the report concluded, 'the need for Eximbank seems to be expanding.' Among the problems to be confronted selling into emerging economies with growing private sectors are the following: Assessing risk may be more difficult: Securing export credit agency (ECA) guarantees and commercial credits is more complicated in regions such as eastern Europe, where business was traditionally transacted with public sector buyers backed by state guarantees. Judging the credit-worthiness of new banks and buyers can be problematic when western banks generally like to see five years of accounts, audited to international standards. 'We attend conferences where we applaud eastern Europe for opening up to private business and we send people to help them develop their new private banks,' says a senior European banker says. 'But outside a few places like the Czech Republic, what we're talking about is much greater risk than we knew when there was one Vneshekonombank, the former Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, one ministry responsible for procurement - and you knew just who to talk to. Now we are unsure of the commercial risk; we don't know the banks and, in some cases, the mafia is running the country.' The rapid increase in privately funded projects: The advent of Bot-type schemes calls for new financing instruments. Multilateral agencies, ECAs and banks have had to adapt to tap markets which are seeking private projects without recourse to the traditional sovereign guarantees. The UK's Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD) is among ECAs which are introducing a new generation of products, such as the recently revamped overseas investment insurance scheme (OIIS) and an expanded project finance facility, which can now provide similar levels of cover as those made available for the buyer credits allocated to capital goods exports. Such is the increase in demand that ECGD insured as much investment in the first three months of the 1994/95 financial year as in the whole of the previous year. But it is not just in the buyer countries that western companies are having to adjust to privatisation and a reduced role for the state. Political considerations and state support remain factors in securing prestige contracts, but increasingly capital goods exporters and contractors do not have the same access as before to official credits for commercial projects and trade facilities, such as short-term export credit insurance. This is because the private market now provides most credit insurance support in the UK, where more than 10 insurers, including some of Europe's biggest companies, now offer facilities. This trend is set to continue. The OECD has announced new measures to consolidate the so-called Helsinki rules, introduced in 1992. These aim to further separate commercial financing from aid. This involves measures such as abolishing remaining subsidised interest rates and linking the maturities of credit repayments to countries' economic performance (with only the poorest countries benefitting from the most extended terms). Further work is planned by the OECD, the European Union and other agencies to further harmonise export credit practices and better regulate the use of export credits for agricultural products.

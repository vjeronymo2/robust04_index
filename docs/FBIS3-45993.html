			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pan Zhongming: "Managing Currency to be Theme of </F> Lectures"]    [Text] Gaiacorp, a London-based international currency  management firm will strengthen its presence in China.    It will do this by enhancing its cooperation with China's  financial education department and increasing its investment in  China's key infrastructure construction this year.    Liu Maolin, manager of the firm's Beijing representative  office, made the announcement over the weekend.    Liu said, in the field of financial education, the firm will  conduct a series of lectures on basic finance and sophisticated  international currency management.    The firm is seeking opportunities for giving these lectures,  setting up scholarship funds and investing to facilitate the  education departments in the universities in Beijing.    The total investment in this sector will be between 2 and 3  million yuan ($229,000 and $344,000).    The firm also plans to further its involvement in the key  infrastructure projects of China this year.    It will explore co-operative opportunities with the Bank of  China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and other  financial and investment firms, domestic and overseas alike, for  investment in the Three Gorges Project and Shanghai's Pudong New  Area.    Liu said that his firm planned to introduce its  sophisticated  and patented techniques in finance to China, but not sell it.  He said China can learn its technology through "cooperation  projects."    The firm, handling daily transaction of floated currencies  worth around $2 billion, contends it has the technology to  predict future trends in 24 different international currencies.    To guarantee the success of the firm's plan, a high-profile  delegation will soon be organized by the firm's headquarters in  London to visit Beijing.    The delegation hopes to make an overall inspection of  China's  financial and educational departments.</p>

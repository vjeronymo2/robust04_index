			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS OUTRAGED OVER CELEBRITY CAMPAIGN TO HAVE SENTENCING JUDGE GO EASY ON  MILKEN  </P> <P> I just read that "They Like Mike." His Highness the Junk Bond King. Who are  they? As near as I can determine, they are the very privileged few, with  virtually no background in jurisprudence, except perhaps Chief Daryl Gates, who  while not espousing pardon for Milken, seems to be caught up in that very  dubious practice of unleashing the "talents" of some of our most devious  criminals to work with the youth of America, thereby setting some very  confusing parameters for them to employ when they mature.  </P> <P> Dr. David W. Golde writes to Milken's trial judge that "Milken is not a  criminal in the normal sense of the word." Milken is a genuine criminal beyond  doubt and should spend the bulk of his life in prison. He is a convicted thief  who has decimated the entire financial structure of our nation, not by  brilliant displays of acumen, buy by illegal stealth.  </P> <P> He is as responsible as anyone for the heinous rape of our S&amp;L system,  which will have generations of Americans paying taxes to back up the "good  faith" of the U.S. government. As for his supporters, hardly a deep thinking  brain among them, merely self-centered fools who demonstrate no ken whatsoever  of the basic tenets of justice.  </P> <P> ROBERT SCHUSTEFF  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

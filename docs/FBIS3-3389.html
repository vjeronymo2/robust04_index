Times have changed, however. At the current session of the  National People's Congress (NPC), rural entrepreneurs among the  NPC deputies claimed, "rural enterprises will face fierce  challenges from state-owned enterprises in fair market  competition."    Li Xianguo, an NPC deputy from northern Jiangsu and a  farmer-  turned entrepreneur, used a vivid phrase to express his sense of  crisis -- "When the tiger comes down from the mountains, what  can the monkey do?"    Li is the general manager of the Zhaonian Industrial  Corporation, a rural enterprise in the suburbs of Xuqian city.  His corporation has 13 factories building ships, making steel  window frames and processing grain.    In Li's parlance, "the tiger" refers to state-owned  enterprises and "the monkey" refers to rural enterprises like  his own. He was talking about state enterprises entering the  market and constituting a challenge to rural enterprises.    Rural enterprises created by farmers came into China's  economic arena as a new, sudden rising force in the 1980s and  gradually developed to take a one-third share of the national  economy.    Last year rural enterprises produced 3,000 billion yuan  worth  of products and made pre-tax profits of 300 billion yuan.    Today, 20 million rural enterprises nationwide have become  "reservoirs" that absorb rural surplus labor as well as "money  bags" for farmers. By the end of last year rural enterprises  had employed 110 million farmers. Two-thirds of farmers'  increased income comes from rural enterprises.    Chinese Premier Li Peng said in his government work report,  "If the countryside is to become moderately prosperous, it is  essential to develop township and village enterprises."    Rural enterprises' role in ensuring social stability in  rural  China, boosting its economy and narrowing the gap between urban  and rural areas cannot be ignored.    The reason why rural enterprises have developed rapidly is  that they have management flexibility which state-owned  enterprises lack and that they outpaced state-owned enterprises  in entering the market when the latter emphasized production to  the neglect of sales.    When reforms are changing the way state-owned enterprises  operate and creating conditions for them to compete on an equal  footing with their rural counterparts on the market, the latter  are beginning to feel the heat, in terms of market share and  relative advantage.    Li Guilian, a woman farmer-entrepreneur from northeast  China,  said, "We rural enterprises outdid state enterprises when their  hands and feet were bound by central planning. Previously we  had the advantage of being flexible; and now they are becoming  more flexible, too. We and state enterprises now face the same  market and are at the same starting point. Rural enterprises  will have a hard time ahead."    Li is the chairman and general-manager of the Dayang Garment  Company Group in Liaoning Province. Her enterprise was started  14 years ago by dozens of women farmers with their own sewing  machines. Today, the company group employs 7,000 people and has  42 factories with total assets of 510 million yuan. Fourteen of  its 16 garment factories have used foreign investment and export  90 percent of their products. Last year their foreign exchange  earnings amounted to 56 million U.S. dollars.    Li, 48, who is an NPC deputy for a second five-year term,  said, "I often tell my workers that rural enterprises are now  under the threat of a mountainous wave. We must learn swimming  in the big wave to avoid being buried."    Many farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that rural  enterprises are in a disadvantageous position because of their  scattered distribution and small scale. An overwhelming  majority of rural enterprises are located in villages, with only  12 percent in towns and one percent near county seats. They are  far from markets and ill-informed.    Moreover, they are innately deficient in terms of equipment,  technology, management and worker quality.    With the introduction of a new tax system, rural enterprises  have lost their previous tax breaks. Other factors have also  eaten into their erstwhile advantages: more expensive land  resulting from a state policy on paid use of all land, more  expensive labor, more expensive loans resulting from more  channels of lucrative investment for idle money.    Farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that, faced with  challenges, rural enterprises in different localities and with  different capabilities will feel different degrees of pressure.  For instance, well-established rural enterprises in the south  and coastal areas are more adaptable to the challenges.    Li Xianguo from Jiangsu Province said that since rural  enterprises have outpaced state-owned enterprises in entering  the marketplace, they have more highly qualified salesmen and  are not overburdened by retirees.    Li Guilian from Liaoning Province said that, since the  market  system is improving, it is possible to compete on a fair basis  according to laws of the market. Rural enterprises are also  granted with export right. The new tax system makes her company  sustain an additional tax of three million yuan, which she said  is acceptable. Last year her company paid 10 million yuan in  taxes.    You Junming, president of the Jiangsu Hongyu Group Company,  a  rural cosmetic enterprise, said his company will adapt to the  challenges with calm, by expanding scale, introducing a  shareholding system, modernizing management and opening  international markets.    Wu Renbao, manager of the Huaxi Industrial Corporation in  Jiangsu Province, said that, in market competition, rural  enterprises and state-owned enterprises have more cooperative  opportunities and they can share their advantages and seek  common development under common interests.    In his government work report, Chinese premier emphasized  that the government will continue to support township and  village enterprises, especially in the central and western  regions. To this end the government has already adopted a  series of measures.</p>

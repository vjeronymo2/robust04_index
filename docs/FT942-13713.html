			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labour market efficiency Sir, In his article about the EU 'A fortress would be no defence' (April 15) Martin Wolf states: 'Unemployment has been rising cycle by cycle over the last two decades.' But this is not true in the UK, as seasonally adjusted unemployment peaked in the last economic cycle at 3,116,400 in the second quarter of 1986, while in this cycle it peaked at 2,962,600 in January 1993. The fact that unemployment has peaked at a lower level in this cycle in the UK but is continuing to rise cycle by cycle elsewhere in the EU is most interesting. It indicates that changes in the British labour market over the last decade mean that the UK labour market is working more efficiently relative to the EU labour market than it used to do. It must also strongly suggest that, if we adopt the practice used elsewhere in the EU, such as the Social Chapter, unemployment will increase.

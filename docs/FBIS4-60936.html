			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Romain Franklin report: "In Tashkent, Islam Karimov Has </F> Silenced the Dissidents"]    [Text] Tashkent -- Despite his popularity as strong man,  Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who received 86 percent of the  votes in the December 1991 presidential election, is displaying  a ferocity against dissidents which diplomats and oppositionists  readily compare to the "era of Brezhnevian repression."  Tolerated at the time of the declaration of the country's  independence in August 1991, the opposition now seems completely  drained. The Birlik movement (nationalist Unity movement),  which organized mass demonstrations, was banned in February  1993; the Erk party (whose leader obtained 12 percent of the  votes in the 1991 presidential election) has not been officially  "registered" since last October. One is now operating from  Moscow and the other from Turkey. The last eight prominent  members of the Erk party still in Uzbekistan, including Otanazar  Aripov, the movement's spokesman and secretary, were arrested at  the beginning of March and have since disappeared.    Francois Mitterrand, who has just completed a visit to  Uzbekistan on Wednesday, made his little speech on human rights,  stating in Tashkent that "the right to criticize is the  precondition for social, economic, and cultural progress." To  this Islam Karimov replied that it was "difficult to change  people's mentality" when economic conditions are still bad, and  reaffirmed that this country had "emerged from the entrails of a  totalitarian system," of which he, as a former apparatchik, was  the instrument. President Karimov in particular brandished the  horrible spectacle of neighboring Tajikistan, where the conflict  between the former communist government and an armed Islamic  opposition ended in a bloodbath.    The fact remains that the methods of the former leader of  the  Communist Party, who became president of this Central Asian  country of 20 million inhabitants, are scarcely different from  those of the former KGB. At least four prominent members of the  opposition have been beaten up, some very seriously, by the  Uzbek internal security forces in the space of a year.    On the occasion of the visit by his "friend" Francois  Mitterrand, the Uzbek president announced that parliamentary  elections "which he had promised but which had not been  mentioned for months" would take place "before the end of the  year." However, in view of the turn things have taken, it is  unlikely that the two main opposition parties, now in exile,  will be allowed to put forward candidates. Only the former  Communist Party (rechristened Democratic People's Party), of  which Islam Karimov is the leader, and the two parties recently  created at his instigation, are "officially registered."</p>

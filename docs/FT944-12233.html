			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Astra pays Merck Dollars 820m for 50% of drugs venture Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday paid Dollars 820m to Merck, the US's biggest drugs company, for 50 per cent of a joint marketing venture. The new company will take over marketing one of the biggest prescription medications in the US, the anti-ulcer drug Prilosec, which had sales of Dollars 684m in the first nine months of this year. Until now, the drug, developed by Astra, has been sold in the US by Merck, under a royalty agreement with the Swedish company. The new joint venture, named Astra Merck, will also develop and market new drugs from Astra and other companies. New gastrointestinal and cardiovascular drugs are likely to be the first considered by the joint venture, which could put it in direct competition with Merck. The US group's Vasotec and Mevacor are among the country's leading cardiovascular drugs. Yesterday's deal follows a 1991 agreement between the Swedish and US groups, which have co-operated in the US since 1982. The 1991 agreement provided for Astra to buy a 50 per cent stake in a new US joint-venture company, provided sales by Merck of Astra products reached a certain level. The trigger point was reached in the middle of 1993, said Dr Hakan Mogren, president and chief executive of Astra. The purchase price equals US sales of Astra drugs in the year since the level was reached, he added. The new company, based in Wayne, Pennsylvania, has 900 employees and 95 per cent of sales come from Prilosec. Mr Wayne Yetter, Astra Merck's president and chief executive, said the company aimed to develop new drugs before the Prilosec's patent runs out in 2001. Prilosec sales had not been hit by the US patent expiry of another ulcer drug, Tagamet, in April, which was followed by the launch of a cheaper form of the drug, Mr Yetter said. Prilosec acts by stopping the creation of the acid which causes ulcers, unlike Tagamet or another rival, Zantac, which suppress the secretion of the acid, Astra Merck said. Prilosec is used in acute ulcer cases, and prescription volumes have remained constant, the company added. Dr Mogren said the goodwill associated with the deal would be written off in Astra's accounts over a period of 20 years, and that over the next two years the Swedish company's share of profits from the joint venture would roughly equal the royalties it received from Merck. He said the profits would grow as the joint venture developed. Astra will continue to operate through its US subsidiary, which handles a number of anti-allergy and hospital products.</p>

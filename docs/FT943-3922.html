			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: 'I am afraid it is unsafe to land' - Michael Cassell had to prepare for an emergency It was when the Belgian businessman sitting next to me scribbled a farewell note to his wife that I began to take seriously the plight of British Midland flight BD147 as it circled Brussels airport. We might now believe that modern air travel is as routine as hopping on and off the bus. But when your aircraft's captain breaks the news there is a technical fault making the DC-9 'unsafe to land', you can't jump off and catch the one behind. The incident which last week brought a dozen 'B' movie scripts to life began with an announcement that the landing had been aborted because of indications the landing gear was faulty. The crew would consult with engineers on the ground. Passengers eyed each other, but pressed on with reading the papers and punching their laptops as the flight attendants, smiling impressively, gathered together outside the flight deck door. Minutes ticked by. The aircraft, announced the captain in his finest 'trust me' tones, would now have to fly over the airport so ground crew could take a look. Having done so, he again broke the nervous silence. There were, he said, visual indications that the landing gear was down and locked, but the instrumentation still insisted otherwise. 'I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, that we will therefore have to prepare for an emergency landing. Rescue services have been alerted. Please listen carefully to the cabin crew who will instruct you in emergency landing procedures.' Two passengers leapt to their feet. 'Sit down. Now,' snapped the chief steward. Emergency landing procedures were read out quickly from a card, perhaps too rapidly for already-racing minds to take in. 'Loosen neckties, feet under seat, head on knees, hands on head.' A stewardess asked, in an exquisitely inappropriate way, whether we were 'happy' with the instructions; individual lessons were given to those who were not. At no time was any language other than English used. Emergency exits were pointed out and we were asked to locate the nearest to us. Would assigned exits not be more sensible in order to avoid chaotic, two-way traffic in the aisle, or is it unwise to be too prescriptive in the face of unpredictable events? The aircraft circled for the last time. I envied the cars and the cows below, oblivious to the drama above their heads. The utter inability to influence the outcome induced a bizarre calm. My brain was busy with banalities rather than the meaning of life. Who would walk Muffin? Who would write the articles for the survey on European Business Locations which had put me up here? At what seemed an extraordinarily slow speed, the aircraft dropped to the end of the runway as the instruction came: 'Brace, brace, brace.' I half-heartedly obeyed, resenting the potential indignity of being found with my head between my knees. The landing was, of course, perfect. Shrieks of 'Yes]' and applause broke out. The aircraft stopped on a sixpence, surrounded by emergency vehicles; a foam cannon pointed at the window. A stewardess walked down the cabin and asked if everyone was all right. We were 'safe', the captain said, but engineers were to insert pins in the undercarriage before we moved another inch. The runway remained closed. Our flight deck heroes thanked us for our calm; we thanked them for theirs. 'That should be worth a thousand free Air Miles,' someone told the chief steward. The incident was deeply disturbing, but the handling of potential calamity by a well-rehearsed crew was professional and successful. On the return trip, I studied the emergency procedures card for the first time in years, comforted by the thought that the incident was as rare as it was unwelcome. British Midland operates more than 52,000 flights a year and says it cannot recall the last such electrical malfunction. It was, said a spokesman, a 'once in a lifetime experience for passengers and crew'.</p>

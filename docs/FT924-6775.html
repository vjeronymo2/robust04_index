			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Daewoo given unit merger deadline THE South Korean government said yesterday that Daewoo, the nation's fourth biggest conglomerate, must merge its shipbuilding and machinery subsidiaries by the end of the year. The government agreed in 1989 to provide rescue loans to debt-ridden Daewoo Shipbuilding, an unlisted subsidiary, on condition it would later merge with its listed Daewoo Heavy Industries to improve the group's financial stability and rationalise operations. The rescue package included loans and loan extensions totalling Won400bn (Dollars 502.8m) from the state-owned Korea Development Bank. Daewoo also agreed to dispose of other assets, including four subsidiaries, property and stock, to keep the shipyard afloat. It has invested Won500bn in Daewoo Shipbuilding as a result of the asset sales. Daewoo's shipbuilding unit suffered losses in the late 1980s, caused by labour problems. Losses amounted to Won69.4bn in 1987, but narrowed to Won39.7bn by 1990. Daewoo has asked the government several times to drop the merger condition since Daewoo Shipbuilding has returned to profitability, with earnings reaching Won79bn on sales of Won1,066bn in 1991. It estimates that profits will reach Won150bn this year on sales of Won1,690bn, as the company diversifies into other business sectors, including vehicle manufacturing. Nonetheless, Daewoo is concerned about adverse stock market reaction to a merger. Shareholders in Daewoo Heavy Industries fear that a merger could cause management problems and weaken the company's financial position as its debt burden increases with the addition of the bigger shipbuilding unit. Daewoo Heavy Industries had net earnings of Won18.9bn on sales of Won1,004bn in 1991. Analysts said yesterday that Daewoo may try to delay the merger until next year in the hope that the new administration, which will take office in February, may overturn the decision. The government did not reveal what penalties it might impose against Daewoo if the company refused to obey the order. Daewoo said yesterday it would begin developing a coal mine in China's Shandong province this year. The mine venture will be a joint project with the Shandong government, each investing Dollars 150m. Daewoo will also study the feasibility of manufacturing petrochemicals and rail carriages and building a hotel in the region.</p>

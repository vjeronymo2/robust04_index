What made you  do it?    [Shakhray] Yes, we voted for the amnesty, but unfortunately  it did not turn out to be quite so easy to explain our position  in the mass media. Alas, in the period of the election campaign  we encountered the concept of "democratic censorship".... So I  am grateful to the very popular TRUD for the opportunity to  express my view on this matter.    So, I believe that we voted absolutely correctly. And it was  not a sudden decision on our part. We had been committed to it  for quite a long time, since the founding congress of the Party  of Russian Unity and Accord, since 17 October 1993. The essence  of our position is that we regard the events of 3-4 October in  Moscow as an episode of civil war. And the responsibility for  it is borne equally by all branches of federal power. They  failed to reach agreement, they failed to prevent the loss of  150 lives. Civil conflicts like this cannot be assessed by  means of juridical rulings and court verdicts. You cannot be  the judge at your own trial. The logic of civil confrontations  knows only one way out: the quest for civil reconciliation.  Everyone must show repentance to the relatives of those who  died, create humane conditions for those who survived, and try  in future to minimize the negative consequences of the conflict.  That is what must be done. And that is what we were guided by  when we voted for the amnesty. But that is not all. TRUD  readers should know that at the same time we voted for the  memorandum on accord and for the decree on disbanding the  parliamentary commission to investigate the events of 3-4  October.    [Lepskiy] Were the possible consequences of the amnesty  studied beforehand?    [Shakhray] Of course. This was a political decision, and in  politics you have to know how to "calculate" how a situation  will develop many moves ahead. We predicted that two main  trends would emerge after the amnesty. First, the possibility  of closer cooperation between the president and the State Duma.  We were working on the basis that the majority in the Duma will  fulfill its election promises with the help of the amnesty, and  that the "Lefortovo" politicians will be at liberty. But at the  same time in the Russian political theater's 1994 season they  only have the opportunity to be spectators, since all the roles  have already been assigned. Neither Zyuganov nor Rybkin is  going to give up his place and his influence to Khasbulatov,  Rutskoy, or anyone else. So, like it or not, the interests of  the Duma leaders and the interests of the president temporarily  coincided: The freed men are restricted in their opportunities  to engage in effective political activity.    Second, we were working on the basis that the political  climate in society is today determined by three groups (or  elites): the Moscow, the regional, and the sector group. In  the sector group, the leading role is played by the  military-industrial and oil-and-gas complexes. The sector and  regional elites have recently been cooperating actively and  coming together as a counterweight to the Moscow elite. The  latter, preparing for a new division of powers, has concentrated  more than 70 percent of Russia's banking capital in its hands.  And now the country's political climate will be determined by  how relations develop between these groups -- peacefully or  otherwise. These "mainsprings" and "levers" will control all  political events of any importance in the near future.    Prior to the amnesty the mood was such that in April-May  there would have been a round of acute political struggle, and  the victim would have been Viktor Chernomyrdin's government.  The political figures who have come out of jail have "tangled"  the threads of these plans. Thus society has won a respite for  a few months, and the May crisis will most likely not take  place. Heaven knows, we should use this respite to achieve  accord and peace.    [Lepskiy] When you talk about peace and accord, are you  thinking only of the possible events in Moscow?    [Shakhray] Not only. Take, for instance, another  consequence of the amnesty -- Khasbulatov's return to Chechnya.  Things could hardly get any worse in Chechnya. And if  Khasbulatov sees with his own eyes how people are living, what a  disastrous situation the Chechen people are in, then I do not  think it is impossible that he will help promote the  negotiations process and the normalization of relations between  Chechnya and Russia.    [Lepskiy] So how do things stand as regards the drafting of  a memorandum or pact on civil accord?    [Shakhray] Well, strictly speaking, the Duma has already  adopted a memorandum on accord. It is another matter that the  president has set the problem of drafting another document -- a  pact (let us call it that) on civil peace. I very much wish to  hope that this will not be an alternative to the document  already adopted by the Duma. If it is an alternative, we will  soon find ourselves with... a war between pacts on civil peace.    [Lepskiy] As I understand it, the president wants this  document to be signed by people from the "risk group" -- those  who have come out of Lefortovo and other old hands at organizing  dangerous May Day parades....    [Shakhray] I am in favor of the document being signed by  representatives of all the really active political forces  without exception. Including the people who have come out of  Lefortovo.    [Lepskiy] The whole question is, is such a compromise really  possible? Does your personal experience of work in the Duma  persuade you that compromise is possible?    [Shakhray] Unlike the former Supreme Soviet, the State Duma  is quite well structured politically -- there are factions  representing the parties. And -- a very important point -- no  one faction has a sufficient majority of votes to push through  its own version of a legislative decision. For a decision to be  adopted, whether you like it or not, you have to seek a general  consensus. So the Duma council has arisen -- something in the  nature of a permanent conciliation commission. This is a very  important component in the future machinery of accord. I hope  you and I will live to see the day when this machinery will  operate smoothly everywhere. In any case, at the moment I can  only say that given the will and a sense of responsibility,  social peace can be achieved.</p>

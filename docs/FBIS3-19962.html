The EU communique stressed: "This violence endangers the  institutional order in Burundi that has been patiently and  courageously established by the democratic forces of the  country."    The worsening of the situation in Bujumbura comes as the  result of confrontation "between certain civil militia and the  forces of order," the communique notes, adding that this  violence had resulted in many victims "especially among the  unarmed and innocent populations of the two ethnic groups."    The EU appealed to all sections of Burundi society, urging  citizens to stop the violence and do everything necessary to  ensure national reconciliation and to maintain the security of  all Burundians in the democratic order.</p>

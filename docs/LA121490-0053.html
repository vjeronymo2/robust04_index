			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKERS' MAJKOWSKI OUT FOR SEASON;  </P> <P> GREEN BAY: TORN ROTATOR CUFF NOT CALLED CAREER THREATENING, BUT QUARTERBACK  WON'T BE ABLE TO THROW FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS.  </P> <P> Green Bay Packer quarterback Don Majkowski underwent surgery Thursday to repair  a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder and will miss the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Coach Lindy Infante said surgeons who performed the operation in San Diego did  not characterize the injury as career threatening, but said Majkowski would not  be able to throw for three to six months.  </P> <P> "Doctors feel very good about his chances for full recovery. There was no  mention of career ending or anything remotely like that. The prognosis is a  good one. They feel the repair is successful," Infante said.  </P> <P> He said Dr. Gary Losse and Dr. David Flood initially were performing an  arthroscopic procedure to repair an impinged nerve but then discovered a  1/2-inch-by- 1/2-inch tear in a tendon in the rotator cuff.  </P> <P> The doctors then made a separate 1 1/2-inch incision to repair the tear in a  90-minute procedure.  </P> <P> Majkowski, 26, has not played since being injured Nov. 18 at Phoenix when he  was tackled hard by Cardinal lineman Freddie Joe Nunn.  </P> <P> Tests in Green Bay earlier revealed nothing more than a bruised rotator cuff,  team doctors said.  </P> <P> Packers team physician E.S. Brusky had cleared Majkowski to play last Sunday  against Seattle, but Majkowski, who had tried to throw during two practices,  said the pain was too severe and objected.  </P> <P> He then decided to seek a second opinion and flew to San Diego on Wednesday.  </P></p>

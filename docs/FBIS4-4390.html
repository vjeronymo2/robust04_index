			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, now on an official  visit to Japan, has urged that country to relocate in Bangladesh  its industries which have become commercially disadvantageous.  She was addressing the inaugural session at the seventh meeting  of Bangladesh-Japan Committee for commercial and economic  cooperation. Begum Zia said due to fast progress in technology  and high labor cost some industries have ceased to be  commercially viable in Japan. Bangladesh offers to host these  relocations to the mutual benefit of both our countries. The  prime minister said excellent bilateral political relations  between the two countries (?naturally) translated into  increasingly active and mutually beneficial economic  cooperation, trade and tourism. She said the promising  opportunities in Bangladesh for Japanese investors and  entrepreneurs need to be materialized for the benefit of the two  countries. Begum Zia drew the attention of the Joint Committee  to the increased cooperation between the two countries in the  fields of trade, investment and tourism.    Highlighting the present social-political conditions in  Bangladesh, the prime minister said it has been able to  establish social-political stability through democratically  elected government. She said the present government is fully  committed to further strengthening and broadening the democratic  basis of the society.    Listing the success in the economic policies of the country,  Begum Zia said international financial organizations, like World  Bank and the IMF, have appreciated the economic policies of  Bangladesh. She said increased food production, faster growth  of export-oriented industries and the recent interest of foreign  investors in Bangladesh testify to the soundness of nation's  macroeconomic management. Begum Zia said in Bangladesh  privatization is being encouraged through new policies and  institutions. Bangladesh's economy is now thriving in the midst  of market forces. The prime minister said liberalization of our  trade has moved at a rate much faster than that of country's  immediate neighbors. She said new opportunities have been  created for foreign trade and investment. The prime minister  said Bangladesh encourages the strong role for the private  sector and strengthening its banking system and stock markets.  The country's laws fully protect foreign investment. Begum Zia  said the Joint Committee can play a further significant role in  disseminating in Japan the relevant information on attractive  investment opportunities in Bangladesh. She hoped the committee  will continue to play a dynamic and innovating role in  generating increasing interest among Japanese traders, investors  and tourists of Bangladesh.</p>

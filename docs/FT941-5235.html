			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Life companies pressed over pension survey Leading life insurance companies have been put on the spot by a committee of MPs about whether they took part in the survey on pension transfers that caused widespread public concern about mis-selling. Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social security committee, has written to the six largest providers of personal pensions asking if their pensions business was included in the sample studied by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. If some companies now declare that they did not take part in the study, as the Prudential has already done, attention will focus on the others. As part of the committee's inquiry into aspects of personal and state pensions, Mr Field has also written to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, which commissioned the study, asking what further steps it intends to take in response to the survey. SIB has set up an inquiry into how to ensure higher standards in the sale of pension transfers, and is due to publish a report on that by the end of this month. It will then turn its attention to how people who suffered as a result of following poor advice should be compensated. The KPMG study suggested that in only 9 per cent of cases was there evidence of substantial compliance with the regulators' rules on selling pensions to people transferring a lump sum out of an occupational pension scheme. The six organisations contacted by the committee are Pearl, TSB Group, Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Allied Dunbar and Abbey Life. This demand for information will put greater pressure on those companies which have been unwilling to reveal their participation in the study, even though regulators have emphasised that the findings were representative of the industry as a whole. At least one of those Mr Field has written to is understood to have taken part in the survey.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 6  December 1993 on page 15 reports that, according to Oscar Aleman  of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Trade Department, if Nicaragua  signs a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Mexico, it will ba able  to participate indirectly in NAFTA. He reasons that an agreement  with Mexico will favor Nicaragua because Nicaragua's labor force  is cheaper that Mexico's. Aleman believes that as Mexico  prospers under NAFTA, it will become more open to buying  Nacaraguan products, which will not have to reach the same level  of quality as they do for sale to the United States. Aleman  expects that Nicaragua will continue to export goods to the  United States under NAFTA. Nicaragua currently exports to the  United States $17 million worth of goods.    Carlos Reynaldo Lacayo, a member of the American Chamber of  Commerce, explains that joining the FTA will not solve thge  country's problems. He calls on the government to establish  fiscal, monetary, and credit policies to allow businessmen to  modernize equipment and update technology in order to be more  competitive. Lacayo explains that political and social stability  and a new labor code are also necessary to stimulate investment.</p>

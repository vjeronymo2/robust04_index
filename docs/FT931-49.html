			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds upswing The clearing late last week of a large overhang of stock in Lloyds Bank, which had acted as a considerable drag on the share price, enabled Lloyds shares to outpace the rest of a generally buoyant sector. The stock finished 12 stronger at 535p, although turnover was a relatively light 2.1m shares. A bank specialist said the fall in the share price to around 510p last week provided 'a perfect buying opportunity', adding that the recent changes introduced in the Budget prompted strong institutional demand for companies with the capability to deliver above-average dividend increases. The prospect of a further cut in UK interest rates was also seen as very positive for the stock.</p>

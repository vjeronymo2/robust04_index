			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCO PLANS OIL DEALS WITH 2 REGIONAL SOVIET COUNCILS  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield Co., undeterred by growing political tension in the Soviet  Union, said Friday that it has agreed to negotiate a joint oil exploration  venture with two local Soviet governments.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles oil company said he agreement, signed last week, was the result  of year-long discussions with the regional councils of Magadan and of the  Chukotka Autonomous Area, both in the northeastern corner of the Soviet Union,  across the Bering Sea from Alaska.  </P> <P> Any final agreement between Arco and the regional councils would also need  approval from the Russian Federation and Soviet central government in Moscow.  </P> <P> The Arco announcement came as the sudden resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze increased political uncertainty in the Soviet Union.  Shevardnadze's departure raised concerns about the possible emergence of a  dictatorship, or some other political shift.  </P> <P> Though Arco declined to comment, oil industry analysts expect some U.S. energy  companies to delay plans with the Soviets in light of the new uncertainties.  </P> <P> "I'm sure it delays everything," said John Lichtblau, president of the  Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "One of the problems they have with  making deals over there is that they didn't know how reliable their partner  was, who their partner was."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, but its industry has  fallen on hard times after peaking at 12.5 million barrels of crude oil  production daily in 1988.  </P> <P> Lichtblau said Soviet production has now dropped to 11.3 million barrels a day.  It is expected to drop even lower over the next several years unless the  Soviets receive technological assistance from the West.  </P> <P> It is unclear how much new oil could be found in the Soviet Union, although  some experts say higher production could easily equal that of a moderate-sized  member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  </P> <P> Apparently, none of the major oil companies has gone beyond signing agreements  that commit them to negotiate the possibility of a joint venture, similar to  the pact announced by Arco.  </P> <P> Experts say Chevron might be the closest to getting a final deal with the  Soviets. It is eyeing the large Tengiz oil field in the northeast Caspian Sea  region, which the Soviets have estimated could contain 25 billion barrels of  oil.  </P></p>

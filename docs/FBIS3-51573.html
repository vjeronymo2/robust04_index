			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Concerning the disturbances that have been taking  place in various educational institutions throughout the  country, Interior Relations Minister Carlos Delgado Chapellin  reiterated that these incidents are being caused by small groups  of troublemakers. He added that these groups include suspected  extremists who are being investigated.    [Begin recording] [Chapellin] I believe that this would seem  to be a political tactic that will lead nowhere. Some high  school students are being manipulated. They are students who  are being misled [words indistinct] by people who have nothing  to do with the educational sector. These disturbances have no  popular support, and the best thing the students can do is to go  home and study and allow the elected president to be sworn-in  peacefully.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, by whom are they being manipulated?    [Chapellin] Manipulated by forces associated with the  so-called extremists. We are currently investigating several  extremists. There might be some surprises in terms of who is  manipulating these squalid protest marches. Do not blow these  disturbances out of proportion because they are worthless.    [Reporter] Will the authorities ever uncover who...    [Chapellin, interrupting] Of course we will. Just yesterday  [words indistinct] four masked men. The university authorities  were the first to [word indistinct]. Let us give...    [Reporter, interrupting] Yes, but the uncertainty caused by  these same four people...    [Chapellin] Well, we will have to arrest those four people,  even if they decide to hide on university grounds. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal to extreme are required under section 182(a)(1) of the 1990 CAAA to submit a final, comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone season, weekday emissions from all sources by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1992. This inventory is for calendar year 1990 and is denoted as the base year inventory. It includes both anthropogenic and biogenic sources of VOC, nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The inventory is to address actual VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO emissions for the area during a peak ozone season, which is generally comprised of the summer months. All stationary point and area sources, as well as highway mobile sources within the nonattainment area, are to be included in the compilation. Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission inventories are first reviewed under the completeness criteria established under section 110(k)(1) of the CAAA (56 FR 42216, August 26, 1991). According to section 110(k)(1)(C), if a submittal does not meet the completeness criteria, ``the State shall be treated as not having made the submission.'' Under sections 179(a)(1) and 110(c)(1), a finding by the EPA that a submittal is incomplete is one of the actions that initiates the sanctions and Federal Implementation Plan processes (see David Mobley memorandum, November 12, 1992). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum from J.

Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing emission inventory submissions to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each emission inventory submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Final approval of the inventory will not occur until the State revises the inventory to address public comments. Changes to the inventory that impact the 15 percent reduction calculation and require a revised control strategy will constitute a SIP revision. The EPA created a ``de minimis'' exception to the public hearing requirement for minor changes. The EPA defines `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' for such purposes to be those in which the 15 percent reduction calculation and the associated control strategy or the maintenance plan showing do not change. States will aggregate all such ``de minimis'' changes together when making the determination as to whether the change constitutes a SIP revision. The State will need to make the change through a formal SIP revision process, in conjunction with the change to the control measure or other SIP programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 110(a)(2) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum from John Calcagni, Director, Air Quality Management Division, and William G. Laxton, Director, Technical Support Division, to Regional Air Division Directors, Region I&hyph;X, ``Public Hearing Requirements for 1990 Base-Year Emission Inventories for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide Nonattainment Areas,'' September 29, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Texas submitted the 1990 base year inventories for Houston/Galveston (HGA), Beaumont/Port Arthur (BPA), El Paso (ELP), and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) on November 17, 1992, as a SIP revision by cover letter from the Governor. The inventories were reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after their submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Texas subsequently held public hearings to entertain public comment on the 1990 base year emission inventories. The hearing for the HGA area was held on August 5, 1993, in Houston, Texas. The hearing for the BPA area was held on August 6, 1993, in Beaumont, Texas. The hearing for the ElP area was held on August 4, 1993, in El Paso, Texas; and the hearing for the DFW area was held on August 7, 1993, in Arlington, Texas. The State provided evidence to EPA Region 6 that the public hearings were held and that the State responded to comments. The inventories were approved by the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) on November 10, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resource Conservation (TNRCC), and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind any rules, regulations, orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

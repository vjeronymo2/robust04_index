			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia exceeds expectations BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's largest local family-controlled bank, yesterday exceeded market expectations when it reported a 30 per cent growth in profits to HKDollars 504 (USDollars 65m) in 1991 compared with HKDollars 387.7m a year earlier. The bank usually starts Hong Kong's corporate reporting season and, with profit growth nearly twice that reported a year ago, its results were seen as auspicious for the colony's corporate sector generally. As is customary with the colony's banks, Bank of East Asia provided little detail of how its profit was arrived at, although it was struck after an unspecified transfer to inner reserves. Analysts said they thought the declared growth in profits reflected actual profit growth last year. They doubted, however, if the bank would be able to maintain such a high profits growth this year. Miss Maisie Cheung, an analyst at Baring Securities, said the Bank of East Asia had a large slice of its business in the Hong Kong housing market. The government, which is concerned about spiralling property prices, has encouraged banks to rein in the lending and the longer this restraint continues profits might be less than otherwise, she said. The bank has been steadily expanding its operations in Hong Kong, China and abroad. Mr David KP Li, the bank's chief executive, said the bank planned to open two more branches in the colony this year - bringing the total to 62 - as well a banking subsidiary in Toronto and a new office in the heart of New York's Chinatown. Directors recommended a dividend of 50 cents a share which, with the interim of 25 cents, makes a total payout of 75 cents - up 20 per cent on last year's dividend. They are also recommending to shareholders a one-for-five bonus issue to be met by capitalising HKDollars 172.1m from the bank's share premium account.</p>

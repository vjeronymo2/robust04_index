			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  A U.S. District Judge has limited to $2.5 million the damages owed by Mail  Boxes Etc. to a former shareholder who successfully sued the San Diego company  for misrepresenting the value of his stock.  </P> <P> The alleged misrepresentation occured just before the shareholder's sale of  shares back to the company in 1983.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes must also pay $750,000 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiff, the  judge ruled.  </P> <P> In September, a jury awarded $4 million to family members of Gerald Aul, a Mail  Boxes Etc. co-founder.  </P> <P> The award was broken down into $2.5 million owed to Aul by the company and $1.5  million owed by Mail Boxes chief executive Tony De Sio.  </P> <P> On Monday, the court ruled that Mail Boxes faces a maximum liability of $2.5  million plus legal costs, De Sio said.  </P> <P> If Mail Boxes loses a planned appeal, it would be forced to pay $2.25 million,  since $1 million of the liability is covered by insurance.  </P> <P> The liability works out to an after-tax cost to shareholders of about 35 cents  a share, company sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (11): The winter of the 'honest brochure' - Arnie Wilson takes a light-hearted look at the tour companies' annual output Now that we are ruled by European mandarins, tour operators can no longer make extravagant claims. Not that Le Ski (0484-548996) ever did, but it is playing extra safe this year. Many of its chalets in Courchevel have 'decent sized' rooms. And 'although neither the chalet Aramis or Athos would win any architectural design awards they are solid 1960s chalets in which everything works'. While it will no longer wash to claim that St Firmin in the Basses Alpes has 'superb expert terrain' it is still possible to get away with more esoteric descriptions that cannot quite be disproved because in the end they are so subjective. Last winter two words dominated the ski brochures: 'nestled' (much favoured by Airtours 0706-260000) and 'superb' (used frequently by the Swiss Travel Service - 0920-463971). This year we have a new one: 'heaven'. It is used to describe almost every North America resort by Crystal Holidays (081-399 5144) - but rarely, if at all, for its European resorts, which tend to be merely 'paradises'. Killington, we learn, is a 'beginner's heaven'; Buttermilk and Snowmass are 'beginners' and families' heaven'. Intermediates will find 'their own ski heaven' in both Jackson Hole and Crested Butte, while 'powder-hounds will be in seventh heaven' in Steamboat. (Seventh heaven is also the destination for intermediates in Breckenridge.) And naturally, Heavenly in California is 'heavenly both in name and in fact]' Canada, it seems, also qualifies. Whistler is an 'intermediates' heaven'. There must be something lacking in Stowe, Vail, Keystone, Park City and Mammoth. All fail to receive recognition from above. Simply Ski (081-742 2541) is scrupulously honest about the daunting black runs that lead to some of its chalets in Courchevel, giving a new twist to the 'ski in, ski out' concept. The Chalet Madelon, for example, is 'ideal for those adventurous enough to negotiate the route on skis back to the door'. Likewise the Chalet Radja, where 'adventurous skiers can ski straight to the door'. Simply Ski's director of operations, James Armitage has taken a leaf from the brochures of some of his rivals who last winter featured in their own brochures, appearing as he does in two photographs. Ditto Collineige's (0276-24262) brochure, in which Colleen Gerrand (the company is named after her) pictures her husband Jean-Marie Olianti, a high-mountain guide, peering Adonis-like across the Mer de Glace in Chamonix's Vallee Blanche . . . This is a famous off-piste run: but not every tour operator seems to be quite sure what the various piste colours signify. Sally Holidays Ski Drive France (081-395 3030) may find it gets complaints from beginners confused by brochure claims that red runs are for beginners/intermediates and blue runs are for intermediates. Ski Panorama (0273-206531) which specialises in Andorra and Italy even out-does Simply Ski in the honesty department. 'Sheets are always provided, but not always towels,' it warns. 'And there will usually be one toilet roll, but this won't last all week]' Panorama also describes Pas de la Casa-Grau Roig as having 'no architectural charm' and warns that 'some rooms at the Hotel Duc (in Soldeu-El Tarter) can be a little noisy due to their situation over the disco' and that 'the Music Pub (in Livigno) is noisy and this can filter through to the apartments - so we don't recommend this accommodation for light sleepers'. Ski Esprit (0252-616789) is another company which is refreshingly honest - even in its choice of clients' letters. Last year it included one or two negative comments ('We would have preferred less food but better wine') and this year, among the praise is: 'In contrast to the excellence of the evening meal, breakfast was very disappointing.' Would that Silver Ski (0622-735544) might be brave enough to include just one even slightly less-than-glowing hero-gram in its litany of praise. Or does every single client find it perfect? Out of 48 bouquets in its brochure, there is not even the tiniest niggle. My one niggle about Virgin Ski's (0293-617181) cheerful brochure is the trail maps. Many of them are almost meaningless - especially Squaw Valley, where the runs on six mountains have been reduced to what looks like the haphazard scribblings of a monkey with a bag of coloured pens. In Switzerland, Klosters, the favourite stamping ground of British royalty also has some gems - literary carbuncles of a sort - in its promotional brochures this year. Klosters' 'degree of stimulation is 2' we are told. This includes 'stranger baths' (sounds ominous) and other attractions. You get a lot more, it seems, for your Stotinki and Bani when you ski in 'Beautiful Bulgaria' and 'Romantic Romania'. Ski Balkantours (0232-246795) compares prices with those in France. A cup of coffee on the mountain in the 'winter paradise' of Pamporovo or the 'championship ski resort' of Borovets would cost you 10p or so, and Pounds 1.15 in France. A portion of chips would cost 25p in eastern Europe and Pounds 2.30 in France. Ski Inghams (081-789 3331) has delivered a rather crushing snub to this annual brochure review. Last year I took it to task for a sloppy description of my favourite ski area, Jackson Hole ('nestled astride the magnificent Grand Tetons,' etc). This year, in response to my criticism . . . it has not changed a word. But worse, Ski The American Dream (081-552 1201), perhaps searching for inspiration for its description of Jackson, has come up with: 'Jackson Hole, nestled astride the magnificent Tetons.' It also describes Aspen as a 'Ski Heaven'. Could all these brochures be the work of one copy-writer? Or perhaps a whole team of them working in the new French Olympic resort of La Tania, which, as Stena Sealink Ski Drive Holidays (0303-221010) quite correctly points out was 'purpose-built for use by tourists'. Powder Byrne's (071-223 0601) new brochure informs us that it has made some 'interesting changes' telling us that there is 'no room for complacency'. What can this mean? 'We have added an extra nanny in Klosters and introduced 'Fat Boy' boy skis on powder courses.' Nothing shattering, then. There are some 'interesting new hotels too,' but the company stays loyal to its 'grand old creaky Hotel Vereina' even though Powder Byrne thinks it should be rated 'upper three star' rather than four-star. I normally like to compare Powder Byrne's brochure with Ski Scott Dunn's (081-767 0202), as they are usually the best two. But since Mr Dunn's brochure appears have been lost on its way to the remote part of New Zealand in which I am currently leafing through the pages of his rivals, I am sadly unable to do so. Ski Thomson's (081-200 8733) brochure has arrived, and I am shocked to find it has dropped America for the first time in almost a decade. Could it have fallen out on the way here? Finally, according to one Japanese brochure: 'The ski season depends on the snowing conditions. Facilities include the kinds of lifting apparatuses at a ski resort.' So I should hope]</p>

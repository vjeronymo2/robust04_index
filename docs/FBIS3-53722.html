			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee concluded  its meetings in Aden, the economic and trade capital, yesterday  by endorsing the Document of Pledge and Accord to build the new  Yemeni state. The document was reached through an agreement  among all parties participating in the dialogue.    This national document covers the following important issues  covered by the political forces dialogue:    The accused in disorder cases:    The document calls for firm measures to arrest fugitive  suspects in cases of assassinations, assassination attempts, and  highway robberies, and in other security violations. It also  calls for immediate legal and public trials for those arrested  in order to implement legal measures and penalties against the  accused without delay. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee  opposes any leniency or hesitation on the part of the competent  forces to take firm legal measures against those involved in  terrorist acts. It affirms the need to expeditiously issue the  regulations governing the carrying of firearms, ensure  compliance with them, and review the current law to make it  tougher in order to limit arms carrying, arms proliferation, and  arms trade, and to make sure that there are no camps or centers  for terrorist training as well as to take the appropriate  measures regarding this.    Regarding the security and military aspect, the document  affirms the need to remove all checkpoints inside and outside  the cities, whether these checkpoints are affiliated with the  Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, or both ministries. The  Interior Ministry will be responsible for defining the places in  which security interests require security points, provided that  it cooperates with the Defense Ministry to define the joint  military and security checkpoints.    The document also calls for general reconciliation among  tribes to stop Yemeni bloodshed. In accordance with this  reconciliation, no acts of revenge will be taken, and anyone who  takes revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state  organizations will take firm legal measures against these  outlaws and will define the cases -- which would prompt revenge  -- which took place before the date on which the declaration was  issued. The military units -- which were stationed in the  outskirts in some areas in the Governorates of Ta'izz, Lahij,  Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib -- will be redeployed in  areas agreed upon by a technical committee from the Armed  Forces. No military patrols will be deployed in the cities, or  along the roads. The police will be in charge of this in  accordance with security requirements. An intelligence organ  will be established in accordance with the law that will define  its structure, tasks, and powers to safeguard national  sovereignty. The document calls for discussing the methods to  end the unofficial armed presence, including the distribution of  weapons to citizens under any pretext. Any such act will be  considered a crime.    It calls for reorganizing the Ministry of Interior in a way  that the various security units, including the central security  forces, will be incorporated into it, so the ministry will have  control over them.    It calls for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the  cities, and their redeployment during a period not exceeding two  months in accordance with a consolidated central plan to  reposition, merge, and reorganize them.    It also calls for a commitment not to move any military  units  or troop or equipment reinforcements, to suspend the  implementation of military exercises, and to confine the  military police's role to that of keeping the security and  promoting the discipline of military units. The military police  will be prevented from carrying out any activity or patrols  which conflict with the duties of the public security. Any  manifestation, or measure, or conduct which would suggest  distinction or preferential treatment among the armed forces  personnel will be banned.    The officers and soldiers of the armed forces will be  prevented from intervening in the affairs of both citizens and  local authorities. They will also be prevented from carrying  out any activity in their workplaces that would conflict with  the functions of the judicial and executive authorities.    Recruiting, arming, and mobilizing military units, militias,  the Border Guard, the Popular Guard, and similar units will be  halted, and the units recently formed will be disbanded.    With regard to assessing the relationship and defining the  powers, the document stresses the need to embody the  Constitution, laws, and by-laws in practice; to spell out the  tasks and powers the Presidential Council, its chairman, and its  vice chairman will enjoy in the course of the performance of  their constitutional duties; and to reconsider the duties and  prerogatives of the Presidential Council Office accordingly.    The disbursement of public funds outside the purposes  defined  in the general budget's current expenditure and development  expenditure will be banned. There is a need to abide by the  powers defined for disbursement. The powers regarding  disbursement for senior state officials will be defined.    With regard to the bases of building a modern state and its  bodies, the dialogue committee affirmed that the major task lies  in building the state and repairing the problems from the  previous phase. Our experience since the formation of the  Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way of  running state affairs has been an obstacle to the merger of the  two former regimes and to building a united state.    With regard to the organization of the central authority,  the  document explained the following: The House of Representatives  is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen, and it is  elected by the people through secret, free, and direct  balloting. The Constitution defines the House's powers, duties,  terms of membership, and its means of nomination and voting.    The Consultative Council comprises an equal number of  members  representing the local administrative units. These members are  elected by the governorates' councils. The Constitution defines  the number of members from each and every administrative unit,  membership terms, and the method of nomination and voting.    The document also defines the tasks and powers of the  Consultative Council. The document states that the presidency  of the state constitutes the sovereign power of the state and is  composed of the Presidential Council, which includes five  members elected by the House of Representatives and the  Consultative Council together. The House of Representatives  elects a president and a vice president from among its members.  The term of membership of the Presidential Council has been set  to two electoral terms. The document also identifies the powers  and tasks of the Council as set by the Constitution. It also  defines the tasks and powers of the president, the vice  president, the Presidential Council members, the government, and  the judiciary.    With regard to local government, the document affirms that  it  must be based on a new administrative configuration of the  Republic of Yemen, revoking the existing administrative  structures and units through which the country will be fully  merged and all manifestations of partition will disappear.    The document of pledge and accord also defines the powers of  local administration, which shall be based on direct and free  elections. It also defines financial, administrative, economic,  social, security, educational, health, and social services.    In the field of rebuilding and reorganizing the armed  forces,  the document considers the reorganizing of the armed forces one  of the major issues. The armed forces shall be affiliated  directly with the government. No side shall be authorized to  form a military or semi-military force. A general plan shall be  prepared to rehabilitate, merge, and reorganize the armed forces.    In the field of education, the document stresses the need to  unify school curriculum. The document urges the formation of a  higher national security council and the identification of its  tasks. The document also stresses the need to reactivate the  central audit and control bureau as a body that is independent  of the executive power. It shall be directly affiliated with  the legislature.    In the field of economy and financial organization, the  document sets a number of steps aimed at abiding by a general  state budget that defines expenditures and revenues and  nourishes the economy in all fields.    The document urges abidance by the current Constitution  until  it is amended, providing that an action shall be carried out to  make constitutional amendments within a period of three months  and not exceeding five months.    The document stresses the need to give the government all  powers and not to interfere in its work in order to enable it to  execute its tasks. The government shall set timetables to  accomplish the set tasks within a month.    The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall supervise and  follow up the implementation of the decisions stipulated by the  Document of Pledge and Accord between the parties to the  dialogue of political forces to establish a modern Yemeni state.    Regarding the necessary security arrangements and conditions  to sign the agreement and begin to implement it, the document  stipulates that a committee should be formed comprising the  parties to the dialogue. The committee shall make the necessary  arrangements to provide the required security conditions to sign  the agreement and establish guarantees for the beginning of  implementation, in coordination with the president and [word  indistinct]. A date shall be set in light of the arrangements  that will be reached.    Afterward, the participants to the dialogue of the political  forces signed the Document of Pledge and Agreement.    The meeting also endorsed the formation of a committee to  follow up on the implementation of the seventh paragraph of the  pledge document on making preparations and providing security  conditions to endorse the document in a final manner and to  specify the guarantees for its implementation. The committee  comprises the following brothers:    Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum; Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-Shawarib; 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi; Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Iryani; Jarallah 'Umar; and [first name indistinct] Ahmad  Jabir, the committee's rapporteur.</p>

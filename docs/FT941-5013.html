			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Increase in output strengthens hopes of steady recovery: Pessimism over base rate cut hits shares Fears that the UK economic recovery might be faltering were assuaged yesterday by news of faster-than-expected growth in manufacturing output and industrial production in January. The Central Statistical Office said January's manufacturing output was 1.1 per cent higher than in December, while industrial production, which includes energy, rose by 0.8 per cent. However, the January increases are from a lower base as the CSO reduced its estimates of output and manufacturing production in 1993. The output statistics depressed sentiment on the London stock market as traders felt it made an immediate cut in base rates less likely. Shares were also hit by falls in bond markets in Germany and the UK. The FT-SE 100 index fell 41.5 points to close at 3,264.4. Weak economic statistics published last month had cast doubt on the strength of the UK recovery and revived calls for sharper base rate cuts. Manufacturing output had been estimated to have fallen by 0.5 per cent in December, although that has been revised to a 0.2 per cent fall. Many of the figures appear to have been distorted by the effect of the Christmas period and the CSO prefers to look at quarterly trends. Manufacturing output was 0.6 per cent higher in the three months to January than in the previous three. Industrial production was 0.9 per cent higher. 'The figures confirm that the December data were erratic and that people are still too downbeat about the prospects for economic recovery in the UK,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, who last week increased his forecast of this year's UK economic growth from 2.6 to 2.8 per cent. The government is forecasting a 2.5 per cent growth in UK gross domestic product in 1994. Some observers, however, believe that tax increases taking effect next month will slow the pace of economic growth. Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming thinks a combination of higher taxes and a weak labour market will restrict consumer spending and limit GDP growth to 1.8 per cent this year. Yesterday's figures prompted the CSO to increase its estimates of the trend in manufacturing output growth from 1 per cent to 2 per cent annually and for the trend in production from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent annual growth. The main source for January's manufacturing output rise was the engineering sector, notably electrical and optical equipment. The main reason for the downward revision in estimated 1993 growth in manufacturing output and industrial production was higher than expected export prices. The CSO uses the inflation rate to 'deflate' output cash totals and reach volume estimates. As a result, manufacturing output was 1.8 per cent higher in 1993 than in 1992, down from the previous 1.9 per cent estimate, whereas 1993 industrial production was 2.5 per cent up on 1992.

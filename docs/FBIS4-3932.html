			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A modern mobile  telephone production line started operating early this month in  Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province.    It is expected to produce the world's up-to-date 9900X  mobile  phones for this country's large telecommunications market.    With an annual production capacity of 400,000 mini mobile  phones, the production line is another important landmark for  Hangzhou Telecommunications Equipment Factory, which last April  put into operation an 8900X production line, using technology  from Motorola, the U.S. blue-chip company.    According to sources from the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, China has registered 480,000 subscribers of  mobile telephones, 2.67 times the total figure for all the  previous years.</p>

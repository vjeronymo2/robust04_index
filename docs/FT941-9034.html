			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Mandela acts to avert poll boycott by S African right Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday announced constitutional concessions aimed at averting a rightwing boycott of South Africa's all-race elections and reducing the threat of violence. 'We must treat the threat of civil war seriously. That is why we have gone out of our way to make these concessions,' Mr Mandela said after an emergency meeting of the ANC's policymaking national executive committee. The concessions would strengthen the powers of provinces under the country's post-apartheid constitution, but they fall short of the demands of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party for provincial autonomy. Mr Rowan Cronje, chairman of the Freedom Alliance which comprises Inkatha and rightwing whites, said he would ask for a meeting with the ANC today. Inkatha said it would study the concessions. However, before the ANC announcement, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, speaking in Cape Town, outlined a tougher stance. He said he believed the demand by Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, for an independent Zulu homeland, which Mr Mandela ruled out, was probably 'irreversible'. Mr Mandela proposed constitutional changes are aimed at accommodating not only Inkatha, but also the white rightwing Afrikaner Volksfront, which demands a homeland for Afrikaners. The concessions include powers of taxation for provincial governments and a safeguard for the right to 'self-determination' - a key demand of the white right - as well as measures to protect the powers of provinces when the elected assembly writes a new constitution to replace the 1993 interim constitution. These concessions would probably not affect the basic nature of the current constitution, which provides for strong central government rather than the federal system demanded by Chief Buthelezi. But they would partly meet Chief Buthelezi's concerns, and demonstrate the ANC's willingness to consider compromise. On provincial powers, Mr Mandela said: 'The matter is on the agenda, and we are prepared to hammer out a solution.' He said the ANC approved amending the new constitution to allow consideration of an Afikaner homeland after the election. The ANC also dropped its demand for a single-ballot system in the April 26-28 election, and called for multi-party negotiations to be reconvened on Monday to approve the decision. Separate ballots would be cast in provincial and national elections, favouring the regional parties. President FW de Klerk said parliament would be recalled in March to incorporate the proposed amendments in the constitution and to extend the deadline for parties to register for elections. Government officials argue that this should be done, whether or not the right accepts the amendments, to undermine the right's moral position in boycotting elections.

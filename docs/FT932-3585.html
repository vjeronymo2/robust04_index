			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Italian bank reform set to spur privatisation ITALY'S banks have been given the go-ahead to take stakes in industrial companies, in a step aimed at assisting privatisation and bailing out troubled private companies. Commercial banks will be able to own up to 15 per cent of industrial companies directly, provided the stakes do not damage their profits. The size and number of equity stakes will be limited by criteria set by the Bank of Italy, based on a commercial bank's size and type of business. Large commercial banks will not be able to invest more than 6 per cent of their capital in a single stake, and not more than 40 per cent for all their industrial participations. The plan to reform one of the central pillars of Italy's 1936 banking law, made by the central bank last month and approved by a cabinet committee on Friday night, takes the country's banking rules closer to the German model. The long-discussed change has been accelerated by the severe debt crisis faced by a number of Italian companies. Rescue talks are under way between Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, and bank creditors, while creditors are negotiating a restructuring of the Aga Khan's Ciga hotels chain. Ferruzzi and Ciga have debts of L31,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) and well over L1,000bn respectively. Reform of banking rules could also ease the government's privatisation plans. Allowing the banks to take stakes in privatised companies could help overcome liquidity problems on the small Milan stock exchange and provide the government with much-needed cash to curb the huge budget deficit. Italy's privatisation programme, involving the disposal or flotation of large swathes of the state's activities in industry, energy and financial services, has had a slow start. Although handicapped by domestic political uncertainties, disposals have also been held back by limited interest. Some observers fear reform of the banking law could put pressure on state-owned banks, which dominate the financial system, to buy up privatised assets. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, said the change was 'a question of force majeure' in the current economic climate. A senior Italian official has confirmed the government has reached a compromise with the European Commission on reforming new laws on securities trading to bring them into line with EC rules. This follows a Commission threat to bring Italy before the European Court of Justice over rules forcing foreign stockbrokers and securities houses to set up trading activities in the country. Rome will alter its controversial law, named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new form of securities broker, to conform with EC rules on freedom of establishment and the free provision of services. 'Effectively, Italy will anticipate the EC directive on investment services,' the official said.</p>

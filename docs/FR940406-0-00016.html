			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission suggested merging &sect;268.102(u) into &sect;268.102(t) of the Rules, so that both paragraphs relate to sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Board has adopted this suggestion. The Commission also suggested that the Board amend the definition of ``individual with a disability'' to exclude from the definition alcoholics and individuals with current infectious diseases. With the assistance of the Commission's staff, the Board has inserted language in &sect;268.303 which provides that alcoholics will be held to the same performance and conduct standards that all other Board employees must satisfy, following the Commission's regulations regarding holding alcoholics to the same performance and conduct standards to which an employer holds its other employees. 29 CFR 1630.16(b). In addition, language has been inserted to prevent persons with infectious diseases from working in the Board's food handling area, following the Commission's regulations regarding infectious and communicable diseases for food handling jobs. 29 CFR 1630.16(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission suggested that adoption of part 268 by the Board is unnecessary in light of the Commission's Government-wide complaint processing procedures. 29 CFR part 1614. The Board believes, however, based on specific provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and established precedent, that adoption of part 268 is necessary to authorize and insure the Board's compliance with the important national policies set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the other laws cited above. The Board will continue to work closely with the Commission to insure effective implementation of these Rules consistent with those laws and the policies of the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter expressed a concern regarding the organizational placement and reporting relationship of the EEO Programs Officer. Citing the Commission's Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity regulations (29 CFR 1614.102(b)(3)), the commenter proposed that the EEO Programs Officer report to the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The Commission addressed this matter in the preamble to its regulations and stated ``Moreover, &sect;1614.607 permits [the agency head] to delegate that authority. Ultimate responsibility would remain, though, with the higher official.'' 57 FR 12642, April 10, 1992. The Board believes that the EEO Programs Officer's reporting relationship is appropriate and is consistent with the Commission's approach. In this connection, the Board's Rule provides that the EEO Programs Officer, who reports to the Staff Director for Management and whose title has been changed to ``EEO Programs Director'' as reflected in this Final Rule, may ``advise and consult with the Chairman of the Board of Governors *&blank;*&blank;*'' &sect;268.103(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Revisions to Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional, minor modifications have been made in the final rule based on comments received from Board staff. These modifications are not substantive:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The third sentence in &sect;268.103(c)(11) has been re-written to reflect actual practice concerning the EEO Programs Director's contracting authority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;268.202 stating that section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act is covered by these Rules, which caused paragraphs (d) and (e) to be renumbered as paragraphs (e) and (f);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Sections 268.202(e)(13), 268.205(c), 268.204(b) and 268.604(b) were modified to clarify existing language in the interim rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Section 268.204(f) was modified to make it clear that the Board will develop and use alternative dispute resolution procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Section 268.206(a)(7) was modified to provide that the Staff Director for Management or the General Counsel, or their designees, should consult with the EEO Programs Director before issuing the certification as provided for in subparagraph (7);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Because of the strict time limits governing the issuance of a final decision, &sect;&sect;268.209(a) and 268.709(k) have been modified to provide that the Governors will have only 3 business days (formerly 7 calendar days) to ask that a matter be brought to the full Board for final decision rather than be resolved by the Board's delegee; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Section 268.304(b)(3) was modified so that it now provides that the Board will prefer only U.S. citizens over equally qualified noncitizens in hiring. This was done to insure compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rules are hereby issued as the Board's final rule and this final rule shall be made effective 30 days from publication. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 268  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Age, Americans with disabilities, Civil rights, Equal employment opportunity, Federal buildings and facilities, Federal Reserve System, Government employees, Religious discrimination, Sex discrimination, Wages.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by revising 12 CFR part 268 to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 268_RULES REGARDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

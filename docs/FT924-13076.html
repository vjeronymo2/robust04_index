Lord Kadoorie, 93, will be joined in retirement by group managing director Sir William Stones, 69, who has served for 18 years. Lord Kadoorie helped lead Hong Kong's transformation from a colonial backwater to an international trading powerhouse. He rebuilt China Light after Japan's Second World War occupation of Hong Kong, starting with a single turbine, into a group with power sales last year of HKDollars 11.9bn (USDollars 1.54bn). Lord Kadoorie will be succeeded by Sir Sidney Gordon, 75, who has been associated with the company for 45 years.</p>

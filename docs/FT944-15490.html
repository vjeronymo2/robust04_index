			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ross tumbles to Pounds 15,000 as costs of restructuring bite Restructuring costs of Pounds 500,000 reduced pre-tax profits at Ross Group, the consumer products and technical services company, from a restated Pounds 602,000 to just Pounds 15,000 for the six months to June 30. The shares closed 2p down at 8 1/2 p. Turnover of continuing operations rose by 41 per cent, from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 32.3m. Operating profits fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 32,000. The technical services division suffered 'significant losses', which would continue into the second half, said Mr Noel Hayes, chairman. The company had recently won two contracts for test rigs, the benefits of which would be apparent in the 1995 results. Stiff competition and small margins, together with the costs of integrating three businesses into one site at Bolton, depressed profits in the consumer products division. Better news came from the Powercords division, which makes plug-in power supplies for mobile phones, said Mr Hayes. Tadmod was expected to increase turnover by 75 per cent in 1994, and Ross was anticipating a further 35 per cent increase for 1995. The group is targeting Asian markets through Accom, its joint venture company in China. The group also disposed of Traveller, its travel accessories company. Losses per share came out at 0.04p, compared with earnings of 0.29p, and there is no interim dividend (0.2p). The company will not make a decision on a final dividend until the end of the first quarter of 1995.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Observer: Nothing ventured Britain's venture capitalists seem to be getting itchy feet. Robert Drummond, 48, the venture capital industry's answer to BBC TV Troubleshooter Sir John Harvey-Jones, resigned as chairman of Grosvenor Venture Managers just before Christmas, and now Jon Moulton, Schroder Ventures' high-profile managing partner, has quit. Moulton, who built Schroder Ventures into one of the most successful UK venture capital firms, has fallen out with his patrons once too often. Apparently, Schroders wanted tighter controls while Moulton yearned for greater freedom. A familiar story in an industry which spends its time backing entrepreneurs with big egos. Citicorp reached an amicable agreement last year with its venture capital team, allowing them to set themselves up as an independent company but with a commitment from the bank to continue providing funds. Did this tempt Moulton, 42, a former general manager of Citicorp Venture Capital, to overplay his hand? Whatever the answer, it sounds like he will not be out of work for long. One investor has already offerred him Pounds 50m to play with.</p>

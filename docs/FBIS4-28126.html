			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Escalating land prices seen  in Japan's "bubble economy" in the late 1980s and early 1990s  will become a legend, according to a government survey released  Sunday [5 June].    The Prime Minister's Office sent questionnaires to 3,000  people aged 20 or over in late February, of which 2,153  responded.    Thirty-three percent of respondents believe land prices will  continue to rise in the foreseeable future, compared with 75  percent who thought so in the previous poll in June 1988.    Japan's land prices have taken a downward turn after peaking  in fall 1990, after the speculative bubble economy with its  inflated land and stock prices burst.    The percentage of those who said they believe prices will  head up in the coming years fell to 31 percent, sharply down  from 75 percent in 1988.    The poll showed 66 percent believe present land price levels  are still high, with those who live in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya  or those who do not own housing particularly saying so.    Nearly 60 percent said they favor current falling land  prices  and hope they decline further, according to the poll.    The percentage of those who want to have their own land and  homes stood at 84 percent, a 14 point gain from 69 percent in  the previous survey, it said.    " People are beginning to buy their own houses again as a  result of lower land prices recently," an analyst at the Prime  Minister's Office said.    The poll also found 62 percent think housing property is a  more attractive asset in the investment portfolio than savings,  deposits and shares.</p>

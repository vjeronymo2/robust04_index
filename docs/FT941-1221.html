			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: French bank defies trend to lift earnings by 10% Credit Commercial de France last year withstood the pressures on the French banking sector to lift net profits 10.2 per cent, to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 189m) from FFr978m in 1992. The gain came in spite of losses at the recently-acquired Banque de Savoie. Mr Charles de Croisset, who last summer replaced Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman when he left to head Banque Nationale de Paris, said he expected the group to continue improving this year, and record its '11th consecutive year of profits growth'. The principal problem for CCF during 1993 was Banque de Savoie, the regional banking group in which it has raised its stake from 24 per cent to 96 per cent. The bank, which has been badly affected by the economic recession in its area of southern France, saw net losses deepen to FFr110m from FFr29.4m in 1992. Mr de Croisset said he planned a capital increase to refinance Banque de Savoie. 'It ought to help Banque de Savoie to find its feet again,' he said. In spite of Banque de Savoie's difficulties, CCF mustered a 12.7 per cent increase in net banking income, to FFr9.2bn last year from FFr8.2bn (restated). CCF also lifted gross operating profits by 23.5 per cent, to FFr3.21bn from FFr2.6bn (restated), over the same period. However, the group was also forced to raise net new provisions by 15.7 per cent, to FFr1.54bn from FFr1.33bn. Consequently, it trimmed the growth in net attributable earnings per share to 5 per cent, with an increase to FFr18.03 from FFr17.18. The board has decided to increase the dividend to FFr4.30 from FFr4.</p>

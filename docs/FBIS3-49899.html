The members of UNPROFOR [UN Peacekeeping Forces] from  Sweden,  Denmark and Norway were deployed in the Tuzla area. One part of  this unit spent several months in the Pancevo barracks, waiting  for permission from the authorities of the republic of Srpska to  transport the 11 peace force tanks to Tuzla.    The republic of Srpska, however, regarded this intention as  an attempt at irregularly applying the existing Blue Helmets  mandate.    Representatives of the republic of Srpska army pointed out  that UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping peace and providing  humanitarian aid to civilian population, in the course of which  they were authorized to carry personal and defensive weapons. A  tank of the Leopard kind is neither a personal nor a defensive  weapon.    Since no agreement on the passage of the tanks was reached,  the Nordic soldiers have left Pancevo. In addition to the tanks  and soldiers, 23 armored personnel carriers have also left  Stevica Jovanovic barracks aboard three trains, the federal  government committee says. [passage omitted]</p>

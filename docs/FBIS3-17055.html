			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The number of non-ethnic  Estonians who had obtained Estonian citizenship by the beginning  of February was 16,324, statistics reports show.    Of these more than sixteen thousand people, 3,390 were  granted citizenship under the regular naturalization procedure,  and 605, for outstanding merit before the Republic of Estonia.    Estonia has established regulations favoring people who  registered themselves in 1990-1991 as applicants for the  Estonian citizenship with the Congress of Estonia, a parallel  parliament set up to stand for the legitimacy of interests and  legal continuity of the pre-war Republic of Estonia in the  country's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union.    A total 12,329 holders of the Congress of Estonia cards, who  are not required to pass the language exam or the one-year  waiting period after entering the citizenship application, had  obtained citizenship by early last month.    Also 12,718 ethnic Estonians who were not citizens by birth  had been granted citizenship. Ethnic Estonians can obtain  citizenship under looser procedure rules.    Russian-speakers make up about one-third of Estonia's 1.5  million population. A considerable number of ethnic Russians  also are citizens by birth and received citizenship without  having to apply for it. Their exact number is not known.</p>

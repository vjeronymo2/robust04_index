			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Thames ferry service launched A COMMUTER passenger service on the River Thames in London is to be launched by Catamaran Cruisers, a subsidiary of Sodexho, the French-owned group. The service will operate every 15 minutes in morning and evening peak periods between Charing Cross the City and Canary Wharf. The Port of London Authority selected Catamaran Cruisers from a shortlist of four bids to replace the RiverBus service which went into liquidation last month. Catamaran Cruisers will use conventional craft.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KARPOV CHECKMATES TIMMAN  </P> <P> Former world champion Anatoly Karpov won the World Candidates chess final today  by beating Dutchman Jan Timman, earning the right to a world championship  rematch with fellow Soviet Gary Kasparov.  </P> <P> The $3-million championship match, the fifth between the archrival grandmasters  in six years, will be held in New York in October.  </P> <P> Timman resigned after 56 moves in the ninth game, which grandmasters and chess  experts said was the best game of the tournament.  </P> <P> The victory put Karpov in a jubilant mood and not only because the Soviet  grandmaster earned the lion's share of the $250,000 in prize money.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to win so easily," Karpov said.  </P> <P> Karpov and Kasparov last locked horns in a two-month duel in Seville, Spain,  that ended with Kasparov retaining the world title he had seized from Karpov in  1986.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Factional leaders of ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] have again committed  themselves to another cease-fire accord to end the bitter  fighting within the organization. At a meeting held in  Monrovia, Roosevelt Johnson demanded a change in ULIMO's  representation on the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional  Government] cabinet to reflect ethnic balance of Krahns and  Mandingos. ULIMO's representation to the LNTG cabinet is  dominated by Mandingos.</p>

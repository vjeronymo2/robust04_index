			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Tebbit warns of rejoining ERM LORD TEBBIT, the former Conservative cabinet minister and party chairman, claimed yesterday that the Maastricht treaty would result in sterling being dragged back into the European exchange rate mechanism 'before long', Ivor Owen writes. Lord Tebbit said: 'I believe that could provoke a political crisis.' Lord Tebbit joined Mr William Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic in the Commons, in repudiating the view of Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, who on Tuesday reaffirmed that there was no obligation under the treaty 'to work towards fixed exchange rates or membership of the ERM'. Lord Tebbit, speaking at the launch of a pamphlet on the Maastricht treaty, written by Mr Martin Howe, suggested the votes of crossbench peers could be decisive when the campaign for a referendum is taken up in the Lords.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  met here this afternoon with Oskar Lafontaine,  minister-president of Germany's Saar Land Government, and his  party.    Li said China has always attached importance to and been  committed to the development of long-term and stable ties of  friendly cooperation with Germany.    It falls in line with the interests of both China and  Germany  to expand their cooperation in all fields, Li said.    "We are pleased with the good trend of development in  Sino-German relations," Li said, noting that there have been  frequent high-level exchanges and contacts between various  departments of the two countries.

During the meeting, Lafontaine showed much interest in the  implications and content of China's socialist market economy.  Li briefed Lafontaine on this, and Lafontaine briefed Li on his  view of the present situation in Europe.

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: A short life on the shelf - How 7-Eleven in Japan uses customer information to sell more goods Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain, likes to know its customers intimately. Its recently upgraded point-of-sales (Pos) system helps to ensure this is the case. Checkout assistants key into the checkout terminals the age and sex of each customer as they key in the price of goods. The company says the information means it can stock the products its customers want to buy. Establishing a customer's sex should be straightforward. Age is more of a problem. 7-Eleven's youthful team of checkout assistants must guess a customer's age within five bands: Under 13, 13-19, 20-29, 30-49 and over 50. Each is a distinct consumer group with different needs and spending patterns, according to the marketing theory. 7-Eleven says that analysing the data enables each of the chain's 4,500 stores in Japan to tailor its stock to the local market and compete more effectively with large retailers. If the store is near a school it will stock items that students are likely to want; if it is in a residential area it will stock more household goods. Mini-computers have been installed in all of the stores (franchises as well as directly-run outlets). A time-switch on the computer produces two graphs overlaid every two hours: the age/sex profile is laid over the latest stock and sales position. The graphics give store managers a snapshot that should improve their ability to make accurate decisions about what stock to buy. Slow-moving goods or dead stock are swiftly removed from the shelves. 7-Eleven stores in Japan typically stock about 3,000 products per 100 sq metres of shop space. The lifecycle for any product can be short - about 70 per cent are changed in a year. The company has increased sales and reduced inventories as a result of its attention to customer profile and inventory control. The latest upgrading also includes graphic ordering terminals. These hand-held consoles with tiny graphic screens enable swift and well-informed ordering from the shop floor. Inventory scanners have also been introduced. Bar codes on deliveries are scanned and the information is fed into the store's mini-computer. Before the scanners, a warehouse worker ticked off goods against a computer print-out. Information can be exchanged between the mini-computers, graphic ordering terminals and cash registers. The mini-computers are also linked to the central distribution system. The company's latest Pos system was installed 14 months ago. It will be upgraded between April and July this year. 7-Eleven's Pos system has been converted partly to digital technology which enables the transmission of voice, data and graphic information using phone lines. Much of the network still operates on a traditional analogue network. The company is planning to covert the whole system to an integrated services digital network (ISDN) over the next few years. 7-Eleven's head office, stores and distribution centres were connected to a central computer in August 1979. Since then, it has exploited the network at a breathtaking pace. In 1981, the company installed a computerised Pos system with terminals at each store. A four-temperature (hot for rice, cool for noodles, chilled for milk, frozen for ice cream), delivery and distribution system was tagged on to the system in 1984, linking wholesalers and producers. In 1986, new checkout terminals were brought in, allowing data communications between individual stores and suppliers. In 1988, 7-Eleven customers were able to pay their electricity and gas bills at the neighbourhood store - bills include bar codes that can be read by terminals at 7-Eleven stores. The Pos upgrading to be installed this spring will bring in equipment for the launch of 7-Eleven's joint venture with Shop America, a US-based direct mail catalogue sales operation. A nine-inch, double-sided screen will be attached to existing checkout terminals, one side facing the checkout and the other the customer. Customers will be able to order from a range of foreign-made goods direct from the US at any 7-Eleven check-out. Information about an item  - prices and availability - will show up on the screen. The screens would also be able to display, for example, the plan of a theatre, enabling a customer to choose seats and order tickets at the checkout. Investment in 7-Eleven's latest Pos installation and the upgrading this spring will cost the company Y35bn (Pounds 160m). 7-Eleven Japan's parent company, Ito-Yokado, is eager to export the Japanese chain's retailing methods to the US, where 7-Eleven was founded. Last year, Ito-Yokado took control of Southland, the Dallas-based convenience store group which runs 7,000 shops in the US and nearly 2,000 in 20 other countries. Ito-Yokado made clear at the time it would want to teach the troubled US chain (from which the original 7-Eleven Japan licensing rights were bought) how to run convenience stores. Don Cowan, publicity manager for 7-Eleven in the US, says tests are under way to determine what kind of system might work best in America, but it is 'some distance away' from an advanced network. 'No one knows yet whether or not what is effective in Japan would work the same in the US,' says Cowan.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Its decline is attributed primarily to development and succession of its habitat, and these threats to the species' survival persist. Sandy pineland communities where the species exists have proven to be especially vulnerable to development because soils are level, deep, and suitable for building sites. Remaining American chaffseed sites are threatened primarily by activities or management practices that result in restriction or suppression of fire, which is apparently needed to maintain the open subclimax ecosystem inhabited by the species. Other continuing threats to American chaffseed include inadvertent disturbance to plants, discontinuation of game management and the consequent cessation of burning, conversion of the fire-maintained flatwoods and savannas to commercial pine plantations, commercial pine straw raking, and the increasing restrictions on prescribed burning of forest tracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclassification of the American chaffseed is the primary objective of the draft Recovery Plan. Reclassification to threatened status will be considered when at least 50 geographically distinct American chaffseed populations are permanently protected and managed as needed to ensure long-range viability, and the species is established or found at four additional sites in the northern portion of its range. A delisting objective is not being defined at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recovery of the American chaffseed will be achieved through a combination of habitat protection and management, reintroduction of the species in portions of its former range, research aimed at better understanding the species' biology in order to predict viability of populations, and research to determine the best techniques to maintain the species and its habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described.

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German banks offer hope on interest rates Bourses pulled back some of their losses in the afternoon, seeing a measure of recovery in bond markets, and in the dollar, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT incorporated Thursday's post-bourse losses and dropped further by the end of the session when the Dax index was 2,130.06, down nearly 14 points from the previous afternoon's close and off 1.2 per cent on the week. However, bund futures rose late, there was a slight gain in the dollar, and the Ibis-indicated Dax recovered to end just 0.36 down at 2,144.00. The Federation of German Banks said yesterday that German interest rates could continue to fall in spite of increases in US rates. In Milan, Deutsche Bank said that the Bundesbank is likely to cut official lending rates half a percentage point in April, with a further half a point cut before the end of the year. Turnover fell DM3bn to DM7.6bn. Volkswagen fell DM3.50 to DM499.30 but it continued its upward career in relative terms, just overtaking BMW - down DM14.50 to DM818 - in the performance stakes with a gain of 13.5 per cent since January 1. PARIS dipped sharply in the last moments of trading as the matif continued to exert its influence over equities. In a volatile start to the new account the CAC-40 index moved from a day's high of 2,171 to a low of 2,113, before settling down 15.94 at 2,136.62. The market has lost 3.8 per cent over the week. Turnover was moderate at FFr4.4bn. Disappointing results from Credit Lyonnais after the close on Thursday upset sentiment, and particularly Thomson-CSF, which holds a 20 per cent stake and slipped FFr13.30 or 7 per cent to FFr175.20. Credit Lyonnais said that it was omitting the dividend. Societe Generale was expected to benefit on Monday from better than expected results announced after the close on Friday. It closed FFr3 lower at FFr637, before a 10 per cent rise in 1993 profit and an increased dividend. AMSTERDAM closed the session and the week on a negative note. The AEX index slipped 1.26 or 406.83, bringing the week's decline to 2.8 per cent. There were some heavy falls among the major blue chips, although DSM resisted the trend with a rise on the day of Fl 4.50 to Fl 129, as investors were seen switching out of Akzo Nobel, down Fl 4.60 at Fl 214.60. DSM is seen as benefitting from the possible turnround in the European chemical sector. MILAN saw an unexpected round of buying on the last trading day before the general election on Sunday and Monday; the Comit index added 2.48 to 669.73, 0.7 per cent lower on the week. Domestic retail investors emerged as buyers, adding to short-covering activity by institutional investors expecting a flat market on Monday. NatWest Securities expected that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, and followed by a tense period of negotiation to form a new coalition government: 'Volumes will be lower and market conditions more volatile after the poll. Longer term, however, we expect that a 'technocratic' government will be formed which will be able to continue the economic policies of the last administration.' Industrials were at the centre of attention with Fiat rising L129 or 2.6 per cent to L5,124; Montedison was L58 or 4.7 per cent higher at L1,298 in heavy volume of 55m shares. Olivetti added L28 to L2,584 with the decision on the awarding of Italy's second mobile telephone licence expected imminently. Pirelli rose L120 or 4.9 per cent to L2,543, largely on short covering and optimism over the 1993 results. MADRID featured the requotation of Hidroelectrica de Cataluna, down Pta59 to Pta611 as the market absorbed details of the sale of the company's non-nuclear assets in a restructuring of the industry. Turnover was high at Pta45.4bn as the general index closed 1.19 lower at 329.39, down 2.3 per cent on the week. STOCKHOLM continued to weaken in thin trading. The Affarsvarlden index dropped 28.2 to 1,438.6, for a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover eased to SKr1.90bn from SKr1.96bn. The banking sector was one of the day's steepest fallers, while Ericsson B lost SKr16 to SKr347. ISTANBUL rose 4.3 per cent ahead of Sunday's local elections. The composite index added 555.40 to 13,536.12, with many investors discounting the rise in overnight rates to some 900 per cent, as the central bank attempted to check an anticipated rush on the US dollar.

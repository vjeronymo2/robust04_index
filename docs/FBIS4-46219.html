			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Adams: "Revealed: How Iran's Terror </F> Network Embraced the IRA"]    [Text] The IRA leaders flew secretly to Tehran, taking  steps to ensure they were not being tailed on the journey from  their homes in Ireland. The meeting they were attending last  November was one of the group's most important for a long time:  a gathering of the world's terror organisations at the behest of  their Iranian paymasters.    As the IRA bosses walked into the Feirouzi palace, they  joined leading figures from some of the most secretive and  feared groups in the world: the Japanese Red Army, the Basque  terrorist group, Eta, Hezbollah, the Abu Nidal organisation and  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General  Command.    The terrorists were met by Muhsin Reza'i, commander of the  Iranian Revolutionary Guard. There was only one item on the  agenda: a plan by Iran to fund and arm a new "terrorist  international" in exchange for the launching of attacks against  western targets.    The aim was to cause unprecedented devastation in western  European capitals with co-ordinated bombings and assassinations.  According to senior intelligence officials, Iran hoped to fuel  revolution in Europe and make it pay a heavy price for  supporting American policies in the Middle East.    The meeting, the biggest terrorist gathering since the early  1970s, was closely monitored by western intelligence.  Immediately afterwards, agencies across Europe and the United  States began a counter-terrorist drive to track the Iranian  diplomats, known terrorists and their contacts in Europe. The  biggest undercover operation since the Gulf war, it involved  satellite surveillance, intercepting telephone calls and  widespread bugging.    British security services were especially concerned that the  Iranians pledged to supply the IRA with sophisticated weapons as  well as millions of pounds. The republicans had been searching  for a supply of modern detonators and ground-to-air missiles to  complement their stockpile of small arms, ammunition and  explosives.    The IRA presence in Tehran came as no surprise to British  intelligence, which had watched links developing between Tehran  and Irish republicans for more than a decade.    The contacts began in 1981 when an Iranian diplomat went to  Belfast to attend the funeral of Bobby Sands, the first hunger  striker. He was soon followed by Hojatoleslam Hadi Ghaffari, an  Iranian cleric nicknamed the "machine-gun mullah" after killing  up to 60 pro-Shah officials.    Although Ghaffari antagonised Sinn Fein by refusing to pay  for drinks at a lunch he hosted, the republicans found the  cleric sympathetic. In 1980, he told a rally in Tehran that "we  are ready to blow up British factories and ships. Now is the  time for the death of Thatcher."    Over the next six years the two sides developed their  friendship. A Sinn Fein delegation attended the Conference of  World Movements in Tehran in June 1982, while Iran sent a  delegation to Sinn Fein's annual Dublin conference for three  years running. The relationship, however, was largely political  as the IRA was receiving arms and weapons from Libya.    Then in December 1987, Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the  IRA's political wing, flew to Tehran as the guest of the Iranian  government. Exactly what was discussed is not known, but soon  afterwards the first clandestine contacts between the terrorists  and Tehran began.    Over the next six years, both MI6 and MI5 tracked IRA  terrorists to secret meetings in Paris, Bonn and The Hague. Each  took place with accredited Iranian diplomats, most of whom were  attached to the Ministry of Information (MOI) in Tehran, a cover  for Iranian intelligence.    Apart from Ghaffari, three key Iranians have been identified  by British intelligence. They are Ali Reza Hakkikian, chief MOI  representative in Bonn until 1993; Vahid Attarian, his  replacement in Bonn believed to co-ordinate operations of  Iranian spies across Europe; and Amir Eravani, responsible for  liaison between the MOI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    To begin with, British intelligence was content to monitor  the relationship. It wanted to track the IRA officers  responsible for negotiating arms and cash abroad and to unravel  the intelligence network run by the Iranians.    The tone of the operation changed when Jurgen Merx and  Tunza-Anet, his wife, were arrested in Athens last year for  smuggling huge quantities of heroin to Britain. The drugs were  thought to have been supplied by Iranian intelligence, perhaps  to generate funds for the IRA. At the same time, there was  intelligence that cash from Iran might already have reached  Belfast and that a big arms shipment was being planned.    Then came the terrorist summit last November. It was no  longer simply a British effort to control the IRA, but an  international attempt to foil a threat to the security of  several western European countries.    The French government launched raids against Muslim  extremists and members of the Kurdish Workers' party. Germany,  Spain, Sweden and Italy have also moved against groups suspected  of having contacts with the Iranians.    For Britain, the problem was more difficult. Although many  IRA terrorists are well known to the security forces and those  directly involved with the Iranians had been tracked, there was  not enough evidence to bring anyone to trial. Instead, it was  decided to confront the Iranians directly in the hope that  publicity would force the IRA to break off contacts.    So, on Thursday, Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister,  summoned Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, for a  confrontation about his government's contacts with the IRA. The  Iranian denied the links, claiming there was "no shred of  evidence to support these astonishing claims."    Security sources said this weekend it was too early to  determine if the move has worked. The Iranian government has a  long history of defiance and few doubt that the IRA will try to  continue to tap the deep pockets and well-stocked armouries of  Tehran.</p>

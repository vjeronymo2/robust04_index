			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / An intricate web of influence: Robert Peston explores the links between Italy's Mediobanca and the interests of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi As Silvio Berlusconi, the new prime minister of Italy, devises the policies of his administration, a secretive and powerful banker, Enrico Cuccia, is right behind him, watching every move. The answer to the question of whether the premier or the 86-year-old Sicilian-born banker has the most power is finely balanced. Is it Berlusconi, head of the government and owner of three television networks, which together attract half of Italy's viewers? Or is it Cuccia, the founder of Mediobanca, Italy's only big merchant bank, and spider at the centre of a web of powerful, interlinked companies? Possibly tipping the balance in his favour, Cuccia has, in the past six months, acquired considerable sway over Berlusconi's vast and overborrowed business empire and thus over the prime minister's personal wealth. This influence could be useful in preserving Mediobanca's near monopoly of advising and financing Italy's biggest companies. Members of the government, particularly representatives of the Northern League, are determined to weaken Mediobanca. They want to undermine the 'Salotto Buono' - the 'good salon', or network of powerful business dynasties, including the Agnellis of car group Fiat, De Benedetti of computer company Olivetti, the Pirellis of the eponymous tyre group - which, though frequently competitors against each other, are supported by Cuccia and which support him. They believe Mediobanca's power is holding back the development of Italy's economy. By contrast, Cuccia is extending the reach of the Salotto Buono by persuading his corporate allies to take stakes in the succession of Italian companies being privatised. He is seeking involvement in new businesses because the recession has eroded the financial strength of some of his most long-standing allies, such as the Agnellis and De Benedetti. With this end in view, Mediobanca is raising at least L1,500bn (Pounds 626.56m) from a share issue. So Italy's privatisation programme - including sales of state banks, telecommunication and electricity companies - has become the battleground between Cuccia and many government members. Ber-lusconi has yet to show his col-ours. Never part of the Salotto Buono himself, Berlusconi has indicated he wants to impose a 5 per cent share ownership ceiling for groups of related investors in future privatisations. But there has been no test case yet. Berlusconi may be waiting to see the outcome of Cuccia's other big struggle  -against the judiciary. Magistrates are investigating whether Mediobanca has committed a criminal offence by allegedly failing in its duty to ensure that accurate accounts were filed last year by Ferruzzi, a long-standing client, just prior to the refinancing of the huge industrial conglomerate which had been crippled by debt. Magistrates have already shaken public confidence in many of Mediobanca's clients - from Fiat to de Benedetti to the king of Milan concrete, Salvatore Ligresti, until last year a member of Mediobanca's board - by alleging their involvement in assorted financial scandals. Until now, Mediobanca itself has always been above the fray, remaining aloof from the corruption charges that have touched almost all other corners of Italian business and political life. 'In Italy it is a crime against God even to think bad things about Mediobanca,' said Francesco Micheli, an independent financier who in the early 1990s failed in his attempt to create a rival to Mediobanca. With a horror of publicity, Cuccia has made Mediobanca the paramount financier of Italy's commercial and industrial aristocracy. Its financial muscle is enhanced by its 12.5 per cent controlling stake in the giant insurance company, Generali. 'Mediobanca is always at the crossroads of all business,' said Mario Sarcinelli, the chairman of the state-controlled bank, BNL. Cuccia has held the reins for the 48 years of Mediobanca's existence. The 'honorary' tag in his title of 'honorary chairman' is deceptive. He is still to be found every day at the bank's headquarters in a converted 16th century convent, beside Milan's La Scala opera house. Its inconspicuous exterior hides airy, white-washed salons, dotted with Renaissance artefacts. In other respects too, appearances mislead. It has just 87 executives and a total staff of 307. However, its net assets are worth L10,301bn (Pounds 4.2bn), at market value, making it a substantial financial institution. The UK's biggest investment bank, SG Warburg, by comparison has net assets of Pounds 1.1bn. The relationship of Mediobanca with the Salotto Buono is one of mutual advantage. In return for supplying equity and long-term loans to anyone in the group, it expects members to return the favour when either Mediobanca or another group member needs capital. This system is beneficial for a handful of big companies - of which Fiat and the other interests of the Agnelli family are the prime example - because it provides them with a stable, long-term source of capital. However, Mediobanca has virtually ignored medium-sized companies, which have had to rely on short-term funding from the commercial banks. 'How can you have democracy if not all companies have equal access to capital?' asked another banker who has tried for years to create an investment bank to compete with Mediobanca. The power of the Salotto Buono has also acted as a deterrent to the creation of independent sources of equity capital. When Mediobanca and its allies act in concert in a company's affairs, other shareholders have no voice. There is, therefore, little incentive for those outside the Mediobanca circle to invest alongside the bank and its friends. 'Mediobanca ignores minority shareholders,' said Romano Prodi, the economist and departing chairman of Iri, the state holding company, For Prodi and Mediobanca's critics in government and banking, Cuccia is standing in the way of the development of the Italian stock market. Even the Bank of Italy, long regarded as a supporter of Cuccia, accepts the case for greater competition. 'What we need is several Mediobancas,' said a senior Bank official. The first big test of whether the government will confront Mediobanca will come this autumn with the privatisation of Stet, the telecommunications monopoly. Mediobanca, in partnership with Pirelli, wants to take control of Stet, according to a banker close to Cuccia. However, Berlusconi is under pressure from other members of the government to prevent this. For the current privatisation of Ina, the state insurance company, the government has put in place rules preventing groups of connected investors - or individual investors - from acquiring more than 5 per cent of the shares. Mediobanca had little interest in taking control of Ina because of its Generali interests. It is unclear how vigorously these restrictions will be applied in forthcoming privatisations, especially that of Stet. Clearly, much will depend on Berlusconi's stance. He has never been close to Cuccia. 'Cuccia and Berlusconi are so different,' commented a banker who knows them both. 'Berlusconi is like a pop star, a showman. Cuccia is more like a priest, not interested in the trappings of power but in power itself.' Cuccia decided five years ago that Mediobanca would not have any direct financial involvement with Berlusconi's operations, because 'he did not like the risks', in the words of a banker who knows Cuccia well. Cuccia was particularly concerned about the trillions of lire which Berlusconi was investing in film and TV rights. 'Cuccia said the rights were just hot air (or valueless)', said a businessman close to both Berlusconi and Mediobanca. So Berlusconi turned to Italy's commercial banks. By borrowing from them he was able to expand Fininvest, his holding company of media and financial services interests, into one of Italy's three biggest private sector groups. In the end, however, he took on too much debt, about L4,500bn at the end of last year, as the recession of the past two years put a brake on revenue growth. At the same time as Berlusconi started his campaign to become prime minister at the end of last year, he was forced to initiate a complicated restructuring of Fininvest, designed both to reduce indebtedness and also to move borrowings from the top holding company into the operating companies, which generate cash. Without the co-operation of Berlusconi's bankers, the reorganisation will not succeed: and Cuccia has, over the past six months, manoeuvred himself behind the bankers. He has acquired indirect control of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, known as Comit and Credit, two of Fininvest's five biggest bank creditors. Cuccia has already exploited his relationship with these two banks to acquire direct influence over Berlusconi's business. In the spring, Comit and Fininvest asked Mediobanca if it would organise the flotation of a 53 per cent stake in Mondadori, which owns Berlusconi's magazine, book publishing and newspaper interests. This is the first important asset disposal in the Finvinvest restructuring. Ironically, it was the previous Italian government's failure to prevent Mediobanca acquiring indirect stakes in Credit and Comit, when they were privatised, that now gives it a role in the new prime minister's financial affairs. Cuccia took control of Credit and Comit at the turn of the year and in spring respectively. He had been so confident that the government would be unable to block his raids that he disclosed his intentions at a meeting last summer with Prodi, who was in charge of the bank sales as head of Iri. Prodi urged the government to restrict the size of shareholdings in the privatised banks, to block Mediobanca. Single investors were banned from owning more than 3 per cent in either. However, the curbs proved futile because Mediobanca rarely takes direct shareholdings in companies bigger than 2 or 3 per cent. Cuccia's technique is to persuade each of his corporate friends to buy 1 or 2 per cent of a target company and then vote in concert. The graphic shows the complicated relationship of mutual dependency between Mediobanca and the two 'syndicates', or groups of companies, which bought shares in Credit and Comit. Mediobanca owns shares in these companies and many of them also own shares in Mediobanca. The syndicates determined the composition of Comit's and Credit's boards through their voting at the annual meeting. Shareholders must appear in person to vote, as there is no proxy system, so Mediobanca's syndicates, whose members always attend, can call the shots. There are few other sizeable holdings in the banks to counter their influence. There is a commercial imperative for Cuccia's interest in Comit and Credit. Mediobanca has traditionally raised much of its finance by selling certificates of deposit through its branch networks. It needed an assurance that this funding would be secure for the long term. Cuccia got his way. Both have extended the contract to sell Mediobanca's certificates of deposit until the end of 2001 and at a reduced cost. However, control of Comit and Credit also allowed Cuccia to envelop Fininvest, at a time when Berlusconi's political star was waxing but his business was under increasingly heavy financial pressure. It was a no-lose bet. Even if Berlusconi was not elected Cuccia could nonetheless exploit Fininvest's financial predicament to bring his TV and publishing interests firmly into the Mediobanca sphere of influence. Comit and Credit have loans to Fininvest of L500bn and L300bn respectively. Cuccia also has substantial influence over a third creditor, Banco di Roma, which is owned by a charitable trust but which is also a substantial shareholder in Mediobanca (as are Comit and Credit). Banco di Roma lent L500bn to Fininvest. Berlusconi's businesses therefore rely more on Cuccia's goodwill than on any other single financier. 'Cuccia can turn on the tap to give Fininvest access to credit,' said a senior Italian banker. 'Or he can turn it off.' Berlusconi thus faces a possibly insoluble dilemma. If Mediobanca's syndicates continue to acquire strategic holdings in privatised companies, especially Stet, he could be accused of acting leniently towards Mediobanca to protect his private interests. If, on the other hand, he is aggressive in implementing the new rules to block the Mediobanca syndicates, he could equally be vulnerable to the charge of using government office to pressure Mediobanca into supporting Fininvest's restructuring. His advisers say he is working assiduously on the problem of how to erect an effective wall around his business interests. The future of Mediobanca may depend on whether he succeeds.</p>

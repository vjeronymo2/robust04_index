			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Rebound in exports cuts US trade gap sharply THE US trade deficit fell sharply between September and October but the longer-term trend remained adverse, figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday. A rebound in exports accounted for most of the decline in the deficit, which fell to Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) against a revised shortfall of Dollars 8.6bn in September. Wall Street analysts were taken by surprise, having forecast a deficit of about Dollars 8bn in October. Exports rose Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 39.2bn, a new record in cash terms. Imports fell Dollars 0.2bn to Dollars 46.2bn. However, the US's bilateral deficit with Japan rose sharply to Dollars 5bn, the highest monthly figure for four years, raising fears of increased trade tension in coming months. Much of the overall rise in exports, moreover, reflected higher sales of civilian aircraft, which are notoriously volatile on a monthly basis. Sales of telecommunications equipment also rose strongly. In spite of the stronger-than-expected figures for exports, the longer-term trend appears to remain adverse, reflecting faster growth of consumer demand in the US than in most overseas markets. The trade deficit averaged Dollars 8.2bn in the three months to October, compared with only Dollars 4.9bn in the first three months of this year. The trade deficit for the first 10 months of this year was Dollars 67.8bn, compared with Dollars 55.1bn in the same period last year. In a separate report the Labour Department said claims for state unemployment insurance rose 22,000 to 347,000 in the week ending December 5, the first rise in four weeks. The level of claims, however, remains consistent with steady improvement in labour market conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 Apr--Two economic agreements, on  protecting and supporting investments and on avoiding double  taxation, and a consular convention were signed today in Warsaw  by Polish and Bulgarian Ministers of Foreign Affairs Andrzej  Olechowski and Stanislav Daskalov.    According to Minister Olechowski, a delay in signing the  agreements had been caused by weak economic contacts, with which  neither side is satisfied. According to Minister Daskalov, the  creation of a legal base will give businessmen of both countries  a feeling of security and will increase the scope of mutual  investments. He said that, next year, Polish-Bulgarian talks  might begin on setting up a free trade zone, when negotiations  on Bulgaria's membership in GATT will be completed and the issue  of Bulgaria's debts to Poland will be resolved (Bulgaria owes  Poland 207 million transfer rubles).    The Bulgarian minister announced that it was decided during  the talks how to resolve a dispute between both states  concerning the localization of the Polish culture and  information center in Sofia.    International issues were also discussed, including the  aspirations of both states to the European Union and the  situation in former Yugoslavia. The war there not only poses  threats to Bulgaria's security but is also causing great  economic losses.    Daskalow announced that he invited Andrzej Olechowski to pay  a visit to Bulgaria.</p>

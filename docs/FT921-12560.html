			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Jazz nut to the rescue THE SIGHT of Sol-swigging hipsters three deep at the bar and waitresses busily weaving across a packed dancefloor is not one you would naturally associate with a business in receivership. But this is the Jazz Cafe on a Monday night and the receivers have been a supporting act since November. Proprietor and founder Jon Dabner owes his creditors, of which the brewer Whitbread is the largest, Pounds 1.3m. The receivers, at Messrs Cape &amp; Dalgleish, say the company is insolvent and will sell the business as a going concern for upwards of Pounds 300,000. Dabner, who says the place has no future without him, has brought in a company doctor to negotiate on his behalf and appointed a new manager to help in the crisis management. The deadline for tenders is March 31. Roger Gewolb, lawyer, former merchant banker and public company finance director and now head of London turnaround specialists Roger Gewolb Corporate Renewal, is a jazz nut and thinks the Jazz Cafe is a 'very special place'. This is a special job for him and his team since the club is a business without any tangible assets but is not in hock to a bank. Unusually, the receivers' client, Whitbread, could have a vested interest in the club's resuscitation, Gewolb says. His job is to convince the brewer, and the receivers, that with a solid management team he can help it move into profit. 'Jon has built a fine business in a very short time and were it not for the recession and thin management he might well be prospering today,' Gewolb says . Teresa Cesario, whose appointment as manager has been approved by the receivers, is in her final year of an MBA at London Business School. A native of Naples, she expresses surprise that British creditors are so quick to pull the plug on a business with such evident potential. The club has been open for a little over a year. 'If this club were in Japan lenders would be looking at a five year probationary period before seeing a return on their investment.' Her remit, to provide the Jazz Cafe with a marketable direction, will doubtless inspire her for her examination in strategic management next week. All concede that Dabner made some basic mistakes. The conversion of the building itself, from a Barclays bank branch, was overspecified and Dabner has been burdened by builders' bills ever since. But if his planning was awry, the ex-school teacher's programming has been a success. Fusion merchants have mixed with elderly beboppers and while attendance has been patchy, it has been generally healthy. 'But we still have to break the myth that jazz is only for the middle-aged beer monster,' says Cesario. 'Live music is exciting and we have to promote that idea to Londoners and the tourists that flock to Camden. Young people pay Pounds 15 to go to a rave, why shouldn't they pay for live music.' Fair enough, famous American saxophonist Archie Shepp, with his repertoire of blues singing to straightahead bop filled the tables the night I saw him. The young but relatively unknown James Taylor Quartet filled floor and tables the following week. Even as Cesario speaks, JT's enthusiastic young band, which incorporates a peroxide topped dancer in long leather coat and velvet hotpants, slides into the 1970s strains of 2001 Space Odyssey, to squeals of delight from the thronging Monday night ravers. This stuff is not to Dabner's personal taste but he has initiated changes to accommodate, and make the most out of, this kind of jazz fan. The menu now includes meat dishes, once anathema to the brown rice style of the club's forerunner in East London. The staff that serves up this 'supper club' style food are now given incentive bonuses to sell more of it. With the March 31 deadline looming over the Dabner, Cesario and Gewolb trio, Delroy Chambers at Cape &amp; Dalgleish reckons several offers are already on the table, and he hopes to have a buyer in February. But Gewolb, who believes that the club's hi-tech style is unsuitable for much other than live music, has another card to play. 'We have targetted three potential investors,' Gewolb explains, 'who have the funds and a love of jazz in common. Thus we hope that Whitbread will see that they can have it two ways. Either they are paid something and Dabner goes his own way. Or he, as the only guy who can make this place work, can cut them a piece of the deal and they can make money.'</p>

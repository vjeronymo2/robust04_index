Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN and MINJU CHOSON today say  this is a scheme to bring the situation to a hopeless phase.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    Their call for a comprehensive inspection can never be  justified both in view of the special position of the DPRK,  which has temporarily suspended the effectuation of the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the  agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States.  Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline conservatives are urging the  DPRK to accept a comprehensive inspection and openly scheming to  take "sanctions" against the DPRK unless their demand was met.  This cannot be construed otherwise than an act to obstruct a  peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and intentionally bring  the situation to a hopeless phase.    France, which possesses nuclear weapons and has been  bitterly  denounced by the world peaceloving people for its many nuclear  tests, has the hardihood to join the United States in its  nuclear clamor. This invites hatred from the people.    We have already declared in an explicit term that we would  consider any kind of "sanctions" to be something like a  declaration of war against us. It is well known a fact that we  never utter empty words.    The U.S. hardline conservatives and their lackeys must  ponder over what dangerous consequences their moves may entail.    The United States must know well whom it is dealing with and  act with discretion.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that if the United States try to  overpower the DPRK with "strength," it would be a big mistake  and it would meet defeat more serious than that it suffered in  the Korean war in the '50s.</p>

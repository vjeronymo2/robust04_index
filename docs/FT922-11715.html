			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Management: Post Office gives uniforms the stamp of approval Customers queueing for stamps in the post office can now play a new game to while away the time: spot the grey and gardenia refurbishments, and toning, smartly-uniformed staff. More than 800 main post offices have so far been revamped in an effort to lift them out of their former utilitarian gloom. Overall, Pounds 40m is being spent on bringing premises up to date and - with the introduction of automation - service into the modern age. As part of the process, the appearance of employees is also being overhauled with the issue of grey and yellow clothing that would not look out of place in more up-market establishments such as banks or airlines. Uniforms, workwear or, as Post Office Counters likes to call it, 'careerwear', is increasingly being used by service organisations to strengthen identity and alter public perceptions. The aim is to reinforce images of professionalism, build pride in the team and thereby improve customer service. In the Post Office's case, the hope is that the introduction of new clothing for staff will lead to some tangible improvements in customers' perceptions of the service they receive. Indeed, perception, rather than the objective measure of performance itself, appears to be the key issue. For, according to Post Office Counters' own research, customers have very little idea of, for example, how long they have actually queued. On average, they think they have waited twice as long as has actually been the case. Frustratingly for the Post Office, taking action to cut down on queueing time seems to have little impact on these perceptions. In refurbished offices, however, customers feel they have not had to queue for so long, regardless of actual waiting times. The hope is that the new staff clothing will add to the 'feel good' factor and further close the perceptions gap. The 10,000 staff themselves should also feel better in the new clothes as the existing cheap and nasty blue outfits, the subject of a steady stream of staff complaints, are replaced by softer, more generously-cut, modern styles. Designs were drawn up by Anne Tyrrell Designs, the same consultancy that recently reformed British Rail's look, in consultation with a Post Office staff-management steering group. The mix and match outfits - which will have been fully introduced by the end of June - include grey jackets for both sexes, a choice of suit skirt styles and lengths plus a crepe de chine blouse, scarf and skirt for women. Other interesting additions are a sari and maternity wear - the latter requested, says Crozier, by some of the 'larger ladies who find it more comfortable'.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Simplicity with a low risk level - Unit Trusts / A new cash fund offers a chequebook and high interest THE NEW cheque account, launched by Fidelity, represents a significant step in the drive to widen the appeal of unit trusts in Britain. The idea itself was simple. Fidelity has given a chequebook to those who invest more than Pounds 5,000 in its existing cash unit trust. But in the long run, the account could herald a challenge to the hold of building societies on the private savings market. For a start, Fidelity's account offers taxpayers a significantly higher rate than is available on most building society instant-access accounts. At launch, in November, the account was paying about 10.7 per cent gross, 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher than was available from most building societies. Fidelity can pay such a rate, because the fund is invested in money-market instruments - short-term deposits of large banks - and because it has lower costs than the building societies with their substantial branch networks. Second, the account was designed to be very simple, with investors given both a chequebook and a paying-in book. There is no bid-offer spread - just one price for the units. The annual management charge of 0.5 per cent is deducted before the gross yield is paid out. In short, the account is designed to be as little like a conventional unit trust as possible. This also applies to risk. What prevents most people from investing in unit trusts is the fear of losing their capital. There is very little chance of this happening with this particular Fidelity unit trust. The worst that could happen is that the trust might buy securities in a bank that fails, such as BCCI (although obviously it spreads its investments over a significant number of banks). But Fidelity chooses only those banks that have high credit ratings, so the risk is very small. Indeed, in one respect the risk is lower than that for building societies. The trust is covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, under which the first Pounds 30,000 of an investment can be refunded, followed by 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. Building society compensation is limited to 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. So are there any drawbacks? The first is that the trust cannot accumulate money gross - basic-rate tax is deducted at source and cannot be reclaimed. This means that building societies will still be more attractive to non-taxpayers. The second is that the minimum withdrawal is Pounds 250, and investors will not be able to use their chequebooks if the account falls below Pounds 5,000. If the latter occurs, and they want to realise part of their holdings, the process may take a week or two. The third drawback is that the trust does not offer standing orders or direct debits - it is definitely a savings, not a current, account. This may limit its appeal - but there are plenty of people with savings of over Pounds 5,000 who might find it a good deal. And Fidelity hopes that, once drawn into the world of unit trusts, they might eventually be tempted into the equity-based funds.</p>

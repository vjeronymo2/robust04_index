			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU  coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after  each item.  <H5>  Benin </H5>   Our country joined the international community on 1 December  to observe World AIDS Day. According to the National AIDS  Control Program coordinator, from 1985, when the first cases  were diagnosed, to date, there have been 566 AIDS cases. In  1992, there were 218 cases; and for the first six months of this  year, 101 new AIDS cases have been registered. Following a  survey, the number of seropositives is estimated at 400,000.  (Cotonou Office de Radiodiffusion-Television du Benin Radio in  French 1930 GMT 1 December 93)  <H5>  Congo </H5>   Health Minster Jean Ekoundzola issued a message in  Brazzaville to mark World AIDS Day. The minister stated that an  estimated 19,000 AIDS cases and 100,000 cases of HIV-infected  persons have been reported in the Congo. The minister said that  in Brazzaville, one out of three adult deaths was due to AIDS.  He also stated that 7 percent of pregnant women have Human  Immuno Deficiency Virus, which causes the disease. The minister  stated that one out of three of these women would transmit the  disease to their babies. (Dakar PANA in English 1143 GMT 1 Dec  93)    Schistosomiasis, a disease characterized by itching and  blood  in the urine, is reappearing in the Niari area. According to  the head of the schistosomiasis unit, although the disease is on  the decline, some cases can still be found mainly in three  primary schools of the area where the incidence varies between 6  and 7 percent -- based on a survey conducted in 1991. Due to  disturbances in the country, figures for the 1992-1993 period  are not yet available. In Kiniati, out of a population of 365  inhabitants, the incidence was about 65 percent in 1991. In  1992, this figure had decreased: Out of 225 people examined, 52  cases were diagnosed. (Brazzaville Radio Nationale Congolaise  Network in French 1830 GMT 4 December 93)  <H5>  Cote D'Ivoire </H5>   The coordinator of the National AIDS Control Program, who  was  invited to the studio on 1 December on the occasion of the World  AIDS Day, revealed that the incidence of AIDS in the country  today is estimated at 10 percent of the population. This does  not, however, mean that one Ivorian out of 10 is seropositive.  For the sexually active adult population aged between 15 to 49  years old, the incidence is around 9.8 percent. The coordinator  also said that the AIDS education campaign in the country is  making some progress because now 10 percent of the population  aged between 15 to 49 years old say that they regularly use  condoms during casual sexual encounters. In 1988 this figure  was around 2 percent. In addition, more than 80 to 90 percent  of ceremonies involving or held by the youth carry messages on  AIDS. Local, departmental, and regional committees on AIDS and  other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as national  nongovernmental organizations, have been established throughout  the country. (Abidjan La Chaine Une Television Network in  French 2000 GMT 1 December 93)  <H5>  Ghana </H5>   The Ashanti Region now tops the list of AIDS cases in the  country. A total of 3,515 cases of the disease were recorded  between 1989 and 1993. This figure represents 31.8 percent of  the total of 11,044 cases recorded throughout the country. The  district pharmacist in charge of Kwabre, Mr. Kofi Baye,  announced this when he launched the district AIDS Awareness Day  at Nkosu. Mr. Baye said that as part of measures to check the  menace, health authorities in the district have trained 30  people to mount educational programs to complement efforts of  health personnel. The Kwabre district secretary called on  churches, youth associations, and unit committees to help fight  the AIDS menace in the district, which now has a record 27  cases. (Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in  English 2000 GMT 30 November 93)  <H5>  Niger </H5>   Niger joined the rest of the international community to  observe the Sixth World AIDS Day on 1 December. As of 30  November, there were 992 declared AIDS cases in the country.  According to the national director of the Niger AIDS Control  Program, for the first six months of this year, 183 cases were  recorded. A look at figures for previous years shows that  full-blown AIDS cases have increased, which also implies an  increase in the number of seropositives. The most affected  target-population is prostitutes and truck drivers. Among  prostitutes in Niamey, the infection rate rose from less than 9  percent last year to 15.30 percent this year. For truck  drivers, the rate is 3 percent. (Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in  French 1200 GMT 1 December 93)  <H5>  Nigeria </H5>   Nigeria joined the world community on 1 December to  celebrate  World AIDS Day. The director general of the Ministry of Health  and Human Services, addressing newsmen in Lagos, disclosed that  the number of people who have tested HIV-positive in the country  stands at about 50,000 to 100,000. As of November this year,  there were 952 AIDS cases out of which 100 patients have died.  (Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English 1030 GMT 2 December 93)    It was reported in Makurdi by the Benue director general in  charge of health and human services, Moses Ugye, that a total of  644 of about 6,600 blood samples from donors screened at the  general hospital in Makurdi between August 1989 and October of  1993 were found to test positive for Human Immuno Deficiency  Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. The director general stated  that 44 of these samples were confirmed to be full-blown cases  of AIDS.    The medical superintendent at Makurdi General Hospital, Dr.  Sylvester Ogiri, disclosed that 15 AIDS patients were admitted  and later discharged at the hospital this year at their own  request. Dr. Ogiri said that before their voluntary departure,  the AIDS victims were given proper counselling in a bid to  discourage them from spreading the disease. (Dakar PANA in  English 1651 GMT 3 Dec 93)    In Benue State, out of the 6,550 blood samples screened for  the AIDS virus, 644 tested positive. The director general in  charge of the Ministry of Health, who disclosed this, also  confirmed that 44 of the blood samples carried the AIDS virus.

(Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 3  December 93)  <H5>  Zaire </H5>   Zaire joined the international community on 1 December to  observe World AIDS Day. With a little more than 21,000 AIDS  cases recorded to date and close to 2 million seropositives,  Zaire is one of the worst hit countries in the world --  accounting for 3 percent of total world AIDS cases. The  suspension of cooperation between Zaire and its leading foreign  partners has had serious effects on the spread of the disease in  the country. In order to prevent the disaster that could result  from the blocking of external resources, the National AIDS  Control Program has decided to set up a special AIDS fund.

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: European sectors rally sharply on rate cut hopes GROWING expectations that Germany will cut its key interest rate today helped all the main European government bond markets to rally sharply. Confidence in a move by the Bundesbank grew as a survey of 12 German economists showed that the majority expect the discount rate, which sets the floor for German interest rates, to fall by half a point to 6 1/4 per cent. This compares with a consensus in the UK of a quarter point cut, dealers said. Also, the latest German regional inflation data showed that price rises in western Germany were slowing down. However, yesterday's Bundesbank repo was carried out at an unchanged 6.80 per cent rate and one economist said: 'All things being equal, the Bundesbank has no more reason to cut this time than last time.' At the last council meeting before the summer recess a discount rate reduction had been widely flagged, but only the Lombard rate, which sets the ceiling for lending, was altered. Another economist argued that the traditional refusal of the Bundesbank to bow to market pressures made it even less likely to ease by a half point following the economists' forecast. On balance, the rate-cut logic would not go away and bund futures on Liffe gained 36 basis points to end at 97.52. FRENCH government bonds surged ahead yesterday with the futures contract breaking through several support levels to record a gain of 66 basis points at 122.94. The rally was led by the futures with heavy turnover of 140,000 contracts. The bullish tone was reinforced by a purchase of 10,000 call options, a bullish trade which gives the investor the right but not the obligation to buy at a fixed price and time. Dealers said much of the rise was technical with stop-loss buying triggered at certain points and the 'feel-good' effect of the market deterring any sellers. IN THE UK, concerns of a significant shift of assets away from the gilts market faded as long-dated paper responded to the rate cut euphoria. Most dealers had heard strong rumours that Middle Eastern investors were taking profits on Tuesday. The rumours prompted a number of traders to take short positions, but as the speculation lost ground, books were squared and prices squeezed higher in a thin market. Long gilt futures for September recovered nearly half a point to close at 112 7/8 . HIGH-yielding markets, which have greater room for interest rate manoeuvre in the event of a German cut, were particularly strong yesterday. Spanish debt prices received additional impetus from the encouraging wage negotiation talks between the government and unions. Also the Spanish peseta broke through Pta80 against the D-Mark. Italian government bonds also rose sharply with the futures contract lifting more than a point to 113.44. AFTER a mixed morning, US Treasury prices posted solid gains across the board yesterday afternoon following a successful five-year auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 101, yielding 6.169 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent. Prices rose in early trading on the news that durable goods orders fell 3.8 per cent in July. The gains, however, were short-lived when traders realised that the decline in orders was entirely due to a fall in the always volatile aircraft sales component. Excluding transportation orders, durable goods orders actually rose 1.3 per cent in July. While the long end languished, the short end picked up ground on speculation that the Federal Reserve was buying two-year, three-year and five-year notes for the Bank of Japan. Later in the day, after a brief dip on comments from a senior Fed official that was interpreted as a sign that monetary policy would not be eased any time soon, intermediate and long end bonds rallied.</p>

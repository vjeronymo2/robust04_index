The aid will be  handled through the Foreign Ministry's Development Aid Section.    "Planning for distribution of the aid will start in January.  The aid will partly consist of goods, partly personnel, and  partly as direct support," said Humanitarian Aid Section Chief  Ritva Jolkkonen.    Needs for the aid will be discussed with international  relief  agencies. This year aid has gone through the UNHCR (United  Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees), the  International Red Cross, and the World Health Organization (WHO).  <H5>  Partly Goods, Partly Money </H5>   Part of the aid will go as goods, part as money, since at  its  destination money is needed for purchasing fuel, etc. The aid  sent through WHO will be in the form of medical equipment and  such items as artificial limbs. Finnish experts can also be sent  to Bosnia-Herzegovina with the aid money. "The intention is to  act now in anticipation of winter needs," Jolkkonen stated.</p>

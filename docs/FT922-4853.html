			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Ex-Soviet states invited to join new Cocom body COCOM, the multilateral organisation which for years controlled the sale of western high technology to communist countries, has invited the former Soviet republics to join a new export control body. The group will not replace Cocom, which will continue to control some exports because of fears they could be re-exported to regimes Cocom perceives as dangerous or unstable. On Monday, Cocom, the 17-member Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, agreed to a proposal by Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, that the republics be asked to join a new entity, the Cocom Co-operation Forum on Export Controls. The US agreed to a German demand to ease export curbs on telecommunications. Reportedly, this concession includes easing of controls on fibre optics, which the Bush administration has been resisting. Announcing the agreement yesterday, the State Department embraced the German proposal as its own. A State Department spokesman said President Bush had been urging Cocom to become 'reflective of today's environment. As the emerging democracies seek to reform and establish closer ties to the west, better telephone, fax and other data networks are clearly needed'. The new forum would provide significantly wider access to advanced western goods and technology to the former Soviet Union; set out procedures to ensure against diversion to unauthorised users, and help the new states develop their own systems of export controls. Curbs will remain on some republics for munitions, high-speed computers and advanced machine tools. The forum will meet soon to further define its agenda. With concern in the US shifting to curbing weapons and high technology for what it sees as unstable or 'outlaw' states, the setting-up of export control systems in the republics assumes new urgency. Export control experts say the corruption sweeping the former Soviet Union as its economic system collapses could mean leakages of weapons and technology to dangerous users.</p>

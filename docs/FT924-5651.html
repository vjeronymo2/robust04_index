			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Maltese currency devalued MALTA last night devalued the Maltese lira by 10 per cent in a move apparently hastened by this week's devaluation of the Spanish and Portuguese currencies. The lira, which was yesterday quoted at 1.89 to the pound sterling, had been widely regarded as pegged at an unrealistically high rate by successive governments. The decision was announced by Finance Minister John Dalli while presenting a LM400m budget in parliament for the coming year. He said devaluation would lessen the impact of worldwide economic slowdown on the island's developing economy. It would also help meet the challenge of more competitive Mediterranean holidays and preserve the island's attractions as an investment base, Mr Dalli added. Previously Malta has steered clear of devaluation for fear of the spiralling cost of imports, on which Malta is heavily dependent.</p>

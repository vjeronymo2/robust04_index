			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Funny accounting Why are accountants Price Waterhouse increasing the starting salaries of their graduate in-take by 20 per cent, to Pounds 14,000 a year, in the middle of the worst recession since the 1930s? Given that the dole queues are full of eager young graduates who would love to train as PW bean counters, it doesn't make sense for PW to break ranks and start paying above the odds for staff. Surely they are not going to add the extra hundreds of thousands of pounds of this generosity onto clients' bills? If PW were a bank, this sort of behaviour might make some of its depositors nervous.</p>

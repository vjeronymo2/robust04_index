It wants to face the  future with clarity and without fear; society wants job and  income security; security for its savings and investments;  society wants security in its daily life and wants certainty in  the institutional order, in politics, in the exercise of its  rights, and in the work of the authorities.    Society demands recognition of its maturity and capacity to  cooperate and assume public responsibilities. It wants to  actively participate in national progress but also demands  greater responsibility from the parties, from which they expect  democratic consensus, definite commitments, and reasoned  proposals. Society demands from the authorities honesty, social  sensibility, efficiency, and strict observance of the law.    Society is willing to take on the challenges of change. It  knows it must reform to move ahead. It values the efforts made,  but it demands to go further. Society is aware that the bases  have been laid down for a better future, but demands greater  well-being, justice, and increased opportunities.    In the face of these demands for certainty, responsibility,  and change, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] makes  the following commitments;  <H5>  Mexico's Democratic Transformation </H5>   Mexico's democratic transformation is our answer to the  challenge to build an institutional and political order that  gives the nation certainty. It is our answer to the demands for  an open and responsible authority. It is the government's  responsibility to guarantee security, order, and the framework  of stability that democracy requires. It is up to the parties  to work to build a proper and legitimate representation of  social needs. It is up to society to encourage tolerance,  legality, and openness in electoral processes. The effective  exercise of his or her political rights through responsible  participation is up to each citizen.    Democratic transformation is an overall process that extends  to all spheres of social life, and particularly to the electoral  processes.    Our pledge is to specifically encourage open electoral  processes and seek a confident vote through institutional and  civilized competition with other political options.    In order to consolidate democratic transformation the PRI  assumes that it is necessary to:    -- Have full respect for public and private freedom.    -- Favor the free expression of ideas.    -- Encourage social well-being.    -- Establish clear and fair rules for electoral processes.    -- Motivate a culture for legality, dialogue, and the  recognition of plurality.    -- Encourage broad citizen participation.  <H5>  Guarantee Mexico's Sovereignty and Interests in the World </H5>   Mexico is a sovereign State whose independence, unity, and  integrity has been the work of generations. Our commitment is  to strengthen the nation's sovereignty in the changing  conditions of this century's end.    There cannot be, nor should there be a separation between  domestic and foreign policy. In the domestic sphere,  sovereignty is upheld by the full exercise of political  liberties, the keeping of the law, in the democratic exercise,  and in a vigorous economy that should be the source of  well-being and social justice. Internationally, fidelity to our  principle of people's self- determination; no intervention; the  peaceful solution of controversies; the prohibition of the use  of threats or force in international relations; the states'  equality before the law; international cooperation for  development; and the struggle for peace and for international  security have won us the respect and acknowledgement of the  world community.    To strengthen the nation's sovereignty the PRI makes a  commitment to:    -- Recognize that the nation's highest values and its  first responsibility lie in the acknowledgement of sovereignty.    -- Maintain the nation's direct control over the energetic  resources and the state's control over the strategic areas  pointed out in the Constitution.    -- Act in strict compliance with our constitutional  principles on foreign policy.    -- Encourage international cooperation under shared  opportunities and responsibilities.    -- Sponsor our culture to reinforce the nation's identity  and unity.  <H5>  Strengthen a Stable Economy </H5>   In the process of economic change and trade opening, the  state cannot leave aside its responsibilities, the state must  maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and guarantee  opportunities for creativity's free development and social  initiative. The state must also promote savings and investment;  foster productivity; broaden regional infrastructure; support  the modernization of micro, small, and medium businesses;  promote job training; watch over the strict compliance of work  regulations; and generate favorable conditions for salary  betterment.    The challenge in economic and social matters is to increase  well-being, income, and the quality of life for all Mexicans.  It is necessary to generate more and better jobs, increase the  true salaries, and undertake an active social policy oriented  particularly toward the groups that require greater support so  they may be incorporated into the benefits of growth.    We should be responsible with what we have already achieved  in the economy, preserve it, and construct a new horizon of  possibilities, without losing sight of the social objective that  gives significance to all productive activity. Our commitment  is of a responsible economic policy that is at the service of  mankind, particularly to the less favored individuals and groups.    For the development of a strong economy, the PRI promises:    -- To guide the economy with a clear sense of  responsibility to face the needs of the present and future  generations.    -- To promote stable economic growth that can lead to  social welfare.    -- To fight poverty and backwardness.    -- To promote the creation of more and better jobs.    -- To increase productivity and the income level of the  population.    -- To support the efforts of companies and guarantee fair  competition.  <H5>  Balanced Regional Development </H5>   The Mexican nation is made up of multiple regions with their  own productive characteristics and traditions. The strength of  the nation is the strength of its regions. To take full  advantage of the potential of our regions is a fundamental  condition for our economic growth and social welfare. There is  no reason to justify the difference in opportunities between the  rural and urban areas and among the various regions of the  country. Utility services, education, health, and job  opportunities must be distributed throughout the entire national  territory.    True regional development also requires a rational and  careful exploitation of our natural resources. Each region,  each community, each corner of our country is a unique  expression of opportunities, culture, talent, and natural  resources. The wealth of our national development lies in the  natural, cultural, and social heritage of our regions.    We promise to close the gap that separates our rural reality  from urban life, preserving the natural conditions for the  development of future generations.    To promote regional development, the PRI promises:    -- To support a balanced development that can integrate  the various regions of the country with the national and  international markets.    -- To expand the communication and transportation  infrastructure.    -- To carry out actions aimed at improving the quality of  life in urban areas.    -- To expand economic development opportunities and  improve social welfare levels in rural areas.    -- To take advantage of the natural resources of each  region in a rational and well-balanced manner.  <H5>  Social Reform </H5>   Our party's basic aspiration is to improve the quality of  life of those who face the greatest deprivation and limitation.  The economic progress of the last few years places us in a  favorable position to begin an extensive and profound social  reform. Our main investment must be in the people so that each  citizen can fully develop his own abilities.    All Mexicans deserve to live in dignity, to enjoy the hope  of  improvement and the true opportunity to develop as an  individual. Not only does poverty affect those who suffer it,  but it weakens and harms the nation. Our commitment is to  engage in a head-on struggle against poverty, in order to be  able to fill the needs and provide basic services for the  poverty stricken communities, and expand the government's  protection and social development network to the whole  population.    The Indian communities will receive all our support and  respect. Their shortages will receive special attention from our  social reform. We join their struggle to improve their  production opportunities, to increase social well-being, and  ensure respect for their rights. We are also convinced that the  Indians must participate more decisively in the direction of  their communities and in the development of policies for solving  their problems and attaining their goals.    The struggle against poverty is the government's single most  important social responsibility. Furthermore, this task must  bring the people and the volunteer and self-improvement social  organizations together, so they can participate and become a  part of the grand joint alliance in search of unbiased  prosperity.    Our commitment is to a social reform program that can  improve  the quality of life of those who face the greatest deprivation  and limitation, and guarantee opportunities for well-being and  progress for all.    To aid in the development of this social reform plan, the  PRI  hereby makes the following commitments:    -- To fight poverty and promote progress for those who  have less.    -- To actively develop policies that offer support for the  Indian, with direct participation from the Indian communities  themselves.    -- To struggle for equal job, education, housing, and  well-being opportunities for all social groups alike.    -- To expand and improve health, nutrition, housing, and  social security programs.    -- To promote social support programs for groups with  specific needs, according to gender, age, or personal condition.    -- To summon the most wide-spread citizen participation in  social development programs.  <H5>  Education for Development and Competition </H5>   In view of the economic modernization process and growing  international competition, we embrace the obligation to expand  and improve our education system. Qualified education,  available to everyone, is essential in order for changes to be  the foundation of additional economic development and social  well-being.    Education must be the channel leading to full development  and  the creativity of all Mexicans. It must disseminate our values  and assert our history as well as confer a sense of permanence  and national pride. It must also be the point of contact  between our society and humanist tradition, universal culture,  scientific vision of the world, and technological developments.    We are committed to a nationalist and federalized type  education; an education with quality, sufficient resources, a  teaching profession endowed with decent living conditions and  permanent training programs. Our commitment is to  unquestionably promote and encourage scientific and  technological development as well as training programs which  must be linked to the productive sector.    Our commitment is to an education system that will open the  doors to social mobility, justice, economic progress, and  national fortitude.    In order to achieve an education system that will propitiate  development, the PRI is determined to:    -- Support a nationalist and federalized education.    -- Promote quality education that is made available to all  Mexicans.    -- Encourage work related training programs.    -- Link scientific investigation and technological  development to all productive sectors.  <H5>  A New Equilibrium in the Republic's Life </H5>   Mexican society's new economic and political configuration  requires an institutional system capable of proclaiming social  initiatives, individual rights, and public actions. Today, more  than ever, there is need for public institutions that will  acknowledge the average citizen's potential, as well as  society's energy.    The republic's new equilibrium demands government reforms.  We are in need of a government system that is in touch with  civilian society, capable of providing effective answers through  a public administration that is modern, professional, and  respectful of justice.    The Republic's new equilibrium demands self-respect in  political life through the strengthening of a Legislative Branch  that will be effective in truly representing social positions  and contribute to promoting social benefits. It also demands  that the institutions responsible for handing out justice will  be able to consolidate a framework of trust and confidence in  the legal system and the public authorities. We are in need of  a more expeditious justice system, one committed to defending  the individual's rights.    In order to accomplish this new equilibrium in the  Republic's  everyday life, the PRI is committed to:    -- Proposing government reforms that will consolidate a  public administration system that is more modern, expeditious,  professional, and respectful of justice.    -- Acknowledging the political capability of every  institution and every municipality as well as increase their  respective fiscal resources which will lead to modernizing  federalism.    -- Strengthening the Legislative Branch and guaranteeing  an expeditious justice system available to all Mexicans.    -- Improving public safety within a framework of respect  for the individual's rights.    Today, just as during other moments of our history, the PRI  is adopting commitments that society demands by presenting  concrete political proposals. Through Luis Donaldo Colosio, our  candidate for the presidency of the republic, through our  candidates for deputies and senators, we are going to confront  the current challenges with responsibility. Today, the PRI once  again can rely on the people's support in order to continue  building a future of certainty and better opportunities for our  children. We reiterate: Our only commitment is to Mexico.</p>

MBC (Munhwa  Broadcasting Corporation) reported the Defence Ministry  "explained in camera" to the "assemblymen" of the "Defence  Commission of the National Assembly" that the purchase of  Patriot missiles was under way.    Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today views this as another  clear sign that the Kim Yong-sam group has become rabid in war  preparations against the North.    The analyst says:    What our nation wants now is to put an end to confrontation  and division and achieve peace and peaceful reunification at an  early date.    Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam group is dancing to the drum-  beating of the United States which is hastening the deployment  of Patriots in South Korea, while scheming to arm the puppet  army with these missiles. This is aimed at slaying the fellow  countrymen in the North in league with outside forces.    If the puppets' war moves are overlooked, the 70 million  people of Korea would not be spared of a nuclear war disaster.    Their reckless acts to overpower the North will lead them to  destruction. We are keeping close scrutiny over the Kim  Yong-sam group's war provocation moves and will never tolerate  any provocation.</p>

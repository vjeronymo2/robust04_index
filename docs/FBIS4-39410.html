			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report in the "Insolvency" column: </F> "Russian Bankrupts Will Pass Under State Trusteeship. Their  Property Will Be Available for Purchase for One Ruble"]    [Text] By the end of this month the first decisions will  be made on competitive sell-offs of state enterprises considered  insolvent. This was announced by Sergey Belyayev, chief of the  Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) under the  Russian Federation State Property Management Committee  [Goskomimushchestvo], at a press conference yesterday devoted to  the presidential edict "On Selling State Debtor Enterprises."  All decisions will made by a special commission created by the  Administration, taking into account the opinion of sectoral  ministries and regional authorities.    According to Goskomimushchestvo, approximately 100,000  Russian enterprises can today be classed as state controlled.  Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) experts made  a preliminary analysis of the payment balances of medium-size  and large enterprises with a staff of over 1,000. The results  of the examination have shown that approximately 1,500  enterprises with a state share in their incorporation capital of  over 25 percent fall under the criteria of insolvency. The most  difficult situation has developed in the textile industry,  machine building, and the transport sector.    By 1 July, according to Belyayev, his department will  prepare  a list of potential bankrupts. As of now 30 enterprises have  been officially ruled insolvent, 20 of which are in Moscow.  Moscow's predominance, however, administration officials  explained, is in no way related to the confrontation between  Goskomimushchestvo Chairman Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov. It is simply that the proximity of the Moscow  industrial region to federal power bodies makes Moscow a  convenient ground for testing bankruptcy procedures.    In spite of a large number of organizations that meet  insolvency criteria under the presidential edict, Mr. Belyayev  noted that the document's thrust is to prevent the real  bankruptcy of state enterprises. The state legalizes its  ownership rights in order to stop the spontaneous  self-dissolution of enterprises, prevent latent unemployment,  and in a civilized manner resolve the payments crisis, he said.    The entire process -- from deeming an enterprise insolvent  to  making a decision to sell it -- envisions a whole number of  procedures. Experience -- limited so far -- has shown that the  stigma of insolvency serves as a good incentive for enterprise  directors to repay their debts as soon as possible. If the old  management fails to cope, the enterprise will pass under the  trusteeship of the Federal Administration on Bankruptcy which  will decide which is economically more effective: to restore  its balance of payment or take it out of the production sphere.  The criterion of "economic effectiveness" in decisionmaking  will, however, be substantially influenced by existing social  realities. First of all this will bear on so-called  town/enterprises that contain more than 50 percent of the town  infrastructure. In any event, administration officials believe,  the extra-juridical bankruptcy procedure stipulated in the edict  is more advantageous to enterprises than dealing with creditors  in arbitration courts would be.    The basic criterion in determining the bankrupts' selling  price will be the sum of their unpaid debts. In this connection  Belyayev did not rule out a hypothetical option whereby property  can be acquired for a symbolic price of one ruble. Competition  for bankrupt enterprises, Belyayev noted with optimism, will  attract domestic and foreign investors because the edict allows  them, in addition to debt obligations, to take control of the  entire property at once.    An objective analysis of the reasons for insolvency, it was  noted at the press conference, will identify the range of  enterprises really needing state support. Nonetheless, the  state 1994 budget envisions subsidies only to coal mines. Until  next year Goskomimushchestvo hopes for wide solicitation of  extra-budgetary funds.    By 1 September, the Federal Administration on Insolvency  chief promised, a new bankruptcy law concept will be published.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING COSTS OF SPRING AND FALL ELECTIONS IN TUSTIN  </P> <P> During the last several weeks, a considerable amount of criticism has been  published regarding the decision by the Tustin City Council to revert back to  April from November for local City Council elections.  </P> <P> Although the reasons have been carefully stated during council discussion and  relayed to reporters so that the details could be published, this has not  happened. The last Tustin City Council election was held in November, 1988, at  the same time as the general presidential election. Of the 21,000 registered  voters in Tustin, 15,900 went to the polls to vote. However, of these, less  than 12,000 voted in the Tustin City Council election. In other words, almost  4,000 voters voted for the president but weren't interested enough to vote for  the Tustin City Council!  </P> <P> As part of my campaign, every one of these 4,000 voters received a personally  addressed mailer from me asking for their vote. Many other candidates did the  same thing. If you assume that each mailing piece costs at least 50 cents,  mailing to the 12,000 Tustin City Council voters cost over $6,000. The total  cost of my successful November, 1988, campaign was in excess of $25,000. This  compares to the total cost of my successful April, 1984, campaign of only  $5,000. A total of $100,000 was spent by all the candidates in November, 1988,  as compared to less than $20,000 in April, 1984. This increase is a direct  consequence of holding the election in November and being obliged to compete  for attention among many state and federal officeholders. Campaign costs of  $25,000 discourage many qualified candidates from entering the competition.  Placing the election back to April will provide much more opportunity for a  newcomer to compete.  </P> <P> Forty percent of California cities have April elections. I support a local  election that touches local people at a cost that is reasonable.  </P> <P> RICHARD B. EDGAR  </P> <P> Mayor, city of Tustin  </P></p>

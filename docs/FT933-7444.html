			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why is mail order so slow? Sir, In 1967 I ordered a pendant from a mail order company in the first of many hundreds of such purchases over the years. After I sent off my postal order for 7s 6d, the pendant took four weeks to arrive. I almost despaired at the delay, but looking back I realise that the order and the accounting would have been processed entirely manually. What I cannot understand is that if I were to repeat the exercise today, but ordering by telephone and using my credit card, the result would be the same, a wait of four weeks (or longer in some cases). One would think that the processing of orders could be computerised to allow a turnaround of less than a week. In fact there is proof that it can: the Next Directory generally delivers within 48 hours and occasionally within 24. Why are companies still quoting a 28-day service? The good old British tradition of poor service, one can only assume. Jonathan Price, 10 Bell Meadow, Dulwich Wood Avenue, London SE19 1HP</p>

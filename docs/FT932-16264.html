			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Daimler-Benz warns of fall in profits and more job cuts DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's biggest industrial group, is heading for a further fall in profits of between 25 and 30 per cent this year, Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director, said yesterday. The group expects to cut 15,000 jobs in 1993, following the loss of 18,000 jobs last year, and production plans have been pruned. 'The German economy's nose-dive has been picking up speed at a rate that has surprised even hardened pessimists,' said Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman. The slowdown was set to continue, he added. 'In other words, we must face up to the fact that 1993 is going to be even harder than the second half of 1992.' Net earnings would be driven down to about DM1bn (Pounds 410m), compared with DM1.45bn in 1992, Mr Liener said. In the first quarter, earnings would be considerably lower than the DM480m for the same period last year. Mr Reuter said group sales in the first quarter had already fallen 25 per cent, compared with the same period last year. The decline was due exclusively to a steep reduction in vehicle sales. Plans for car production had been cut by 43,000 to 486,000 units, he said. Commercial vehicle output would fall 27,000 to about 250,000. Mercedes-Benz, the vehicles subsidiary which usually accounts for two-thirds of group sales and in 1991 provided 80 per cent of earnings, has been especially hard hit by the domestic recession. The division's earnings last year dropped almost 60 per cent to DM849m on marginally reduced turnover of DM66.48bn. Daimler, which also includes the Dasa aerospace business, AEG electrical and electronic engineering, and the Debis software and financial services division, had shown encouraging growth in the first half of 1992, Mr Liener said. But then it tumbled into 'acute losses' which were cushioned only by the first full consolidation of the Airbus aircraft business, which last year earned DM411m net. Dasa, which last year turned in a DM341m loss, including a DM500m provision for staff cuts, is expected to show a considerable improvement this year, Mr Liener said. AEG, which in 1992 earned just DM10m after DM624m losses in the previous year, would probably slip back into the red. However, Mr Liener expected a speedy return to profit as restructuring took effect. Despite the sharp drop in group sales so far, Mr Reuter said he expected turnover for the full year more or less to match 1992's DM98.5bn, but stressed that trends were hard to forecast.

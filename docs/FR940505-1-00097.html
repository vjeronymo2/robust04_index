			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Determination of Baseline Emissions. The proposed FIP cap rules require baseline emissions and emission reductions to be calculated on a monthly basis. The rules require baseline emissions to be determined based on emission inventory records, production, throughput, or usage level. If daily emissions records are available for the period 1989&hyph;1990 and are consistent with the State or local agency's November 15, 1992 inventory submittal, then this data would be used. If daily emissions records are not available for the 1989&hyph;1990 period, then the baseline would be established based on the average daily emissions value calculated by dividing the average emissions over the 1989&hyph;1990 period by 730 days. These baseline emissions are annualized and reduced by the projected reductions from 1990 through the year 2000 (using anticipated control factors from control measure implementation). Finally the reduced baseline is prorated to establish monthly emissions caps by dividing annual emissions by twelve. The purpose for using the median or average value for calculating baseline emissions is to determine the representative emissions of the affected facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance Plans. This proposed regulatory format requires owners and operators of subject facilities to calculate total VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from all process and area emissions sources at the facility for the base year 1990, adjust these emissions by the projected reductions to be achieved by 2000 and then reduce the year 2000 emissions by 4 to 9 percent for VOC and 6 to 9 percent for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per year from 2001 through 2005. Owners or operators could use a variety of methods to reduce VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions by installing new control equipment and/or increasing control efficiency of existing equipment, process modifications or substitutions, or reducing operating schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific provisions sections of the rules require each owner or operator of a subject facility to prepare a VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reduction compliance plan for the years 2001 through 2005 and submit the plan to EPA by January 1, 1999. EPA could comment on any plan and request additional information if needed to adequately evaluate the requirements of the plan. Each owner or operator would submit a revised plan to EPA within 30 calendar days of the receipt of EPA comments. The source would then comply with the provisions of the most recent plan approved by EPA. The owner or operator would include the following information in the plan:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Name, title, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator of the facility, and the person responsible for preparing the plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An estimate of baseline (year 2000) VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from all emissions sources at the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Methods to be employed to achieve the annual percent emissions reduction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Test or demonstration methods used to demonstrate achievement of the VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projections of annual VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions for each source through the year 2005 after application of the VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction methods described in the plan; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For all sources, all information required as part of the facility's Title V operating permit. If a source is not subject to Title V, then the source would submit information similar to that provided by sources subject to Title V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to require submittal of the plans two years prior to the effective date of the limitations of the rules (i.e., January 1, 1999) to obtain a more accurate estimate of baseline VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, to identify subject facilities, and to encourage subject facilities to develop a comprehensive, long-range control strategy for reducing VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submittal of baseline VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions data in 1999 will provide the EPA with more accurate, facility-specific data for evaluating progress toward attainment of the ozone NAAQS and will allow EPA to evaluate whether the cap rules should require higher or lower VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions than the proposed annual rates. In addition, this information is important to EPA because it will provide a current estimate of emissions for the affected sources. Hundreds of small, uninventoried facilities are located in the FIP control areas account, in the aggregate, for a significant source of the VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. Although the databases contain area source emissions estimates to account for uninventoried sources classified under some source categories, the area source emissions estimates are based on inexact data (i.e., the amount of coating or solvent used in the county, etc.) rather than emissions associated with individual facilities in the control area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will also use the emission reduction plans submitted to identify the number and location of subject facilities. This determination is needed to estimate resource requirements for conducting facility inspections for enforcement of the rules. Enforcement personnel will also use the plans to prepare for facility inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Compliance Requirements. Owners or operators of facilities which would be subject to the VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  limitations of the rules would also be subject to annual reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators would certify to the EPA by March 1 of each calendar year, beginning in 2002, that they have complied with all of the requirements of the rule for the previous calendar year on a monthly basis. Owners or operators would also submit documentation of the methods used to achieve the VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Penalties. In the FIP cap rules, EPA proposes an exceedance-based approach to establishing statutory maximum penalties for monthly emission cap exceedances. EPA favors the use of an exceedance-based approach to establishing penalties for emissions limit violations in cap programs and as such, is proposing such an approach for the FIP cap program. The FIP cap rules specify that each 50 pound increment or fraction thereof above a monthly emissions cap would be considered a violation for federal enforcement purposes. For example if a facility was subject to a 2000 pound per month emissions cap and in one month exceeded its emissions cap by 500 pounds, then that facility would have been liable for 10 violations when establishing the statutory maximum penalty for federal enforcement purposes. EPA is seeking public comment on the specific increment (50 pounds per violation_also referred to as a violation-increment) found in the proposed regulations. EPA will consider whether values in a range up to 200 pounds per violation are necessary or adequate. However, the ranges discussed in the FIP should not be construed as what would necessarily be required for all types of cap programs or economic incentive programs including those developed at the State or local level either as a supplement to the FIP cap program or as a replacement for the FIP cap program. For example, State/local agencies may design programs which incorporate enforcement authorities that are unavailable to EPA (e.g., mandatory minimum civil penalties for violations) and which may compensate for somewhat higher violation-increments. In addition to the emissions limit violation penalties, all of EPA's enforcement authorities under section 113 of the CAA apply in the FIP cap program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following is a detailed description of each source category for which EPA has proposed emission cap rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

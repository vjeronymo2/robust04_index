			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE OKS WATER FOR MARSH, IF NEEDED  </P> <P> A surprise rainstorm earlier this week dumped just enough water to dampen a  smoldering political battle over Madrona Marsh's future.  </P> <P> Despite Mother Nature's intervention, however, Torrance City Council members  voted 5 to 2 Tuesday night, with Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker  opposed, to let city officials add as much tap water to the parched marsh as it  needs.  </P> <P> But the heavy rain on Memorial Day weekend, which replenished a nearby drainage  sump that supplies water to the marsh, may have at least delayed the need to  dip into the potable water supply.  </P> <P> Plans by Torrance park administrators to release between two and four acre-feet  of domestic drinking water into the marsh -- an amount roughly equal to between  650,000 and 1.3 million gallons -- were blocked last week by Walker, who  believes pouring water into a marsh during a drought sets a bad conservation  example.  </P> <P> A week ago, workers started the project by pumping about 230,000 gallons into  the marsh, an amount roughly equal to what two average Torrance households  would use in a year.  </P> <P> After Walker complained, the pumping abruptly was stopped to allow council  members time to vote on the project.  </P> <P> During the hiatus, Mother Nature stepped in.  </P> <P> "Somebody upstairs must have been looking out for us" by taking the water  decision out of the hands of city officials "and putting it back with Mother  Nature, where it belongs," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said.  </P> <P> Although city workers were unsure of just how much rain the sump captured over  the weekend, Parks and Recreation Director Gene Barnett said he believes the  runoff may be just what the vernal marsh needed. Such a marsh normally dries up  during the hot summer months, but is filled with water by fall, winter and  spring storms. Madrona's wetlands were nearly dry last week.  </P> <P> "There may be a need in the future to add additional water," Barnett told the  council Tuesday, but because of the heavy rain Sunday night and Monday morning,  the marsh and the sump may have received enough water.  </P> <P> Mayor Katy Geissert and other council members told the staff they should pump  in all the water they believe is needed.  </P> <P> "When we accepted ownership, we accepted a tremendous stewardship to maintain  the marsh as a natural area," Geissert said. "If you change the runoff patterns  for a piece of land like that and then you are faced with a drought, very  likely . . . you're going to have to give the marsh some help."  </P> <P> Walker complained that other alternatives, such as laying pipe for the use of  reclaimed water or digging an on-site well, had not been thoroughly explored.  </P> <P> "The city can and will sustain the marsh, but I didn't think and I don't think  that we should be utilizing city drinking water and taxpayers' funds to do it,"  he said.  </P> <P> Applegate, a former city Water Commission member, agreed.  </P> <P> "Knowing that the drought we're experiencing will probably get a lot worse  before it gets better, I just can't" support pumping tap water into the marsh,  he said.  </P> <P> Don Roser, a retired contractor who made it his personal environmental project  to get water for Madrona Marsh, bristled at the suggestion his efforts would  take drinking water from the lips of Torrance residents.  </P> <P> "I'm sure that you and I enjoy drinking water in our swimming pools, Mr.  Walker," Roser said before the council vote. "The better use would be for the  flora and fauna in the marsh."  </P></p>

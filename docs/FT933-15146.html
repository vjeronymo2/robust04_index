			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / IMF backs credit for Hungary The International Monetary Fund is poised to grant Hungary a Dollars 700m credit facility after the successful conclusion yesterday of the latest round of talks in Budapest, Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest. The IMF and the Hungarian authorities said they saw 'no obstacles which would obstruct the conclusion of an agreement within a short space of time'.

The authorities have increased value added tax with the measure passing parliament this week by a margin of 13 votes.</p>

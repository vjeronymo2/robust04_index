			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / A squall over Street: A small town awaits the outcome of a family row over the Clark shoe business Something is amiss in the town of Street, Somerset. The Clark family is falling out. The Clark's shoe business - based in Street since it was founded 168 years ago - has been built on market expertise and family harmony, in the Quaker tradition. Now, the future of the UK's biggest shoemaker is obscured by an emotionally charged dispute between family members. The town's inhabitants are watching anxiously, concerned about employment and the local economy. The arguments in the family have been prompted by the question of whether to sell the business. They have been brought to a head by an approach from Berisford International, the UK property and agribusiness group. A formal offer for C&amp;J Clark is expected within the next few days. From then until the company's extraordinary general meeting on May 7, when the shoemaker's fate will be decided, board relations are likely to become increasingly tense. Disagreements are not new. Since the early 1980s, when the growth of cheap imports from Asia started to affect profits and margins, shareholders have been divided over the best way forward for the private company. The problems in the market have been compounded by recession. Pre-tax profits have fallen from Pounds 30m in 1990 to just Pounds 1.7m last year. Not surprisingly the 500 members of the Clark family which own about 80 per cent of the company are worried. Most have all their personal wealth tied up in the shares, which have fallen from almost Pounds 2 in 1990 to 90p. But if all are agreed that the business faces problems, the Clarks differ over the best solution. There are three basic factions: sellers, sellers at a price, and non-sellers. Many of the sellers are in need of money. Some shareholders have suffered losses in the Lloyds insurance market, while others have found their incomes sharply reduced by last year's cut in the company's dividend from 7.5p to 3.8p. Those advocating a sale also include directors such as Daniel Clark, great-great grandson of the founder and a former chairman, with a 7 per cent stake. Daniel has stated publicly that only a sale could end years of shareholder interference in the running of the business. Daniel, one of two family members on the 11-member board who favours a change of ownership, has personal reasons to complain. While chairman, between 1967 and 1986, he and his team were strongly criticised by a triumvirate of retired directors, including his own father and a predecessor, Bancroft Clark. The three executives had ruled over Clark's in the glory days of expansion after the second world war and controlled the bulk of the family shareholding. They felt that Daniel was resisting their advice, in particular their calls for increased overseas sourcing, and forced him to make way for the company's first non-family chairman, Larry Tindale. Others, such as Anthony Clothier, the grandson of a Clark daughter, say they have no alternative to a sale. With the shares traded only twice a year many investors find it difficult to take advantage of their inherited wealth. A previous attempt to float 25 per cent of the company in 1989 failed when shareholder support fell just short of the required 75 per cent. Mr Clothier, a former director who parted company with Clark's in 1986, also contends that the difficulties of running a company with such a vociferous family shareholding are too great at a time of deep recession. 'Things cannot go on as they are,' he says. 'We need a proper board to get on with the running of the business.' Nevertheless, Mr Clothier is prepared to consider alternatives. These include the creation of a voting trust to represent the family stake, thus reducing the impact of board divisions. This would be followed by eventual flotation. The problem is, he says, there are no concrete proposals on the table. Thus, 'it would be stupid not to consider the Berisford bid.' The second faction is prepared to sell, but not at the 205p a share which Berisford is expected to offer. It includes non-family shareholders who, having seen last week's balance sheet, believe the decision to sell has come at the wrong time. In its annual statement, Clark's showed a net asset value of 278p, against 282p last year. Mr Henry Cook, who retired from Clark's retail division in 1987 after 39 years at the company, has changed his mind about the bid in recent days. 'Now I'm wondering whether we would not be giving the business away too cheaply,' he says. This last argument has been used by those resolutely opposed to a sale, including four family board members. Mr Charles Robertson, a founder member of the lobby group, Shareholders Opposed to an Enforced Sale (Shoes), is adamant that to sell now, when Clark's has just finished a Pounds 12.5m restructuring programme, would not be in anyone's interest. He believes that many of the difficult tasks facing the company have been achieved, including the closure of the original factory in Street last year and a sharp reduction in the workforce. The feelings of this last group run deep, rooted in 168 years of tradition based in the town where Cyrus and James Clark set up their sheepskin slipper factory in the farmyard of their elder brother Joseph. The town of 11,000 has been largely built by the Clark family which, in the Quaker tradition, promoted the welfare of its workers through the provision of libraries, schools, swimming pools and social clubs. Many members of the family still live there. The original farmhouse where the first Clark set up house in 1720 still stands. It is inhabited by Richard Clark, one of the rebel board directors who jealously guards the family's position in the company. Richard, along with many of the non-sellers, are determined to retain family control of Clark's for a variety of reasons. The less sentimental argue that any sensible investor, with their wealth tied up in one company, would want control of that investment. For this group, who claim it is not a family row, the troubles started when outsiders began to wield influence. About 20 years ago, they say, the board was made up mainly of family members. 'There were not meetings of the family to alter anything, partly because there were a lot of family members in the company's management,' says Robertson. However, Shoes has accepted that the formula of 20 years ago may not apply in the 1990s. Hugh Pym, a Clark and founding member of the lobby group, says Shoes backs 'work already being done . . . to set up a board which is realistic for the needs of the company'. This would include a shareholder council to channel views to directors. Opponents of a sale also believe that Clark's troubles of recent years are almost over. 'The company is actually recovering and it will happen quite quickly,' says Nathan Clark, the 76-year-old great grandson of the company's founder and inventor of the desert boot. 'As soon as we are making better profits again, people will not want to sell.' In Street the locals watch the dispute with a degree of resignation. 'We just wish they would knock their heads together so we can get back to work,' says one local resident.</p>

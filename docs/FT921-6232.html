			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Appointments: Albert Fisher picks from Ranks ALBERT FISHER, the acquisitive fresh food company recently fallen from favour with the City, has hired Timothy Howden, managing director of Ranks Hovis McDougall, as a main board director and chief executive of the European operations. With Stanley Metcalfe as a very active executive chairman of RHM in recent months, the managing director's sway is seen to have diminished. However, Albert Fisher's chairman Tony Millar, the entrepreneurial spirit behind the 1980's expansion, reckons he has secured in Howden ' a first class hands-on manager who we hope will drive the European business very hard.' Howden, 54, is a fluent French speaker, and has spent alot of time in Europe for RHM. Richard Portergill, who had been in charge of Europe for Albert Fisher, becomes corporate development director, Europe, staying on the main board. Millar yesterday denied Portergill had been pushed aside, and suggested that he was pleased to be released from daily operations. ' He recognises corporate development is where his talent lies'. Lenny Pippin, 44, group chief executive of North America, now also comes onto the Albert Fisher board. RHM meanwhile is replacing Howden internally, with accountant Paul Coker who had been deputy managing director. He is characterised as a 'hard numbers' man in contrast to Howden who has a strong marketing bent. While the City gave a vague nod of approval to the Howden move - marking Albert Fisher shares up and RHM slightly down - analysts were uncertain as to how Howden would fare in the 'thrusting entrepreneurial' atmosphere of Albert Fisher.</p>

Paul Ayemona, spokesman of the  Collective of Independent Labor Unions and the Interunions  Crisis Committee takes stock of the three-day strike:    [Ayemona] The Collective of Independent Labor Unions  has established three facts: First, that despite the untrue  statements liberally made by the government, the Beninese  workers widely followed the strike call. Second, the government  does not seem willing yet to listen to workers or it is simply  reluctant to admit the sufferings of the people. Third,  Beninese workers are determined to use all legal and peaceful  means at their disposal to increase their purchasing power.    Should the government maintain its stand, the trade unions  will feel obliged to adopt new measures. Here are more details  with Mr. Ayemona speaking to a Benin radio reporter:    [Ayemona] We have organized days of mobilization and  information for workers and the people. As early as next week,  that is as early as 16 March, the strike movement will resume  with the possibility of negotiations. The issue at stake is the  purchasing power of workers.    [Unidentified correspondent] It seems now that the  government is willing to enter into negotiations with you. What  about that?    [Ayemona] That is what the government thinks. Now,  there is pressure from the workers because we believe that the  government is not the only decisionmaking organ. We want to  help it to make a decision as partners and friends.    On the government's side, serenity prevails despite the  strike call. There is a status quo. Timothee Adanlin, minister  of civil service and administrative reform, has the details:    [Adanlin] The government is observing the same  attitude. It means we are available for discussions with  workers and their representatives on the measures to be taken to  maintain the most peaceful social atmosphere.    [Correspondent] Does that mean that you are calling on  workers for more negotiations?    [Adanlin] We can go back to the negotiation table  anytime. I am currently waiting for the workers to make contact  and to tell us their position. I refer to position because I do  not know what they are planning to do now. For our part, we are  making every effort to prevent a strike. We believe there is no  need for a strike before we discuss the issues at stake and  reach satisfactory solutions for all workers.    Asked on how the government would react to an indefinite  strike, the labor minister said:    [Adanlin] I do not believe there will be an indefinite  strike. What did the government do to trigger the last strike?  The government just said that the right to go on strike is a  right that should be enjoyed and used within the limits imposed  by the law. What the law says is that the right to go on strike  should not be used to cause disturbances and to disrupt public  order. I would like to express my personal satisfaction with  the fact that trade unionists kept the promise made to the head  of state. They promised to make every effort to prevent public  disturbances during their strike and true to their word, public  order was not disrupted. This is indeed satisfying.</p>

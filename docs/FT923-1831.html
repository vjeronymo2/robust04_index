			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: World Bank's spotlight on Russia's woes The upheaval last week in the European currency markets was spectacular. But on the Richter scale of economic convulsions, the forced realignments in the European Monetary System and the unprecedented decisions to release sterling and the Italian lira from their obligations in the European exchange rate mechanism must still rank some way below the economic crisis engulfing Russia. The finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries heard something of these problems when Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign affairs, and other Russian officials joined their meeting on Saturday. But for a comprehensive and deeply disturbing account of the problems confronting the former Soviet republic, western governments would be well advised to read a new World Bank study on Russia due to be released later this week. The study, which runs to more than 300 pages with technical appendices and statistics, is up to date. Russia only became a World Bank member in June. The report takes into account developments since then and was discussed with the Russian authorities in Moscow earlier this month. It makes clear that the former Soviet republic is facing problems of almost unfathomable proportions and the outlook is for conditions to worsen rather than improve. Inflation this year is expected to be around 1,500 per cent, far more than in other reforming socialist countries. Poland, for example, experienced 250 per cent inflation in 1990. Output in real terms has fallen between 30 per cent and 40 per cent since 1989, according to World Bank estimates. The output drop over the past 12 months alone has been about 15 per cent. Import volumes have plummeted - by 50 per cent last year - and the bank expects a further fall of about 20 per cent this year. Exports this year are expected to be about half the levels of 1990. Oil exports, which fell by 50 per cent last year, are expected to decline further in 1992, by around 11 per cent in volume. The warnings in the report are stark. 'Slippages and missteps can be expected and have occurred' in Russia's economic reform programme. Implementation of structural and institutional reforms, other than price liberalisation, has lagged. There is a danger the managers of Russia's fiscal and monetary policy 'will be unable to resist the pressures for a major relaxation' of policy. 'The risks are immense,' including 'a slide into hyperinflation, a decline in output to an unsustainable level, or both, along with the political implications of the failure of the economic reform process'. Moreover, says the bank, 'the government is now reaching a stage where its commitment to the reform process will be severely tested' because the scope for relatively painless adjustments has been exhausted. Not all the administrative problems are on the Russian side, however. Tucked away in its pages is recognition that the industrial countries' co-ordination of support such as technical assistance has not been as good as it might have been. The G7 on Saturday took steps to resolve this problem by urging the World Bank to form a special support group for Russia to discuss bilateral and multilateral technical assistance. So far, as the World Bank noted, the Russian people have born their troubles with remarkable patience. This is partly because real wages have held up well in spite of the high inflation. Real wages are roughly at the level of 1987. Another reason is that employment fell only about 1 per cent last year. But the next phase of the reform process will have to address the problems of the labour force and industrial restructuring which will mean inevitable sharp increases in unemployment and idle plants. With perhaps 3m to 4m people likely to lose their jobs within a year, the World Bank insists that a social safety net should be a high priority. The report cannot hide underlying scepticism about the central state's ability to prevent plans slipping and unravelling. 'Russia is facing a crisis of governance,' the bank says. 'A major effort is needed to develop a capacity to govern and implement economic policy.' In the meantime, Russia's industrialised creditor nations will have to accept some messy compromises. For example, the report warns that achieving policy goals such as lower inflation will take longer than anticipated. Knowing where to compromise is a big problem facing the industrialised world. At the weekend, Lady Thatcher appealed to the G7 and IMF not to be too tough on Russia. The Russian people had a larger task on their hands than any ever known in the West. If their efforts to create a free enterprise society were to end in chaos 'they will turn away from democracy to another strong man,' she said. Another, opposite view came last week from Mr Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Institute for International Finance, the Washington-based organisation owned by commercial banks to monitor sovereign debtors. He urged the Paris Club of creditor nations not to reschedule Russia's foreign debts without securing improvements in its economic and financial policies. The importance of settling Russia's foreign debt problems is considerable. The World Bank report estimates the country will need to mobilise some Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.2bn) a year of external financial resources for the next few years to support the reforms. Russia's external financial requirement is put at about Dollars 23bn this year with a comparable amount thought necessary in 1993. About two thirds of this will come from export credit agencies, through bilateral aid packages or from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Deferral of debt and rescheduling of Russia's debt service obligations are expected to provide the rest.</p>

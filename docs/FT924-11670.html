			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Skiing: The dizzy heights of fashion - Arnold Wilson dodges the fur coats in the Dolomites' top resorts IN ALMOST any other ski resort, the shops would be full of ski hats and sweatshirts with the name of the town emblazoned on them. Nothing so vulgar in the Italian Dolomites resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo, where you cannot buy a hat with Cortina on it for love nor lire. When I searched for one for my friend Nigel, so he could pretend he had been there, I was told politely that the shops in Cortina 'simply didn't sell that kind of thing.' The only possible place where I might find one, it was explained, was the Co-op. But not even it had anything so naff. In Cortina a fur coat, not a ski hat, is the correct uniform. The resort makes Aspen, Colorado look like an amateur in the fur trade. Like a herd of mountain cats standing on their hind quarters, the furs come jostling down the Corso Italia, Cortina's main shopping street in waves - an endless stream of snug, smug, cosy opulence. Even customers at the Co-op wear them. But then this is no ordinary Co-op - how could it be in the most glittering pedestrian precinct in the Alps? Proprietors of even the most glitzy shops here do their window dressing and even sweep the pavements outside wearing furs. Another trait in common with Aspen is that a surprising number of people come here not to ski, but to be seen. The slopes - unlike other Dolomite resorts close by - reflect this. The town may be crawling with party-goers by night - but where do they all go in the morning? I have rarely seen such little queueing at such a famous resort. Those who do ski often make a late start. Fine by me - all the more of the 140 kilometres of runs (served by 56 lifts) to enjoy. Cortina, set in a spectacular mountain amphitheatre, is the most famous of the Dolomites resorts and indeed its local mountains - Tofane, Cristallo, Pompagagnon, Cinque Torri, Croda da Lago and the Tre Cime di Lavaredo - are prime examples of dolomite: the so-called Dolomia Principales. But in skiing terms Cortina, to the north east of the region, remains distanced from the rest of the Dolomites resorts because it is not part of the Sella Ronda, a circuit of spectacular scenery but bland skiing around the Sella massif. The four-valley Sella Ronda circuit (Gardena, Fassa, Livinallongo and Badia) can be skied fairly comfortably (depending on queues) in a day. The circuit, which links the Sella, Pordoi, Campolongo and Gardena passes, comprises a number of small resorts including Colfosco, Corvara, Arraba (new cable car this year) and San Cassiano, all clustered round the huge Gruppo Sella mountain, sometimes referred to as Europe's version of Table Mountain. It is a remarkably scenic route with more than 27 cable cars and bubble lifts, 50 or more chairlifts and 150 assorted drag lifts dotted around this hugely enjoyable ski circuit. The word Dolomites is derived from the name of a French chemist and mineralogist called Deodat de Dolmieu who first described these mountains' unusual and beautiful rock formation in the late 1700s. Apart from their unusual appearance - huge, often vertical monoliths of granite with jagged crags that punctuate the skyline, splashed red and pink as both sun and moon vie for attention - parts of the Dolomites have a complicated history. Sandwiched between Austria and the vast Venetian plain, some of the mountain areas have found themselves in both camps and reflect the two cultures. Selva, for example (but not Cortina) has a strong traditional Austro-Hungarian influence. This makes possible the attractive prospect (in theory) of such healthy compromises as gluhwein parties at Italian prices - arguably the best of both worlds. Much of the area was Austrian until the end of World War One and is still popular with German skiers. Most of the place names have German equivalents: Selva, for example, is also known as Wolkenstein, and the local language is Ladin. The Dolomites cover a vast area, from Plan de Corones in the north to San Martino di Castrozza in the south, and from Bolzano in the west to Cortina in the east. Selva/Val Gardena is an early season venue for the 'Ski Sunday' television cameras with its World Cup race from Ciampinoi down to Santa Cristina before Christmas. The run was the location for the best World Cup performance by a British skier in the northern hemisphere: Konrad Bartelski was second here in 1981. Since last winter, Selva has been upgrading its lifts: the Dantercepies gondola has been modernised, the Fermeda chair is now a quad and a new two-seater chairlift connects Santa Cristina with Monte Pana. On an even grander scale, the entire Dolomiti Superski region, which covers 38 resorts, can be skied on one lift pass. The area has an extraordinary number of lifts - 464, serving more than 1,000 kilometres of prepared pistes. And this year the pass is even valid in the Austrian regions of of Zell am See/Kaprun, the Gastein valley, Dachstein/Tauern, Schladming and Dachstein-Wesrt-Krippenstein.

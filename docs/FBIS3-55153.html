			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant General Dmitriy Kharchenko under the </F> "On Eve of Event" rubric: "What To Expect from the Meeting in  Brussels"]    [Text] A session of the NATO Council opens in Brussels,  the Belgian capital, 10 January at the level of the heads of  state and government of the member countries of this  military-political organization. It is proposed that two main  issues will be at the center of the session's attention: how to  resolve problems of international security, and how to treat the  request from a number of Central and East European states for  admission to membership of the North Atlantic Alliance. It will  essentially be discussing the future of this alliance in the  modern world.    On the eve of the NATO summit it seems expedient to examine  the question of Russia's relationship with NATO. But before  trying to find the answer to it, I believe that we should  consider the following:    A truly paradoxical situation has taken shape. Practically  everyone in the West believes that the North Atlantic Alliance  was the undoubted winner of the Cold War. At the same time this  alliance has probably never before been faced with such acute  and intractable problems. It is even said that NATO is  experiencing a kind of crisis.    The bloc's critical state is all the more surprising because  it followed directly on the outburst of euphoria which in the  West accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of  the Warsaw Pact, and the breakup of the Soviet Union. At the  London meeting in the summer of 1990 the state and government  leaders of the alliance countries welcomed the changes in Europe  enthusiastically and even called them historic. Then suddenly a  crisis. What is going on here?    The point is that NATO in the form in which it was created  in  the late forties is practically played out. The "threat from  the East" has disappeared. The enemy has disappeared. Yet that  is precisely what the bloc organizers needed not only to  implement the policy of "containing and rolling back" communism  but, above all, to consolidate the leading role of the United  States in the postwar world. For long years the bloc's chief  function was to be the instrument of Washington's policy and to  involve other Western countries in it.    There is more. Having rid itself of real or imaginary fears  of a "massive attack from the east," NATO has found itself  facing new and this time very real dangers. These are the  unstable situation in Russia (let us recall the pained reaction  of some people in the West to the results of the parliamentary  elections in our country) and also in other states which have  emerged on the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of  the uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction, and,  finally, the interethnic and ethnic conflicts on the periphery  of the bloc, which are escalating into fierce armed clashes, as  has already happened in Yugoslavia, Moldova, and the Caucasus.  How is NATO to react to all these dangers, and what can it and  must it do under these conditions?    The top-level NATO meeting is to indicate an answer to this  question.    All this also directly concerns Russia, Particularly as the  question of expanding the NATO framework by admitting a number  of East European countries to this organization's ranks is  arising very acutely. Every state's sovereign right to choose  the forms and means of ensuring its security which best suit it  has to be respected. But NATO's leading circles know of  Moscow's negative attitude to the prospect of the alliance's  accelerated expansion. This might not resolve existing problems  but create new ones. For example, it might undermine the  established legal treaty system on our continent -- above all,  the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of  strengthening trust and stability, new seeds of mistrust would  thereby be sown -- which would undoubtedly lead to the  destabilization of the whole situation.    The expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility will  directly affect Russia's interests for geopolitical, military,  and also internal political reasons. As a result of the  alliance's expansion the bloc's military grouping -- the  largest in the world -- will reach lines close to Russian  borders. This will require a fundamental reappraisal of all our  defensive concepts, a reshaping of the armed forces, a revision  of the operational apportionment of theaters of military  operations, the deployment of additional infrastructure, the  relocation of large military contingents, and changes in  operational plans and the nature of combat training.    It is also easy to imagine that both the leadership and the  public of Russia would perceive the widening of the circle of  NATO members as an attempt to isolate us and to create a "cordon  sanitaire" on our western borders. It would not be out of place  to remark that this could promote the emergence of xenophobia in  our society and strengthen the influence of right-wing radical  nationalist parties and organizations.    This, however, is the opinion not only of Russians. It was  no coincidence that the influential German newspaper DIE WELT  wrote recently that a desire to recreate the Iron Curtain to cut  themselves off from an unstable neighbor -- Russia -- lies  behind all the attempts to expand NATO to the east.    Leading NATO circles also understand the delicacy of this  situation. To all appearances they are in no hurry to admit new  members, despite insistent requests from Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a number of  other East European countries. The U.S. President has advanced  as an alternative an idea which has been named "partnership for  peace." I believe that Russia could support this idea insofar as  it takes into account the security interests of all states  without exception. Of course, this partnership should be geared  to forming unified security standards throughout the  Euro-Atlantic area. The priority development of a political  dialogue, constant consultations, the attainment of concerted  positions, and, in the long term, coordinated actions constitute  genuine partnership.    At their sessions in early December the NATO countries'  foreign and defense ministers confirmed their support for the  "partnership for peace" plan advanced by Washington.  Nevertheless, the essence of this plan and the ways of  implementing it are still insufficiently clear. Obviously,  these questions will be the object of close examination at the  upcoming NATO Council session, and we would very much like its  participants to take the Russian viewpoint on this problem into  consideration. Of course, what will be decided in Brussels will  also be discussed at the meeting of the Russian and U.S.  presidents to be held in the next few days.    All this certainly does not mean that an insurmountable gulf  lies between Russia and NATO. This was shown by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's recent meeting with NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner. It was pointed out there, in  particular, that an objective assessment of Russia's role in  ensuring international security and stability requires its  relations with the North Atlantic Alliance to outstrip the  relations between the latter and the Central and East European  countries in terms of pace, volume, and richness.    It is notable that we can already see compatibility in terms  of a number of basic aims in the military-political concepts of  Russia and the NATO countries. This is being promoted both by  the deideologization of international relations and by the  coincidence of the sides' views on the main problems of ensuring  security.    Both sides give priority in this sphere to political  methods.  The use of military force is regarded as an exceptional measure,  permissible only in the interests of self-defense and also in  peacemaking operations. Both the "new NATO strategic concept"  adopted in 1991 and the recently approved "Main Provisions of  the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine" contain  exceptionally important points: No state or coalition is  regarded as an enemy by either the North Atlantic Alliance or  Russia. Both documents recognize that the limitation and  reduction of arms accord with the national interests of all  states and help strengthen universal security. It is possible  to say that this opens up a real opportunity to eliminate the  residual elements of military confrontation in Europe.    Unfortunately, such elements do still exist. Whereas Russia  is carrying out a thorough reform of its Armed Forces, having  already significantly reduced their strength and intending to  continue moving in this direction, the NATO countries' military  activity is still being reduced only slowly. It was pointed out  at a recent session of the bloc's Military Planning Committee  that the strength of the member countries' armed forces has been  reduced by just 15 percent over the past few years, while  military spending still amounts to 3.2 percent of GNP. And this  in the absence of a real enemy!    But the following question arises: If NATO's expansion  appears inexpedient -- let us put it that way -- from Russia's  viewpoint today and if everything is not yet clear with the  "partnership for peace" plan, is there any way out of the  situation which is taking shape? Obviously there is, and maybe  not just one. It is possible, for example, to point to the  further enhancement of the role and significance of the activity  of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. It already  unites 38 states -- both NATO and former Warsaw Pact members,  including, of course, the Russian Federation. Russia actively  participates in NACC sessions at the foreign minister level, and  its representatives from the Defense Ministry participate in the  work of various commissions, seminars, and courses within the  framework of this organization.    This framework, however, is still quite limited. Obviously,  the time is coming to expand it considerably. There is a real  opportunity to turn the NACC into an organization for collective  security in Europe. This would not mean lessening the role of  the CSCE but, thanks to the fact that far fewer states  participate in the work of the NACC than in the CSCE, it is  easier to arrive at mutually acceptable decisions there and to  make these decisions more effective and more consonant with  urgent tasks and with the demands of the situation.    It would not be out of place to remind you here that all the  members of the NACC understand this. A recent NACC meeting  adopted a statement which spoke of measures to further  strengthen cooperation within the framework of this  organization. It sets itself the task of continuing and  activating consultations on political questions and questions  connected with ensuring security, as well as developing  cooperation on military questions. In particular, a new working  plan for dialogue, partnership, and cooperation in 1994 was  approved for this purpose.    Why should emphasis be placed on organizations such as the  NACC, let us say? Why cannot the functions of ensuring regional  security be entrusted to NATO? Because the North Atlantic  Alliance was created as a specific organization of leading  Western countries under definite conditions and with quite  definite aims. But the conditions have changed decisively.    It seems beyond doubt that any attempts to transform NATO  can  change virtually nothing in its essence. The North Atlantic  Alliance remains yesterday's organization. It is not its  modernization that must be on the agenda, but the abandonment of  bloc thinking in favor of an effective and efficient system of  European and international security. It is evidently time to  breathe vital force into the fertile idea of creating a security  system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" and to prepare and set in  motion the appropriate mechanism.    These are the views I would like to share on the eve of the  NATO summit with regard to the serious problem of the  relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>

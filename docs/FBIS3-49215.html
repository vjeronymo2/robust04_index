They opened fire against Ramadan at a  15 meter distance causing him five wounds.    On the same day, at 1500, in the border zone of Tropoje,  Serbian border forces opened fire from the Yugoslav territory  wounding seriously in the Albanian zone the Albanian Citizen  Hamid Ram Sallaku, 20 years.    These grave criminal acts, encouraged by vile anti-Albanian  aims of Serbian chauvinists, are made in the course of similar  acts in the past. In the incidents occurring in the border of  Albania with Serbia and Montenegro, all the wounded and killed  have been Albanians, none of them has been Serbian. With the  last two victims, the number of those killed since the beginning  of 1993 becomes 21. Such criminal acts are part of the strategy  of tension and war that Milosevic is following, thus stirring up  situations with unprecedented consequences in the region.    The Albanian Foreign Ministry forcefully protests against  these incidents, which should be put an end immediately.</p>

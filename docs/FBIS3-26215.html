The propaganda and  ideological front must regard these as four key tasks to be  fulfilled properly.    The "one fundamental guiding principle and four key tasks"  put forward here are the general layout and strategic ideology  for doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work in the  course of speeding up the establishment of the new socialist  market economy structure. This guiding principle is the soul  that sets the orientation for all work, and the four key tasks  are the concrete manifestation and end-result of the fundamental  guiding principle. With the fundamental guiding principle, the  four key tasks have a general program; are linked with,  coordinated with, and promoted by each other; and provide  strength for propaganda and ideological work as whole. On the  other hand, with the four key tasks, the implementation of the  fundamental guiding principle is a prop and can form a spiritual  support for solidifying and invigorating the aspirations of the  party and people. All comrades of the party, and especially  comrades on the propaganda and ideological front, must firmly  grasp "one fundamental guiding principle," strive to fulfill  properly the "four key tasks," live up to high expectations, set  sails in the direction of the current, and raise propaganda and  ideological work to a higher level.    To fulfill the four key tasks properly, it is necessary,  first of all, to grasp well the work of arming the people with  scientific theory. Without arming the people with scientific  theory, there can be no correct guidance for public opinion nor  a clear orientation for ideological education and for developing  the main theme. In this sense, "arming the people" runs through  "guiding the people," "molding the people," and "encouraging the  people." This year, we should proceed from study, research, and  propaganda, and should deepen the work of arming the whole party  with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in an even more extensive and firm manner. It  is necessary to further seriously study the original works,  familiarizing ourselves with them and mastering them through  comprehensive study. It is necessary to further develop and  deepen the study of this theory and to mobilize the theoretical  workers in various branches of science and the practical workers  in various departments in all localities to open up a new  situation of extensive, lively, and vigorous study of the  theory. It is necessary to use the people's experience and  various methods to further publicize and popularize this theory  in light of reality, and especially in light of the reality  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee and since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his remarks in  the south. As some propaganda cadres have put it, properly  grasping the study of leading cadres at and above the county and  regiment level is the "key project" in arming the people with  theory, properly grasping the study of party members and cadres  in urban and rural grass-roots units is the "basic project" in  arming the people with theory, and properly grasping the study  and education of young people is the "project of hope" in arming  the people with theory. Only by properly grasping the "three  major projects" can the task of "arming the people with  scientific theory" truly be fulfilled.    Fundamentally speaking, persisting in educating the cadres  and people with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is to help people clarify the  significance of grasping the overall situation and to increase  their ability to grasp the overall situation. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping is especially good at grasping and controlling the  overall situation, and he is our brilliant example in making  clear the orientation, dispersing the fog, opening up a path for  advancement, and fulfilling tasks with flying colors. His  scientific works and all his theories have proceeded from the  overall situation. The CPC Central Committee set out that the  overall situation of the work of the whole party in 1994 is:  Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu,  shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifeng, cujin fazhan, baochi wending 2119  0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651  4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353]. All work must be subordinated  to this overall situation and must serve this overall situation.  In our further study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, in the new year, we also must focus our  attention on clarifying and serving this overall situation. We  must firmly grasp and treasure the present rare historical  opportunity, unify our understanding, act in unison, achieve  unity from top to bottom, make concerted efforts, and resolutely  push forward reform, which we deliberated on for many years,  wished to carry out, but for which we did not have the  conditions to carry it out. "Reform is a move that determines  China's destiny" and China's development is determined by  reform. Lacking enthusiasm about deepening reform, and being  enthusiastic only about the construction of more new projects  and the expansion of existing ones cannot make the national  economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner  [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660].    Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the great spiritual support of the whole  party and nation, and is a brilliant banner guiding the new  revolution of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.  In the new year, we must make greater accomplishments in arming  the people with theory and in seeking unity of thinking. Under  the guidance of this banner, we must persist in the emancipation  of our minds, seeking truth from facts, promoting and deepening  reform, opening wider, and making great efforts to maintain  stability so that we can have a clearer orientation and more  lively thinking in all aspects of propaganda and ideological  work, and can open up a new situation in this respect.</p>

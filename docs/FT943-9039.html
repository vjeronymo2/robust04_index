			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee traders cautious The coffee market had a nervous week following a sharp fall in prices on Monday as speculators and hedge funds baled out of futures contracts in New York to push prices down by 11 per cent. Monday's sell-off on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was followed by a drop of almost Dollars 200 a tonne in London prices on Tuesday. This pushed the market down to Dollars 3,195 a tonne for the November futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange. The market managed to claw back some of its losses later in the week, but trading remained thin and jittery and last night, at Dollars 3,285, prices were still almost 11 per cent lower than Monday's open. Traders were reluctant to push the coffee market strongly in any direction and stayed cautious ahead of the US Department of Agriculture report on the extent of frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees, expected late yesterday. Market participants were expecting US estimates to be more optimistic than Brazil's own predictions. The Brazilian authorities estimate that up to 11m bags or 40 per cent of the 1995 coffee crop has been affected by the frost. Traders believe the US assessment will put the extent of the damage at between 3m and 5m bags. That means the USDA is likely to estimate a crop of between 18m and 21m bags for 1995 while Brazil expects a smaller 17m bags. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers, said many traders were waiting until after the trees flower in September for renewed assessments of the damage. 'Undoubtedly at some stage there will be another run-up in price, but the market could fall another Dollars 500 a tonne before that happens,' he said. Another USDA report about the prospects for this year's US harvest boosted wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Thursday. The USDA reduced its forecast of world wheat output by 5m tonnes to 541.95m tonnes, pushing wheat futures prices up by 3 cents to Dollars 3.50 a bushel. The USDA also forecast improved prospects for US wheat exports as well as record US crops of maize and soyabeans. Meanwhile, this week there was more evidence that the unprecedented international trade agreement encouraging aluminium producers to cut output is having an increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed prices for so long. The International Primary Aluminium Institute said producer stocks fell for the fourth consecutive month in June, by 12,000 tonnes to 1.993m tonnes. Since February, when trade delegates from six of the major aluminium-producing regions signed a 'memorandum of understanding' about production cuts, producer stocks have fallen by 141,000 tonnes or 6.6 per cent. LME stocks also fell in June - the first time in nearly four years that IPAI and LME stocks had fallen in the same month. Yesterday the LME reported that its stocks had fallen again and Mr Anatoly Shleyev, head of the statistics department at Russia's state metallurgy committee, suggested his country would be able to meet its promised annual production cuts of 500,000 tonnes this year. Nevertheless, he said Russian aluminium exports were likely to be 2m tonnes compared with last year's 1.6m tonnes. Aluminium for delivery in three months closed at Dollars 1,490.50 a tonne on the LME last night, Dollars 5.25 up on the day and Dollars 41.75 up over the week.  -------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------------- Aluminium          -11,175 to 2,491,050 Aluminium alloy        -60 to    26,480 Copper              +3,775 to   346,475 Lead                +2,725 to   365,425 Nickel                +468 to   136,128 Zinc                +5,800 to 1,224,400 Tin                   +200 to    31,165  --------------------------------------------</p>

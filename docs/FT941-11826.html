			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / M&amp;S enters pensions market Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is to offer life and pensions products from next year in addition to its existing financial services. The company said its financial advisers would be salaried and receive no commission or incentive to sell. It is expecting to recruit about 50 advisers initially. M&amp;S aims to provide the service in six stores from early next year, rising to 50 by the end of 1995. The first six sites are intended to be in a mix of city centres and out-of-town shops. The Equitable Life Assurance society will provide consultancy and systems support, and will also be involved in product development and training plans. M&amp;S has not yet decided who should do its fund management. Mr Keith Oates, joint managing director, said yesterday that the company hoped to announce its range of products in the autumn. Its advisers would recommend only M&amp;S products and would not be able to make a recommendation where no product appropriate to the customer's needs was available. M&amp;S entered financial services in 1984 when it launched its chargecard. It added a unit trust management company in 1988 and also offers personal loans. In 1992-93, financial services contributed Pounds 24m to pre-tax profits. Mr Oates said the new services were planned to be more store-based than the financial services operation had been so far. Though information about the new products would be available through stores and direct mail, such products were less suitable for selling through direct mail since there was a greater need for advice and assessment of the individual customer's circumstances, he said. The company's plans to enter the life and pensions business come as the financial services sector is going through a period of regulatory change. The market has become particularly difficult because of public concern about the mis-selling of products such as pension transfers. M&amp;S's decision to pay its financial advisers by salary only will fuel the debate already underway in the life industry over methods of payment, especially since impending changes in regulation mean that sales agents and advisers will be required to tell customers the commission they receive for selling life products. Some industry experts also believe that by adding to the capacity in an already over-crowded market, M&amp;S will hasten the prospects of a shake-out in the life sector. Mr Oates said the project came after two years of research into the savings market. The company had identified the surrender values of policies as one area of customer concern. Lex, Page 20</p>

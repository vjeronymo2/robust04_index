			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Aviation experts suspect mechanical problems A MECHANICAL or structural problem appears to have been the most likely cause of the El Al crash, although the possibility of sabotage has not been entirely ruled out. European civil aviation safety officials said that aircraft accidents on take-off tended to be mechanical, while landing accidents were quite often caused by pilot error. The Boeing 747 freighter crashed after losing its two starboard engines soon after take-off, when both caught fire. Dutch civil aviation officials found the engines in a lake about nine miles from the crash site. These, together with the aircraft's 'black box' flight recorder, are expected to provide vital clues to the cause of the accident. Boeing, the airframe manufacturer, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine maker, have both sent experts to Amsterdam to help Dutch officials and two teams of investigators from Israel. Experts suggest the most likely cause of the accident was an uncontained explosion at take-off in one engine of the jumbo, which led to the failure of the other engine. Another possibility is structural failure in an engine mounting or pylon which could have ripped one of the fuel lines in the wing, causing fire and damaging the second engine. An identical Boeing 747 freighter, operated by China Airlines, crashed into a mountain last December after take-off from Taipei, capital of Taiwan, killing the crew of five. Pilot error at Amsterdam was ruled out. 'With one engine out it would be possible to make it back to the airport but with two on fire he would not have had a cat in hell's chance,' said Mr Charles Darke, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association. The crash of a wide-body airliner in a densely populated area has long been regarded as the aviation industry's nightmare. Anti-airport pressure groups have repeatedly warned about the potential danger.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Donetsk -- At a news conference on 2 February Oblast  Council Chairman Vadym Chuprun reported on the outcome of the  meeting of the chairmen of the oblast councils and state  administrations of 10 Ukrainian and Russian border oblasts,  which took place in Belgorod on 29 January. Its participants  considered the draft regulations which will be worked up in two  weeks and which will determine the principles of mutual  relations between the neighboring oblasts.    According to Vadym Chuprun, the meeting proved that there  are  no discrepancies among the leaders of the oblasts, that all  disputable issues relate mostly to customs service and the  border, but they should be tackled at the interstate level. At  the previous meeting of oblast leaders they discussed the issue  on granting them the status of border zones which would  contribute to establishing normal mutual relations. This issue  was to be solved by the governments of both countries.  Unfortunately, Vadym Chuprun pointed out, while Russia did take  certain steps in this direction, the Ukrainian Government did  not respond to the appeal by the participants in the Belgorod  meeting. The current meeting approved an appeal to Leonid  Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin with the request to help establish  normal neighborly relations between the neighboring states.</p>

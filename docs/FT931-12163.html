			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (22): Less attractive than the collective route - Managed PEPs / A rule change and the absence of performance figures have weakened a once-popular tax shelter MANAGED Peps used to be the bread and butter of the Pep industry. While investment and unit trust Peps were limited to a maximum of Pounds 3,000 until last year, the full Pounds 6,000 could be put into a general Pep. Those who already had a portfolio of equities could simply shelter a portion of these from tax by putting them into a Pep. Other investors, attracted by the tax breaks, could leave it to the discretion of a Pep plan manager to choose their shares. The limits on collective funds (apart from new-issue investment trusts, which qualified for the full Pounds 6,000) meant that the remaining Pounds 3,000 had to be topped up with shares - again, a decision that many investors would rather leave to the experts. But a combination of factors has conspired to make managed Peps less attractive. John Spiers, of BESt Investment, estimates that managed Peps now account for only 20 per cent of the Pep market, and expects to see that proportion fall further. One reason has been the lifting of the Pep limit on collective funds last year, with the exception of those that are 50 per cent or more invested in non-European markets. (These funds have an annual Pep limit of Pounds 1,500.) Unit trusts have particularly benefited, partly because the global nature of many investment trusts means that they are still trapped by the non-EC Pep limit. For small investors, in particular, collective funds are a way of diluting equity investment risk, because of the large number of stocks they hold. Since some unit and investment trust companies charge no extra for 'pepping' the investment, they hold considerable appeal for those who may wish, in any case, to invest in a collective fund. A second reason for the demise of the managed Pep is the lack of performance figures. Managed Peps come in many varieties: share-only, a mixture of collective funds and shares, or a mixture of unit and investment trusts. This makes comparison difficult. We wrote to all those who operate a managed Pep service, requesting performance figures for this article, but the overwhelming response was that it was difficult to provide any. For example, Sheppards, the London-based brokers, said: 'Clients who have not selected their own stocks and are looked after by Sheppards Fund managers tend to have a portfolio constructed to cater for their own particular requirements. We do not feel in all honesty we could produce figures which would be meaningful.' This can be a problem for investors, because they are unable to select a plan manager on the basis of performance. The variety of managed Peps, the fact that many are managed as an extension to an existing client's portfolio, and the effect of different charging structures make it difficult to produce figures. By contrast, the performance of a unit trust or investment trust Pep is easily charted, because these funds have prices quoted on a daily basis. This leaves many investors with little guidance but to base their choice on the charges levied on a Pep. Charges also vary considerably, but many are likely to have an initial charge of 1 to 6 per cent, an annual management fee of 1 to 1.5 per cent and dealing charges in the region of 1.65 per cent. Some may charge a flat fee for the initial charge or brokerage. Jamie Berry, of Berry Asset Management, says that when it comes to choosing a Pep, the single most important factor is its cost structure. He warns investors not to be lured by a low initial charge only to find that dealing costs are high. Berry Asset management's own Pep charges are a 2 per cent initial fee, 1.25 per cent annual fee and 1.5 per cent brokerage. For many people, such charges may mean that they should not have a Pep at all. Mr Berry points out that a Pep is not so much a product as a way of holding equities in order to avoid paying income and capital gains tax. There are now over 2m general plans in existence. On the conservative assumption that the same investors in the first year have taken out a new Pep each year since the launch of Peps in 1987, there must now be at least 420,000 people who have one. Yet the number of people paying capital gains tax has dwindled from 165,000 in 1988-89 to an estimated 85,000 in 1992-93. This leaves income tax. The costs of a Pep will almost certainly be greater than the income tax savings for a basic-rate taxpayer, but a higher-rate taxpayer may find he saves tax after a number of years, particularly once time has eroded the effect of the initial charge. If you are interested in a Pep for the income tax savings, you should obviously choose one that is geared towards a high yield. However, there is nothing necessarily wrong with a high-risk Pep aimed at capital growth, so long as you know what you are buying. For the cautious, Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere, recommends James Capel's Footsie Pep fund - which tracks the FT-SE 100 index, as the 'ideal fund for those new to the equity market,' because it has always been difficult for specific funds to outperform the market. Chase de Vere and BESt Investment both publish information on Peps, listing types available, plan managers and charges.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf by </F> Husnu Kaftan in Baghdad on 25 January -- recorded; in Arabic  with superimposed translation into Turkish]    [Text] [Kaftan] Mr. Minister, the talks in connection  with the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline were held between the  Turkish and Iraqi foreign ministry officials in Ankara on 8-9  January. As you know, the UN resolutions still stand. How will  this problem be resolved?    [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, the under secretaries of the  Turkish and Iraqi Foreign Ministries met in Ankara upon the  invitation of the Turkish side. The oil pipeline issue was  particularly discussed during the Ankara talks. The crude oil  in the pipeline must be emptied out and the pipeline must be  refilled to prevent rotting and to maintain it. We have been  suggesting this to the Turkish side for a long time. We should  not wait any longer. Turkey suffered great economic loss  because the pipeline was closed down. The international  economic embargo imposed on Iraq greatly affected Turkey as  well. Turkey suffered great damages. Turkey can extract  certain resolutions from the United Nations to compensate for  its losses.</p>

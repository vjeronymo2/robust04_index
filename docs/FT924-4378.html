			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover to reach new high LONDON'S BULLS refused to be discouraged by the setback in the Hong Kong stock market overnight and, spurred on by strong buying of stock index futures, drove the FT-SE Index by 13 points yesterday to a new closing high which was within 8 points of the 2,800 mark. Favourable statistics on the US economy provided stimulus near the close of trading but the London market had already turned round convincingly from early losses which had failed to bring out any institutional sellers. Although neither the US dollar nor Wall Street stood out yesterday - the Dow Average was a shade off at the London close - news of a 0.4 per cent gain in US economic indicators in October and a Purchasing Managers Index at 55 per cent in November was well-received in the UK market. Improved economic data from the US over the past week has strengthened hopes for a general revival in global economies and boosted confidence in the London equity market. Early trading saw equities give ground smartly with sentiment unsettled by the 5 per cent fall in Hong Kong after China challenged the agreements with Britain. HSBC, the London quoted HongKong Bank, fell sharply and the Footsie was quickly 10.6 down, with the rest of the market cautious on the continued pressures in the currency markets. But trading volume was low and traders stressed that there was little selling pressure. The market quietly rallied until mid-session when a strong buyer drove the December Footsie contract ahead. The stock market quickened its pace as it moved above overnight levels and the December contract broke through the 2,800 mark at its official close. The stock market peaked just short of 2,800, the day's best reading on the Footsie of 2,794.3 showing a gain of more than 15 points. With Wall Street refusing to give a confident lead, the London market closed off the top at a new closing high of 2,792.0 for a gain on the day of 13.2. The mood of optimism was unshaken by some disappointing corporate results and by reverberations from the final collapse this week of Rosehaugh, one of the leading City of London property development groups of the 1980s. Equity market volume remained good, with 631.1m shares traded, against 635.7m on Monday when retail business of Pounds 1.1bn maintained the extended run of good customer turnover in UK equities. The stock market has now gained nearly 100 Footsie points since the middle of November; in fact, only a week ago the Footsie slipped back to 2,709. Investors have taken an increasingly optimistic view of the outlook or equities as the GATT dispute has calmed down and US statistics on durable goods orders, GDP, and now leading economic indicators have apparently turned more positive. However, some traders warned yesterday that share prices had been squeezed higher by the absence of sellers in a market suddenly filled with would-be buyers. Uncertainties still remain regarding the near-term outlook for interest rates, both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Several strategists yesterday suggested selling into the current rally in UK share prices but it was clear that their advice was not heeded to any great extent by the managers of the big investment funds.</p>

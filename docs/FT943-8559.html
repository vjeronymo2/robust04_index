			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Whitehall error over disabled workers: Officials missed EU change in job support scheme Whitehall officials last night admitted it was their mistake over a change in European Union law that prompted employment secretary Michael Portillo to scrap a job support scheme to help disabled workers. Senior civil servants failed to realise that the new directive on awarding public supply contracts, which came into force in June, had dropped previous legal protection that had enabled EU states to support subsidised schemes for the disabled. 'They failed to pick it up,' said one official. As a result, Mr Portillo believed he had no option but to terminate the government's Priority Suppliers Scheme, dating back to just after the second world war, which helped disabled workers tender at a lower price than others for public contracts. The news came as the European Commission denied UK claims that it had questioned the legality of the priority supplier scheme last week. The UK Foreign Office said a letter from Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, to Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, had confirmed the Commission's doubts about the scheme. Brussels officials said the letter had nothing to do with the case. The new consolidated directive was drafted at the end of 1992 by EU officials after Brussels consulted civil servants of all the member states. In Britain both Treasury and the Department of Employment officials gave advice on the contents of the draft. It was stressed last night that ministers were not directly involved in that consultation process. During that period Mr Portillo was chief secretary to the Treasury and Mrs Gillian Shephard was employment secretary. The previous EU directive, drawn up in January 1977 on co-ordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts, stated clearly that opt-outs were permissible which would protect the position of disabled workers. That directive said public supply contracts must go to 'either the lowest price only' or to 'the most economically advantageous tender', depending on a number of commercial considerations. But it also made clear that the economic criteria 'shall not apply when a member state bases the award of contracts on other criteria within the framework of rules existing at the time this directive is adopted, whose aim is to give preference to certain tenderers, on conditions that the rules invoked are compatible with the Treaty of Rome.' It was this opt-out that enabled the British government to continue subsidising disabled workers in sheltered workshops. However, the crucial paragraph was not included in the new consolidated directive, which UK officials believe cannot be amended; legislation would be needed to remedy the omission. Yesterday no official in Whitehall was able to explain why this had happened. But it has been accepted that the omission from the directive had not been spotted by civil servants in late 1992. This is why it was never raised with ministers. Commission denies disabled work claims, Page 6</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (12): Music of the cash tills - Supermarkets spring up on virgin territory Anyone driving through eastern Germany for the first time cannot fail to notice the number of vast shopping centres which have been built outside the region's main towns and cities. These centres, built on greenfield sites since unification, undoubtedly fulfil a demand. Before 1989, eastern Germany's retailing sector, such as it was, was monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft co-operatives, consisting of department stores, supermarkets and small outlets; and the Handelsorganisation, the state-run retail sector. Compared with western German levels, which has 1-1.2 sq metres per capita of retail outlets, there were 0.3 sq m per capita in eastern Germany before 1990. Following unification, the large retailers from western Germany rushed in, encouraged by a consumer spending spree by east Germans. In most cases, the big chains decided immediately to acquire property outside the city centre. They bought cheap land from the local councils, often for only DM3 a square metre. More importantly, they could acquire the land easily because, unlike the centre of the cities, there were few property rights claims. In addition, they could take advantage of investment grants allocated by the states of eastern Germany. But there was another reason why the west German retailing sector decided to locate outside the cities. Not only was the land relatively cheap, but retailers could obtain planning permission quickly, unlike western Germany where planning permission is strict, and because the local eastern councils realised they could reap some of the benefits by claiming turnover tax from the retailers. Above all, west German retailers arrived in eastern Germany at a time when the city authorities themselves had not yet decided what kind of long-term planning they wanted for the inner cities. In short, no lobbies had yet emerged in the city councils to protect the small shop-keepers and retail sector in the inner cities from the competition emerging outside the city perimeters. Eastern Germany's city authorities are now questioning the benefits of these shopping centres. Mr Ralph Kausch, a retailing expert at Leipzig's Chamber of Commerce, says the cities are the main losers. 'A struggle is taking place between the city government and local councils. That struggle is about how to win back consumers to the inner cities. The shopping centres are chiselling away at the small retailers in the city and taking away employment in the inner cities.' By 1993, only 20 per cent of retail outlets, including department stores, in eastern Germany had been based in the cities compared with about 80 per cent in western German cities. The absence of the large retailers also means that the cities, already strapped for revenue, are deprived of the turnover tax from the retail sector. Mr Krausch believes that Leipzig is losing taxes on an annual DM900m turnover in the retail sector. In contrast, the small local council of Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, which has a population of 650, can expect to thrive from the giant 100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex which is expected to reach a turnover of DM850m by 1995. The cities in eastern Germany are now on the offensive, tightening up planning permission with the aim of curbing the continuing expansion of the shopping centres. Ms Irene Krause, an official at Leipzig's planning office, said the city had already granted planning permission to develop 455,000 square metres of retailing outside the city but in future the city authorities intended to impose limits. It may be too late. Mr Berndt Ruckert, president of the Association of German retailers, said recently that the cities provided few incentives for retailers after German unification. 'Property in the inner cities was too expensive and property rights were unclear,' he said. In Berlin's Mitte, the heart of east Berlin, retailers would have had to pay between DM20,000 and DM30,000 a sq m in the boom of 1992. Yet there is a positive side to the retailing developments of the past three years. If the infrastructure outside the cities continues to improve, it is likely the consumers and retailers will both win: consumers will be given more choice at more competitive prices, and retailers, boosted by the availability of more capacity, unthinkable in western Germany, can now rethink their long-term strategy for retailing throughout Germany. Mr Cy Schluter, a Frankfurt-based retailing expert, said that retailers will be able to build large warehouses, which will cut costs, shorten delivery times, and pass on some of the benefits to the consumer. 'If you have a large warehousing network, the transport and delivery costs can be kept down, and ultimately prices can be kept down as well,' he said. Mr Schluter added that as the road network improved, retailers would increasingly use eastern Germany as a base for moving goods across Germany. But it remains to be seen if the economy of eastern Germany can support these large retailing outlets as the fear of unemployment forces people to spend less. There are few worries on the home-improvement front, as east Germans continue to renovate their homes. Hornbach, the large home improvement department stores, expects its four outlets in eastern Germany to account for a quarter of its total turnover, which last year exceeded DM750m. But Mr Schluter believes the food sector could come under pressure. 'The outlets are not near the centre. People tend to buy food every day. I am not so sure they are prepared to drive some distance for the most basic food items.'</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: EIT net assets fall 4.5% Edinburgh Investment Trust, one of the largest UK investment trusts, reported a fall of 4.5 per cent to 326.6p in net asset value per share in the half year to September 30. The fall exceeded the decline of 3.3 per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index over the period and meant that the trust did not achieve one of its regularly stated objectives. However, EIT, managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, achieved its other stated objective of producing dividend growth ahead of UK inflation. It declared an interim dividend of 3.05p (2.95p) - a 3.4 per cent increase compared with a rise in retail prices of 2.2 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 5.77p to 5.35p, as a result of switching part of the gilts portfolio into lower yielding equities in the latter part of last year, as well as the timing of some dividend receipts. However, dividend growth from underlying investments exceeded expectations and the directors are confident of being able to increase the final dividend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 20 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Major General Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian  Defense Ministry International Treaty Directorate, who is on a  visit to Japan, met Ken Sato, defense councilor, at the Defense  Agency [DA] on 19 May. They discussed the DPRK's suspected  development of nuclear arms, and agreed that this problem should  be resolved through dialogue. This is the first time Japanese  and Russian defense officials have shared a common view on the  North Korean issue.    Sato also suggested a visit to Moscow by Naoaki Murata,  director general of the DA Defense Policy Bureau, in 1994.  Lukyanov agreed in principle. Exchanges between the two  countries on defense matters started two years ago at the  councilor level. [If Murata's visit materializes,] this will be  the first exchange at the bureau director general level.</p>

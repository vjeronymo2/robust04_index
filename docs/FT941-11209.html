			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A worrying shift in employment patterns Sir, If Samuel Brittan were to examine the employment rather than the unemployment figures he might feel less sanguine about recovery ('Evidence for a real recovery at last', January 31). Employment began to rise in March 1993. The latest figures (Department of Employment Gazette, January 1994) show that between March and September last year employment rose by 94,000. This was made up of a rise of 76,000 part-time male jobs and 114,000 part-time female jobs and a fall of 87,000 full-time male jobs and 9,000 full-time female jobs. The net result (apart from a further shift from male to female employment) was a fall of 96,000 full-time jobs and a rise of 190,000 part-time jobs. Part-timers work on average 15.2 hours per week. Even if two part-time jobs were equivalent to one full-time job there would still be a deficit of 1,000 jobs over the period. Many part-time jobs pay less than the National Insurance threshold, forcing families into dependence on means-tested benefits, and increasing the fiscal problems caused by a growing social security bill and a smaller tax-paying workforce. Only 40.5 per cent of households in the UK have a head of household in full-time work, compared with 49 per cent in 1981-82. In the north-west in the first six months of 1993 we lost a further 4 per cent of our manufacturing jobs, and since then a number of leading employers (such as British Aerospace and Ferranti) have announced significant job losses. Surveys of manufacturers' order books and output do not count all those who have gone out of business since the previous survey. The apparently inexorable shifts from manufacturing to service sectors, from male to female and from full-time to part-time employment ought to be raising serious worries not only about the economy but about the future of society as a whole.

Electronic devices have already replaced the traditional  barbed wire in many countries. Estonia also intends to protect  itself in this way. Italy, Sweden, France, and Israel have  offered it their electronic systems. The government discussed  these offers together with the conclusions of experts. As Prime  Minister Mart Laar announced at a press conference, the only  scheme for guarding the land border which deserved any attention  was the one Israel had put forward. It is with Israel that  negotiations will be held.    According to the prime minister, electronic equipment will  be  set up along the full length of the border for a certain time.  But the border with Latvia will in the future become  unprotected. All equipment from it will be transferred to the  Estonian-Russian border.    Israel has also concluded a contract to supply Estonia with  arms worth $50 million on credit. There are enough of them for  the whole Estonian Army.</p>

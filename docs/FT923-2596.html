			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (5): Prepared for lift-off - Chile MINING in Chile is poised for a dramatic expansion in the mid-1990s. The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates mining companies will invest almost Dollars 5bn before the end of the decade to explore, develop, or expand projects. Chile is the world's leading copper producer, and about Dollars 4bn of this foreign investment is being channelled into new copper mines. The country has one-quarter of the world's copper reserves. Cochilco estimates new investments will raise Chile's copper production from 1.81m tonnes in 1991 (almost a quarter of the western world's output) to 2.18m tones by 1994. Some Dollars 560m in gold projects will move Chile up the ladder of the world's top 10 gold producers (with silver as an important side product). A further Dollars 405m is being invested in non-metallics, such as iodine and nitrates. More than half of Chile's copper is mined by Codelco, the state-owned Chilean Copper Corporation. But Codelco's four mines, including Chuquicamata, the world's largest, are old. Production is in decline, operating costs are rising, and the powerful Copper Workers' Union, with 19,000 members, has blocked management plans to reduce overmanning. 'The strength of the labour unions in Codelco is of genuine concern ..and a drag on the industry's development,' says Mr Heikki Solin, the chief executive of Outokumpu Copper Resources. However, he notes that new mines have been successful in dismantling restrictive labour practices. At La Escondida, Chile's newest copper mine, for example, the 850 miners are not unionised. They work four 12-hour shifts and have four days off. 'The effects on productivity are astounding, with almost double the tonnes per man-hour compared with the much older Chuquicamata mine,' Mr Solin says. Other mining executives in Chile say they have side-stepped the union issue by hiring the services of contractors. Codelco has launched an exploration drive to find new reserves. It is close to a decision on whether to develop Chuqui Norte, a large deposit close to Chuquicamata. Most of Chile's increased copper output, however, will come from private sector projects. Leading the wave of foreign investment, La Escondida, the richest copper deposit in the world, entered production in December 1990. La Escondida is owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi. To finance the Dollars 900m venture, La Escondida sold 77 per cent of its output in advance in 12-year contracts to smelters in Japan, Germany and Finland. The giant project in the Atacama desert was completed six months ahead of schedule. Mr John Hannah, La Escondida's president, says this is a tribute to the organisation and engineering skills of Chilean contractors. La Escondida is gearing up to full capacity this year. It will produce the equivalent of 320,000 tonnes of copper (four per cent of world output) in the form of concentrates (a semi-refined product) at its turquoise blue concentrator plant in the Atacama desert. The concentrates are slurried down a pipeline to its own port facilities at Coloso, south of Antofagasta. La Escondida's production makes it the second biggest copper operation in the world. In February, Mr Hannah announced that La Escondida would step up production by a further 80,000 tonnes - the output of a medium-sized mine - by 1994. It is testing a method to process the extra tonnage into pure copper cathodes using a new electrolytic technique that does not require smelting. Exxon Minerals of the US is close to completing a Dollars 400m expansion programme at its Los Bronces copper mine that will double production to 200,000 tonnes a year. Phelps Dodge of the US, which is expanding its Ojos del Salado mine, also plans to develop a deposit known as La Candelaria, which is being dubbed as Chile's new Escondida. The company is currently searching for financial backers for the Dollars 400m-project which would produce approximately 90,000 tonnes of copper a year. Outokumpu of Finland is close to a decision on whether to develop its Zaldivar deposit, a stone's throw away from La Escondida. Zaldivar would require a Dollars 300m investment to bring into production. A similar amount is being sought by Cominco of Canada for its Quebrada Blanca deposit. Finally, Royal Dutch/Shell, Falconbridge and Chevron are exploring the Collahuasi deposit close to the Bolivian border. The wealth of mining projects, concentrated mainly in Chile's desert north, is putting a strain on the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Finding water in the driest desert in the world is as much a priority as striking a rich mineral deposit. Electricity is also in short supply. Port facilities are deficient. La Escondida chose to build its own, rather than compete with Codelco for Antofagasta's overstretched docks. Phelps Dodge, which would ship La Candelaria's concentrates from the small port of Caldera, is encountering opposition from local fishermen. Another frequent complaint of foreign mining companies concerns the significant litigation costs incurred in defending property rights. 'There are many savvy Chileans who have become millionaires by slapping property claims on prospected sites,' says one executive in Santiago. These concerns found their way on to a report to the US Congress on American trade and investment in Chile. In the report, one US company said it had abandoned its mining projects in Chile after spending Dollars 1.5m in legal fees to defend its property claim. The company said 37 rival concession claims were stacked against its claim on the basis of a typographical error in its paperwork. The Mining Ministry acknowledges that over-staking is a problem. It says it is trying to improve its record keeping for property claims and simplify the paper-work.  -------------------------------------------------------         CHILE'S NON-FERROUS METAL PRODUCTION  -------------------------------------------------------                               1990          1991 Metal mining (t) Copper - total           1,616,261     1,855,182    of which CODELCO      1,195,374     1,125,478              Others        420,887       729,704 Molybdenum                  13,830        14,434 Precious metals (kg) Gold                        27,503        28,677 Silver                     654,603       673,657 Complex sulphides (t) Lead                         1,120         1,050 Zinc                        25,056        30,998  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Mining Annual Review 1992  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Compaq plans Dollars 20m expansion in Texas Compaq Computer plans to spend Dollars 20m expanding its manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas. It is adding seven new production lines for desktop and portable personal computers to increase production capacity by 41 per cent. The move reflects rapid growth in PC demand and Compaq's rising market share. The US expansion follows the recent announcement that Compaq plans to broaden its manufacturing operation in Erskine, Scotland, with a Dollars 10.5m expansion. Last year Compaq also opened a new plant in Shenzhen, China. The company is shortly expected to announce expansion of its production facilities in Singapore. The Houston expansion marks the return of portable personal computer production to the US for the first time in two years. In 1991, the US government imposed trade sanctions on Japanese active matrix flat panel displays, used in notebook computers. As a result, Compaq and other US manufacturers shifted manufacturing off-shore to avoid prohibitive 63 per cent dumping duties. Last March, the US government lifted the sanction, enabling Compaq to produce portable PCs in the US cost effectively. However, Compaq officials said their decision to expand US production was based largely on productivity improvements and cost reductions at the Houston plant. The company has doubled its production per square foot in the past two years. IBM France, the French unit of International Business Machines, expects stable turnover in 1994, compared to 1993, Reuter reports from Paris. Exports continued to suffer from a price war which was undermining a rise in demand, said the company. Turnover fell 15.7 per cent in 1993 to FFr30.9bn (Dollars 5.3bn).</p>

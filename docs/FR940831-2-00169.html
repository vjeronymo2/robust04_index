Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation, and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington DC area. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Data Collection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OPM, or its representatives, conducts annual Price Surveys to determine living cost differences. Local governments, retail outlets, realty firms, and businesses providing professional and other services to be surveyed are identified through the use of full-scale Background Surveys, conducted approximately once every five years. Participation in the Price Surveys is voluntary. Data are collected by telephone and/or personal interview.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wherever practical and appropriate, the price of each good or service is obtained from at least three outlets in each allowance area and at least six outlets in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, DC, area). Realty data may be obtained from one or multiple sources, as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Release of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The price data collected from participating firms may be made available to Congress or to the general public upon request. This includes the name of the company and prices of items or services surveyed. The names of proprietors, managers, or other individuals who provide price information generally will not be made public. However, the Government may release the names of individuals who, on the basis of their expertise, provide opinions or estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Public Burden Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Public burden reporting for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 1 to 20 minutes per response.

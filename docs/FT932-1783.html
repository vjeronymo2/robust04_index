			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: US court upholds cigarette decision THE Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the US, has affirmed a lower court decision which threw out a Dollars 148.8m jury award against Brown &amp; Williamson, the US-based cigarette manufacturer and a subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries. The decision came after almost a decade of legal wrangling. The case against B&amp;W was brought by Liggett Group, a rival US tobacco company and now called Brooke Group, and centred on anti-trust issues. Brooke claimed that B&amp;W has used 'predatory' pricing to limit Brooke's ability to compete in the burgeoning market for low-priced 'generic' cigarettes. Brooke had introduced some ultra-cheap cigarettes, sold in plain black and white packaging, and was successfully wooing smokers from other brands. B&amp;W retaliated with its own generic brand, and offered wholesalers bigger volume-based rebates than its smaller competitor. Brooke sued, and in 1990 a jury in North Carolina awarded Brooke just under Dollars 50m. Damages, in US anti-trust cases, are automatically tripled. However, a federal appeal court in Richmond, Virginia, sided with B&amp;W, and the Supreme Court, by a six-to-three vote, has affirmed that ruling. B&amp;W said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the Supreme Court ruling, and was 'delighted to finally have this lengthy case concluded'. The suit was first filed by Liggett/Brooke in 1984.</p>

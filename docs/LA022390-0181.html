			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MAN ADMITS SEEKING ELLIS BRIBE  </P> <P> A Seattle man pleaded guilty of attempting to extort money from the lawyer of  Seattle SuperSonics guard Dale Ellis.  </P> <P> "I attempted to get money from an attorney in exchange for giving favorable  trial testimony on behalf of his client," wrote Guy Thomas, 24, in his plea  agreement Thursday.  </P> <P> Thomas, a nightclub bouncer here, entered the plea to the crime of "bribe  receiving by a witness" before King County Superior Court Judge J. Kathleen  Learned.  </P> <P> The crime stems from Ellis' pending case on drunken and reckless-driving  charges. A hearing has been set for March 20 in Seattle District Court. He has  pleaded innocent to the charges.  </P> <P> Ellis is still recuperating from injuries he received Jan. 12 when the car he  was driving was involved in a single-car accident on a northbound on-ramp to  Interstate 5. He suffered a collapsed lung and three broken ribs.  </P></p>

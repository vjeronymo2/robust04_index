			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT;  </P> <P> ASSOCIATE CURATOR GETS A WARM WELCOME  </P> <P> The Scene  </P> <P> Get-together for members of the California Century Club, a support group for  the Newport Harbor Art Museum, in the Big Canyon home of Dorothea and Peter  Perrin. The C.C. Club -- "C cubed," its members call it -- consists of 100  couples who pay $500-per-couple yearly dues to finance the museum's "New  California Artist" exhibitions. The Wednesday night klatch served as the  group's "official introduction" to Lucinda Barnes, Newport Harbor's new  associate curator and the person responsible for selecting new California  artists for the exhibition series. For a couple of after-dinner hours, the 50  cubies shared wine and snacks and art talk with Barnes in the officially  unpretentious manner of the group.  </P> <P> Touring  </P> <P> Peter Perrin somewhat reluctantly sort of pointed out a few of the artworks  adorning the walls of his gigantic brand-new home. ("We're not really  collectors," he repeatedly demurred.) Like the huge oil by Christopher Brown  that dominates one wall in the living room. And the sculpture by fellow  Canadian Sorel Troge (a friend, said transplanted Canadian Perrin, who's lived  in Orange County for nine years). Troge's stark figure stands in its own  lighted alcove just to the left of the front door. "Looks like we built the  house for it, doesn't it?" Perrin asked.  </P> <P> Comments  </P> <P> Terri Coons and Doreen Alstrom studied the painting hanging above the Perrins'  fireplace. "The fact is," said Alstrom, "I think most people would put a bigger  (painting) in that space; they would try to fill the space, but everything is  enhanced this way -- it adds drama, it creates an architectural feel. . . ."  Nearby Larry and Leonora Treglia chatted with Doreen's husband, John Alstrom.  "We have a modest collection," said Treglia, then putting his arm around his  wife: "It's kept modest by a certain conservative member of the family. . . ."  In the dining room, munching homemade hors d'oeuvres and desserts, new club  member Jerry Werksman said he was only "moderately" fond of contemporary art,  but he joined the museum group "because they have this combination of  enthusiasm and sophistication that makes things happen."  </P> <P> Speaker in the House  </P> <P> Barnes showed up shortly before her very informal ("rambling thoughts") speech,  grabbed a bite and a club soda, and mingled hither and yon. "My role with this  group is to lead them through the process of looking at contemporary art,"  Barnes said before she addressed the group. As leader, she'll take them  day-tripping to artists' studios, art galleries and museums, and several times  a year guide longer jaunts to artistic points of interest in San Francisco and  other California destinations. Barnes said the annual $50,000 the club gives  the museum represents more than half of her budget for the "New California  Artist" series.  </P> <P> Also Seen  </P> <P> C Cubed founders Judy and Joel Slutzky and Bobbi and Jerry Dauderman. Mary and  John Carrington. Randy Sue Morrison and Bob Baird. Candice and Roger Schnapp.  Molly and Leon Lyon. Linda and Jay Young.  </P> <P> Quote  </P> <P> "You want to know the scam?" said John Carrington, an art collector's glint in  his eye. "We support these young emerging artists, but we know they're emerging  before you!" PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

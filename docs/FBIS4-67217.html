			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bent Bak Andersen, Linda Bang Jessen, Bent </F> Sorensen: "Kingpin Dried Fish in Gambia"]    [Text] Main Suspect: One of the people taken into custody  in the hashish case from Helnas Bay has run a dried fish  business in Gambia for many years.    One of the alleged key figures in the hashish case, the  49-year-old TJ has since 1990 been running the company Tarco Co.  Ltd., which is registered in Banjul in Gambia. In the village of  Tanjae on the West African coast the Dane has build up a  business of preparing, drying, and exporting fish, which both he  and local fishermen had caught in the ocean outside of Gambia.    "TJ has been particularly popular among African fishermen  because he got many things started and furnished local  employment at his fish-drying business on the coast," we were  told by the shipping agent Steen Hedemann who lives in Gambia  where he received the news yesterday concerning the arrest of TJ  in connection with the biggest hashish case in Denmark.    "I have helped TJ by keeping an eye on his operation when he  was out fishing or at home with his family in Denmark, and I  find it totally surprising that he has been arrested for  smuggling hashish. He is not that type at all," Torben Hedemann  says, having no idea as to what kind of people TJ has been in  contact with in Denmark. "If he really is involved in this, he  has either been enticed into it or pressured. His business in  Gambia could not finance such a large investment.''    ``Many Danish sailors have been down here to help TJ with  the  fishing part of the business while he built up the project on  land. It is my impression that these were people he knew from  his time as a fisherman in Denmark.''    About six months ago, TJ got the idea of investing in a  coastal vessel, and on 1 November he took over the Hela through  his company Tarco Co. Ltd. from a captain from Bornholm for  1,050 million Danish kroner [as published].  <H5>  Large Market for Coastal Vessels </H5>   "There is a large market for small coastal vessels here  where  there is money to be made by carrying goods between the cities  along the coast. The Hela has had many trips up and down the  coast," Hedemann says.    The coastal vessel was built in 1952 in Lubeck where she was  launched with the name of Stellaria, but the ship was registered  with Svenska Lloyd under the name Salome. In connection with the  purchase in November the Hela's Danish flag was exchanged for a  flag of convenience from the Latin American nation of Belize.</p>

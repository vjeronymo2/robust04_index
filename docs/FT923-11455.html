			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Empty seats at summit in Madrid LEADERS of Spain, Portugal and 17 Latin American countries started a four-day summit in Madrid yesterday, amid concern about crises facing several governments in the region. Absent yesterday from the opening session of the Ibero-American summit were President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, embroiled in a crisis after the jail escape of drug baron Mr Pablo Escobar; President Alberto Fujimori of Peru, facing a guerrilla bombing campaign in Lima; and President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, his country's senate refusing to let him travel because of a national political crisis. Also absent was President Mario Soares of Portugal, reported to be ill. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, last night pointedly expressed regret over the non-appearance of Mr Gaviria and Mr Perez, but did not mention Mr Fujimori. The occasion is being used to confirm inter-governmental commercial accords. Mr Gonzalez and President Fernando Collor of Brazil yesterday signed an accord envisaging the extension of up to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.58bn) in Spanish credits and investments over the next five years. The accord includes up to Dollars 500m of credits to finance Spanish exports to Brazil, and measures such as renegotiation of their double-tax treaty to boost foreign investment and joint ventures. The arrival of President Fidel Castro of Cuba was marked by demonstrations for and against his government. Editorial comment, page 18; Observer, page 19.</p>

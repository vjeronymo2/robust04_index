The safety zone will cover the area of Sippican Harbor along the Silver Shell Beach shoreline out to 400 yards east of the shoreline. The safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard these vessels from injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is effective between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 4, 1994.

Due to the date when this office received the application, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the fireworks display is for public viewing and is intended to celebrate the 4th of July holiday weekend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 4, 1994, the town of Marion, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Fourth of July Fireworks display between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. The fireworks will be launched from a site on Silver Shell Beach and will project onto the waters of Sippican Harbor. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area of Sippican Harbor over which the fireworks will be launched. The Coast Guard will establish this safety zone from the shoreline of Silver Shell Beach (north end of safety zone is buoy C ``7'' and runs south to Spragues Cove), extending eastward 400 yards into Sippican Harbor, between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 4, 1994. In the event of inclement weather, the rain date will be July 5, 1994 at the same times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for two hours on one day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 400 yards from the shoreline, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

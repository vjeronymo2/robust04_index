			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is a complete absence of information in  Akhalkalaki and Ninotsminda Rayons [south Georgia] due to lack  of electricity. Information about current processes taking  place in the republic reach the population in a biased form.  The area is populated by non-Georgians. Not a single tonne of  coal, fuel, or firewood has reached the population of the  Javakheti region for a year, which is known for a severe  climate. Neither are they getting gas. In addition, highways  leading to most of the villages have been cut off due to heavy  snow.</p>

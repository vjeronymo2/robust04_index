			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T PAYING $191.8 MILLION TO RAISE SUN MICRO SHARE TO 14.7%  </P> <P> Sun Microsystems Inc. said Friday that it has agreed to sell about 4.6 million  shares of common stock to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for $191.8  million.  </P> <P> The sale, when completed, will boost the amount of Sun stock that AT&amp;T has  acquired directly from the Mountain View-based computer company to 14.7%.  </P> <P> New York-based AT&amp;T had previously bought about 11% of Sun's stock directly  from the company, Sun officials said.  </P> <P> Under a 1988 agreement, Sun can sell newly created shares to AT&amp;T  representing up to 15% of its total shares outstanding.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, AT&amp;T is also permitted to buy up to an additional 5%  of Sun's common stock in the open market by January, 1991. That would bring its  interest in Sun to 20%.  </P> <P> Sun officials said AT&amp;T had bought additional Sun shares in open market  purchases. But they did not have an estimate as to how much.  </P> <P> Sun's stock closed up 25 cents to $30.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T officials were not immediately available for comment.  </P></p>

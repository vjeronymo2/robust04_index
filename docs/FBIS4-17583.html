			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Russia needs to create a  general informational defence system, according to Deputy  Secretary of the Russian Security Council Vladimir Rubanov. He  stressed to ITAR-TASS that computer crimes themselves are  capable of causing as much monetary damage as all the art thefts  in the entire world. The most danger is represented by attempts  to penetrate the networks controlling energy systems, the  production of dangerous substances, and the use and control of  troops and weapons, Rubanov said.    Some of the state's top-priority tasks in the information  security field concern the defence of personal informational  rights and intellectual property, the official said. Special  attention should be paid to preventing the distortion,  concealment, and destruction of information. Leaks of  information representing state secrets must likewise not be  tolerated. Adherence to such guidelines is designed to ensure  information security in the political, economic, military, and  other essential spheres of Russia's activity, Rubanov explained.    Important steps towards the defence of security contained in  and transmitted by computers will be personal access devices  which identify the user of a computer and the quick-acting  algorythyms in the cryptographic programme "electronic  signature". If these defence measures are not taken advantage  of, computer crimes could block the work of Russia's banking  systems, as exemplified by the recent attempt to steal 68  billion roubles through the Russian Central Bank's computer  system.    The Russian Federation's conception of information security,  which was examined by the Security Council Inter-Departmental  Commission on Monday, should be considered an integral part of  the country's system of national security, Rubanov declared.</p>

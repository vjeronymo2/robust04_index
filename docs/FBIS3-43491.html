Our correspondent reports that 200 kg  of rice and a few tins of cooking oil were distributed to the  soldiers today. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, UN Captain  Rudolfo Dulce says a truck with food supplies for 1,000 men was  scheduled to arrive at Namialo this evening. The food will last  30 days, but the soldiers have complained about the quality of  meals served at the assembly point. [passage omitted]    In Cabo Delgado, 1,207 government soldiers had already been  accommodated at the Montepuez Assembly Point by 3 January,  despite logistical problems like a lack of food, household  utensils, water, and medicines. [passage omitted]    In a press release, the provincial government's  representative at the Cabo Delgado branch of the Supervision and  Control Commission says it is extremely worried about continued  violations of the peace accord by the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo]. The press release says Renamo has not yet  sent its guerrillas to assembly points, and that armed members  of that organization are moving in most districts of Cabo  Delgado. The document adds that in Montepuez District on 22  December, Renamo elements arrested the president of the (Napapo)  village, allegedly because he was carrying a firearm. He was  released two days later. Renamo is also accused of having  deployed armed men in the (Napala) village of Chiure District.  The presence of Renamo members from various bases, including  the Maringue headquarters have been reported in Pemba.    In Niassa Province, Renamo says the peace accord is being  battered. Renamo Foreign Relations chief Jose de Castro said in  Lichinga today that many aspects of the accord are not being  fulfilled, notably Protocols 3 and 4 which deal with logistics.  He said the government is not adhering to the protocols.  Castro said Renamo delegates have no houses in various  provinces, and that the government's repressive apparatus is  being used to intimidate the people. Castro said many people  fear joining Renamo because the government prevents them from  doing so, although 100 per cent of the country's population  favors his movement. He said the people have grown tired of  Frelimo and want a change.    [Begin Castro recording] In Mavago and other assembly points  our forces are facing hardships because of logistical problems.  The peace accord is not being applied evenly. Our troops have  not been defeated or amnestied, but have actually won the war  against several foreign armies and the Frelimo army. The  government should take that into account and review the  logistical situation in Mavago. [end recording]    Jose de Castro arrived in Lichinga today to deal with the  appointment of Renamo representatives to the electoral  commissions.</p>

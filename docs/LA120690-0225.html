			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MANY FACES AND STYLES OF SANTA CLAUS  </P> <P> In 1963, La Habra Heights resident Claire Spothelfer received her first Santa  Claus. It was a little German doll given to her by her husband's aunt in the  early years of the Spothelfer marriage.  </P> <P> Little did Spothelfer know that what started with the German Santa would grow  to become a collection of approximately 500 Santas from all over the world.  </P> <P> "It just sort of grew like Topsy," Spothelfer said. "People started giving me  Santas for gifts and one thing led to another."  </P> <P> Spothelfer has Santas of wood, Santas of fabric, musical and ceramic Santas --  more Santas than she could possibly display in her home.  </P> <P> Her personal favorites are a small cloisonne Santa made in China and given to  her by a dear friend. The other, she said, is a dime store Santa Claus with a  music box that she gave to her daughter when she was 5 months old and  celebrating her first Christmas. The daughter is now 27.  </P> <P> Spothelfer's collection is on display through Dec. 16 at the Whittier Museum,  6755 S. Newlin Ave. Hours are 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, and 9 a.m. to 3  p.m. Tuesday through Friday by appointment only. For appointments, call  945-3871.  </P></p>

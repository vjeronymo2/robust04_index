The paving of the main runway at Bangda Airport was basically  completed. We have fulfilled our annual plans for improving the  Sichuan-Tibet, Qinghai-Tibet, China-Nepal, and Ze-Gong Highways.  The (Zhamu)-Medog Highway has been preliminarily opened to  traffic. The Chalong power station at Yanghu overfulfilled its  annual construction plan. Breakthrough progress was made in  deep geothermal prospecting north of Yangbajing.    With the construction of telecommunications projects  accelerating, the telephone service in seven prefectures,  cities, and towns has become program-controlled. We have  basically completed the earth and stone construction projects  and the equipment installation for 61 satellite communications  ground receiving stations. The satellite communications ground  receiving stations and program-controlled telephone service have  entered the stage of trial operations in seven prefectures and  cities and 35 counties.    The report points out: The autonomous region's total  import-export trade volume exceeded $100 million, a 60-percent  increase over the previous year. In 1993, we received 23,000  tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries,  and earned $9 million in foreign exchange from tourism. In  1993, the autonomous region officially approved 41 projects to  introduce investment from abroad and to establish same-level  ties at home, with contracts involving the use of external  capital of 67.1 million yuan and $9.63 million. In addition,  the autonomous region set up 129 enterprises in coastal and  other provinces and regions of our country. Last year, 855 new  state-owned and collectively owned enterprises were established  in Tibet, with a total registered capital of 830 million yuan;  and 46 new private enterprises were set up, with a total  registered capital of 7.31 million yuan.

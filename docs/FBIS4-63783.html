			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian  Union has become the subject of unfair political discussions,  his spokesman Nurlan Danenov said.    In a statement in Alma-Ata [Almaty], he accused some of the  media of trying to capitalize on differing approaches to the  concept by CIS leaders by driving a wedge between them.    "I do not think they will succeed, but they may certainly  create a nasty background for some time. No doubt, this plays  into someone's hands", the spokesman said.    Danenov expressed surprise at media reports saying  Nazarbayev  had already taken the idea off the agenda.    He said "since it has never been put forward for formal  discussions, the idea cannot be taken of the agenda." The  spokesman ceded that there could be a mixed response to the  concept both in and outside the Republic.    Danenov mentioned that the emergence of the Eurasian Union  concept followed the unsatisfactory state of affairs within the  Commonwealth. He said that many had overlooked the possibility  of forming a union by more promising CIS member states as a  strategic line at promoting more productive links between other  republics of the former Soviet Union. "But there could be no  question of reinstating the former Soviet Union or some kind of  a confederation," the spokesman said.    Nazarbayev does not believe that the CIS had run out of its  potential as the instrument for a civilized parting of ways  after the break up of the Soviet empire, he said.    Danenov pointed to the significance of a three-nation  agreement (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan) to set up a  common economic area describing it as a new stage in CIS  economic cooperation. He said the treaty which was open for  other states to join "has laid down the cornerstone of a new and  more effective entity within the Commonwealth." The spokesman  went on to say that the three Central Asian presidents at last  month's meeting on the shores of the Issyk Kul Lake had stressed  the need for further searches of new forms and shapes of CIS  cooperation.    IF Note: Nazarbayev and his Uzbek and Kyrgyz counterparts  Islam Karimov and Askar Akayev are said to have agreed not to  raise the question of a Eurasian Union focusing on greater  cooperation between their countries instead. Unlike Akayev who  threw weight behind the EAU [Eurasian Union] idea, Karimov made  it clear on several occasions that he was sceptical about it.  However, all of them agreed that the latest tripartite  agreement was a new stage in the promotion of CIS cooperation.    Both Karimov and Nazarbayev reiterated this during the  opening of Kazakh Days in Tashkent. They said the three-nation  deal would be to the benefit of their economies as it opened up  unlimited opportunities for cooperation between entrepreneurs  and direct contacts between plants and industrial sectors.  Nazarbayev said the idea of lifting all trade barriers between  CIS states had first emerged during his talks with President  Karimov in Tashkent in January. The Kazakh leader stressed that  other CIS states could benefit from the experience the two  countries had gained since.</p>

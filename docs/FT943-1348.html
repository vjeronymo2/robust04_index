			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Growth accelerates At first glance yesterday's second quarter UK growth figures suggest consumers have been literally tightening their belts since April's tax rises. Spending on food fell a striking 2.6 per cent during the quarter. The usual worries over seasonal adjustment, however, mean such data must be taken with a pinch of salt. The data may also again understate the savings rate, but the broad message is clear. Thanks not least to a robust export performance, the economy is growing at a vigorous clip and, despite a fall in real disposable income, individuals seem willing to reduce their net saving to finance consumption. The question is whether this increased propensity to borrow reflects a lasting improvement in confidence. Perhaps tax increases have taken cash out of consumers' hands before they have had time to adjust their spending habits. If so, private consumption may soon decelerate markedly, especially now that base rates have risen. Despite yesterday's strong figures the authorities have grounds to wait a while before considering another increase. Clearly, though, the overall rate of growth will remain decisive. Even if consumer demand is not overheating, export-led growth still means the output gap is closing. Capacity use is tightening and manufacturers have a greater inclination to pass on cost increases. The authorities would almost certainly prefer growth closer to 3 per cent. Easing it back to that level without trampling on consumer confidence in the process will be a delicate task.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F> 94]    [Text] The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada's (parliament)  resolution, which enacted the State Budget for 1994, provides  for its quarterly revision.    Nonetheless, neither the parliament, nor its Committee for  planning, budgeting, financing and pricing have stirred a finger  to bring the issue under deliberations.    As Andrei Pecherov, chairman of the said committee,  explained  in an interview to UKRINFORM's correspondent, the interfering  parliamentary elections are to blame. With the freshly elected  parliament yet to convene its maiden plenary session the State  Budget's performance in the first quarter, and hence, its  correction, are highly improbable to ever occur.    It may be noted that the State Budget's miraculous  deficit-free nature was very skeptically and reluctantly  accepted by the MP's. Alas, it is precisely on what  international financial institutions insist. In view of this,  in the process of drafting the State Budget's deficit was  gradually reduced to nil.</p>

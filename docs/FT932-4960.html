			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Patten threat to change law on school tests MR JOHN PATTEN yesterday threatened to legislate if necessary to ensure that next year's national curriculum tests in secondary schools in England and Wales go ahead. Speaking as this year's tests - which are expected to be widely disrupted - are due to start, the education secretary indicated that he would consider changing the law if this year's experience was unsatisfactory. Mr Patten said that nothing was ruled in and nothing ruled out to make sure that next year's tests took place. School governors had a 'statutory duty' to see that this year's tests were taken, he added. The tests, which have sparked a long confrontation between the government and the teachers' unions, are due to start today. The three biggest unions predict a firm boycott. This leaves members of the small Professional Association of Teachers alone in implementing the tests. The PAT's constitution forbids industrial action. Speaking on BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Patten announced that he would begin a process of publishing the controversial test papers for 14-year-olds as soon as the exams had been taken. People would look at the papers and 'wonder what all the fuss was about', Mr Patten predicted - parents would be 'rather worried' that their children were not being asked to take them. Mr Patten said he sympathised with teachers about the level of bureaucracy that had sprung up in recent years, but argued that the actual papers being sat were 'very straightforward and very practical'. He said: 'I don't think we should ever have industrial action in our classrooms.' It would be a 'tragedy' if - as expected - only 10 per cent of schools carried out the tests. Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, which was the first to announce a tests boycott, said: 'I would be surprised if more than a handful of schools end up doing them. I can't imagine that the details will tell Mr Patten anything other than that this year's tests have been a disaster.' The National Union of Teachers, the UK's biggest teachers' union, predicted that parts of the tests might be used for schools' own purposes, 'but certainly not for the government's purposes'. The issue of legislation against industrial action first arose earlier this year when a leaked letter to Mr Patten from Mrs Gillian Shephard, then employment secretary, suggested that the government was preparing to amend the Employment Bill to outlaw industrial action which would flout the will of parliament.</p>

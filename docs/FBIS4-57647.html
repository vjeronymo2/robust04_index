			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Nicolae Vacariou held a working  luncheon with Chamber of Commerce entrepreneurs at the Guarani  Hotel. He talked about the Romanian economic opening, adding  that the country has chosen to liberalize its trade and prices,  and to offer its industrial production abroad.    Vacariou said that following the consolidation of its  democracy, Romania is currently experiencing political and  macroeconomic stability which has allowed it to join the  international community. "Our basic concern now is to maintain a  low inflation rate and to continue to privatize state  companies," Vacariou said.    The Romanian official said that during the past four years,  more than 380,000 new companies were created with private  capital, adding that 70,000 of them are foreign owned. Vacariou  said the transfer of public companies to private hands requires  a complex process that must be examined carefully in order to  obtain positive results.    He stressed that Romanian industry is evolving positively,  which permits it to sell its products abroad. Among the areas  with the largest potential are the metallurgical industry and  the manufacture of agricultural and oil exploration and  exploitation machinery. "This permits Romanian businessmen to  look for ways to cooperate with their Paraguayan partners,"  Vacariou said. The prime minister hopes both countries will  consolidate stronger relations, not just in the commercial area,  but also in the area of mutual cooperation.    President Juan Carlos Wasmosy decorated the Romanian prime  minister with the National Order of Merit in the degree of Grand  Special Cross at Government Palace. On the occasion, Wasmosy  advocated strengthening relations between Romania and Paraguay  through solid trade and mutual support.</p>

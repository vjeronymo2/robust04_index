			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS STRENGTHENING OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM  </P> <P> A special committee of the state Board of Education on Thursday endorsed a new  policy that scientists and educators hope will lead to more forthright  classroom instruction about evolution and other politically sensitive  scientific material.  </P> <P> Christian fundamentalists had lobbied against the policy, saying it could cut  off their ability to present a creationist view of human development in science  courses.  </P> <P> The controversy now moves to the full state board, which, after postponing  action for months, is scheduled to make a decision next week.  </P> <P> Both sides say this latest in a long series of clashes between creationists and  scientists could have far-reaching implications for how science will be taught  in the state's classrooms.  </P> <P> And because the lucrative California textbook market is a driving force in the  industry, the outcome of the debate is likely to influence how science texts  across the country will address controversial material. If adopted by the full  board, the policy will guide the board in its selection of science textbooks to  be used in state elementary and middle schools through much of the next decade.  </P> <P> Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said the proposed revision in science  teaching policy is part of a "nationwide effort to strengthen the quality of  instruction" and improve the accuracy of textbooks that now deal confusingly or  not at all with sensitive scientific subjects.  </P> <P> The current dispute centers on revisions proposed by panels of scientists and  educators to a long-standing board "anti-dogmatism" policy on science teaching.  That policy, adopted in 1972 after an earlier battle mounted by creationists,  calls for "conditional" language to be used in discussions on origins of life  and the Earth.  </P> <P> The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Orange County-based Traditional Values  Coalition, said the anti-dogmatism policy is "one of the good things" about  state education policy because it opens "a small window" of opportunity for  creationists to get their views into science classrooms.  </P> <P> But many educators and scientists believe the policy is confusing and has led  to a watering-down of the science curriculum. Scientists point out that,  despite a state board effort to improve textbooks three years ago, some widely  used books still avoid using the word "evolution," substituting less familiar  and less precise terms such as "organic change." Critics also note that some  widely accepted and tested scientific theories are misleadingly qualified with  phrases such as "some scientists believe."  </P> <P> " 'Some believe' is a wording that is unknown in science," said Kevin Padian, a  UC Berkeley professor of paleontology and member of the state Board of  Education's science curriculum committee. "(It) suggests that it is like a  vote. . . . (But) science is not a matter of beliefs, it is a matter of  evidence."  </P> <P> Honig and other advocates of the new policy say that the ambiguity of the  existing policy and the vague treatment evolution receives in textbooks has  caused some teachers to avoid dealing with evolution altogether. In other  cases, some science teachers are using the policy as a rationale for presenting  creationism on an equal footing with evolution.  </P> <P> Under the new policy, instruction about scientific theories, such as evolution,  would be clearly distinguished and segregated from instruction about beliefs,  such as religious views of creation. Only science should be taught in science  classes, the policy says. Discussions of competing philosophies, religious  beliefs and moral values should be dealt with in social studies courses, it  says.  </P> <P> Many mainstream Christian churches support that view and have had no major  problem reconciling scientific theory about evolution with biblical teachings.  The Catholic church, for example, in its schools has long taught evolution in  its science classes and Bible studies in its religion classes. "The Bible is  trying to define the relation between us and God, not . . . how things are  related to one another, as science attempts to do," said Father John Wright, a  professor of systematic theology at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley.  </P> <P> Sheldon, who said his Traditional Values Coalition represents thousands of  churches, said his group has lobbied and written letters to board members. He  said after Thursday's session that the latest draft of the policy is improved,  but his group still will push for language that permits alternative theories to  evolution to be presented in the science classroom.  </P> <P> The most common alternative is "creation science," a theory constructed by  fundamentalists in recent years to rival evolution. Its principal premises,  that the Earth may be only a few thousand years old and that man was created in  his present form, have not been accepted by any major scientific organizations.  </P> <P> Board member James Robinson, who said he had received hundreds of letters from  both supporters and opponents of the policy, cited the controversy and argued  Thursday that the 1972 anti-dogmatism policy should be left intact.  </P> <P> But other board members supported the view of Honig and others that the policy  is confusing and is not providing teachers and textbook publishers the support  and guidance they need.  </P></p>

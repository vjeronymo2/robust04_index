			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of </F> Institute of the United States and Canada of the Russian Academy  of Sciences: "Something Out of Nothing? On the Results of the  Moscow Meeting of the American and Russian Presidents"]    [Text] High-level meetings rarely take place without  results. The immense diplomatic mechanism works on preparing for  them and it must prepare at least something for the leaders of  the countries to sign. Thus the latest Russian-American summit  meeting ended with the signing of 12 agreements, which the  propaganda organs of the two countries announced with a great  deal of ceremony.    To say that the meeting was meaningless would be a great  exaggeration. Among its results was the signing of the  Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on the elimination of  nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. For quite understandable  reasons, this agreement is of extremely special significance,  although the fact that it was signed by three and not two  participants (just Russia and Ukraine) is an immense minus for  Russian diplomacy. The agreement could quite easily have been  reached without the United States, the more so since, as it  turns out, Russia will still have to pay for it--by delivering  energy sources to Ukraine free of charge. And the United States,  as usual, added to its assets an unconditional success while  getting off with vague promises.    As for other results of the meeting between Yeltsin and  Clinton, one can hardly classify them as paramount. The United  States made the greatest concessions to Russia in questions of  trade and the confirmation of human rights as a permanent value.    As we know, the Russian economy is certainly not now in a  condition where the warehouses are crammed with finished  products and the store shelves are groaning under the excess of  domestic goods. If that were the case, one could understand and  appreciate the official optimism: Really, Russian goods are  finally breaking through, like the Japanese, to the American  market. But that, alas, will not happen. And the fact that the  economic agreement that was reached will help with the sale of  Russian uranium and aluminum in the United States by no means  evokes rapture. We know from experience that a breakthrough of  particular raw material goods or semimanufactured products from  Russia into the world market leads to making a group of  wheeler-dealers with questionable reputations and a certain  circle of high-level bureaucrats rich. Such "achievements" do  nothing for the development of the economy.    Official commentators link the joint Russian-American human  rights declaration to potential possibilities of protecting the  human rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking population in  the former Soviet republics, especially the Baltics. Perhaps  this is indeed the case. But it is fair to ask: Can it be that  the governments and parliaments of the countries where Russians  are subjected to persecution and discrimination have never heard  of human rights before? Did they not sign the documents of the  Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe regarding this?    The American President flew into Moscow with the news that  NATO, after studying the new alignment of forces in Europe, was  radically changing its strategy. At one point, at the dawn of  perestroyka and the "new thinking," there were statements in the  spirit of the need to disband military blocs and create some  kind of single system of collective security in Europe and  throughout all of the Northern Hemisphere--"from Vladivostok to  Vancouver." Then after the Warsaw Pact was disbanded these good  intentions were replaced by discussions of the "NATO's new role"  outside Europe: in the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea,  Africa. And now this new role has finally become clearcut:  "Drang nach Osten," to the East.    In order not to frighten the tender liberals and not to  confuse those in Russia who have long been asking to be taken  under NATO's wing, the new doctrine speaks incomprehensibly  about a "partnership for peace." It is in keeping with the  spirit of the times and it does not threaten anyone. But if you  remove the pretty verbal packaging, the bare military essence  remains: The NATO bloc is moving toward Russia's borders.  Elementary common sense tells us that if the "partnership for  peace" really did not have anti-Russian content we might have  expected a different scenario: First the NATO bloc would have  looked for ways of establishing a partnership with Russia, for  with all of its weakness it is still the largest military power,  and only after that would the vacuum in Central and Eastern  Europe have been filled.    When he arrived in Russia the American President probably  had  his doubts about the kind of reception he and his idea of a  "partnership" would receive. How obviously glad he was to see  that this idea did not elicit a great deal of resistance from  the Russian leadership.    Let us recall something else: NATO's position in the former  Yugoslavia and particularly its soft attitude toward Croatia,  its readiness to open up military warehouses to the Muslims in  Bosnia, and the threats of strikes on Serbian positions. The  Russian president had enough common sense to remind Clinton that  Yugoslavia is being handled by the UN and nobody invited NATO  with its role of "peacemaker." The more so with threats in the  spirit of the Cold War. Regarding this question one must think  that Russia is finally capable of taking a firm stand.    It is difficult to sum up the overall balance sheet of the  meeting that was held. Here one inevitably has to take into  account that the U.S. position has become one of the cards in  the Russian domestic political game of solitaire, and when  agreeing to this meeting with Clinton the president of Russia  somehow wanted to take advantage of his arrival to demonstrate  the strength of his foreign connections and powerful support  from the West. This he managed to do: Clinton did not favor  other political figures of Russia with his attention, nor did he  even speak before parliament.    At the same time, the impossibility of having the positions  of Russia and the United States coincide completely, which was  revealed during the course of this meeting, will lead to other  reflections. The period of Russia's "getting used to" its  neighbors on the continent and the planet is ending. There are  difficult times ahead when protection of national interests will  require changes both in the overall style of the "diplomacy of  smiles" and the content of the Russian foreign policy. It is  good that this coincides with the beginning of the work of the  new parliament, which should make a significant contribution to  the creation of such a policy.</p>

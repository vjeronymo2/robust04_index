			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as received] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- One of the main  regional integration organizations maintains that the 25 border  posts along the Central American isthmus constitute an obstacle  for free trade and movement of people and that some $42 million  needs to be invested to improve this situation.    The Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration  (SIECA) reached this conclusion in a report on the situation at  18 of the 24 border posts between the Mexican-Guatemalan border  and the Costa Rican-Panamanian border.    SIECA pointed out that the trade and transportation  obstacles  begin with the numerous bureaucratic procedures needed to cross  resulting from a paucity of human resources, infrastructure, and  guidelines, and from the lack of common schedules. For example,  the regular working day in Guatemala, which has five border  posts, begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 1630 (2230 GMT),  while the working day in El Salvador begins at 0600 (1200 GMT)  and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT).    SIECA admits that the customs offices could hardly work 24  hours a day due to the lack of security; it recommends, instead,  standardizing services and scheduling a regular working day that  begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT). The  report also suggests the complete standardization of in-transit  fees, as is the case in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and  Nicaragua. This is not the case, however, in Guatemala and  Panama because additional charges affect the competitiveness of  products.    As for the facilities, of the 18 offices visited, none is in  good condition, except the "El Guasaule" office at the  Honduran-Nicaraguan border. All of the others pose problems in  the layout out of quarters, offices, warehouses, and stores.    Some countries have already begun to channel funds to  improve  these "ports of entry." The Nicaraguan Government, for example,  is investing $14.3 million, donated by the Central American Bank  of Economic Integration, to modernize such facilities. The  Costa Rican government, meanwhile, is planning to invest some  $100,000 for the same purpose.    About 5 million people and almost 1.5 million tonnes of  merchandise go through the Central American border posts each  year, enduring the bad condition of border infrastructures. The  poor "surface" of the highways worsens this situation. Very few  stretches of road near border posts are in good condition.    The Central American Commission to Facilitate Transportation  [Comision Centroamericana de Facilitacion de Transporte --  Cocafatra] is considering the possibility of carrying out a  plan, in the mid term, to refurbish the 24 border posts so that  they can handle 10 million people and 3 million tonnes of  merchandise by the year 2000. According to preliminary  estimates, repairing the existing facilities and building new  ones will require some $42 million, 80 percent of which the  countries expect to get from international aid.    Cocafatra officials are also analyzing the creation of posts  with common facilities, which the two bordering countries will  manage and where all procedures can be accomplished. Cocafatra  is recommending that a post of this type be in operation by June  1994, but it did not disclose which two countries would  participate in this pilot project.    The existing facilities would reportedly be used in the  model  plan: one facility would house the two countries' customs  offices, and the other would house immigration. These two  offices could be combined into a single facility if a binational  body of trained officers can be formed to minimize bureaucracy.    There are five border posts in Guatemala, six in El  Salvador,  six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua, two in Costa Rica, and two  in Panama.</p>

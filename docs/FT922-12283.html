			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lower prices leave Ibstock 50% down at Pounds 10.6m FALLING prices in its key markets of bricks and paper pulp knocked 1991 profits at Ibstock Johnsen down by more than 50 per cent, writes Angus Foster. Pre-tax profits for the year fell to Pounds 10.6m. That compared with Pounds 23.6m a year ago, or Pounds 30m after restating a Pounds 6.4m restructuring charge as an exceptional rather than extraordinary item. A final dividend of 3.75p makes a same-gain uncovered total of 6p, as promised during last year's Pounds 44m rights issue. Turnover fell from Pounds 342.3m to Pounds 285.3m. In the UK, operating profits fell by 56 per cent to Pounds 9.79m as overcapacity in the brick industry forced margins down from 27 to 15 per cent. Forestry and pulprecorded an operating loss of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 8.18m profit) as pulp prices fell 18 per cent. Interest receivable increased to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 232,000) from the proceeds of the rights issue. Earnings dropped to 2.58p (5.62p). COMMENT Ibstock's decision to increase brick output by 15m by rebuilding its West Sussex plant seems odd when the market reeks of overcapacity. But the company is tempted because the south of England is the only net importer of bricks, and is betting on improving market share through transport savings. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see this year being anything but testing and by its own admission, the dividend is at risk.</p>

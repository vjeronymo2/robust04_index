			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Bob's good job If Manchester wins the Olympic Games in the year 2000, Bob Scott, the theatrical impresario, will deserve more than the standard knighthood. He has done more than any textile magnate to put the City on the map again, and he is not even a local. To help build bridges with the International Olympic Committee he has both a former British high commissioner and an erstwhile British ambassador on the Manchester team. The latter is named simply in the team's bumph as David Scott and is described as having represented Britain in 'several African countries'. Very diplomatic, since this is Sir David Scott, ambassador to South Africa in 1976-79 and Bob Scott's dad. Fortunately, South African connections are no longer an Olympic kiss of death.</p>

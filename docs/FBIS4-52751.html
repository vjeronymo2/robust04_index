			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Information and  communications experts urged drastic deregulation of the  telecommunications industry Friday [13 May], government  officials said.    Participants in a meeting of a working group on government  administrative reform which convened at the prime minister's  official residence noted the profound change in information and  communications, saying, "drastic deregulation is necessary, not  administrative measures in small dollops," the officials said.  The telecom industry is hampered by existing regulations from  freely taking the initiative in business, they said.    They criticized the measures taken so far by the Postal  Ministry, saying that deregulation "must be clear-cut to both  users and the industry."    The working group, which met for the sixth time, will draw  up  a final report at the next meeting on May 27, the officials  said. The government will take the report into account when  drawing up specific deregulation policies before the end of June.</p>

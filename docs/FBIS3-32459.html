			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Cauca representative Edgar Papamija Diago reaffirmed  yesterday that it is certain that some political campaigns in  northern Cauca Department are being financed with hot money.    He said that "the consciences of many persons from several  municipalities have been bought off, having in mind the 1994  election campaign."    The legislator supported the statements made by his  colleague  Juan Jose Chaux Mosquera who was one of the first to denounce  the presence of drug money in political circles.    Papamija Diago promised to cooperate with Chaux Mosquera to  investigate and reveal the names of those politicians who are  buying votes, apparently with money obtained from drug  trafficking.    Meanwhile, Senator Humberto Pelaez Gutierrez, a Liberal  leader in northern Cauca, said that "one should bear in mind  whether Congressman Chaux Mosquera made the statements while  intoxicated or while sober," and Pelaez Gutierrez hopes to begin  investigations aimed at clearing up such statements.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / A Hamlet forced to stay alive / Obituary of Alexander Dubcek ALEXANDER Dubcek, who died on Saturday aged 70, believed in the humane, pre-communist ethos of Czechoslovakia. But he was attached by an umbilical cord to the Communist party and unable to lead a revolt against the Soviet Union to its ultimate consequences. The Prague Spring of 1968 was a misfired attempt to gain self-rule, not full independence from Moscow. Dubcek had perseverance and skill, but proved too weak when it came to the crunch, unable to refuse to sign under duress the document of surrender in the last days of August 1968. His fate was to be a Hamlet forced to watch the aftermath of his indecision. He rose to power from an impeccable family background, on the ladder of local and regional party appointments. A first-class diploma from Moscow's international party university helped. Alexander Dubcek was born in 1921 in a Slovak village, the second son of Stefan Dubcek, a joiner who had emigrated to the US before the first world war. Stefan returned home after the war and, at about the time Alexander was born, joined the Communist party as one of its first members. He left again, this time for the Soviet Union, to join other skilled foreign workers helping to build communism. Alexander attended school in the Soviet Union. But in 1938, rather than accept Soviet citizenship, the family returned to Slovakia. Alexander found work as a locksmith in the Skoda works at Dubnica. In 1955, he won a place at the Moscow international school for party high-fliers, spending three years there, years which saw the Soviet Army's suppression of the Hungarian uprising. Dubcek's further ascent, to secretaryship of the Bratislava party organisation, came because of his apparent docility and non-dangerous ability. His decisive promotion, to first secretaryship of the Slovak Communist party and a sort of governorship of Slovakia, occurred in 1963. Under pressure of an economic slump and Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's terror, the party looked for a man who, unlike President Anton Novotny, had clean hands, liberal inclinations, and the trust of Moscow. From 1963 to 1967, recognition that Czechoslovakia's economic crisis was structural, caused by Soviet exploitation and policies, led - along with further disclosures of atrocities by Novotny and his secret service in the 1950s - to a gradual isolation of the ruling politburo and, at the end of 1967, to its split into two equally strong factions. One of these pressed for the removal of Novotny. A stormy party congress, convened in December 1967, elected Dubcek his successor. Dubcek's intelligence and humility, his halting speech, his broad and ready smile, made him different from the stupid and cruel communist rulers of the past. He quickly became popular with communists and non-communists alike. Press censorship was lifted; travel abroad allowed, and the country seethed with plans for a sort of market-led socialism, reinstatement of human rights and, though never officially admitted, a neutral Czechoslovakia. But noise exceeded action. The party district secretaries remained in control, blocking real economic reform. Soviet pressure increased; the Soviet generals saw a chance to move their army into Czechoslovakia to the West German frontier. After some resistance, Dubcek agreed to Soviet 'manoeuvres' in his country and, later, dismissed the only general ready to organise a defence of Czechoslovakia. Thus the ground was prepared for a walk-over by Soviet tanks, and for the kidnapping of Dubcek and other reformist political leaders to Moscow on August 21 1968. After some rough treatment in Moscow, Dubcek signed a paper legitimising the Soviet invasion and granting the Soviet Union an enormous tribute in the form of industrial plants and lorries. Dubcek returned to Prague in tears. He retained his function for a while, then being moved to Turkey as ambassador. Recalled soon after, he was given a job in Bratislava's parks, looking after machine equipment. His failure to say a loud 'no' when in Moscow in August 1968 overshadowed the memory of his Prague Spring role. In 1989, a new generation of dissidents who came to power consigned him to the lacklustre post of Federal Assembly chairman. He continued to play a minor role on the left wing of Slovak politics, unsuccessfully opposing the split of the federation. He enters the history of his country as a figure not always admired, but much loved.</p>

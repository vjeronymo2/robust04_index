			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent tried to contact the British  Embassy in Tehran today and seek the official view of the London  government about Britain's new espionage activity against Iran.    The British charge d'affaires refrained from any form of  conversation with our correspondent. It was stated via the  embassy secretary: The position of the British Government will  be announced later.    A British Foreign Office official announced last night:  London has nothing to say about this.</p>

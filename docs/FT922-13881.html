			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (6): Friendly, intense and relentless - Profile, Insead 'THE ONLY thing French here is the food - and that's probably a good thing', goes the quip at Insead, the European business school at Fontainebleau on the edge of the Bourbon kings' renowned hunting forest. L'Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affairs, Insead, may be 65km south of Paris, but it could as easily be on the outskirts of Basle or Brussels, given its success in downplaying the French connection. Teaching is mostly in English and administration in French; but a stroll across the dining room adds Spanish, Italian and Japanese (not German - symbolically enough for a business school). Insead claims to be the pre-eminent international business school, and is now widely regarded as such. The smaller International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland has a strong reputation; the Paris-based EAP's three-country 'pre-experience MBA' is highly rated; London Business School is rapidly strengthening its international credentials; and the buzz-word 'internationalisation' reverberates across leading American campuses. But in breadth, depth and output, Insead has a formidable claim to the crown. 'For us, international management education isn't a goal, it's a reality', insists Mr Ludo Van der Heyden, Insead's co-dean. It is reflected in all three of the institute's main divisions. Its 80-strong faculty is drawn from more than 20 nationalities, 90 per cent of them holding at least one degree from the United States. On executive programmes, the rule of thumb is that no more than 16 per cent of participants on any one course are from the same nationality. MBA students are drawn fairly evenly from North America and the leading European states - excepting Germany, which in 1990-91 had only 6 per cent to match France's 16 per cent and Britain's 20 per cent. A tenth hail from Asia and the Middle East. Typically, more than a third of each graduation go to work in a country other than that of their passport. To ice the cake, Insead also boasts a well-appointed Euro-Asia centre, with five academic staffand a range of management development programmes based in Europe and throughout Asia. Not that Insead's top brass sees the international dimension as the be-all and end-all. 'All programmes have to be more international, but that doesn't mean that all tomorrow's managers will be truly international', says Mr Van der Heyden. 'There's still plenty of room for the regional manager.' Executive courses are Insead's breadwinner. Almost 60 per cent of last year's total income of FF234m (Pounds 24m) came from executive courses. Public programmes account for just over half of all participants: the rest attend courses tailor-made for particular companies or consortia of companies. Courses vary in length from a few days to the month-long Advanced Management Programme - which now runs four times a year, up from once a year a decade ago. The development of programmes for the former Soviet bloc is a high priority on the short course side. Mr David Young, a finance professor, has pioneered programmes for Polish managers, and is planning others - in conjunction with IMD and LBS - to 'train trainers' from across the new democracies. European Community funds permitting, that is - difficulties in the securing of which prompt acid remarks about the problems faced by European institutions without a strong national champion when confronting Brussels, the supposedly 'European' citadel. Insead has grown fast and big in the last decade - somewhat faster than it can manage, mutter some potential customers. MBA numbers have grown at an annual rate of 19 per cent for the last decade, yet the brakes have still to be applied: plans are afoot to increase the intake from 450 to 600 a year, with executive programmes (which subsidise the MBA) expected to grow at a similar rate. Since 1989, a small but growing PhD programme has also been running, a boon to Insead's research capacity. A more interactive relationship with companies is the key to Insead's future, says Mr Van der Heyden. 'Companies will require partnerships with business schools of a new kind - a much more dynamic link.' He sees business schools becoming more the consultant, less the teacher - on the medical analogy, a shift from peddling cures to preventing disease in the first place. He cites Insead's link with Digital Equipment - which dates back to Insead's foundation - as a model for things to come. It involves Insead faculty in company study teams, and a steady stream of Digital managers passing through Fontainebleau. The aim? To make management education less an act of faith only indirectly connected with corporate objectives, and more a direct linkage between business schools and corporate development. 'The trend is towards more - and more custom-designed - executive education: in the long run degree programmes are dead,' says Mr Leon Selig, director of executive education. In the short run, however, the year-long MBA remains the brightest feather in Insead's cap. 'I was expecting to find a country club atmosphere - Porsches in the drive, that sort of thing', says one American participant. 'But nothing of the kind. It's friendly - yet intense and relentless.' That is the general impression. Competition is sharp, but group working smoothes the edges and enthusiasm abounds. Other than comments on overstretched facilities, few reservations are expressed. 'The best thing about the place is that it shuts at midnight - or else we'd be here all night too,' volunteers a Canadian, with apparent frankness. Simulations and problem-solving in small groups are the standard features - interspersed with lectures and a hectic social round. The course is unapologetically general: electives are offered only after four months of core courses. The MBA course has two entries a year - January and September. It is divided into five two-month sections, with exams at the end of each. And it doesn't come cheap: budget to spend FF230,000 (Pounds 23,800) for the year, advised a survey of 1990 participants. And after? According to Insead's career management service, typically three-quarters of each intake want to start their own business. Barely 1 per cent do so straight out of Insead, but within seven years more than two-thirds are owner-managers. An impressive score - in any language.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> BERG'S 'WOZZECK' IN THE URBAN JUNGLE  </P> <P> When the Music Center Opera introduced its misbegotten production of "Wozzeck"  to Los Angeles last year, the directorial Wunderkind in residence moved the  action from Germany ca. 1830 to a world of nightmare modernism.  </P> <P> The soldiers wore battle fatigues and green berets. Poor Marie became a  sophisticated slut in a black sheath. Alban Berg's monumental pathos got  muddled in sociopolitical trendiness.  </P> <P> Now comes the San Francisco Opera to restore interpretive sanity. Almost.  </P> <P> The new production at the War Memorial Opera House does indeed take some  liberties. Lotfi Mansouri's careful action scheme teeters on the brink of  histrionic hysteria from the start. Michael Levine's marvelously inventive  designs ignore the intended 19th-Century milieu and invoke urban-jungle  claustrophobia, ca. 1925 -- the time of the premiere of the opera.  </P> <P> The result impels a clash of styles. The actors deal in heightened naturalism.  The settings invoke stylization that stalks toward crafty Expressionism.  </P> <P> The characters are imprisoned in monstrous barracks, trapped in towering  tenements. Facades are rigged, angles ominously distorted, proportions  violently exaggerated.  </P> <P> Berg's poor people live in ratty slums. The enemy, we are told, is the city.  </P> <P> That makes good sense on any terms except those of the composer. He concerned  himself with fundamental matters of human cruelty. The metropolitan milieu is  virtually irrelevant.  </P> <P> In the crucial murder scene, it actually becomes perverse. Marie, after all, is  supposed to die in "a pond in the forest."  </P> <P> Mansouri and Levine make it a vaporous non-pond in a sketchy non-forest near a  geometric quasi-penal housing unit. The San Francisco solution doesn't work  well. Still, it works better than the quasi-bathtub in the mock-Vietnamese  compound concocted at the Music Center.  </P> <P> The San Francisco "Wozzeck," shared with Toronto, suffers from some obvious  surface contradictions. Ultimately, however, these seem relatively unimportant.  The director and designer respect the spirit of the work, even when they  obscure the letter.  </P> <P> Mansouri defines the characters deftly, and motivates their behavior with  telling detail. Levine uses elaborate yet flexible scenic devices to reinforce  the essential moods of terror and oppression.  </P> <P> Sometimes he literally illustrates the text in ways that may be a bit too easy.  Marie comments that the moon is red ("Wie der Mond rot aufgeht!"). Obediently,  the cyclorama suddenly glows crimson. In most cases, however, the bold and  bleak images create their own supportive poetry.  </P> <P> Friedemann Layer, who has inherited the baton from the originally scheduled  Christoph Perick, provided supportive poetry of his own on Sunday afternoon. He  struck a fine balance between analytical clarity and emotional propulsion. He  really savored coloristic nuance and textural cohesion. If any unhappiness  lingered from the recent labor dispute, it wasn't obvious in the well-staffed  pit.  </P> <P> Other conductors -- most notably Karl Bohm -- have built those two otherworldly  B-natural crescendos after Marie's murder into a more shattering outcry. Few,  however, have gauged the catharsis of the great D-minor interlude so  poignantly.  </P> <P> The delicately balanced cast was dominated by Allan Monk -- urgent yet dazed,  tough yet sensitive, vocally bluff yet potent in the title role. Judith Forst,  replacing the originally intended Teresa Stratas, played Marie with feverish  ardor and sang with luminous point.  </P> <P> Wozzeck's adversaries, all picturesquely characterized, included Siegfried  Vogel as the heartily demonic Doctor, Stuart Kale as the whining and preening  Captain and Warren Ellsworth (a veteran of the Los Angeles war) as the  handsome, agile and aggressively horny Drum Major.  </P> <P> John David De Haan brought boyish lyricism to the posturing of Andres. Joseph  Frank coped sweetly with the prophetic utterances of the Fool. Emily Golden  made the most of Margret's lusty counterpoint. Little Darren Mayer exuded  vulnerability as Marie's child.  </P> <P> Everyone articulated the unexpurgated German text beautifully. The supertitles  did not flinch at the translations.  </P></p>

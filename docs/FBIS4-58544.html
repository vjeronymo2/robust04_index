			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 4, IRNA -- Following the victory of the  African National Congress (ANC) in the first free multi-racial  elections and fall of apartheid in South Africa, Islamic Iran is  to lift its 15-year-old economic sanctions against that country  and establish healthy relations between the two countries.    Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the  world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in  1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to  resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly  elected government has come to power in South Africa.    The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of  economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with  the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry  to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country  and set up relations with it.    Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of  firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa  and foresee steady expansion in the future.    According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once  the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic  ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official  agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to  include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African  refineries.    Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade  ties with the country a month after the lifting of United  Nation's economic sanctions against it.    Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and  substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that  the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs.  [dollars] 100 per annum very soon.    The valuable experiences of Iranian experts and specialists  over the years of reconstruction following the victory of the  revolution would enable them to have an active part in  development of housing and power generation in South Africa  which declared it would spend dlrs. 108 billion on housing,  electricity and employment within the coming five years.    [Word indistinct] the lack of a clear prospect in Iran's  economic relations with South Africa, experts believe that  mutual interests and connections between the two nations and  their leaders provide a proper foundation for Tehran and  Pretoria to build up deep political, economic, cultural and  social ties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephane Bothma] </F>   [Text] Pretoria -- Defence Minister Joe Modise had met some  of the former Military Intelligence [MI] agents who had  threatened to divulge sensitive information and was considering  their demands for restitution, Military Intelligence Acting  Chief of Staff Maj-Gen Dirk Verbeek said yesterday.    The agents, calling themselves the Group of 23, were gagged  last week by the Transvaal Supreme Court following an urgent  interdict by Modise against them and the WEEKLY MAIL. The  interdict was withdrawn by Modise this week.    According to court papers, he feared that the disgruntled  former Directorate of Covert Collection spies would make public  names of their former informants. These were believed to  include senior Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC  military wing; MK] officers who are in line for high-ranking  posts in the new SA [South Africa] National Defence Force  [SANDF].    In an earlier letter to President Nelson Mandela, the group  urged government to redress their "unfair dismissal" from the  former MI front company Pan Afrik Industrial Investment  Consultants (PAIIC). They asked that they be re-employed by  the SANDF, or that they be paid compensation, despite having  received retrenchment packages equivalent to 18 months' salary  tax free.    The former spies also wanted to be cleared for any alleged  third force activities following a Goldstone commission raid on  PAIIC's offices and a subsequent statement by former President  FW de Klerk in 1992. De Klerk's statement resulted in 11 MI  members being placed on early retirement and the closure of the  front company. Forty-nine PAIIC employees were retrenched and  the front company closed.    Verbeek said Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira's  investigations  after Goldstone's raid had failed to produce any evidence of  criminal activities in the ranks of the directorate.    He said that only four of the spies had identified  themselves.    Verbeek said that although MI was still involved in covert  operations outside SA, the directorate no longer had any front  organisations in SA.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Climate Agreement Requires Emission Control''] </F>   [Text] In accordance with the agreement approved in Rio in  1992, Finland has to use already long-known ways of reducing its  carbon dioxide emissions, which are altering the climate.  Appointed by the Environment Ministry, the Second Carbon Dioxide  Committee regards energy conservation, reduction in the use of  fossil fuels, and taking good care of our forests as the most  important ways of slowing down the greenhouse effect.    In the committee's opinion, parliament may very well ratify  the agreement, which it is at present discussing, which over 50  countries have already approved, and which is to go into effect  internationally next month. Parliament must act quickly so that  Finland does not lag behind in what may be the most extensive  and most important implementation of the Rio agreement. The  committee calls for versatile solutions that will be effective  for a long time so that carbon dioxide emissions can be  stabilized by the turn of the century and gotten back down to  the 1990 figures.    A more effective technology than before must be developed  for  the production and use of energy. We must switch to fuels that  produce few emissions and gradually to clean alternatives  despite the fact that nuclear power has been ruled out -- to the  regret of the committee. We are already on the right track in  Finland, but development must be accelerated with economic and  administrative control measures.    Used with care, the proposed limits on concentrations and  taxes on energy will be good alternatives, as long as they do  not interfere with trade or weaken our ability to compete. One  would not think that this danger is hard to ward off since the  other industrial countries will also have to meet the same  challenges and the climate agreement will have to be observed in  international trade.    The forests offer Finland both leeway and an incentive to  reduce carbon dioxide emissions and stimulate other countries to  do the same. Woodlands will increase and bind much more carbon  than is logged in them. A significant absorption of carbon will  also be obtained by planting trees on hundreds of thousands of  hectares of arable land to be taken out of agricultural use,  whereupon the energy production, industry, and traffic sectors  will manage to better implement their own reductions.    While it is impossible to stop the greenhouse effect, the  climate must not be allowed to warm up any more than one degree  in a century so that conifers, which grow for a long time, can  adapt to the new living conditions. Consequently, a country that  lives off of the lumber industry has a quite special need for  effectively enough slowing down the change.    From Finland's standpoint, interesting as well is the  possibility of perhaps counting in its favor reductions in  greenhouse gases that we would achieve by modernizing outdated  technology for dealing with an abundance of emissions in  cooperation with Estonia and Russia or by reforesting  desertified developing countries.    The Rio agreement calls for major changes in the climate  policies of first the industrial countries and then the  developing countries as well. The immediate goal for the turn of  the century is only the first stage, after which the process  will have to be continued for several more decades.</p>

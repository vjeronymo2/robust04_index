As we bade farewell to the old year and greeted the new,  State Vice President Rong Yiren, in the midst of his pressing  affairs, gave a special interview to a TZU CHING magazine  special correspondent, talking freely about the excellent  situation of China's reform and opening-up, forecasting the  major trend of China's economic development, expounding on the  inseparable relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese  mainland, and extending New Year's greetings to our countrymen  at home and abroad.    Quick in thought, the 78-year-old vice president remained a  good talker. Concentrating on the main points and taking a  strategically advantageous position, he reviewed the past,  forecast the future, and was full of confidence in the prospects  for China's socialist modernization program.  <H5>  Assist the State President in Doing Jobs </H5>   Rong Yiren was elected vice president of the PRC at the  First  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on 27 March  1993. Ten full months have elapse since then.    Rong Yiren said: "In the past I held the posts of vice  chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, chairman of All China  Association of Industry and Commerce, and chairman of the Board  of Directors of the China International Trust and Investment  Corporation [CITIC], but I spent most of my time on CITIC  business. I am now state vice president, and have resigned my  position as CITIC Board of Directors chairman. As a matter of  fact, I was prepared to retire. Besides, I also have resigned  my position as chairman of the Association of Industry and  Commerce."    "My position as state vice president is mainly to assist the  state president in doing jobs." Rong Yiren declares.    As state vice president, from April 1993 until now, Rong  Yiren has visited Portugal and Spain, and has received and met  with 88 groups of visitors from all over the world, including  fellow countrymen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with almost  one interview every two or three days, or sometimes several  interviews in one day. Since the beginning of this year, the  vice president has met with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan  and Zimbabwe, U.S. Senators, the Romanian minister of state  affiars, and other important visitors.    Talking about holding the post of state vice president, and  whether or not he is busier than before, Rong Yiren said: "I  cannot say busy; I was very busy in the past, when I worked at  CITIC. Only now my work is of a stronger political nature than  in the past, and the requirements are higher too."    He declared that as state vice president he represents the  interests and reputation of the state. In contacts with foreign  visitors, it is necessary to present China's situation to them  in a practical and realistic manner, introduce them to matters  they want to know, and also explain to them patiently the things  they do not quite understand. It is important to respect  guests, as well as ourselves, but it is more important to  promote and develop contacts and friendship between China and  other countries.  <H5>  Constantly Exchanging Views With President Jiang Zemin </H5>   Rong Yiren said: "In my work I often exchange views with  President Jiang Zemin. I assist him in doing jobs, and I will  do my best in whatever business I am required to do. President  Jiang Z emin also attaches importance to my views, and we have  had very good cooperation."    Talking about his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong  Yiren recalled with delight: "The two of us have a longstanding  friendship, and have always been on very good terms. In 1979,  in the PRC Foreign Investments Management Committee, Jiang Zemin  was vice chairman, Gu Mu was chairman, and I was advisor. We  had many contacts between us."    "Afterward, Jiang Zemin became minister of the electronics  industry, and I was engaged in setting up CITIC. We had many  contacts in our jobs. When Jiang Zemin was mayor of Shanghai  and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I even  called on him when I visited Shanghai."    Talking about his job in mainland China, Vice President Rong  Yiren said that as the emphasis of his job in the past was in  the economic field, his job in mainland China was mainly to do  more investigation and study and to discover the facts, and  after consideration, to make suggestions and proposals to the  departments concerned.    "Therefore," Rong Yiren declared: "After being busily  engaged in protocol work, I spend much of my time reading data  and studying problems." In May and November last year, he went  to Jiangsu Province and Tianjin Municipality in succession to  make on-the-spot investigations and to discover facts. The  visits were most rewarding. He points out: "As a whole, my job  has been pretty smooth."  <H5>  The Year 1993 Laid a Solid Foundation for Future Development </H5>   Talking about his appraisal of China's economic situation in  1993, Rong Yiren said: "Taken as a whole, China in 1993  witnessed the implementation of Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It was a year  in which China continued to score successes by seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, and developing the economy  faster and better [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge you kui you  hou di fa zhan jing ji 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245  0642 1816 0642 1170 0966 4099 1455 4842 3444]. Enormous changes  have taken place in China's situation following Deng Xiaoping's  inspection tour to southern China in 1992. At the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Congress, we finally built up all over  China a unanimous understanding of the experiences gained  through more than 10 years of exploration and discussion, that  is, to build up the socialist market economy system. This has  vigorously promoted the development of China's economy."    Rong Yiren declared: From 1980 to 1991, the annual average  growth of China's economy was about nine percent, the growth in  1992 was 12.8 percent, and the growth in 1993 was about 13  percent. Such high-speed growth for years running is very  rarely seen in the world. The reason China made tremendous  achievements in economic construction last year was primarily  because China emphasized in- depth reform, strengthened  macroeconomic regulation and control, and enabled economic  construction to proceed in a more orderly way than in the past.  Now China is socially and politically stable, agriculture  continues to gain great bumper harvests, industrial production  is growing rapidly, domestic markets are prosperous, foreign  trade is brisk, the life of the people continues to improve, and  the overall strength of China's economy has increased to some  extent. All these accomplishments have laid a solid foundation  for development in 1994 and in the years to come.  <H3>  A Nine Percent Growth Rate This Year Is Laid on a Good  Foundation </H3>   Rong Yiren said that this year China will further carry out  in- depth reform, and will develop the economy with more  intensive reforms in banking, fiscal levies, foreign trade, and  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. In addition, we  will step up legislation work, and a series of many laws and  regulations will be introduced which will favor the transition  to a market economy.    He said: In accordance with China's basic national  conditions and the essential requirements of the socialist  market economy system, China's next-step reform still must adopt  the methods of 'follow in order and advance step by step' and  'gradual transition'. Before the introduction of each reform  measure, the bearing capacity of the state and the people must  be taken into full consideration, and the ability to promote  economic development and social stability through reform must be  ensured.    He said: For instance, the common people now have some  complaints about prices, which should draw attention. Of  course, some problems can be overcome only gradually, by reform.  However, attention should be paid to acting according to  economic law, and best efforts should be made to avoid the ups  and downs of the economic situation and any major fluctuation.    Talking about the growth rate this year, Rong Yiren believed  that the nine percent growth rate now set has quite good a  foundation. He declared: "It seems that this growth rate is  lower than that of last year, but actually it is not. Economic  development in China should take the road of sustained,  high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu jian kang  fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and nine  percent is a rational pace. Throughout the `Eighth Five-year  Plan,' China's growth rate was set at eight to nine percent,  which was precisely for the sake of being favorable to  mobilizing the initiatives of various fields, and of ensuring  the healthy and orderly progress of economic construction."    Rong Yiren stressed that currently it is necessary to handle  several relationships well, that is, the relationships in  sustained, high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu  jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and  the relationships in reform, development, and stability. In the  former group of relationships, healthy development is the crux,  and only with healthy development will there be truly sustained,  and high- speed development; otherwise it will possibly be false  and bad development. For example, the economy grows at a high  speed, but inflation also rises to an extent that the common  people can hardly bear. Then what is is the good of it?  Conversely, if everything is kept under tight control, the  economy can hardly develop either.    Among reform, development, and stability, reform is the  leading factor. Without reform, there will be no development,  but without stability, and without social and political  stability, both reform and development are but empty phrases.  Therefore, development is the objective, reform is the motive  force, and stability is the guarantee. We hope to promote  development through reform. Only when the economy develops and  the living standards of the people are raised can there be  political and social stability, and stability, in turn, pushes  forward in-depth reform. These are the major experiences China  has acquired in the more than 10 years of reform and opening up.  <H3>  Currently It Is Still Necessary To Lay Stress on Hard  Struggle </H3>   With regard to why China's high-speed economic development  in  recent years has drawn the world's serious attention, Rong Yiren  asserted his belief that China covers a large territory, and has  a large population. It naturally occupies a very large  proportion of the world, and it is quite natural for it to draw  the attention of others. However, if we analyze in a practical  and realistic manner, there is an enormous gap between China's  per capita income and that of many Western countries. Some  people currently overestimate China's economic strength. This,  plus differences in statistical methods, means that people are  quite different in their viewpoints. Of course, there are two  kinds of situation here. One is: People are friendly to China,  and they are really happy with China's progress. The other is:  People harbor evil designs. Toward this kind of situation,  explanations should be made to them and those things that are  not in conformity with facts should be cleared up, and  exaggeration by some people who have ulterior motives also  should be guarded against.    Rong Yiren explained that China has made considerable  achievements in economic development, but it is still quite a  long way from its objective. We propose to build China into a  medium- developed country within half a century, and it is now  still a far cry from this objective. We still are required to  keep making great efforts.    He declared that China currently is still required to lay  stress on arduous efforts, on thrift and hard work, and on  determination to make progress, as well as to truly build China  well through concerted efforts." He criticized some localities  for being wasteful and extravagant after their economic  conditions improved. He said that such a situation is no good  and should be stopped resolutely.    Rong Yiren gave this earnest advice: New China was built on  the foundation of a semicolonial and semifeudal society, and the  goal now is to build a modern socialist country with Chinese  characteristics. It is impossible to achieve this goal without  going through protracted arduous struggles, without surmounting  numerous difficulties, and without undergoing repeated setbacks.  The policy is: Strive for fewer twists and turns, and for more  stable development.  <H3>  China Attaches Great Importance to the Development and Role  of Hong Kong </H3>   Talking about the relations between the Chinese mainland and  Hong Kong, Rong Yiren said: "As an international monetary,  trading, and shipping center, Hong Kong has very close ties with  the economic development of the Chinese mainland. In the past  few years, Hong Kong's volume of international trade grew  considerably, and it had more and more contacts with the Chinese  mainland. Investments by Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and  especially by those in Hong Kong, also grew very rapidly. For  years running, investments from Hong Kong occupied first place  in the overseas investments drawn by the Chinese mainland --  approximately over 60 percent. Therefore, we value the  development and role of this region."    Rong Yiren said that only by relying on the Chinese mainland  had Hong Kong been able to develop up to today. Without the  support of the mainland, the daily life of the residents would  be affected, not to mention banking and trading. Through the  important region of Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland has  developed its contacts with the international community, and  Hong Kong also has gained many benefits from the frequent  contacts between the Chinese mainland and the outside world.  Therefore, the close links between the Chinese mainland and  Hong Kong, were as described by Premier Li Peng: "The economies  of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have become an inseparable  entirety."    He said that currently more and more compatriots in Hong  Kong  have come to understand the relations between the Chinese  mainland and Hong Kong, thereby developing more and more  economic and trading contacts with the Chinese mainland." He  hoped that this favorable momentum would continue to develop.    Rong Yiren said that recently the negotiations between China  and Britain on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements had  broken down as a result of the fact that the British Government  did not live up to its words and took an uncooperative attitude.  This increased some troubles and difficulties, and it was  natural for our compatriots in Hong Kong to worry about the  situation. Whatever the situation, however, the Chinese  Government will uphold the principles of "one country two  systems" and of Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong people, which  will never change. Together with patriotic fellow-countrymen of  various circles in Hong Kong, the principles of the Basic Law  will be upheld, and the long-term stability and prosperity of  Hong Kong will be maintained.    He pointed out that it was only a little over three years  before China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong. He hoped that  during this period everyone would see more clearly the situation  in which Hong Kong stands, that economic and trade ties with the  Chinese mainland would be developed in a better way, and that  the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong would be upheld.    Before the end of the interview, Vice President Rong Yiren  wished, through TZU CHING magazine, to extend New Year's  greetings to compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, to compatriots  in Taiwan, and to fellow countrymen residing overseas, wishing  all of them a happy Lunar New Year, happiness to the whole  family, and that everything turns out as they wish.</p>

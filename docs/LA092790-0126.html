			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURGERY IS SET MONDAY FOR BLYLEVEN  </P> <P> Angel right-hander Bert Blyleven will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right  shoulder Monday in an effort to repair a problem that has reduced strength in  the shoulder.  </P> <P> A club spokesman said Blyleven might have a slight tear in the rotator cuff,  and the arthroscopic procedure was scheduled because Blyleven hasn't responded  as well as expected to treatment and therapy.  </P> <P> Team physician Lewis Yocum will perform the procedure.  </P> <P> Blyleven, 39, hasn't pitched since Aug. 10. He is 8-7 with a 5.24 earned-run  average this season and has 279 victories. He was signed to a guaranteed  contract for 1991 at slightly more than $2 million. HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton has finally announced his  counternarcotics policy. He will step up the fight against drug  consumption in the United States and will give more economic  support to eradication and substitution of drug cultivation in  drug-producing countries. Miriam Ortiz has the report on what  that program means for Colombia.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz] President Bill Clinton's new  counternarcotics program has four fundamental objectives. The  first is to reduce demand. This is the most important goal of  the new strategy. Budgets for prevention, treatment, and  education programs will be increased. The second objective is  to reduce drug-related violence. The U.S. Government will  appoint 100 policemen [as heard] to prevent crime in the streets  and will ask Congress to pass more controls and requirements on  gun ownership. The third objective is to reject the  legalization and decriminalization of illegal drugs. The fourth  is to request international cooperation.    According to the drug czar [Lee Brown], the U.S. Government  will continue to be a strong ally of countries that have  demonstrated a political willingness to fight drug trafficking.    [Brown, in English with superimposed translation into  Spanish] It's very important that we do not open our borders to  the Escobars of the world to bring drugs in at will. That is  why we will continue our program to ban drugs.    [Ortiz] The U.S. Government believes that Colombia has one  of  the most successful counternarcotics programs, so its budget  will not be reduced.    [Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington] In  addition to support for efforts to reduce consumption, the new  program includes institutional support, which will strengthen  justice and democratic institutions.

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Head of Arlington quits BAe main board THE head of British Aerospace's property arm has resigned from its main board, clearing the way for the subsidiary's eventual disposal. In a brief statement to the stock exchange, British Aerospace said Mr Raymond Mould, chairman of its property subsidiary Arlington, had resigned 'in order to concentrate on his role at the head of Arlington'. A spokesman for Arlington said Mr Mould had resigned to prevent a conflict of interest during negotiations over the company's future. Mr Mould's resignation from the main board coincided with the expiry of his three-year service contract, which he agreed at the time of BAe's takeover of Arlington in 1989. The Arlington directors' contracts, which expired on Sunday, have been rolled over until the end of the year. Sir Graham Day, then BAe's chairman, announced in May the intention to introduce outside shareholders into Arlington once the property market showed clear signs of improvement. Mr Humphrey Price, finance director of Arlington, said that the disposal or flotation of a stake in the company was likely to be 'several years off'. Arlington, including BAe's landbank, was likely to be valued at several hundred million pounds, he said. Mr John Cahill, the former BTR chief executive who has taken over as BAe's chairman, wants to refocus the group on its profitable core military aircraft and Airbus activities. A BAe spokesman said property was not seen as a core business for BAe, although it would continue to play an important role in the short and medium term. Arlington was bought for Pounds 278m to add value to BAe's surplus landbank, which had grown after its acquisitions of Rover and Royal Ordnance. BAe saw Arlington as a valuable source of expertise, since it is widely considered to be the leading developer of business parks in the UK. Arlington, which was bought at the peak of the property market in 1989, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 19m in 1990, and in 1991 it incurred a Pounds 60m exceptional charge due to a shortfall in the value of assets it had injected into Burwood House Group, a joint venture with Asda, the supermarket group.

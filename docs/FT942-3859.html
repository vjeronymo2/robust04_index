			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / People: Shaky first steps of black empowerment - Nthato Motlana tells Patti Waldmeir about the challenges facing black business in the new South Africa Nthato Motlana is South Africa's most prominent black businessmen - and that is a revealing commentary on the state of black business in the post-apartheid era. Motlana is a medical doctor, a decent soul, a man of the best intentions. But his record as a businessman can scarcely explain the large infusions of corporate power which he has recently received from white business, eager to divest itself of peripheral assets in the name of black economic empowerment. The recipients have been Motlana and a handful of other black leaders with the right political connections, but often only a passing experience of business. Perhaps they are best seen as caretakers for the new generation of black businessmen growing up freely in a world without apartheid. But in the meantime they control several billion rands worth of assets; and at least as far as Motlana is concerned, his plans for managing the assets remain difficult to discern. Motlana is understandably pleased with the recent election of his lifelong friend and patient, Nelson Mandela (he is Mandela's personal physician) to the Presidency of the new South Africa. When I arrived to interview him in the coffee shop of a Johannesburg hotel - on a public holiday, he has no free time on any other day - Motlana proudly announces that there is only one member of the new cabinet whom he does not know well. His pride would be touching, if that fact were not so much part of the problem: the suspicion that political expedience prompted his elevation, that he and other black South Africans (deprived by apartheid of capital, skills, education and opportunity) could be tempted to peddle political influence to gain economic power. Motlana, 69, who has had a long and respected career as a community leader, has no time for this argument. 'I've been criticised as one of those who is going to get rich as a result of so-called black economic empowerment. 'My answer to such critics is that I got involved in business in the late 1960s when the (ruling) National Party took a resolution that 'elke kaffir moet 'n baas he' (every black must have a boss) and that's where we begin.' Far from accepting that a black man could never be boss, Motlana formed a series of companies over the past 25 years, yet he does not try to hide the fact that almost all of these businesses failed. His first company, formed to manufacture school uniforms, went under because the managing director stole company funds; the next, a manufacturing firm producing hair products, detergents and car wash liquid, failed because of lack of management skills. A venture in chicken farming proved no more successful. 'You have no idea how much money i've lost,' Motlana concludes. His only notable success has been the Lesedi Clinic, South Africa's first private black hospital - and even that had to be bailed out by a white shareholder, Afrox, which recently took 10 per cent of the equity and a management contract to prevent its collapse. This is not to deny the formidable, perhaps insuperable, obstacles which apartheid put in Motlana's way. 'Everything we did was illegal. Black business in this country has always had to break the law,' he points out, reminding the listener that until the 1980s it was virtually impossible for blacks to obtain property for business use. Banks would not lend in the absence of collateral - and this was unavailable because under apartheid blacks were not allowed to own the freehold of their homes. He is understandably proud of his achievement in conducting any business at all under those circumstances. 'I hate people who say to me, you are empowered by politics, because I'm not] I battled at the coal face when it was almost impossible to do so. 'So don't talk to me about black economic empowerment because I don't come from that bloody genre, I come from a time when it was impossible and I did it] That's where I come from, not from some bloody political patronage]' But the challenges facing Motlana now are of a wholly different order. Last year he became chairman of Methold, a black-owned holding company. The Afrikaans insurance giant Sanlam recently granted Methold a controlling stake in Metropolitan Life, an insurance company which targets mainly blacks. It was one of the first major corporate deals to empower black South Africans. As part of the deal, Sanlam ceded control to Methold, which borrowed R137m from the state's Industrial Development Corporation to finance the purchase of 10 per cent of MetLife shares. But Methold is struggling to place the shares with black shareholders, who lack the capital or inclination for share purchases. Motlana is also chairman of Corporate Africa, his chief investment vehicle. It controls the largest black newspaper, the Sowetan, after Anglo American Corp, which previously controlled the Sowetan indirectly, ceded a majority stake to Motlana and other black leaders. The deal was financed via Corporate Africa's stake in the cellular telephone network MTN, which it gained in turn through political pressure. All these deals have been criticised for empowering the black elite far more than the man in the Soweto black taxi, whom Motlana claims to represent. An amiable man clearly unused to tough questioning, Motlana becomes increasingly strident when confronted with this charge; but he lacks a convincing defence. 'You can ask, what value does Motlana add to any of these businesses,' says a local businessman involved in one of the deals. 'The answer is not a lot. But then you have to ask: who else is there?' Apartheid not only stifled black business, it prevented the emergence of natural leaders. And that is precisely what Motlana wants to rectify. 'We're interested not in some token director like Motlana who sits on the board, but in seeing upward mobility of blacks within organisations, that's where the real power is,' says Motlana. 'Sometimes we speak of black economic empowerment and we demand total control . . .that is unrealistic. We lack the financial muscle . . .the management skills . . .all manner of things we have been denied for many years. I'm looking forward to companies where we have a van der Merwe and a Khumalo (typical Afrikaner and African names). 'You can call it tokenism if you like, but it's going to be the story of South Africa: van der Merwe and Khumalo. The Afrikaners did the same thing; when the National Party took over in 1948, it was Levine and Kruger. The banks in South Africa were all run by English men; today most of the major banks are run by Afrikaners.' Motlana's vision of a South Africa run by Africans is scarcely consoling to whites: 'For the first time we blacks are going to sit back and employ whites and see them sweat on our behalf' - hardly a sentiment which his patron, Nelson Mandela, would endorse. But whatever Motlana's other shortcomings, he can boast perhaps the most essential quality of a successful businessmen: the desire to get rich. He quotes Chinese leader Deng Xiao Ping approvingly: 'It is glorious to be rich. That's my favourite quotation. 'I'm looking forward to the creation of black Donny Gordons (founder chairman of the highly successful Liberty Life, the South African insurer).' If Motlana can foster the creation of younger versions of the rich and flamboyant tycoon, he will have done his bit for the new South Africa.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK dairy sector The uncertain future of the UK's Pounds 3bn milk industry as the Milk Marketing Board begins its death throes is unsettling investors. The share prices of both Northern Foods and Unigate are curdling as a consequence. The fear is that the demise of the Milk Marketing Board will simply transform a statutory monopoly into an unregulated private one. Milk Marque is likely to control far in excess of 50 per cent of the market, making it the biggest purchaser of milk in Europe. It would have the power to steer the UK market whichever way it chose  - although it would be hard to justify higher prices given its promises of greater efficiencies. In this scenario, Northern and Unigate would be squeezed by supply pressures at one end of the milk chain while suffering margin erosion at the other as supermarkets won ever more market share. Higher margin doorstep deliveries, which accounted for almost 90 per cent of milk sales in 1980, may shrink to less than 50 per cent by 1995. Milk may be 'commoditised' like bread. But the parallels are inexact. Unlike bread, demand for milk has remained stable and there is no great excess processing capacity. Milk will also retain some premium for quality  - it is impossible to degrade the product without being jailed. Moreover, the critical determinants of dairy profitability will remain processing and distribution efficiencies with the barriers to entry remaining high. Although there will undoubtedly be a hiatus as the new regime takes shape, the market's worst fears appear exaggerated.</p>

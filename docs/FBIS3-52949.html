Salih arrived in Ta'izz last  night for a meeting with al-Bid which he described as a meeting  of reconciliation.    The sources, who preferred anonymity, said that al-Bid's  attendance will depend on the implementation of the 18 points  that the YSP presented as solutions and practical ways out of  the current crisis and which the Salih-led General People's  Congress party accepted unreservedly.    The Ta'izz meeting between the two men had been prepared by  the Yemeni Ulema Association. Several hours before it was  scheduled to begin today a machine-gun attack was mounted on  al-Bid's house in Aden.    The Yemeni police who caught the assailant are interrogating  him to reveal the motives for his attack. It is not known if  al-Bid was at home when the attack occurred.    It is worth mentioning that al-Bids has refused to leave  Aden  for the past five months and is demanding deep-rooted reforms in  Yemen as a condition for traveling to Sanaa.</p>

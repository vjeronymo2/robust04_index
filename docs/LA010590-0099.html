			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S DESIGN FOR PROBATION SUITS THIEF TO A T-SHIRT  </P> <P> A Tulare man with a long criminal record avoided a prison term for stealing  beer from a grocery by agreeing to wear a T-shirt that reads "I'm on Felony  Probation. . . . My record plus two six-packs equal four years" at all times  for a year.  </P> <P> The shirt was designed by Visalia Superior Court Judge Howard Broadman, who in  a hearing earlier this week also ordered Russell Allen Hackler, 29, to check in  with the court daily and to attend three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week.  </P> <P> Hackler's prior convictions include robbery, burglary and auto theft.  </P> <P> Broadman said he did not want to impose another prison term.  </P> <P> "I am horribly bothered by the prospect of spending $80,000 for putting you in  prison for stealing these two six-packs of beer," the judge told Hackler.  "(Regular) probation hasn't worked. And we have sent you to prison before."  </P> <P> Broadman admitted that he was using humiliation to punish, as was done in  Nathaniel Hawthorne's early American novel, "The Scarlet Letter," in which  adulteress Hester Prynne had to wear a red "A."  </P> <P> "If you are willing to be Hester Prynne for the next year, I am going to give  you probation," the judge said.  </P></p>

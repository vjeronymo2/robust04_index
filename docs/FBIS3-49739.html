			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A few minutes ago we received from Prague a  recording of statements made by [Slovak] Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar and [Czech] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on the results of  their talks today. Here are they in their full length version.    [Begin recording] [Meciar] The meeting between the  delegations of the Slovak and Czech Governments have just  finished. The delegations were led by us, the two prime  ministers.    During this meeting, we told the Czech Government our stance  on the cooperation within Visegrad Four, as well as on some  other critical statements made recently, especially in Poland.  I would like to stress that the Government of the Slovak  Republic considers all the steps taken by the Czech Republic in  order to protect its political and security interests to be  fully legitimate. The criticism was one-sided, and simplified  matters, and we do not identify ourselves with this criticism.  In this respect, we express our full support for the steps  taken by the Government of the Czech Republic to defend its own  interests.    We have analyzed issues related to the Partnership for  Peace.  We agreed that (?our) stance is approximately identical. The  Slovak side accepts this initiative without any reservations.    We have also dealt with issues concerning the agreements we  had concluded in years 1992 and 1993 and the fulfillment of the  obligations ensuing from them. By coincidence, in two weeks, it  will be one year ago that, in the very same room, we were  working on the currency division. It seems that the system  which was set up is [word indistinct]. A meeting of the  representatives of the customs union will take place this week,  the interior ministers will meet to discuss borders.    We have also debated the improvement of economic  cooperation.  In this area, the interest of both sides on the priorities we  have is fully legitimate. In 1994 we shall continue to support  the economic cooperation in 1994 as well as in the next period.    These, approximately, were the main topics that we dwelt on  during our talks.    [Klaus] Thank you very much. I really agree with this  information on our meeting. I would like to underline three  issues.    First, I expressed to the Slovak side and the Slovak  Government an appreciation for a hundred-percent observation of  the agreements that we had concluded between the Czech and  Slovak Republics, especially for the immediate settlement of the  debt on the clearing account. We consider this to be a very  good signal and a sign that the pessimists who foresaw a  deterioration in cooperation in all the areas between our  countries are wrong. We are very pleased that this happened the  way it did, and I would like to underline it here.    Second, we talked about the Partnership for Peace, to be  more  exact, about our very, very close if not identical views.    Third, we talked about the very close views on the  cooperation between the countries of the so-called Visegrad  Four. I think that both sides are well aware that we are  painstakingly seeking to find the highest common denominator in  the views of these four countries. The fact that we are not able  to do everything as a foursome is in no way caused by any  individuals on this or the other side but by the real interests  of these countries. [end recording]</p>

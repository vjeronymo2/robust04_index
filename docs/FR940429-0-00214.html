			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six commenters stated that the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution provide examples of an institution's refund policy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective students is burdensome and unnecessary. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters asserted that most students would not understand such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples and that the examples would inevitably be misleading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the many variables that might apply to a real student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal situation would not be represented. Three commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shared the Secretary's view that prospective and current students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should receive a written statement containing an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund policy, but one commenter believed providing such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement would be burdensome and costly for institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that current and prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students have the right to be informed in writing of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's refund policies and practices, and that the costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of providing such information are part of the normal costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doing business. A particular student's ability to completely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehend such information does not impact that student's right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to receive the information. Further, the Secretary would expect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in accordance with 34 CFR 668.45(a), an institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have designated an employee or group of employees who must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on a full-time basis to assist students or prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students with any questions they might have in this area. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary wishes to clarify that, as discussed in the February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28, 1994 NPRM, the requirement to provide examples would be met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the institution informs students in the written refund policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that examples are available and the institution makes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples readily available to current and prospective students on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request. The Secretary does not believe refund examples must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all possible variables to be useful to students. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is expected to provide reasonable examples of common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund situations applicable to its average student population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution must make available to students, upon request,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples of the application of the refund policy and inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students of the availability of these examples in the written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fair and equitable refund policy. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed the requirement for a fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and equitable refund, as interpreted in the February 28, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM, is needlessly complex, is intrusive upon the rights of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to determine policy, and extends beyond the intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the law. The commenters believed institutions should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forced to calculate up to three separate refund amounts for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawing student, as this would be burdensome and confusing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both to institution employees and to students, resulting in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawing students inevitably receiving incorrect information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters asserted that an institution should be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine which calculation generally provides the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial refund to its average student body population and use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that calculation consistently for Title IV, HEA program refunds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters believed the Secretary should provide certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund calculation software for institutional use, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfairly expecting institutions to create or purchase from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private source software that is potentially erroneous. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters requested the Secretary commit to providing clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of revisions and changes to the refund requirements, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid the inevitable widespread confusion and noncompliance that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will otherwise result if the February 28, 1994 NPRM is published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a final rule. One commenter believed it is inappropriate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inefficient to require institutions to implement a policy which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affects such a small number of individuals, and that institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are capable of developing workable refund policies that are fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reasonable. One commenter supported the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of the statute and believed withdrawing students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deserve the benefit of the largest refund possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992 define a fair and equitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund policy as one that provides for at least the largest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amounts provided under applicable State law, nationally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized accrediting agency requirements approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, or the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation for qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, as described in the statute. The Secretary asserts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the individual calculation of all possible refunds for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawing student is the only possible means by which an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution can determine which refund calculation provides the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest amount, as required by the statute. The Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploring the development by the Department of software for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional use. The Secretary believes the equity to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student provided by the law and the proposed rule override the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters' concerns of burden and potential confusion, and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to provide ample direction and guidance on refunds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions in the form of examples, Dear Colleague Letters, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters believed the requirements of Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A are too cumbersome and should be replaced with a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable policy. Three commenters believed the Appendix A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are intrusive and extend beyond the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute, resulting in excessive burden and cost for institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters suggested Appendix A should be a guideline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem-free institutions, required only of institutions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated compliance problems. Two commenters suggested all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions should be required to follow the guidelines of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A, thereby eliminating all the other detailed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent refund requirements proposed in the February 28, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM. Four commenters asserted that institutions have already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted procedures in line with the Appendix A guidance and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further intrusion on the part of the Secretary is unnecessary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unjustifiable. The commenters believed institutions have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethical means to decide these issues among themselves and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes the Amendments of 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly give every student who receives Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance_not just those students who attend institutions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance problems_the right to a fair and equitable refund as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in the statute. The Secretary is concerned, as discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, with instances wherein an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's State and accrediting agency do not have specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund policies and a particular student is not entitled to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund. In such a case, a loophole exists and the law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers no alternative standard by which to ensure the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a fair and equitable refund. Consistent with existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs regulations, the Secretary intends to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A as an acceptable refund standard in the absence of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pro rata Refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed the 60 percent point in time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for the purposes of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund requirement), when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in clock hours, should be calculated using the hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled instead of the proposed use of hours completed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student. Two commenters specifically referred to the statute's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept of elapsed time, stating that the treatment proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the February 28, 1994 NPRM is in conflict with the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier guidance and the intent of the law. All of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters believed the costs of providing education are fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each day a class is offered, regardless of an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's attendance. The commenters further suggested the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is openly discriminating against clock-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions by allowing credit-hour institutions to figure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 percent point in time using weeks, while insisting that clock-hour institutions consider individual students' rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress. Two commenters suggested the Secretary allow clock-hour institutions to include excused absences and repeated hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the total hours completed by a student. One commenter noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the determination of the 60 percent point in time conflicts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the determination of the portion of the enrollment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that remains for the purposes of calculating a refund after an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has determined that a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated. This commenter believed these two determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be simple and consistent with one another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sadashi Kiyoda] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 7 April -- It was disclosed recently that  the DPRK is building large missile launching sites in areas near  the Chinese border. This was disclosed to an ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter by former North Korean Lieutenant Yim Yong-son who has  taken refuge in the ROK. Reportedly, the DPRK chose the areas  thinking that other countries would not dare to attack the sites  for fear of bombing China by mistake.    Former Lieutenant Yim worked at the military construction  bureau in Pyongyang till he defected to the ROK last September.  According to his fellow soldier who was engaged in the  construction of missile bases, the launch sites are located  mainly in the eastern coastal areas, including North Hamgyong  and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan City. Recently, however, the  DPRK started to construct missile sites along the Chinese  border. It is said that about 5,000 people are working at the  sites at Chunggangjin in Changang Province and that the job will  be completed next year. Former Lieutenant Yim said: "I heard  that the DPRK selected the areas presuming that it would be  difficult for the United States and the ROK to launch an attack  in time of emergency for fear of hitting China by accident."</p>

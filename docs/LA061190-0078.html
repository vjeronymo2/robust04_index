			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: AGASSI EVOKES NO ECSTASY FOR FASHION CRITIC  </P> <P> Philippe Chatrier, president of the French tennis federation, said during the  French Open that he would like to ban the colorful clothes worn by Andre  Agassi, among others, in favor of the traditional white that is worn at  Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Agassi called the federation members "bozos," and Thomas Bonk of The Times  called Chatrier "Agassi's Mr. Blackwell."  </P> <P> What does the real Mr. Blackwell think of Agassi's wardrobe?  </P> <P> In the February issue of Tennis magazine, the well-known fashion critic said of  Agassi: "Looks like he missed the last train to Woodstock. With neon-colored  spandex worn under denim-look shorts, he's tennis' flower child gone to seed."  </P> <P> Add fashion: Other opinions from Mr. Blackwell:  </P> <P>  -- On Martina Navratilova: "Truly frightening. In her leather-appliqued skirts  and '70s wire-rim eyeglasses, she's the Tootsie of tennis."  </P> <P>  -- On Stefan Edberg: "Ruins his matinee-idol looks with baggy tie-dyed trash.  Dresses for surfing, not serving."  </P> <P>  -- On Zina Garrison: "Foghorns are not this loud."  </P> <P> Last add fashion: Mr. Blackwell actually had good things to say about the  fashion sense of several players, including:  </P> <P>  -- Gabriela Sabatini: "Drop-dead dazzling, period."  </P> <P>  -- Chris Evert: "Feminine perfection. The queen of American tennis has a  romantic, stylish touch. She also has one of the best senses of on-court color  of any player, male or female."  </P> <P> Trivia time: How many former UCLA players are playing in the major leagues?  </P> <P> Lips are sealed: Sorcerers in Cameroon who publicly predicted a 1-0 victory for  the Indomitable Lions over Argentina in the opening game of the World Cup  soccer tournament refused to foretell the outcome of Cameroon's next game,  Thursday against Romania.  </P> <P> Wait a minute: Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, asked by Sport magazine to name  his favorite films, said: "Lethal Weapon I and II. They were great  action-packed films filled with blood and guts."  </P> <P> And his least favorite?  </P> <P> "All of the Friday the 13th movies. I wish I could put an end to all that  nonsense."  </P> <P> What are the chances?: Asked about her 5-month-old son, Marcus Gastineau, whose  father is former New York Jet Mark Gastineau, actress Brigitte Nielsen told  Newsweek: "He's a very big boy, very strong, but I won't guide him in one  direction. I can't say he'll be a football player. He may be a computer  scientist."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Seven -- Todd Zeile of the St. Louis Cardinals, Tim Leary of the  New York Yankees, Dave Schmidt of the Montreal Expos, Mike Gallego of the  Oakland Athletics, Don Slaught of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Shane Mack of the  Minnesota Twins and Matt Young of the Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Oklahoma State Coach Gary Ward, whose team averaged almost 12 runs  and batted .390 in the College World Series before losing to Georgia, 2-1, in  the championship game: "When you only score one and get five hits, you look at  your offense and say, 'Hey, where are the bats? Where's the beef?' " JERRY  CROWE  </P></p>

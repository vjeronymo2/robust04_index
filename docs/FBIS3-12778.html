Now, over 50 years after it was established,  this international organization's activities are contrary to the  objectives that have been stated in the UN Charter. Our  political correspondent interviewed our country's permanent  representative at the United Nations, who is in Tehran now to  discuss the United Nations' actions on world events during  recent years.    [Kamal] Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative,  said it is disturbing that the United Nations follows U.S.  policies and stressed that the United Nations has become more  like a pressure lever. Citing an example of how the United  Nations follows U.S. policies, he referred to its stances on  Iraq, Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and said: Since U.S.  interests were involved in the Iraqi and Somali problems, the UN  presence was strong. But, when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the passage of two years since the problem started, it has  taken no serious step against the Serbs.    Elsewhere in his interview, our country's permanent UN  representative discussed how the United Nations uses human  rights in its approach to various countries and said:    [Begin recording] [Kharrazi] Human rights has been turned  into a political instrument and everyone, that is, the  representatives of the various countries at the United Nations,  knows the human rights issue is a political instrument, not a  real problem, and that the stance on this issue is very  selective. One country is selected for political reasons so  that pressure is exerted on it and the United Nations examines  human rights in it, while the member countries know that, say,  the Iranian human rights situation cannot be compared with that  in many countries nearby. They know this. But in their  political transactions and under the pressure and influence of  these countries, they do not vote in our favor. And this is  because the approach to human rights in general is a political  one.    Basically speaking, we should note one point: The United  Nations is not a house of justice where everything is based on  justice. The United Nations, as I said, is a political club in  which the political interests of countries play a determining  role. In countries' political transactions among themselves  they may vote for something. They may not necessarily believe  in the vote they cast, but they justify their vote on the basis  of their own political interests. [end recording]    In this interview, Kharrazi also referred to the UN Security  Council's procrastination over dealing with the recent crime by  the Zionists at al-Khalil and pointed out: Such approaches have  led the Third World members of the United Nations to demand that  the Security Council hold open sessions and to the countries of  the south forming a committee to examine the Security Council's  actions.</p>

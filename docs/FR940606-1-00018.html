			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) A final determination to deny any request for an extension submitted under either &sect;63.6(i)(4) or &sect;63.6(i)(5) will be made within 60 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made, rather than 30 calendar days as provided for in &sect;63.6(i)(12)(iv) and &sect;63.6(i)(13)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed rule requires each owner or operator who uses a control device or equipment to control HAP emissions to prepare an operation and maintenance plan in accordance with &sect;63.6 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the information required in &sect;63.6, the proposed rule requires that the owner or operator of the control device or equipment include the following information: (1) The operation and maintenance criteria for each air pollution control device or equipment, including a standardized checklist to document the operation and maintenance of the equipment; (2) a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions and for reporting them immediately to supervisory personnel; and (3) procedures to be followed to ensure that equipment or process malfunctions due to poor maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ibid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general standards also state that an owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device or equipment not listed in the proposed rule must submit to the Administrator for approval a description of the device, test data verifying the performance of the device or equipment for HAP and/or VOC emissions, appropriate operating parameters that would be monitored to establish compliance with the proposed standards, and a copy of the inspection and maintenance plan required under &sect;63.6 of 40 CFR part 63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, &sect;63.6(g) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63 allows an owner or operator of an affected source to use alternative means of compliance. This allows the development and use of new technology not known or not demonstrated at the time the rule was promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The affected sources for the proposed standards are defined as follows: (1) Each cleaning operation (all hand-wipe cleaning operations constitute an affected source, each spray gun cleaning operation constitutes an affected source, and all flush cleaning operations constitute an affected source); (2) each primer application operation, which includes all primer applications at the facility; (3) each topcoat application operation, which includes all topcoat applications at the facility; (4) each depainting operation, which includes all depainting of the outer surface of aerospace vehicles at the facility; (5) each chemical milling maskant application operation, which includes all chemical milling maskant applications at the facility for subsequent use in Type II chemical milling etchants; and (6) each waste storage and handling operation, which includes all waste handling and storage at the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standards also specify that HAP-containing waste that is subject to the provisions of RCRA would not be subject to the waste handling and storage requirements of the proposed standards. The EPA included this provision so that the proposed standards would not require less strict handling and storage of waste than the RCRA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs summarize the proposed standards for each affected source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cleaning Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards for the cleaning operation, including those specific to hand-wipe, spray gun, and flush cleaning operations, would apply to all new and existing affected sources. The proposed standards would require that all fresh and spent cleaning solvents be stored in closed containers and that solvent-laden cloth, paper, or other material be placed in bags or other closed containers immediately after use. The bags or containers would be required to be kept closed at all times (except when depositing or removing material) and of such design so as to contain the vapors of the cleaning solvent. In addition, the proposed standards would require the owner or operator to implement handling and transfer procedures to minimize spills during filling and transferring the cleaning solvent to or from enclosed systems, vats, waste containers, and other cleaning operation equipment that holds or stores fresh or spent cleaning solvents. The above requirements are known collectively as housekeeping measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standards for the hand-wipe cleaning operation would require the use of a cleaning solvent that conforms to the approved composition list detailed in Table 3 or a cleaning solvent that has a vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) at 20 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (24.1 in.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Due to the nonpayment of a large debt for natural  gas consumption and delivery, the supply of natural gas to the  republic was reduced by 60 percent as of 27 June 1994.    Instead of receiving 7.5m cubic meters of gas a day, the  republic will now be receiving 3.0m cubic meters. The Sakgazi  Department will distribute this limited supply among vital  installations in the republic, including Tbilisi power station,  which will be receiving 1.0m cubic meters of gas a day, instead  of the required 3.0m cubic meters.    All supplies of natural gas to eastern and western Georgian  regions and to the Kartli and Kvemo Kartli zones will be stopped  as of today.    As soon as the situation improves the Sakgazi Department  will  take measures to resume the normal supply of gas.</p>

The train has left. The nomination of  aspiring candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council of Ukraine  ended on 26 January. According to the Law on Elections, the  collection of signatures, and registrations, will be conducted  until 10 February, but the number of aspirants can only  decrease, not increase. Those who collected 300 signatures and  paid the entry fee in the amount of five minimum wages have  already taken their place on the train, have arranged their  baggage, and have started to look hard at their fellow travelers.    Whom do we see among the "passengers?" In what coaches and  compartments have they settled? What kind of ties have bound  their unions, and have the blocs not started to squabble among  each other?    Alas, it appears that there will be no intimate groups on  this train. Although it is still early to reach conclusions, the  first results of the nominations show however that groups of  very diverse colors have been sorted out. Thus, for each of the  34 electoral districts of the Dnepropetrovsk region there are  six aspirants on average; moreover, the voters proposed 129  persons, labor collectives--58, but parties and movements--only  17. It is noteworthy that among the aspirants about 30 are  managers of enterprises, kolkhozes, and sovkhozes, 21 are  representatives of commercial structures, 13 are unemployed, and  only eight are workers.    As a rule, the "oldsters" are going into battle. Among the  aspirants we see Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; Sergey Pravdenko, editor in  chief of the newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY; Valeriy Pustovoytenko,  deputy chairman of the board of the Expobank; and also seven  current people's deputies.    The situation is the same in the other oblasts. But the  number of aspirants differs in them: It is either feast or  famine. While in Galicia and generally in western Ukraine the  districts are "overpopulated," they have 20 each, and even 30  aspirants in the Crimea (which made it possible for V. Chornovil  to accurately call these districts "fraternal graves"); for  example, in some of the districts, alas, there are none.    As for the ties and blocs, there is complete confusion here  also. Created at the end of last year by Rukh [Popular Movement  of Ukraine], the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces],  and the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party], the Council of  Democratic Organizations with a permanently operating staff  proved to be built on sand. "The separate nominations of  candidates of the bloc and Rukh may serve as an example that not  everything is in order in the camp of the democrats--it divides  the united forces of the democrats," complains Levko Lukyanenko,  cochairman of the staff.    Everything comes down to the fact that the ambitions of the  national-democrats exceed their ammunition. The managers of Rukh  themselves admit that it is not party but personal aspects that  come to the forefront in the election campaign. "We do not have  a political party," thinks Sergey Golovatyy, "but there are  clubs--the Lukyanenko, Chornovil, Pavlychko, and Moroz clubs."  Independent observers think that Rukh is now striving to win the  elections only with its own forces, without considering the  needs of its Council partners, inasmuch as it is not confident  of the effectiveness of joint actions. And already now a futile  debate has started regarding who was the first to start to put  whom down.    "One sees an interesting alliance of our right-wingers and  the party in power," says Vyacheslav Chornovil. "They are coming  out against Rukh in order not to let them take those 20-25  percent that we set our sights on. Some national democrats are  also being used for this." Its political opponents are holding  the directly opposite opinion. "Rukh's wish is to see to it that  a representative of Rukh and the KNDS is not simultaneously on  the ballot in one district--this is a declaration that is not  backed by anything," says Larysa Skoryk.    It appears that the interregional bloc of Volodymyr  Hrynyov-Leonid Kuchma feels most comfortable of all in the  "train." "Our candidates," declared Hrynyov, "are prepared to  cooperate without quarrels and splits in the organs of state  authority as well." This bloc is oriented on the southeast  region, and stands for the conduct of market reforms, but one of  the points of its program envisions introduction of the Russian  language as the second state language.    It is also impossible to disregard the bloc of Volodymyr  Lanovyy with private entrepreneurs and free trade unions.  Lanovyy thinks that Kuchma's program generally does not talk  about market reforms and therefore is counterposing his own  program, whose keystone is privatization. Lanovyy's relationship  with the miners' trade union weakens the position of parties  that are traditionally influential in the Donbass--Merkulov's  Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The balance worked out by  Lanovyy between the trade unionists and the bankers from Inko  and Pravex makes it possible for him to stand "on his own two  feet" immediately.    He also does not overestimate the role of the trade unions  themselves which, according to the Law on Elections, and in  particular the statute on labor collectives, have gained an  opportunity to really influence the election process. However,  trade union leaders treat with skepticism the idea of  establishing a bloc with political parties. "Political forces  are engaged in what is not even an intraparty or interparty  fight but more of a squabble," says Aleksandr Mril, chairman of  the executive committee of the association Free Trade Unions of  Ukraine. "They are waging a fight for seats, for some particle  of power. We have one objective--the democratization of society,  reforms, and a market--but the approaches and paths are  absolutely different. We think that people should be helped at  least regarding bread. But they do not consider that people have  been reduced to despair."    In the opinion of political scientists, a bloc has also not  been established between the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant  Parties. Already at the very beginning, Yevgeniy Marmazov,  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Ukraine, declared that "we will not form a bloc with anyone, but  the Communist, Socialist, and Peasant Parties will help each  other." And it appears it was that way at the beginning. For  example, these parties did not allocate their aspirants in  Donetsk according to districts, but proposed that the voters  vote according to lists so that the Communists and Socialists  would be able to select candidates together in a majority of the  districts. This practice began to spread to other regions also,  and, judging by everything, it did not last long. In some  districts the voters will have to make a choice between the  Socialists and Communists.</p>

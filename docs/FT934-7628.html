			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Romanian demo demands reform SOME 40,000 Romanian union members yesterday marched through Bucharest demanding the government speed up market-led reforms or resign, writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest. The march, organised by the CNSLR-Fratia confederation, which represents a third of the workforce, was one of the largest such demonstrations since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in 1989. An 11-point statement demanded that the government - a left-wing minority which includes many senior former communists - begin real privatisation and restructuring of the state sector; invest in public works and infrastructure projects; take concrete steps to fight corruption; develop a better social security system; and establish the minimum wage at 60 per cent of the average wage.</p>

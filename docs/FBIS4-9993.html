			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 3 Apr (EFE) -- The immediate return of Peru to  the trade integration program of the Andean Regional Group  (Gran) was discarded today by Peruvian Integration Minister  Liliana Canale.    Beside Peru, the Gran includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,  and Venezuela.    Minister Canale left for Caracas to attend a meeting of the  Cartagena Accord Commission. She said Peru will resume all its  commitments in the Gran "as distortions affecting regional trade  are eliminated."    Canale thus alluded to the fact that Peru's partners in the  Gran have an external common tariff of four different scales (5,  10, 15, and 25 percent) while Peru virtually has one 15 percent  rate.    Before leaving, Canale said: "Instead of thinking of an  urgent return to the group, we must consider how to strengthen  Andean trade." She added: "We will consider returning as tariff  distortions are eliminated."    Peru suspended its participation in the commercial program  of  the Gran in August 1992, with the agreement of its partners,  until December 1993 when it requested an indefinite extension.    Meanwhile, Peruvian trade with the other four members of the  group continues through bilateral agreements which, according to  Canale, will be strengthened in the next few months.</p>

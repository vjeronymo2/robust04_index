			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  ANIMAL SANCTUARY MAY BE ELIMINATED  </P> <P> A report to the Los Angeles County Small Craft Harbor Commission recommends  elimination of a makeshift sanctuary for abandoned bunnies, baby chicks and  ducklings in a Marina del Rey flood control basin.  </P> <P> Commissioner Mark Nathanson, who conducted a public hearing on the matter in  October, said in the report that the commission should remove the animals from  the 10.5-acre Oxford Flood Control Basin.  </P> <P> County officials said that people tired of bunnies, baby chicks and ducklings  that were given as gifts on Christmas and Easter began dumping the creatures in  the basin about 10 years ago. In 1982, volunteers began feeding and caring for  the abandoned birds and animals.  </P> <P> Some nearby residents, complaining of noise and odors, have asked county  officials to remove the animals.  </P> <P> The commission will consider the matter on Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spanish closure holds back Baris Baris Holdings, which installs passive fire protection and drying systems, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 351,000 in the year ended February 28 1993. UK operations continued to perform well, but the year was affected by the closure of the unprofitable Spanish operation in the second half. Total losses incurred there, including closure costs, were Pounds 721,000, less a net tax credit of Pounds 363,000. There were earnings per share of 0.2p (losses 13.3p) but no dividend is being paid (2p interim last time). Mr Robert Smith, chairman, said price competition remained fierce and led to a reduction in margins on continuing activities from 17.4 per cent to 18.3 per cent. He did not envisage a reversal of that trend over the next year and, with the reduced amount of work available, it was likely to effect the gross profit in the current year. Current order book was Pounds 9m, against Pounds 14m last year, while inquiry levels were down from Pounds 64m to Pounds 48m. A German subsidiary has been formed to exploit a market where margins were currently higher than in the UK and which should provide a stable work load over the medium term. A substantial contract had recently been won.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Rail union to decide on stepping up dispute Leaders of the RMT transport union will meet on Monday to decide whether to escalate the dispute involving railway signal staff, who yesterday staged their third one-day strike. The following day, Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, and Mr Bob Horton, the Railtrack chairman, will give evidence to the Commons employment committee on the dispute. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, faces a potentially embarrassing grilling by the committee the following week on the government's intervention in the rail pay negotiations. The RMT executive meets against a background of continuing deadlock after the collapse of peace talks earlier this week. One option under serious consideration at the meeting will be to escalate stoppages from one day a week to two days a week. A further 24-hour strike is already planned for next Wednesday. The three 24-hour stoppages so far have cost Railtrack about Pounds 30m in lost revenue. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, told delegates at the RMT's annual conference in Liverpool yesterday that the signalling grades remained solidly behind strike action. 'I regret the ongoing inconvenience to the public and I want to get my members back to work with a just settlement,' he said. 'But I don't see where an easy answer is going to come from at the moment.' In a letter sent to the signalling staff last night he said they had 'already given more than enough' in efficiency improvements. 'Railtrack must now pay the bill owed for past and present productivity.' Mr Knapp said the union had spent the past four weeks trying to resolve the dispute, and accused Railtrack of refusing to negotiate seriously. 'They will not recognise the massive savings you have already given to the railway,' he wrote. 'This debacle has shown management to be bungling, incompetent and out of touch with your aspirations.' A statement from the RMT said that Railtrack's latest package for the signalling staff tabled at Acas, the conciliation service, had taken the negotiations 'several steps backwards'. Three weeks ago, the union said, the company had offered 5.7 per cent on basic rates - now it was offering conditional average rises of 3.5 per cent in actual earnings. The RMT said Railtrack was now demanding commitments from the union on future productivity and restructuring that 'allowed no scope for negotiation on principles and only restricted negotiation on detail'. Mr Knapp told the RMT conference that he viewed 'with growing alarm' the use of managers to operate the signalling system during the one-day strikes. 'We are not operating a safe railway today,' he said. Railtrack denied last night that safety had been put at risk on the railways. It said all staff operating signalling boxes during the strikes were either non-union signalling staff or qualified supervisors and managers and that staffing arrangements were in line with laid-down safety criteria. Mr Greville Janner, the Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee, said the government's role in the dispute would be 'one of the prime questions' for Mr MacGregor to answer when he appeared before the committee. 'The purpose of this exercise is to try to find out what has gone wrong and how it can be put right,' Mr Janner said. 'This is a strike that has vast effects on the public, but all the efforts to solve it have been in private.'</p>

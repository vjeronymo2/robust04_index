			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Accord on Black Sea fleet The presidents of Russia and Ukraine yesterday said they planned to sign a new agreement on the Black Sea fleet which would settle its disputed future. 'We are determined to conclude talks on the Black Sea fleet as soon as possible and to sign an agreement which will fully meet the interests of the fraternal Russian and Ukrainian nations,' said Mr Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine's newly elected Mr Leonid Kuchma in a joint statement reported by Itar-Tass news agency. The row over ownership of the 800-vessel fleet is one of several that have troubled relations between Russia and Ukraine since break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Mr Yeltsin told Mr Kuchma soon after his victory over President Leonid Kravchuk that he hoped his election would lead to an improvement in ties between Moscow and Kiev. Mr Kuchma said during his campaign Russia should be granted a lease on the Sevastopol naval base in the Crimea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z. Radovanovic: "To Return What Has Unfairly Been </F> Taken Away"]    [Text] In addition to continuous internal conflicts and  standstills caused by workers' stoppages and demands for the  resignation of the management, the oldest Serbian factory --  Zastava Special Purpose Production -- has been burdened for a  long time by irregular conditions of production at various  levels, as well as by uncertainty regarding the further  manufacture of arms for the needs of a reduced Yugoslav Army.    Last year Zastava Special Purpose Production factory, that  makes up a quarter of the Yugoslav arms production in terms of  number of employees and existing capacities, was one of few  Yugoslav factories that had been working regularly and the  business had been running rather successfully, despite all  subjective and objective circumstances and difficulties. Hence  the rightful demands to the government that it publicly and  clearly states the prospects of further development of the  special purpose production, as well as the future of the factory  itself.    "This year almost no capacities of the special purpose  production have been operative, which is not only because they  are outdated, but also because the budget does not allocate  enough funds for this kind of production. I do not think it  would be good to allow this system to die, because in that case  almost 1,300 workers would be out of work," Vukasin Filipovic,  director general of the factory, recently warned Nikola  Sainovic, deputy prime minister of the Federal Government, and a  group of republican officials.    Director Filipovic underlined that a vital interest to the  arms manufacturers in Kragujevac is to take over several  production lines from the arms factory in Travnik, Bosnia, such  as the production of artillery, howitzers, tank ammunition, and  so forth. This would be also necessary because nowhere in the  FRY, except partly in Kragujevac, are there capacities developed  for such a kind of production, while their development would  demand new investment.    The demands by the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac for  the  takeover of a considerable part of the Bosnian program of  special purpose production also reveal a certain portion of  nostalgia for the prestigious century-and-a-half tradition of  the local Military-Technological Institute, which became famous  throughout the world for the Kokinka rifles and other infantry  and artillery weapons that were manufactured here. For that  reason the manufacturers particularly stress that the production  of artillery, howitzers, and other weapons was moved from  Kragujevac to Travnik immediately after World War II, so it  would be fair to return to them what was unjustly and unfairly  taken away from them.    "There are some pressures that the production line from  Travnik should be relocated to the Lola factory in Zeleznik.  Lola, however, does not have any tradition, while it is not  ready either in terms of workforce, or in any other way, to take  over that sort of production," Filipovic says.    In addition, it is also demanded from the government to  force  the payment of debts upon Cuba, Ethiopia, Angola, and some other  countries to which Zastava exported goods worth $71 million.  "The Yugoslav Government made such business arrangements, so it  is obliged to make sure that the goods are eventually paid for,"  the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac demand.</p>

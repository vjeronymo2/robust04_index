			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Irish government will support a referendum to amend its territorial claim over Northern Ireland MR DAVID ANDREWS, the Irish foreign minister, has indicated that his government will support a referendum to amend its territorial claim over Northern Ireland, if 'a fair and honourable accommodation' can be reached between unionists and nationalists in the talks on the province's future. That might mean rewriting Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Irish constitution that lay claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland. The round-table talks - which will make an historic move to Dublin today - will be attended by the British and Irish governments, and three of the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The hardline Democratic Unionist party said on Friday that it would not be sending a delegation to Dublin, arguing that the Irish government had not shown flexibility on its territorial claim. However, a statement to unionist leaders in Stormont last Friday by Mr Andrews - leaked to Sunday newspapers in Dublin and Belfast - indicates that the Irish government said it was prepared to go ahead with a referendum in the context of an overall settlement.</p>

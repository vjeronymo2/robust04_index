			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Gilat: "`There Will Be No Civil War in the </F> Gaza Strip'"]    [Text] Spirits in the Gaza Strip were markedly low last  Wednesday [6 April] compared with the week of euphoria  experienced at the sight of the accelerated IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] withdrawal from the Strip. The Islamic Jihad called for  the monthly general strike as it does on the 6th of every month,  reminding the locals that the intifadah is, in fact, not over.  The streets were covered with rocks and the remains of burned  tires.    The Palestinians failed to show up for the ceremony the IDF  had prepared at the entrance to the al-Shati' refugee camp to  hand over the police building. The disappointed Israeli  policemen quickly folded up the refreshment tables. The  disappointed residents started to slowly move away as IDF  soldiers began pushing them with increasing determination,  having no choice as the friction became intolerable.    Dozens of local residents crowded the gates of the Bayt  Lahiya Civil Administration offices, seeking exit permits to  Israel, while giant cranes lifted the barracks one by one. It  looked as if all that will be left there soon will be the long  line of unsolved problems.    In the afternoon, when the reports on the 'Afula car bomb  started coming in, my taxi driver's face turned gray. He  recalled the preintifadah days "when we used to work at a steak  house in Rishon Leziyyon from morning till night and go home to  the Strip once a week. It was quiet and good." From his point  of view, a life of exploitation and humiliation is better that  the current situation. "Now they will expand the closure," he  said with concern. "You will leave, and we will remain here  between the fences. What will we have? All the space between  Gaza and Rafah. You can drive through our entire autonomy and  the car engine will not even warm up."    Twilight is the hour of great hopes and of fears. At the PLO  headquarters in the Rimal neighborhood, the deportees who  returned the day before through the Rafah crossing repeatedly  hug their friends at the local command. There is hope in their  eyes. They are certain the road is leading to the establishment  of a state.    Most of the deportees maintained daily contacts with the  Gaza  Strip. While in Tunis, Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the Fatah  Hawks, was a member of the Gaza committee which liaised between  Chairman 'Arafat and his comrades in the field. Upon arrival,  he was appointed chairman of the liaison committee with the IDF.  As soon as he arrived at the border crossing, he held a  business meeting with Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander  of the IDF forces in the Gaza Strip and his Israeli counterpart.  A business meeting between two practical men. As a rule, the  higher you go in the level of command, the more people speak to  the point and not in slogans.    Midhat al-Salim, who had been serving a life sentence, was  released in the Jibril deal, arrested time and again, and  deported in early 1991. He returned yesterday and already wants  to start working. He would rather not talk about the past and  would not discuss the reason he was given a life sentence. All  he would say is that he used to be a member of one the top  secret squads operating in the Gaza Strip in the 1980's, named  after Rafiq Salama, who, according to him, was killed on 25  December 1990. He pronounces the date in the way a soldier  would state his serial number.    "It is unhealthy to discuss the past," al-Salim says. "We do  not wish to intimidate the Israelis. In the past, I acted like  a soldier fighting for peace, and I am going to fight for peace  now as well." What will he do now? Al-Salim does not yet have  an official assignment but says that the bulk of his work will  be against "our extremists." A local Shin Bet? He prefers not  to use this word. "We will reach an understanding with them," he  assures me. "They will know their limitations." It is to be  assumed that he means Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].    Al-Salim has no difficulties assimilating back into the  Gaza Strip after being away for three years. Sufyan  Abu-Zayidah, a local Fatah leader, was a member of the same  terror squad with him.    Abu-Zayidah, an eloquent person, carefully puts forth his  ideas in Hebrew. Alert to language nuances, he tries to  introduce to the Israeli media the idea of peace and  coexistence. In an interview he granted Karmela Menashe of Qol  Yisra'el, he asked that she say at the end "the PLO offices,  Gaza," and not "the PLO offices in Gaza."    His office and the office of the Arab affairs adviser at the  Civil Administration maintain frequent fax communication. When  asked, Abu-Zayidah says that in the autonomy, he will be the  Jewish affairs adviser.    Abu-Zayidah shares an office at the central PLO building  with  Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq. There is no clear distribution of  authorities between them; everything is being done in  cooperation, but Abu- Zayidah focuses more on coordination with  the IDF, while 'Abd-al-Raziq is primarily engaged in  coordinating with the other Palestinian organizations in the  Strip, including Hamas.    He is an impressive man, age 39 but looks older. He was  released from prison only four months ago, shortly before  completing a 20-year prison term, in response to a special  request from Yasir 'Arafat. He was appointed a member of the  Fatah leadership while in the Nafha prison. There, together  with jailed Hamas leaders, he signed a document regulating  coordinated operations in the Gaza Strip by the two  organizations. As is well known, the Gaza Strip is being run  from the city and from prisons.    'Abd-al-Raziq was a student in Lebanon when he joined Fatah.  After he returned from his studies, he prepared an explosive  charge and took it to Rishon Leziyyon to retaliate for the  killing of three Palestinian leaders in the al-Firdan operation  (he, too, utters the exact date this happened as if it were the  date he joined the army). The charge exploded in his hands, he  stresses; there were no Israeli casualties. He still carries  the scars of that day: numerous scars, a split lip sewn  together by undergoing plastic surgery several times, a twisted  hand. He has nothing but praise for the medical treatment he  received at Asaf Harofe Hospital.    In prison, he expanded his studies. He studied the history  of the Haganah and read the writings of Ben-Gurion, Rabin,  Dayan, and Begin -- all in Hebrew. He says that the books  influenced and encouraged him. "I was impressed by the  determination of those men, by their ability to reach their  goals despite the difficulties. It helped me through the  darkest days." To get to know Jewish history even better, he  took an Open University course called "From Jerusalem to Yavne."  He is better versed in the history of Yohanan Ben-Zakay and the  Roman rule than most Israelis.    You must have compared this with your situation, I  suggested.  You must have viewed the Palestinians as the Jews with the  Israeli occupation forces acting the part of the Romans.    "There is no comparison," Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says. "The  Romans were much worse. They tried to wipe out an entire  culture."    'Abd-al-Raziq is also very careful with his choice of words.  When I ask him to confirm that he was one of the leaders of the  "revolt of the security prisoners" staged in Israeli prisons, he  asks that I replace the word "revolt" with "struggle for  rights." What is the purpose of making such fine distinctions?  "It is important to be precise. We care very much about how  the Israeli public opinion reads us."    Why do you care so much about the Israeli public? Israel  will soon be out of here. Why not deal with your own public? I  asked.    "The Israeli public opinion is very important. Israel is a  democratic society. Public opinion will determine what will  take place here. It is important that you realize that we are  not extremists. We are sensible people who know what their  goals are. Naturally, our goal is an independent state, but it  is important to point out that this state will seek peace with  Israel. Without it, we stand no chance to exist. We need peace  for domestic and external reasons.    "Unfortunately, Palestinian public opinion is less important  at this time. We are not yet a democratic society. Our people  are motivated by emotions. Sometimes I have to speak to the  people's sentiments to promote our strategic goals. We have no  other option but to become a democratic society. Anyone who  fails to understand that understands nothing."    His remarks imply that he attributes the failure to  understand to the chief leaders in Tunis. 'Abd-al-Raziq is not  worried. They will understand. They have no choice. 'Arafat,  too, will understand. "So far, our organization itself has been  undemocratic," he admits. "The regime is undemocratic. In  fact, there is hardly any regime to speak of."    Conversations with former prisoners, who constitute the  local  Gaza leadership, are in some peculiar way easy and relaxed. I  am certain that IDF officers come across this daily. These are  people who lost their youth in prison, who were subjected to the  most rugged interrogations, who proved their character and  determination in the toughest tests possible. Lies do not  interest them, and the feeling that nothing could scare them any  more helps them to speak openly with both Major General Matan  Vilna'i and Yasir 'Arafat.    'Abd-al-Raziq says with indifference that he is not  concerned  about his future station or standing. 'Arafat may decide  whatever he likes; he does not depend on his decision. "I have  never been a man searching for a position. My position found  me." He estimates that whoever comes to rule Gaza will require  his qualifications -- his personality, ideological fortitude,  organizational skills, integrity, his excellent Hebrew, and his  understanding of the Israeli system and Israeli soul.  Invaluable assets.    The seminar "From Jerusalem to Yavne" taught him how  dangerous religious fanaticism is. He has a dream: to  establish a universal movement opposing religious fanaticism.  And he is the man who oversees the daily coordination with  Hamas.    "It is true," he says, "that we maintain an open  communication channel. I assure you: Hamas knows its place  perfectly well, and it knows that it should avoid starting a  civil w}F will return to Gaza. I can allay your fears: Even if  it happens -- and you know to what organization I belong and how  much I want my organization to do well -- even if Hamas comes to  power, it will happen democratically, while safeguarding  democratic values, because without democracy, we will all go  down here."    Authoritative Israeli sources also believe that Hamas will  not hinder the PLO and that it will play by the rules in the  hope of enlisting the support of the majority of the public, the  majority that does not identify with any side.    The prevailing opinion is that Hamas must not cause a  "fitnah." Fitnah, or civil strife, is a major taboo according to  the Koran. The practical implication of this Koran law is that  Hamas will have to avoid attacking inside the  Palestinian-controlled territory. As the PLO is in charge of  the Qatif Bloc settlers' security, a Hamas attack on the Qatif  settlers will force the PLO to shoot at Hamas members, possibly  pitching the entire system into a domestic war. The Hamas  leadership will seek to prevent such a development, IDF elements  estimate, for practical as well as ideological reasons. "There  must be no private militias, either on our or the other side,"  Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says.    Which means, I told him, that the Qatif Bloc settlers will  be  safer than Israelis anywhere.    "That is very possible," 'Abd-al-Raziq says seriously, "and  it naturally depends on them as well. We obviously do not want  them here; they should start preparing for a possible departure.  But it is equally obvious that we must succeed in carrying out  the task we have undertaken. If the Gaza First experiment  fails, we will never reach a permanent arrangement and  independence. And we want independence."    Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq and his colleagues understand the  reality. In Tunis, it is less understood. Nabil Sha'th placed  a mine on the negotiating table by demanding last Wednesday that  an armed and uniformed police force enter Gaza amid festive  processions. The IDF was opposed, as was the local leadership.  The locals understand very well that the deployment of an armed  Palestinian police force before it has been granted formal  powers will raise unattainable expectations. The locals prefer  the policemen to enter quietly, to remain inside their camps,  and to train until the right moment when are they able to take  up their posts.    Right now, there is talk of about 3,000 Palestine Liberation  Army [PLA] members. Thousands of locals enrolled at the  recruitment offices, but they have had no training as yet. They  will be unable to take up their posts for another two months.  Actually, 'Arafat's appointments, against which no one dares to  speak out, are more than surprising. The PLA generals have had  no operational experience, and their knowledge of the terrain is  minimal. Even 'Arafat's local appointment is odd: He appointed  Zakariyah al-Agha, an engineer, as head of Fatah in the Strip.  It is a worthy position, but in practice, it entails very few  powers. Al-Agha is preoccupied primarily with settling feuds  and conversing with journalists.    The PLO's offices in the Strip are situated in his private  residence in the Rimal neighborhood. Not to worry, al-Agha owns  another villa for his own use. He rarely makes an appearance at  the offices. He has nothing to look for among the determined  young people who populate the building. When the local leaders  waited for the returning deportees at the Rafah terminal, the  young people banded together, laughing and carrying on like a  bunch of reserve soldiers meeting after an operation. A  detached al-Agha remained standing alone by the door. He does  not belong to this generation; neither does 'Arafat. It is to  be hoped that he is sufficiently astute to give this generation  the role which it -- and only it -- can play in the process.    Israel is concerned about the security issue. The issue is  more or less closed. Yet civilian issues have hardly been  discussed at all, and they are a true time bomb. Israel did not  really invest in Gaza during its rule. A considerable part of  the taxes levied from the residents of the territories was used  to pay the Civil Administration personnel's salaries. The  Israeli command officers -- soon they will become mere  coordination officials -- had the rank of deputy directors and  the salaries to go with it. They are leaving the Strip. For a  while, they will work from the coordination offices in the Erez  checkpoint. The services will be left to the locals.    Some of the local administration officials have been  mistakenly labeled collaborators. It is to be hoped that  'Arafat will allow them to keep their jobs and that he will not  appoint his own people, who have no idea how the system  operates. "We will miss the administration yet," a local  resident, whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons, told  me. "In our system, everything is corrupt. You need to know  someone even to get yourself admitted to a hospital. If you do  not know anyone, you are dirt."    At the moment, people fear the Palestinian rule more than  the Israeli administration. For example, there is a Bedouin  family, from among the Beersheba refugees, that has been living  in Rimal since 1948. They built their house without a building  permit, as a matter of course. Several times the IDF issued  demolition orders, which were never executed. They are now  afraid that their 30-year tenure will be of no avail against the  interests of the PLO apparatus officials, who covet the  expensive land.    Almost every family in the Gaza refugee camps owes money to  the Electricity Corporation. The Civil Administration  occasionally cut off the power supply and then reconnected it.  Now the residents are afraid that the Palestinian regime will  cut it off because of its dire need for funds.    The health services are in very poor shape, for which Israel  is basically responsible. The al-Shifa' government hospital is  unable to provide much of the required medical treatment. There  is not a single oncology clinic in the entire Strip. In fact,  there is only one qualified oncologist. There is still no  agreement on how people will receive treatment in Israel.  People will simply die.    There is still no agreement on how Gaza laborers will work  in  Israel. The present bureaucracy will double and triple in size  when Palestinian rule takes over. There are no development or  welfare plans, and people are afraid that, at least at the  beginning, oppression will be worse than before.    The standard of living will drop. The more it will drop, the  less the population will support the peace process. Unless an  accelerated economic development process is launched, people  will be disenchanted with the PLO and cross over to Hamas,  augmenting its strength. A local resident told me: "When a man  does not have bread, what else does he have, except God?" At  present, Gaza Strip fundamentalists fear that they will be  persecuted, as they are in other Arab countries. But with  popular support, "Allah is great."    "I have as yet to see anything happening," says a local  young  man at one of the social clubs which cropped up after the Oslo  agreement. A club was established in each neighborhood. In the  future, they will be the foundation of political power. "In the  meantime, there is a curfew. I cannot go over to my brother's  after 2100. First we would like to see the PLO lift the curfew."</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Italians still worried by public finances MR Luigi Abete, the chairman of Italy's Confindustria employers' federation, last night summed up the mixed feelings of many business leaders to the surprise devaluation of the lira. The business community 'didn't ask for a devaluation of the lira, because without rigorous measures to restore public finances, devalution risks being counter-productive for the solution of so many national problems', he said. Virtually all Italy's leading businessmen have in recent weeks strongly supported the Bank of Italy's policy of defending existing exchange rates on anti-inflationary grounds. Though the steady rise in interest rates required in the past two months to defend the currency has been viewed with growing alarm, entrepreneurs have expressed strong support in public for the central bank's approach. Most have remained tactfully silent on the policies of Italy's EC partners. But Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computer group, last week launched a stinging attack on Bundesbank preoccupation with the domestic economy, leading to high interest rates which were creating recession elsewhere, he warned. Few others have been so public. Last month, Mr Giorgio Falck, one of the family owners of the Falck steel group and about the only prominent businessman publicly to call for devaluation, was roundly criticised in the media and by prominent counterparts for his comments. Devaluation is likely to have a mixed reaction on the stock market. Fears that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy  - who has repeatedly stressed central bank determination to defend the currency at all costs  - might resign could severely depress sentiment. 'If Ciampi resigns, the lira will come back under pressure straightaway and the devalution will have been a complete waste,' said one bank economist. He doubted the Bank of Italy would cut the key discount rate at which it lends to commercial banks  - raised by 1.75 percentage points to 15 per cent last week  - before the French referendum on Maastricht. But removal of months of uncertainty over Italy's currency could prove a tonic to the stock market, which has seen share prices tumble by around 27 per cent this year. Shares in some big companies have fallen below their nominal values as foreign investors liquidated holdings, partly because of devaluation fears. Some analysts have already been predicting that a cut in the value of the lira would help big companies such as Fiat, Olivetti and the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, which sell much production abroad and have been increasingly penalised by relatively high domestic costs.</p>

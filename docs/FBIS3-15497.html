In a speech to the Yeltsin-sponsored public chamber  discussing the plight of Russian-speaking communities in Baltic  states, Churkin said that in international law, Russia was  perfectly right to link any economic cooperation with those  countries to the treatment of Russian residents there.    "Of course, economic blockades or sanctions is not the best  of options, but it will be unrealistic to expect that Russia  will meet those countries half-way in the face of their  deliberate policy of discrimination against our compatriots", he  said.    Churkin said that any show of respect for members of the  Russian-speaking communities there would be met with  "understanding and response" in Russia.    In his words, Moscow works on the assumption that ensuring  human rights regardless of citizenship is a key element of  internationally-recognized standards. He pointed to LIthuania's  human rights record as an example.    Speaking in an interview with Interfax, Churkin stressed the  need to speed up the formation of a special government body  responsible for solving the problem of Russian communities in  former Soviet republics. He said the need for such a structure  was caused by the dimension of the problem itself and necessity  to rally effort by various departments. Churkin believes such a  body can operate under the wing of the foreign ministry though  as an independent organization.</p>

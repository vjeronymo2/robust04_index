			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: O'Reilly lifts stake in SA newspaper group Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing group controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, has lifted its stake in Argus Newspapers, the largest newspaper group in South Africa, from 30.1 per cent to 34.98 per cent, the maximum level permitted without triggering a full bid. The additional 2.2m shares, taking Independent's stake to a total of 15.8m shares, were bought for R25.8m (Pounds 4.5m), or R11.74 per share. This brings the total investment in the Argus group by Independent Newspapers to R181m since last July, when it bought its initial stake in a share-swap deal with Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and Anglo-American Corporation. Independent Newspapers is the largest single shareholder in Argus Newspapers. The only other significant shareholder is the Argus pension fund, which holds 10 per cent. Mr James Parkinson, group finance director of Independent Newspapers, said yesterday that a full bid for Argus Newspapers was not being contemplated.</p>

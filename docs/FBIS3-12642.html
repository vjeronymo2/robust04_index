A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington  negotiations are still going round in a vicious circle and that  the Israeli delegation continues to evade adherence to the peace  process, first and foremost the full withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and the other occupied territories. The official added  that the Washington negotiations have considerably and clearly  exposed Israel's hostile position toward the peace process.  "The Israelis continue to raise the same issues and provoke the  same obstacle with a view to prolonging the negotiations and  using the wasted time to circumvent the results of the Geneva  summit, get around the Security Council resolutions, and empty  them of any substance."    The official went on to say that Rabin continues to insist  on  the tone of secret negotiations at a high level with the aim of  torpedoing the negotiations and the U.S. initiative, eclipsing  the resolutions of international legitimacy, and practicing  blackmail against Syria, Lebanon, and the Arabs. Plus, Israel  is going to impose other impossible conditions for the sake of  playing for time and using the coming years in the service of  its settlement schemes.    The official called on the United States to adopt a firm  position so that the time will not be wasted, because Syria  cannot continue to engage in futile negotiations forever or  allow Israel to lie to world public opinion and say that it is  continuing the peace process merely to achieve its expansionist  schemes.    The official added that the peace process could collapse if  Israel continues to ignore Arab demands. And Israel must know  that there can be no peace in the region without Syria and that  no agreement concluded with Israel has any hope of continuing or  being implemented without Syria. Syria has a known and fixed  position, namely not to relinquish a single inch of its  territory or the other Arab territories. [passage omitted]</p>

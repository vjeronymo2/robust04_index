			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Virgin poised to sell 15% of games offshoot to Hasbro VIRGIN Communications, the holding company for Virgin Group's entertainment, broadcasting, publishing and production interests, yesterday said it would sell a 15 per cent stake in a subsidiary for about Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.8m) to Hasbro, the US toy company. The subsidiary, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, develops and publishes interactive entertainment games for Nintendo, Sega and several computer platforms. The company has licensed a number of Hasbro products in the last five years including the Monopoly and Risk board games. Virgin and Hasbro have also agreed to form a joint venture within Virgin Interactive to develop and market Hasbro's existing products and other properties. The Hasbro stake in Virgin Interactive, which is subject to regulatory approval, will dilute the holding of Mr Richard Branson, who controls the company. Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Interactive and Mr Branson's brother-in-law, said: 'The proceeds from Hasbro's investment will provide VIE with increased financial flexibility as strategic opportunities arise to expand the business.' The two companies plan to work together in product development, marketing and acquisitions.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems cool over Labour Maastricht plan THE PROSPECTS of as many as six more government defeats on the Maastricht bill appeared to be receding last night as senior Liberal Democrats indicated they were unlikely to support a string of non-wrecking Labour amendments. But government whips were still left facing a stormy passage when the bill returns for detailed Commons consideration tomorrow. At least two further Labour amendments - including its attempt to remove the protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out - were expected to secure Liberal Democrat support, making government defeats likely. Meanwhile, government hopes of speeding up the passage of the bill by carrying procedural motions extending debate into the small hours were also looking forlorn. By what are thought to be the Tory whips' own calculations, the government could still be some 20 short of the votes necessary to do this, even when the Liberal Democrats agree to side with them. Two weeks ago, the government suffered its first Commons defeat on any issue for about three years when MPs supported a minor Labour amendment to the Maastricht bill by a margin of 22 votes. And it suffered a fresh humiliation when the bill was last debated on March 12, deciding against calling a vote to extend the sitting after 10pm, despite hinting heavily that it planned to do so. The non-wrecking Labour amendments - which mainly focus on increasing the accountability to parliament of various European institutions and the Bank of England - could conceivably secure enough support to be carried even without the Lib Dems. But not all the 50 Tory rebels who government whips expect to vote against or abstain on procedural motions would be likely to rebel over these amendments. Hard-core rebels are expected to meet today to discuss tactics. The Liberal Democrats are not expected to decide on strategy until tomorrow. The party is believed to be leaning towards the view that Labour's accent on accountability risks distracting attention from the issue of how best to make European institutions more democratic.</p>

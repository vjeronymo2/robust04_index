Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi has warned of unparalleled  resistance should action be taken against opposition to the  April election.    "If the current election does actually run its course, and  is  finally declared a free and fair election, it will be because  democratic opposition has been stifled by the might of the  state," he said at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative  assembly [KLA] in Ulundi on Thursday [17 March] morning.    Mr Buthelezi said opposition to the interim constitution and  the elections which met with "draconian or Bophuthatswana-type  action" would spawn a struggle for liberation from African  National Congress [ANC]/National Party oppression, "which will  have no parallel in Africa".    There would no peace or democratic settlement until there  was  a settlement of kwaZulu issues. Mr Buthelezi said it appeared  to him that a free and fair election under the current  circumstances was impossible.    Speaking as kwaZulu's chief minister, Mr Buthelezi said the  SA Government and the ANC were producing a highly explosive  situation in the territory. He warned of an "uncontrolled and  unorchestrated internal political spontaneous combustion" in  kwaZulu.    "I'm talking about a Bophuthatswana-type explosion, but  unlike it as a result that it has not been orchestrated." He  charged the SA Government was party to the violence which ousted  Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, and questioned whether  it was the government's intention to do the same in kwaZulu.    Mr Buthelezi said the country was poised "on the very brink  of disaster...Let us join hands to ensure international  mediation runs its course as soon as possible in the interests  of peace, stability and justice".    He repeated that the IFP and kwaZulu government would  participate in the April poll if: mediation could take place  swiftly; certain amendments could to be made to the  constitution; and the party registration deadline and election  date could be reconsidered.    Mr Buthelezi reiterated that his constitutional demands  remained those proposed in the Freedom Alliance's yellow paper  of December last year.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Sheraton trumps Forte bid for Ciga Sheraton, the international hotels group owned by ITT of the US, last night emerged as the surprise buyer of Ciga, the troubled luxury hotels chain controlled by the Aga Khan. Sheraton's offer of about L900bn (Pounds 353m) easily topped the Pounds 270m bid from Forte, the UK hotel and restaurant chain, which had for some time been considered the front runner. Forte said it was asked last Monday if it could match Sheraton's offer but decided it would not do so. Few details of Sheraton's proposal emerged officially, amid surprise among Italian bankers that the group had been prepared to make such a high offer for the loss-making Ciga without looking closely at its books. But the offer is believed to involve a L940bn capital increase - corresponding to Ciga's outstanding short-term bank indebtedness, to be underwritten by its creditor banks. Assuming it obtains at least 50.1 per cent of the shares, Sheraton would then launch a public tender offer priced at between L720 and L740 a share for the banks' stake and any remaining shares floating on the market. Ciga's troubles stem mainly from its high debts, which now exceed L1,000bn, and the recession, which has sliced demand for five star hotel accommodation. The group has also suffered from an imbalanced portfolio of hotels, with too many properties bunched in the same cities. Attempts to remedy matters by selling some properties where it was over-represented coincided with the recession, and failed to attract buyers at the price levels Ciga expected. Forte's revised proposal had been made in tandem with the Quantum Fund, controlled by Mr George Soros, the US investor. Forte was to provide Pounds 33m and the Quantum Fund Pounds 135m. The balance was to have been made up with deferred payments over the next two to three years. Forte said that while it was disappointed not to have captured Ciga, it believed there would be other opportunities to purchase European hotels. It said its shareholders would not have thanked it for making a higher offer as Ciga was making a loss even before interest payments and depreciation and would have required major restructuring.</p>

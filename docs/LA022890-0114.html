			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> HOAG HOSPITAL EXPANSION IS TOPIC  </P> <P> A planned 21-year expansion of Hoag Hospital and areas along West Coast Highway  between Newport Boulevard and Superior Avenue will be the subject of a meeting  tonight of the West Newport Beach Assn.  </P> <P> Pete Foulke, senior vice president of the hospital, will discuss the  development, although specifics have not been determined, he said.  </P> <P> "This will more than double the size of the hospital and have major impact on  the community," said Bill Jennings, member of the ad hoc committee now being  formed by the association to study expansion issues. "It's both an asset and a  problem."  </P> <P> Jennings said he expects controversy regarding density of the project, which  will be under construction for more than two decades.  </P> <P> The meeting, open to all Newport Beach residents, will start at 7 p.m. in the  Newport Beach Council Chambers, 3300 Newport Blvd. LESLIE HERZOG  </P></p>

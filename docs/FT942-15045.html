			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Irish rail strike called off A threatened national rail strike in Ireland, due to have begun at the weekend, was called off at the 11th hour after management and unions agreed to arbitration by the country's Labour Court. The dispute is over changes to work practices and the introduction of new technology on Ireland's antiquated rail network. Forty staff had been suspended for refusing to participate in training courses on the new technology, but following Friday's agreement, they have now been reinstated and the management has decided to postpone for one month the introduction of a productivity package pending the Labour Court ruling. Irish Rail loses around IPounds 90m (Pounds 87m) a year and is estimated to require some IPounds 800m in new investment to modernise its rail network, rolling stock and signalling and ticketing systems.</p>

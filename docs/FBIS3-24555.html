Zhubr, Polytechnical  Institute, Kharkov; UDC539/264]    [Abstract] Cadmium telluride has been used successfully as  an absorptive coating on polycrystalline solar cells and as a  buffer coating on Si and GaAs single crystals used for growing  epitaxial HgCdTe films. In both cases high requirements are  imposed on the structure and optical properties of the CdTe  films. A basic technological problem lies in getting a  stoichiometric and structurally perfect film at the lowest  possible substrate temperatures. From an analysis of previous  work it was concluded that an ``ideal'' process requires use of  a beam of precipitating atoms having an energy of 5-50 eV per  atom in order to attain high surface mobility and formation of  dense and structurally perfect films. A recent trend in ion  technology utilizes beams of so-called intrinsic ions having a  high degree of ionization (1-10 percent) and relatively low  energies (100-500 eV per ion). In this connection, one of the  most promising methods for preparing semiconductor films appears  to be vacuum precipitation from an ion-molecular beam. In the  present work a study was made of the effect of the energy from a  beam of precipitated material on the structure and optical  properties of ion-molecular beam precipitated films of CdTe on  glass and single crystal silicon substrates. Optimum conditions  for obtaining precipitates of fully texturized, mirror-smooth,  and optically perfect films were determined, and the effects of  various interacting mechanisms of the intrinsic ions with the  condensate on the structure and optical properties of the  resulting films are discussed.

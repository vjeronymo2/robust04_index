			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Truth of the Matter: Is science all a bore? - Or do scientists make it seem boring? IN AUGUST 1838 the Rev Professor Adam Sedgwick went to Tynemouth to give a lecture on behalf of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. His lecture theatre was Tynemouth beach, his subject the surrounding and underlying rocks and his audience was mostly made up of local colliers - 3,000-4,000 of them. This was a remarkable event in its time, but seems even more remarkable now. One hesitates to impugn the minds of modern miners, but it is hard to imagine them turning out by the thousand for a geology field class. It is equally difficult to imagine a Cambridge professor today managing to hold such a vast lay audience - especially with slides, overhead projector and photocopied handouts. It will never be like that again. That is the lament which all scientists can justifiably rehearse. Sedgwick was (literally) at the cutting edge of modern geology. The sequences of the earth's surfaces now established in textbooks - the order of Cambrian and Silurian, for example - were then matters for passionate, friendship- wrecking debate. Fresh crops of fossils nourished their own thriving and inventive taxonomy. And up into the Welsh mountains with Sedgwick scrambled the young Charles Darwin, soon to become more of a household name than Mrs Beeton. All this predates the 'two cultures' mentality either described or fabricated by C P Snow some 30 years ago. Would any modern publisher be able to produce what was hugely successful in the last century - a guide to the Lake District, combining the geological analyses of Sedgwick with the poetical topography of William Wordsworth? Sedgwick duly did his stint as president of the British Association. David Weatherall, current president, made the blanket complaint during the association's latest gathering at Keele, that British society was 'anti-science'. This is a complaint heard regularly from university dons, and is often extended to describe Britain as an unfriendly habitat for any sort of intellectual, let alone the pure scientist. But Weatherall at least had the honesty to heap part of the blame on himself and his colleagues. Locked in their own impenetrable Argo, their peer-reviewed journals and their bubbling laboratories, scientists have become plain negligent at explaining themselves. In Weatherall's own field of medicine, there ought to be public excitement about new research. Perhaps not the pitch of excitement enjoyed by Sedgwick et al, but at least a significant awareness. Many common afflictions - arthritis for one - remain, after all, fundamentally mysterious. So why should we be excluded from the fun of discovery? Britain is not intrinsically an anti-science nation. Measuring public commitment is tricky, though it may be relatively consoling to David Weatherall that 50 per cent of Americans are said not to believe in the theory of evolution. But the people who put Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time into the best seller lists, whose children noisely throng the South Kensington museums, who ensure David Attenborough's faunal epics prime time on television, cannot be accused of lacking the basic willingness to be informed. The fault lies with those who refuse to inform. This issue is made topical by the failure of universities to fill places on science-based courses. It has also become personally contingent, as I undertake this autumn the editorship of The Cambridge Review, a journal which ought to provide a means of divulging all sorts of university research. But the biggest challenge of the job, according to the outgoing editors, is that scientists will not write. And so the principal energies of the university remain largely obscure to the public at large. One of the contributors to the recent Keele congress was a specialist in artificial intelligence. He has been trying to get computers to write novels, and has concluded that the next Flaubert will never be an Apple Mac. Disappointing news, then, to those scientists who prefer to remain mute. But the solution does lie in Flaubert's direction. It was demonstrated in 1967, when James Watson published a great account of his investigations into molecular structure with Francis Crick. The story of DNA would not be a story at all if it were not for Watson's use of the storyteller's craft. No one says that he misrepresents the actual research. But in The Double Helix he certainly exaggerates the personalities of himself, his collaborator, and their rivals. In short, he amalgamates the processes of scientific inquiry with the techniques of literary narrative. The DNA tale is presently being televised. It is to be hoped that it scores on our screens; and that more scientists will follow Watson's elementary lead.</p>

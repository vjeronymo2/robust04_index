			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 18--The newly-appointed  Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Prof  Rajendra Singh, on Friday described the Supreme Court judgment  regarding invocation of Article 356 of the Constitution to  dismiss State governments as "controversial" which needed  interpretation and elaboration by legal experts.    Addressing his first press conference after his elevation to  the top post in the RSS, Prof Singh, who is popularly known as  Rajju Bhayya, said his personal feeling was that the apex court  had not appreciated the depth of the issue. Article 356 had been  a part of the Constitution from the very beginning, whereas the  word "secularism" was introduced in the mid-70s during the  Emergency. The judgment appeared to place undue emphasis on this  later entrant into the Constitution. It was foolish for anyone  even to suggest that the majority community needs to be educated  about secularism, it being an integral part of the Indian  heritage, he said.    Dwelling on the concept of "Hindutva" as espoused by the  Sangh Parivar, Prof Singh said he welcomed the ongoing debate on  the subject. For him the word signified the entire spiritual and  cultural background of the country. It had nothing to do with  anyone's personal faith, but the general loyalty to the nation.  Unfortunately, there was a leadership in this country which did  not allow this to be appreciated by a section of the people, he  said.    Reiterating his organisation's commitment to persist with  the  Ayodhya movement, the RSS chief said construction of a temple at  Ayodhya would be the first priority even as it considered the  liberation of temples at Mathura and Varanasi as important.    Prof Singh, who maintained that the various wings of the  Sangh Parivar were totally independent of each other,  nonetheless willingly answered questions on various Bharatiya  Janata Party (BJP) leaders. He defended the BJP president, Mr  L.K. Advani's remarks abroad supporting the government's  economic policies. Criticism as an Opposition party did not mean  that one runs down his own country's government in foreign  countries. At the same time, it was not far off the mark that  the BJP did welcome some aspects of the ongoing liberalisation  process. It supported the simplification of procedures  internally but not the unhindered entry of multinationals into  the country. Definitely not for potato chips and coke, he said.    Mr A.B. Vajpayee had been sent by the government for the  human rights meet at Geneva because of his vast experience and  knowledge of foreign affairs and also because of his personal  contacts with leaders of different countries. His efforts to  ensure that the national prestige was held high at the  international forum did not mean that the BJP was joining hands  with the Congress, Prof Singh stated.    Reacting to the reverses the BJP suffered in last year's  Assembly elections, Prof Singh said the results were not as bad  as was being made out. Secondly, there was an element of chance  in elections and a political party which loses one election  comes back to power in the next. Another factor he identified  was the ban on the RSS which had made it difficult for its  volunteers to work for the party.</p>

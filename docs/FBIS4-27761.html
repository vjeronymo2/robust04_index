			<p>BFN     [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's  fifth session entered its ninth day today.    "The National Assembly worked at the conference hall in the  morning under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman  Dang Quan Thuy.    "The deputies debated a revised draft law on the amendment  of  and supplement to a number of articles on the law on military  service. There were 21 deputies airing their views. All those  who spoke favored the idea of amending and supplementing the law  on military service now in force. Most of them hailed the fact  that the draft law had been supplemented with Articles 11, 9,  23, 56, and 61 on the duty of economic organizations and of the  administration to muster youths to comply with the law on  military service. They pointed out the need to assign relevant  economic organizations, public organs, and units with the duty  of accepting their former personnel who have returned from  military service. Many deputies asked that the law clearly  specify that in cases where these organizations or organs are  deactivated, the responsibility of arranging employment for  these youths will rest with the War Invalids and Social Welfare  Offices concerned."    Some deputies proposed that the law further specify the  responsibility of People's Councils at various levels to  supervise the enforcement of the law on military service. The  question of temporary military deferment or temporary military  exemption was also intensively discussed.    "The general views are that the law on military service has  been carried out in a biased fashion, as there are fewer youths  from wealthy families or whose fathers are party cadres and  members carrying out military service than less-educated youths  from poor families. It is precisely due to this that many  deputies favor the idea of offering an appropriate benefit  policy to those who have fulfilled their military service."    Some deputies urged the defense minister to reexamine the  training program for two-year military draftees "as there have  been complaints about military draftees having to spend more  time on manual labor than on military training."    "Others proposed that members of Assault Youth Forces be  exempted from military service."    This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies split up into  groups for discussions.</p>

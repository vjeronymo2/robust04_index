			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Testing time for French insurance groups - Alice Rawsthorn examines an industry preparing for partial privatisation The financial figures of France's grand old insurance companies which have been announced over the past week or so have not made pleasant reading. The bad news began last Wednesday when Axa, the largest private sector insurer, announced a 28 per cent fall in net profits to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 436m). Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled company which is the biggest single force in French insurance, followed on Thursday by disclosing an 11 per cent decline to FFr3.8bn. The week ended with Friday's news that Assurances Generales de France (AGF) had made static profits of FFr2.7bn. This week began with yesterday's announcement from Groupes des Assurances Nationales (GAN), which, like AGF is a state concern, that its net profits had slipped by 1.7 per cent per cent to FFr2.3bn. This picture of sluggish profits comes at a sensitive time for the French insurance industry which is preparing for the government's partial privatisation programme, pressing ahead with its international expansion and facing significant changes in its traditional domestic market. So far France's insurance groups have led fairly sheltered lives thank to their hold over their home market. The French market slowed last year and the Paris property sector weakened, thereby posing problems for insurers, such as GAN, which have been active investors in the capital. But the French insurers have been spared the horror stories that have hit their US and UK counterparts. They are also, according to Mr Tom Bennett, European insurance analyst at Paribas, 'solid, asset rich, reasonably well-run businesses'. The life insurance market is poised for healthy growth in France following the forthcoming reforms of the pension system which should create a lucrative new market for the insurers in private pensions. The outlook for the non-life sector is not so rosy. The growth potential is lower and this is the area where competition on pricing - and therefore on profitability - has been the most fierce. Moreover the mutual companies, the specialist insurers servicing particular groups, are expanding rapidly in motor and home insurance. But the real threat to the big French groups is the structural change in distribution patterns. At present they sell their products through networks of agents working for them on an exclusive basis. The agent system protects the vested interest of the established insurers by making it difficult - and expensive - for new competitors, notably foreigners, to expand in France. However, there are moves among the agents to break away from their exclusive relationship with individual insurers to operate as brokers. The brokers are also becoming more powerful due to an influx of foreign investment. There are also signs of some big insurers attacking the status quo. Axa has quietly started direct sales of motor insurance. If other big insurers follow, direct selling could become as common in France as in the UK where it represents 10 per cent of the market. This might increase the French majors' market share in the short term, but it could weaken their position by making it easier for new players to expand. The industry faces these changes at a time when the three state-controlled companies - UAP, AGF and GAN - all need to present a sales pitch to the stock market when the state sells part of its holdings, possibly later this year. The plans for partial privatisation have yet to be finalised. The insurers do not yet know if they will be able to raise capital in the share sales. One reason why they are so keen for capital is to finance their international expansion. Over the past 10 years the big French companies have been diversifying into other European countries. So far they have met with mixed success. Some companies, such as GAN, ran into difficulty in their foreign markets last year. Undeterred the French insurers are continuing their expansion. AGF is locked in a legal battle over its attempt to invest in Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteilungs of Germany. AGF and UAP are willing to bide their time until their deals come to fruition. Luckily they have the resources to do so.</p>

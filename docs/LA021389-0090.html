			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> CITIES VS. THE SUBURBS;  </P> <P> URBAN LIVING MEANS ONGOING BATTLE FOR NEEDED SERVICES  </P> <P> In December, 1987, I bought a house in South-Central Los Angeles and moved  there from the Fairfax District.  </P> <P> I expected my life to change. I was a new homeowner in a neighborhood with not  the best of reputations. With the newspaper stories about gang and drug  problems in mind, I was braced for problems with the people who would be my  neighbors.  </P> <P> Instead, I found that my real problems were with the city.  </P> <P> Services I took for granted in the Fairfax District were nonexistent in my new  neighborhood. While city street sweepers kept my old neighborhood relatively  clean, litter remained untouched on my new street. After weeks of watching the  street sweeper roll down the middle of the street, brushes up and idle, I began  making about two calls a week to the city to complain. After four weeks of  calls, the brushes did touch the pavement, but most of the street went unswept  because of abandoned or illegally parked cars, none ticketed.  </P> <P> So again I took to the phone. Sanitation told me that they couldn't sweep if  cars were illegally parked, and that the cars were not their problem.  Transportation told me they couldn't ticket the cars because there were not  enough signs restricting parking and the signs were not their problem. So with  my phone book in hand, I tracked down who was responsible for posting signs. It  only took a couple of weeks to get more signs posted. Two more weeks of trash  piled up.  </P> <P> With that accomplished, I got in touch with transportation once again to let  them know that they could begin ticketing and to request -- for what seemed  like the hundredth time -- the removal of a car that had been abandoned by the  previous tenants of my house. They said they would begin ticketing and mark the  tires of the abandoned car "in a couple of weeks." After marking the tires of  an abandoned car, the city has to wait 72 hours before removing the vehicle.  </P> <P> Well, cars started to get ticketed and the street got swept, but getting the  abandoned car removed was another matter. After weeks of calling, I was totally  frustrated. In one last effort I called transportation and told them if the car  was not removed by the end of that day, I was going to pay to have the car  towed to Mayor Bradley's or Councilman Farrell's house. Four tow trucks showed  up that afternoon, and the car was removed. So much for being diplomatic.  </P> <P> Parking is only one of the problems that residents of my area have to deal with  every day. There are no decent grocery stores, department stores or parks or  playgrounds in the area, although liquor stores, nail salons and mini-malls  abound. The ice cream trucks that travel the streets night and day are known to  sell more than just push-up sundaes.  </P> <P> Car insurance, while high-priced for most in Los Angeles, reaches astronomic  proportions in South-Central. In the first three months I owned my home, my  homeowners insurance was cancelled twice in spite of having passed loan  inspections and having a burglar alarm. The companies didn't give reasons but  did say I could write for an explantion. But there is little time for  corresponding with insurance companies when you are threatened with  foreclosure, which is what happens when you don't have insurance. My neighbors  tell me that my experience is not uncommon. I and a number of my neighbors have  had our homeowners insurance canceled for no apparent reason.  </P> <P> Just going to the grocery store is a reminder of the area's status. There is  essentially one grocery chain in the area, and in survey after survey its  prices are the highest in the city. People in the Westside would be shocked at  the lack of variety and the poor quality of the products, to say nothing of the  stores' dirty conditions and lack of service. The standard joke where I live is  that Boys gets its produce in Vons' alley. Of course it's no joke when you are  the one buying the produce. The people who are lucky enough to have  transportation go out of the area to shop, which is both time-consuming and  inconvenient.  </P> <P> Zoning violations are rampant especially in multi-unit buildings. It is common  to see one-bedroom apartments with up to 20 people living in them. I have heard  the arguments that it is racist and elitist to enforce zoning regulations in  poor minority areas. My answer to that is that it is racist and elitist to  believe that those of us who live in South-Central don't have the right to have  our quality of life protected by zoning regulations.  </P> <P> There are many who live in the area who take pride in their homes and  neighborhoods and are working to improve them. It is discouraging to see  council members seeking higher office argue that those of us who live in  redevelopment areas, designated such because of blight, should bear the burden  of most of the of low-income housing for the city. We have more than our fair  share of poverty and its resultant problems, few of which I witnessed on the  Westside.  </P> <P> I have gotten to know my neighbors while we have been out working in our yards  or sweeping up trash out on the street, and I have great respect for them. They  are people who want better lives for themselves and their children in spite of  what sometimes seem insurmountable odds. These are people who work hard all day  and spend their leisure hours meeting in groups to find ways to get rid of  drug-trafficking and prostitution and devote weekends to painting out graffiti.  While many people blame the residents of South-Central for the area's problems,  I see many who are trying to be part of solution.  </P> <P> Every neighborhood -- regardless of the color of the people, the number who  speak English or who are citizens -- deserves equality of services. The normal  trials of everyday life are enough. We should not have to fight the  institutions that are meant to serve us as well.  </P></p>

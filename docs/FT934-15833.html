			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rail privatisation - treading the same stony path Sir, I cannot understand the fuss over whether British Rail should be allowed to bid for rail franchises. Let it bid. The award criteria doubtless include assessment of competence at running a railway. Bidders not considered capable of meeting service level targets will be eliminated. British Rail's record will speak for itself. Stephen L Phillips, chairman, Hygicare, Whitegate Industrial Estate, Wrexham, Clwyd LL13 8UG</p>

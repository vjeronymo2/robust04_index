			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Malaysia ruling on foreign stockbrokers FOREIGN stockbrokers with representative offices and research units in Malaysia must apply for an investment advisory licence by the end of the year or face closure, according to Mr Nik Mohamed Din, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) executive chairman, Reuter reports. Foreign stockbrokers in equity tie-ups with local brokers need not apply for a separate licence, but must move to the offices of the local partners, under the ruling from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Foreign brokerages have rushed into Malaysia since the KLSE split with the Stock Exchange of Singapore in 1990. Some have linked with local brokers while others operate as research units without having to obtain an investment advisory licence.</p>

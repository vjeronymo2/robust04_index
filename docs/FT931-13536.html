			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banco Santander lifts net income by 11.8% BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish bank, raised net income by 11.8 per cent in 1992 to Pta66.1bn (Dollars 585m). The result gave the bank a 1.1 per cent return on assets during last year and a 20.34 per cent return on equity. Santander, which is a significant shareholder in Royal Bank of Scotland and of First Fidelity Bancorporation of the US, raised the fee income from its domestic banking operations by 21.8 per cent to Pta69bn, and restricted the growth of its operating expenses to 3.5 per cent. In spite of the lowered allocation for depreciation and provisions, Santander has a 101.43 per cent coverage of non-performing loans and remains the best-protected bank in the domestic sector against such losses. Santander is being investigated over its use of an alleged tax avoidance instrument called loan assignments between 1988-89. However, a judge at Madrid's senior monetary court last week revoked a controversial order that had forced the bank, just before Christmas, to post a Pta8bn bond as surety against possible fraud charges. Caja de Madrid, Spain's second-largest savings bank, reported pre-tax profits of Pta39.2bn for last year, an increase of 11.5 per cent on 1991, after raising provisions for bad debts by 52.7 per cent to Pta25.3bn. It said the sharp rise in provisioning reflected a cautious policy rather than a significant increase in bad debts. The latter represented 2.7 per cent of total loans.</p>

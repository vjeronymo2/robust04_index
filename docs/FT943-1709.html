			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hungarian power unit sees rise MVM Rt, the main operating subsidiary of Hungary's state electricity monopoly, has reported pre-tax profit of Ft2.379bn (Dollars 22.03m) on turnover of Ft52.78bn for the first half of 1994. The company, which is due to be partly privatised by the middle of next year, is expecting pre-tax profit of Ft1.4bn on turnover of Ft107.81bn for the year, up from Ft329m on turnover of Ft101.4bn in 1993. However, this year's turnover could rise by Ft22.7bn if, as expected, electricity prices, presently 40-60 per cent of western European levels, are increased by 30 per cent in October. The rises are designed to make the company more attractive ahead of privatisation. The government and AV Rt, the privatisation body, which is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, are due to make a decision on the sell-off within the next month. Under the plan being considered, the state would sell stakes in MVM's power generation and distribution subsidiaries. MVM's nuclear plant and the national grid would remain 100 per cent state-owned. The state is expected to announce tenders this autumn for minority stakes in five of the country's six household gas distribution companies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Today, Estonian Defense Minister Indrek  Kannik arrived in Ukraine on an official visit. After a meeting  with his Ukrainian counterpart, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy,  a news conference was held for the mass media representatives.  We invite you to listen to the speech by Ukraine's Defense  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy.    [Begin Radetskyy recording] We have an opportunity to  welcome  Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik on the land of Ukraine.  This visit is a symbol of developing friendly relations between  our countries. The signing in 1992 of the Treaty on Friendship  and Cooperation between our countries became the first official  step in this direction. However, in my opinion, our peoples'  good feelings toward each other extend far beyond the limits of  official documents. It may not be out of place to recall that  Ukraine and the Republic of Estonia recognized each other's  independence and sovereignty as far back as 1921. The fact that  this independence was later crossed out mercilessly was not our  predecessors' guilt, but their bad luck.    Today, we must remember this to prevent numerous tragedies  of  the past from happening again, and, unfortunately, there are too  many of these in the historical memory of our people. It is  with this very aim that both Estonia and Ukraine strive to join  the family of European nations as fully-fledged members, and  show concern for the consolidation of security and stability on  our continent. Already now, after the first exchange of  opinions with the minister, I can make a conclusion that our  views of the future architecture of European security coincide  in their majority.    In particular, we see great prospects in the implementation  of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. This is a real chance  to establish genuinely partnership relations with the countries  of the West and East, and prevent the return to the times of  military-political confrontation. We do not see any substantial  reasons for which any country, if it is guided by good will, can  be denied access to this program which does not contradict the  national legislation of the countries-participants, respects  their sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is exactly on  these grounds that we are trying to solve the painful for  Ukraine issue of the future of the Black Sea Fleet. Already, we  have firm intentions in the near future to come to an  understanding with Russia as far as this complicated issue is  concerned.    Ukraine has always been against the deployment of foreign  troops on the territories of other states without their clearly  expressed consent. Our stand on this issue is clear regarding  both purely domestic problems facing Ukraine and international  precedents. This is exactly why we show understanding of  Estonia's stand concerning the withdrawal of the Russian troops  from their national territory. In my opinion, the current year  must become a decisive year in solving this problem.    I am deeply convinced that the development of  good-neighborly  and sincere relations between countries of Eastern and Central  Europe, within the context of the all-European processes, allows  the future to be viewed with optimism. The deepening of the  Ukrainian-Estonian dialogue is part of this future.    With Mr. Kannik we signed an agreement on military  cooperation. This is an important and far-reaching document. It  lays down a basis for military-scientific cooperation, mutual  interaction in the military education sphere, retraining of  troops, social protection of servicemen, and other issues. We  felt the desire of the Estonian side to build these relations on  the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit.    I hope that during the meetings with government officials  and  with Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials our Estonian partners  will have an opportunity to concrete these principles  essentially. I am convinced that the development of bilateral  contacts between the military departments of Ukraine and Estonia  is useful for our states and peoples.

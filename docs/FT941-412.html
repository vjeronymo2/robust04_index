			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: A chiaroscuro election Nothing in Italian politics is ever quite what it seems. On the face of it, yesterday's election result represents a decisive break with the past of muddled and corrupt coalition governments as well as a stunning victory for the right-wing Freedom Alliance spearheaded by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. In reality, it is neither so novel nor so decisive. Although Mr Berlusconi posed as a harbinger of Italy's renewal, his business career - involving close links with politicians now on trial for corruption  -reflected much that was wrong with the way the country was run in recent decades. While the electorate has clearly signalled its disgust with the old order by plumping for a man who has been in politics barely four months, it also confirmed a fact common to other democracies: that voters choose politicians who tell them what they want to hear. Even the Freedom Alliance's absolute majority in the lower house may turn out on closer inspection to be fuzzier than it looks. The three parties of which it is composed make such implausible bedfellows that it is hard to see them forming a stable or durable government. Moreover, the tensions among them - between the corporatist MSI/National Alliance and the economically liberal Forza Italia, or between the federalist Northern League and the centralist, southern-based MSI - do more to underline the problems facing Italy than to identify common ground for solving them. When a government is eventually formed, those problems will be as acute as ever, and the options for addressing them every bit as constrained as those that have guided the technocratic coalitions of the past two years. A new prime minister will find no escape from the financial reality of a budget deficit only just under control and a public sector debt still climbing. Any deviation from the arduous course of fiscal adjustment charted by the outgoing Ciampi government will be instantly punished in the bond markets, with rapid effects on domestic interest rates and growth. The first test will come almost as soon as the new government takes office, when it considers, as it must, how to deal with a worrying overshoot on the deficit revealed last week. If that government's leader is Mr Berlusconi, he will find his task made no easier by his election trail slogans of lower taxes. This pledge is not compatible with Italy's current fiscal predicament. Now that power is almost within his grasp, he needs to swallow it and concentrate on the stark choice his country faces. On one side is the long, hard climb towards fiscal respectability and integration with Europe; on the other, a slide towards Latin American-style financial collapse. If a Prime Minister Berlusconi chooses the former, he will be well placed eventually to deliver the economic transformation he has promised, since his victory comes just as the European economy is turning. If not, his political career will prove an ephemeral phenomenon.</p>

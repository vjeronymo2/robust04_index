			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MITTERRAND IS EUROPE'S MIDDLEMAN;  </P> <P> STATECRAFT: A WILY FRENCH PRESIDENT, ENJOYING RARE CITIZEN SUPPORT, WORKS AT  HARNESSING GERMAN ASPIRATIONS TO AN INTEGRATED CONTINENT.  </P> <P> Concerned about the future of Germany, France is torn between trying to  accelerate the development of West European institutions, the better to link  the destiny of Germany to its partners, or accepting the inevitability of  reunification in order to control the process. France is not the only nation  concerned about the future of Germany but it is perhaps the only European state  that can influence what happens. The United States is too remote and too  preoccupied with other issues. Great Britain is increasingly irrelevant to  Germany. The question is, will France choose to exert its influence?  </P> <P> Ideological and partisan divisions in France have so diminished that President  Francois Mitterrand can demonstrate leadership aboard with a nation virtually  united behind him at home -- the consummation of Charles de Gaulle's grandest  hopes for France. Perhaps the most important issue facing France is the  structure of a new Europe, now that the question of German unification cannot  be postponed.  </P> <P> France has often sought a role in German affairs. In 1648, at the Peace of  Westphalia, France was striving for dominance in Western Europe and was only  too happy to keep Germany fragmented into hundreds of states without a strong  central authority. In 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, French leaders shared  the European consensus of maintaining the status quo of a divided Germany. In  1870 France fought Prussia in a last-ditch effort to prevent German  unification. After 1870, France no longer sought dominance but security against  the threat of a powerful aggressive neighbor. In 1919 at Versailles, France  tried to cripple Germany through border changes and severe reparations. Policy  after World War II was far more enlightened; it sought a democratic Germany  within a European Economic Community. Significantly, EC institutions are housed  at cities in Belgium, Luxembourg and France that Germany invaded in 1914 and  1940.  </P> <P> Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman initiated, De Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer  cemented, the special Franco-German relationship that has been the dominant  feature of European politics in the postwar era. This relationship has been  based on German economic strength and French freedom of action in political and  military affairs, leading to the great prestige France enjoys in the federal  republic.  </P> <P> In many ways, France is in a better position than ever to act. The curse of  French political life since the 1789 revolution has been political instability.  Instability contributed to France's decline as the preeminent continental power  in the early 19th Century. In the 1930s, polarization between left and right  reached such extremes that agreement on the basics -- foreign policy and  national defense -- could not be reached, leading to the debacle of 1940. The  Fourth Republic, created in 1946, failed to create consensus and collapsed 12  years later. Even the Fifth Republic initially divided Frenchmen, although in  the long run its executive-dominated institutions suited contemporary needs.  </P> <P> In the last years, however, the ideological fervor separating right and left  have almost disappeared, in part because the opposition finally came to power.  The Socialists' effort at a "break" with capitalism failed in 1981-83; the  right's 1986-87 efforts at rolling back most of the Socialist legislation soon  ground to a halt amid popular opposition. "Cohabitation" between a Socialist  president and a conservative Parliament in 1986 was decisive, producing an "end  of ideology." Voters reelected Mitterrand because he appeared less divisive  than his rival, Jacques Chirac.  </P> <P> Today, there is broad agreement between all major parties on matters of defense  and foreign policy. The constitution of the Fifth Republic and the current  political situation give the president considerable room for initiative. And  Mitterrand has great interest in European and international affairs, with more  experience than any other European statesman. Like the fox in Machiavelli's  "The Prince," he has been able to finesse seemingly impossible political  situations.  </P> <P> In the course of two decades, Mitterrand proved that a Socialist could be  elected president of the republic, that a moribund Socialist Party could be  transformed into the major French party, that the Communist Party could be used  to win an election and then dispatched to the dustbin of history. Mitterrand is  one of the great political strategists in French history; his understanding of  many domestic issues, especially economic, is less notable.  </P> <P> Mitterrand clearly wants to play an active role in the creation of a New  Europe. But will he have the support of the French people? Not because they are  divided, as in the past, but because they have other things on their mind.  </P> <P> France today seems remarkably inward-looking. The French have entered the age  of consumerism, with all that implies about attitudes toward work and patterns  of expenditure. Traditionally strong French domestic industries are often not  capable of meeting the demands of the consumer market. Unemployment remains a  concern.  </P> <P> As more young people pursue higher education in overcrowded universities, entry  in the job market is postponed until the mid-20s, an age group with  considerable unemployment. The French are not so dazed by the joys of  consumerism that they can think of nothing else, but the sluggish economic  situation means that they are preoccupied with holding on to what they have.  </P> <P> Concerns about immigration and crime, often with racist overtones, reflect  French fears for economic security. Preoccupation with domestic issues is  compounded by the feeling that France is merely a spectator to what is  happening in the East, with little capacity to influence events.  </P> <P> There is no mystery about where French interests lie in Europe. No French  leader can be enthusiastic about the prospect of German reunification,  certainly not someone like Mitterrand who lived through the occupation. But  neither can France appear to be the stumbling block to reunification. So much  the better if East Germany maintains a separate identity. Mitterrand's trip to  East Berlin was clearly intended to prevent a precipitous collapse of East  Germany, so that this possibility would not be foreclosed. At minimum,  Mitterrand wanted to buy time to avoid a rapid and uncontrolled process of  reunification in which French interests would not be taken into account.  </P> <P> After World War II, France was willing to accept rebirth of an independent West  Germany as part of an economically unified democratic Western Europe. If  Germany is to be reunified, the French will want to be sure that it is a  democratic Germany encapsulated in a reunited Europe. What Mitterrand cannot  accept is an uncontrolled reunited Germany dominating central Europe.  </P> <P> Mitterrand has talked in vague terms of a European confederation. On the  content level, this has sounded like statesmanlike fudge. On the tactical  level, however, it makes sense. Mitterrand wanted to tie Helmut Kohl into such  a plan and thus prevent anyone else (especially the Germans) from seizing the  initiative. He will then do what he does best, work behind the scenes to create  a situation in which German reunification poses the minimal threat to French  interests.  </P> <P> Politics is full of unforeseen events but Mitterrand's experience also tells  him that success comes by working carefully, patiently, behind the scenes with  a long time frame. He has six years left in his term. Although the French may  be unusually inward-looking, the public and political class will follow a  presidential leadership that "rises above" controversial domestic issues. With  help from other West European nations, plus the United States and the Soviet  Union, perhaps from Germany as well, Mitterrand's job will be to bind Germany  to Europe with hoops of steel.  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / DTI plans reform of insolvency procedures: Companies may win extra protection from creditors COMPANIES in financial difficulties would be able to gain powerful protection from creditors trying to recover their money, under proposals issued by the government yesterday. They would be able to gain a 'breathing space' of 28 days, renewable for up to three months, while they tried to put together proposals acceptable to creditors representing at least 75 per cent of the company's debts. Banks - which generally take priority over other creditors - would also be bound by this moratorium and would be required to give seven days' notice to companies of their intention to appoint receivers, under the suggestions circulated by the Department of Trade and Industry. The moves, in the report of a working party set up in November last year to consider changes to insolvency law, represent a modest shift towards the principles of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the DTI, said: 'The proposals aim to create workable and affordable rescue procedures. We need to ensure these are fully utilised whenever a lifeline can be thrown to a company in danger of sinking.' The DTI report covers proposed reforms to company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administration orders, which were introduced in the 1986 Insolvency Act but are acknowledged to have failed to live up to expectations. In the past three years, there have been just 296 CVAs and 447 administrations, but more than 66,000 liquidations. The recommendations met with widespread initial support. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'It certainly seems as if the DTI is aware of the problems faced by companies.' The DTI's proposals suggest company voluntary arrangements should be subject to relatively low-level monitoring by a supervisor, who should be in a regulated profession but need not tbe an insolvency practitioner. They say the company should possibly have access to new lenders to help restructuring who would have priority over existing creditors. Shareholders would lose the right to approve CVAs. The document also suggests changes to administration procedures which would allow a professional adviser to be appointed for 28 days without having to report to the DTI on the conduct of directors. An appendix even suggests that in an administration all debt should be converted into equity, while preserving the rights of priority creditors. Banks and other creditors with debts secured against assets would lose some power under the proposals. But the British Bankers' Association said it 'would give a cautious welcome if companies can be restructured to continue to pay their debts'. Mr Colin Bird, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse and chairman of the technical committee of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said: 'The DTI has made a very good attempt at understanding the issues.'

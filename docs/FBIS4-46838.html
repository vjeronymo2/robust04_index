			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Maryasov: "Good Seeds--the Foundation of the </F> Harvest"]    [Text] Recently the collegium of the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food at its meeting considered the Russian  Federation draft Law on Seeds. This question, as they say, is  urgent. At the present time there are no legislative acts in the  country regulating production, procurements, sale, and  utilization of seeds and planting material.    The experience of countries with a developed market economy  shows that the creation of this kind of legal base is possible  only on the basis of recognition of unified production  principles, certification of seeds, and their introduction into  commercial circulation. It is these principles that make up the  foundation of the proposed draft. The law provides legal  foundations for the activity of producers and consumers of seeds  and protects their rights.    The system for growing seeds of agricultural crops is formed  from the production of original, elite, reproduction, and hybrid  seeds. It is stipulated that the production and utilization of  seeds of strains included in the register of selection  achievements is done only by certified legal entities and  individuals, in observance of the exclusive right of the patent  holders.    In order to deliver seeds to regions that do not produce  them  or have limited possibilities of producing them and to render  assistance in cases of natural disasters the draft law envisions  the creation of a federal branch seed supply. The draft law  especially stipulates that the state client for the formation of  the federal insurance supply of seeds is the Ministry of  Agricultural and Food of the Russian Federation.    For the purpose of stimulating procurements of seeds for the  federal insurance supply there is to be advanced payment of 50  percent of the cost of the delivery volume contracted for and  also compensation for the producers of the original seeds for 50  percent of the costs related to their production and all  expenditures on the creation of insurance and carryover supplies  of these seeds.    A great deal of attention is devoted to control methods that  contribute to improving the quality of seeds.    According to the draft law all seed and planting material  used for planting is subject to testing for grade and planting  qualities with the issuance of the corresponding documents--a  certificate (upon sale), and in other cases--a certification of  the quality of the seeds.    In order to monitor the observance of normative-technical  and  technological documentation in the production, procurement,  storage, transportation, and utilization of seeds, the position  of state inspector for seed control is being introduced with the  assignment of the corresponding authority. At the same time  liability for violation of the law has been determined.</p>

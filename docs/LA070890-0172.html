			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ARTS: A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE;  </P> <P> DIVERSE CULTURES FIND A COMMON GROUND THROUGH DANCE, MUSIC, THEATER AT MEETING  OF THE WORLDS FESTIVAL IN FINLAND  </P> <P> The marketplace in this Finnish border town was an incongruous pageant of  feathers and beads, bandannas, fringed deerskin and painted shirts as  Blackfoot/American Indian ceremonialist Charles Lawrence rattled his spirit  staff, thereby signaling the opening of Joensuu's Meeting of the Worlds  festival.  </P> <P> At his bidding, about 1,500 spectators held hands and mimicked his Navajo  prayer, a mighty "ya-hey-ya-hey-ya" cutting across the Babel of languages in  the square. The chant unleashed an affirmation of positive energy that remained  the hallmark of the 31-concert international performance festival, held between  June 19 and 23.  </P> <P> "We, as two-leggeds, must never forget the spirit. It is a spirit working  through the people that will truly bring the greatest changes for the Earth,"  Lawrence, an Anaheim native, told the crowd.  </P> <P> As optimism peaked during this season of the white nights, and as families  prepared for the traditional lakeside bonfires, solemn saunas, drinking and  song that mark the celebration of Midsummer's Eve, Joensuu was preoccupied by a  sprawling festival. Ostensibly, the focus was music, with theater, dance and  performance art the minor keys. But revealed in its subtext was a concern for  building bridges across cultures, for finding common ground through the arts  and exploring the theme of borders -- political, psychological and conceptual.  </P> <P> To that end, San Diego art theorist Allan Kaprow, New York actor Arthur  Strimling and Oakland large-scale public performance artist Suzanne Lacy  utilized the town's special geography and history to plan a constellation of  more or less connected happenings. These included a Christo-like wrapping of  the banks of a nearby lagoon and Illosari Island ("Island of Happiness") with  several hundred teen-age swimmers, clad in red and waving white towels, as well  as Kaprow's outlining on the ground in chalk images of couples meeting in the  marketplace.  </P> <P> The global gathering, orchestrated by Performing Artists for Nuclear  Disarmament (PAND) activists in Finland and the United States, brought out  participants of every musical stripe, including Los Angeles Philharmonic music  director-designate Esa-Pekka Salonen, the San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet,  noted singers Martina Arroyo and Christa Ludwig, composer Henrik Otto Donner,  the Leningrad Philharmonic and new wave guitarist David Byrne. There were Lapp  and Gypsy folk singers, the Japanese drummer Eitetsu Hayashi, a tango orchestra  and Sakhile, a South African band.  </P> <P> In support of PAND's platform, all artists performed gratis, and proceeds of  the festival are to be donated to UNICEF. (Festival organizers say a profit was  made, but the tallying was still on-going last week and no figures were  available.)  </P> <P> If culture has all too often been used by governments as a malign instrument of  propaganda, in Joensuu, the power of music was almost tangible as a benign  uniting force among individuals.  </P> <P> There was, for instance, the performance of Shostakovitch's Fifth Symphony with  Mariss Jansons leading the Leningrad Philharmonic in their first Finnish  appearance.  </P> <P> In 1937, that same orchestra under Evgeny Mravinsky played the triumphant  premiere of this work, thus introducing what instantly became one of the most  popular and enduring 20th-Century symphony classics.  </P> <P> Following a performance calibrated slowly to wring out all the pain and pathos  in the music, Jansons (whose father, Arvit Jansons, was the No. 2 conductor to  Mravinsky) acknowledged a stormy ovation by playing an encore, the "Valse  Triste" of Finland's national hero, composer Jean Sibelius. Five years ago such  a gesture would have been unthinkable -- Sibelius wrote the piece as a protest  against Russian oppression of Finland.  </P> <P> Another Soviet presence was Boris Grebenshikov, a rock vocalist/guitarist with  matinee idol looks, and his backing group, Aquarium. Forced underground as a  performer during the Brezhnev regime, Grebenshikov embarked on his career by  studying tapes he purchased on the black market. Nonetheless, he gathered a  following in the U.S.S.R. and remains in demand -- glasnost notwithstanding.  Joensuu was his second appearance in the West, the first being Montreal just  last year.  </P> <P> Finnish-born conductor-composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, whose very career and  artistic existence defy man-made borders (his musical orbit now includes  Germany, Italy, England and the United States), well appreciates the politics  of music.  </P> <P> "The reason classical music is so universal is partly because it has been  considered not dangerous, socially speaking," Salonen said during a break in  rehearsals.  </P> <P> "So you can play a Beethoven symphony anywhere, and you don't threaten the  system. In a way, it's a pity. I'd rather like to deal with something a bit  more dangerous, especially because I don't drive or do anything else risky. . .  ."  </P> <P> Salonen did seem to be flirting with the unconventional in some rather  venturesome programming -- in addition to a composition of his own, "FLOOF,"  inspired by a Polish science-fiction novel, he presented two works by rock  musician Frank Zappa juxtaposed with two Mozart symphonies. "FLOOF," which  starts from a primitive syntax and develops towards discopunk, emits along the  way some incomprehensible sounds, like burping ("and so forth, no other  description needed," said Salonen).  </P> <P> His festival appearances were with Avantil, a chamber orchestra he founded in  1983 together with a group of young Helsinki musicians, and which is now his  main performance vehicle in Finland. Salonen, who estimates he spends no more  than 25 days a year in Finland, maintains a cottage close to Helsinki for those  infrequent visits.  </P> <P> Though he by no means sees himself as Finland's cultural ambassador to Los  Angeles -- he's committed to healthy mixes in styles and nationalities in terms  of composers he introduces -- he is enough of a patriot to have volunteered his  services in Joensuu, along with leading Finnish baritone Jorma Hynninen and  basso Jakko Ryhanen.  </P> <P> Besides throwing his support behind an event he deems important, for Salonen  Joensuu represented an opportunity to reconnect with his native country and to  speak his mother tongue.  </P> <P> "One of the great things here," he said, switching reflexively between Finnish  and English as he fielded questions in the lobby of his hotel, "is that when I  walk in the street, on almost every corner, I see a familiar face. When I  conduct a Finnish orchestra, it's a very odd feeling -- oh, yes, it's our  Esa-Pekka who's back."  </P> <P> Then to a more universal note: "The goals of this festival are special. Artists  don't readily recognize limitations. Sometimes impenetrable walls turn out to  be sliding doors."  </P> <P> On the shores of Lake Ladoga, Europe's largest lake, situated 150 kilometers  from the Joensuu marketplace, Russian and Finnish folk groups crooned their  songs about lost youth, birch trees, and nostalgia for Karelia (that geographic  region shared by eastern Finland and western Russia) of old.  </P> <P> In what represented the final Midsummer's Day concert of the Meeting of the  Worlds festival, as well as the first cross-cultural event to be held in  Sortavala since the town was ceded to the Soviets in 1944, a crowd estimated at  38,000 milled in front of the makeshift stage that had recently been erected  jointly by workers from both towns -- and the spirit was strong.  </P> <P> Until World War II, Sortavala, a vibrant, attractive city, was the site of an  annual summer song festival. After 1944, when 400,000 Finns fled to the other  side of the frontier on two hours' notice, it became part of a  restricted-access military zone. As though bisected by an East-West Continental  Divide, Finland's gravitational pull went one way, and Soviet life flowed  another. The Sortavala Song Festival was reestablished in the '50s by the  people of Joensuu.  </P> <P> The festival's ideological climax, the East-West encounter across the border,  was the culmination of more than two years of negotiations. According to  Joensuu's deputy mayor, Pirkko Kylanpaa, the obstacles were daunting.  </P> <P> "The roads were bad. We had to arrange the logistics of crossing the border.  There was no stage. There were also questions of food," she added.  </P> <P> On the morning of June 23, two trains carrying 1,600 passengers made the  two-hour trip through boreal forests to Sortavala. For this day only, Moscow  suspended the usual rigorous visa requirements, and Soviet officials who gave  passports a perfunctory once-over were almost genial as the trains rolled  across the frontier for the first time in 46 years.  </P> <P> At the station, visitors had powerful impressions of the toll to a society that  had kept the world at bay. Smiling and making every effort to play the part of  gracious hosts, these were people taking their first, tentative steps towards  openness.  </P> <P> Attempts had been made to spruce up the environs of the station, but elsewhere,  wooden structures that hadn't seen a coat of paint since the Finnish withdrawal  lent a woebegone look. Russian visitors who stayed overnight were accommodated  in a hospital and camp grounds -- this town of 22,000 has no hotel -- and the  few souvenirs to be seen were sold by street vendors uncertain about how much  to charge.  </P> <P> More than just a varied musical program and other scheduled festivities, the  three-hour concert presented an opportunity for townsfolk to mingle  unrestrictedly with visitors from the West. As one Finnish radio journalist put  it, "Glasnost for the Russians is like psychotherapy. Now they are enjoying  talking, but soon they'll tire of it and want more. Nonetheless, I feel  euphoric. Sortavala represents a reopening of possibilities."  </P></p>

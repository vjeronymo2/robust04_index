			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / IAEA acts to tighten checks for N-weapons THE International Atomic Energy Agency is to extend its powers to check for clandestine nuclear weapons development, including inspection of undeclared sites and gathering foreign intelligence. The new measures agreed in Vienna yesterday by the policy-making board of the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, amount to a fairly modest tightening of safeguards against nuclear proliferation. Critics say the IAEA needs much stronger powers if it is to avoid repeating its failure to detect Iraq's secret development of a nuclear bomb. The 35-nation board affirmed the right of its 200 inspectors to visit any site they chose in countries which have signed the agency's safeguards agreements. They will also be able to consult foreign intelligence sources for clues about secret weapons projects. The board also agreed that member states should submit in advance any design for new installations or changes to existing nuclear sites. 'The board further reaffirmed the agency's rights to obtain and have access to additional information and locations,' Mr Hans Blix, IAEA director-general, said. But a proposal to compile a central IAEA database of imports and exports of sensitive equipment and nuclear materials was not accepted. Several western industrialised countries said the information would be too laborious and costly to collect. 'The intention is to build up a picture of who is importing equipment that is incongruous with the scale of its known nuclear programme,' said Mr David Kyd, IAEA information director. 'It will mean a lot of work but unless someone does this, it is going to be a critical weakness in the system.' IAEA officials said the tightening of controls would only apply to members which had signed full safeguards agreements. Countries with agreements to inspect only specific reactors, such as Algeria, would not be obliged to open other sites for inspection. The next IAEA board meeting in June will resume the discussion of stronger safeguards, including the proposed database of materials and equipment. It will also have to tackle the impending financial crisis, following the loss of the Soviet Union's contribution to the agency. The IAEA's Dollars 75m a year inspection budget has been cut by 18 per cent at a time when its existing workload is increasing.</p>

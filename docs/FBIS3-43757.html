			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   `Shocking' Black Exam Pass Rate -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN  in English on 13 January in its page 6 editorial comments on the  "shocking" 38.3 percent pass rate of black students in the final  matriculation examinations. There are the "usual  recriminations" with the African National Congress (ANC) blaming  the Department of Education and Training for "failing to  'provide the most basic education facilities'." THE CITIZEN  agrees that blacks schools generally "are not as good as White  schools, nor is Black teaching in the main as good as White  teaching." Nevertheless, "when pupils burn down classrooms in  Black schools in political protests, or headmasters are  assaulted and chased out of schools, when teachers engage in  chalkdowns and pupils stay away from school, Black education is  bound to suffer."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Minerals Policy To Win Popular Support -- "Are the  changes to mineral rights ownership proposed as part of the  ANC's overall economic policy devised to win popular support  rather than to contribute to an effective restructuring of the  economy?" asks a page 4 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY  in English on 14 January. The ANC "still has to express an  "unequivocal economic policy." Its debate later this month  "must produce a coherent policy if uncertainty over its  intentions is not to deter investment."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Blacks, Whites Train Together in SADF -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN  in English on 14 January in a page 8 editorial welcomes the  South African Defense Force changeover to volunteer enlistment,  "allowing blacks and whites to do basic training together."  "While the army previously had more credibility than other  security forces, an army that is representative of all the  people will have more credibility. It will also be able to use  the skills of many more young people."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   ANC Election Lists Show Internal Democracy -- Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 14-20 January in a  page 14  editorial comments on the ANC's regional nomination election  lists saying they demonstrated "internal democracy and openness  in the ANC's handling of its lists. This was a bottom-up  process -- the lists were generated by ANC supporters and not by  party leaders handing out favours." "No other party has shown  such internal democracy and transparency. It augurs well for  the ANC's ability to limit future corruption and patronage."    ANC, Police At Fault in Katlehong Shootings Incident -- A  second editorial on the same page comments on the ANC leaders'  visit to Katlehong on 9 January, and the ensuing shootings,  saying that although the ANC had "every right to be in  Katlehong" they "acted irresponsibly" because they knew of the  dangers facing their charges. They should have had a  bullet-proof car at the ready, and when the shooting started  Ramaphosa and Slovo should have been thrown to the ground, and  their bodies covered by those of their bodyguards. "Not  informing the SAP [South African Police] of the delegation's  movements was irresponsible too. Whatever the ANC's view on the  presence of the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] in the townships,  the SAP had a role to play in securing the visit and should have  been informed of its details. Playing pass the buck may gather  a few votes, but it could cost lives." However, the SAP  response that it was not informed of the visit "was a typical  whine, ignoring the force's responsibilities under the law."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Need for Media Freedom To Report -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 11 January says in a page 10 editorial the  Katlehong shooting on 9 January highlighted the fact that "the  SAP and the political parties dare not pull in opposite  directions where security is involved. They owe it to the  country to protect the political process." BEELD does "not  accept that the ANC was simply being provocative by visiting  Katlehong. It has the right to convey its message, just as the  National Party [NP] has the right to preach its message in  Soweto. That is the kind of freedom we need to strive for in  this country."    ANC Education Plans Too Costly -- A second editorial on page  10 of BEELD says: "The ANC is skating on thin ice with its  ideas on a new educational system for a new South Africa. The  cost implications of its plans seem to be unaffordably high. It  is true that its ideas for a new educational system are not  entirely new. Many of them even have merit. But to actually  consider free and compulsory education for the first 9 years for  all, and to want to place all schools back under state control,  sounds half-baked. Education is only one of the areas where  affirmative action must take place. But the cost of the ANC's  education plan will be so enormous that it will swallow up the  country's whole budget." Fortunately, this is not a final plan.  BEELD believes the ANC is "testing the water."    Editorial Urges Parties Too Unite Against ANC -- According  to  the latest poll, argues an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 12 January, "a two-thirds majority in the  election is well within the ANC's reach, which means the  organization will be able to put its stamp more completely on  the final constitution," which "would not be in South Africa's  best interests. A check is needed on the organization,  especially because there are some dangerous aspects in ANC  policy which will have to be removed through struggle and  negotiation." "According to figures, the NP remains the only  broad, countrywide movement which will be able to stand up to  the ANC. It seems the NP has reached its low point and has  started growing again. So the contest is far from over." BEELD  advises "parties with sufficient common ground" to "get  together."    Crack in Freedom Alliance To Grow -- A second editorial on  the same page of BEELD welcomes the Ciskei decision to  participate in the Transitional Executive Council. "This crack  in the boycott attitude of the Freedom Alliance can only grow.  It has been caused by more than simple increasing political  realism. Subjects of Brig. Gqozo insisted that Ciskei become  part of the legitimate reform process, or they would be left out  of new structures like the National Peacekeeping Force. The  same internal pressures will in the days ahead be experienced in  kwaZulu and Bophuthatswana. The latest survey indicates that  Inkatha is losing support in its home ground, Natal-kwaZulu.  Hopefully the leaders of not only Inkatha, but other members of  the alliance, will realize that they cannot stop the march to  democracy. The overwhelming majority of South Africans want to,  and are going to, vote with their hands and feet for  participation in the new South Africa."</p>

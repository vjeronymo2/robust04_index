			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: IT'S FONTANA, BISHOP AMAT OUT OF BLOCKS  </P> <P> In 1969, Mark Parades was an ambidextrous quarterback who played for St. Paul  High School in Santa Fe Springs. An assistant coach for the Swordsmen that  season was Dick Bruich, who guided the team's defense and running backs.  </P> <P> The two met again last November, but as opposing coaches in a Southern Section  Division I quarterfinal matchup, with Bruich coaching Citrus Belt League power  Fontana and Parades heading Bishop Amat of La Puente.  </P> <P> In arguably the best game of the playoffs, Bishop Amat survived a 28-27  overtime thriller on its way to the Division final. The Lancers won by stopping  Fontana's two-point try on the game's last play.  </P> <P> Now, as the 1989 Southern Section high school football season opens this  weekend, Bruich and Parades have the top two teams of the Times' preseason  Southern Section poll.  </P> <P> Bruich, who is beginning his 13th season, returns an experienced senior  offensive backfield from last season's 10-2 team.  </P> <P> Quarterback Nick Bennett, who directed the Steelers' late charge into the  playoffs last season, leads a talented backfield of running backs William  Ephriam and Missouri transfer Samita Vaoifi, along with fullback Bobby  Sylvester.  </P> <P> They will operate behind one of the top-rated lines in Southern California led  by senior center Roman Guitterez and junior tackles, 6-foot-4, 260-pound Clay  Hattabaugh and 6-4, 270 Robert Loya.  </P> <P> On defense, Fontana's linebackers will be their strength, with Sylvester and  his younger brother Bryan playing inside and Vaoifi and David Lundy playing  outside.  </P> <P> "We ended last season on a positive note," said Bruich, whose Steelers won the  Southern Section major division championship in 1987. "We chose to go for two  and didn't make it. However, this season we have a lot of experience but we  also have to rebuild our defensive line and secondary."  </P> <P> What Bruich lacks in promotion of his team, Paredes willingly fills in.  </P> <P> "They (Fontana) are definitely the top team," said Parades, who led the Lancers  to their fourth consecutive Angelus League title last season. "If we had to  play them to start the season, we'd be overpowered by them because we don't  compare."  </P> <P> Last season, Bishop Amat did not seem to match up to many of its opponents.  But, the Lancers went 11-3, losing to Fountain Valley, 31-24, in the Division I  final. Along the way, they defeated such highly touted teams as City 4-A  champion Carson and Loyola, the top-rated team in the state for most of the  season.  </P> <P> Leading the way for the Lancers this season are receiver Jeremy Smith and 6-3  tight end Jason Green.  </P> <P> Smith, who is regarded as the area's best receiver, also might play tailback,  so he handles the ball more as the Lancers adjust to new junior quarterback  Zach Zertuche, who has shown a strong but erratic passing arm.  </P> <P> The Lancers' defense, which will be led by safety Paul Moetului, is an area of  concern for Parades, who will have a smaller lineup than last season.  </P> <P> "We are not as quick as last season and at times, we will be manhandled,"  Paredes said. "However, our overall speed is good."  </P> <P> Paredes expects for Bishop Amat to take its lumps early, with a schedule that  opens with Rubidoux of Riverside, Carson, Long Beach Poly and Pasadena Muir.  But, he does not rule out a return playoff matchup against his former coach --  Bruich.  </P> <P> "I try not to think about our schedule because if I do, it'll drive me to  drinking," he said. "But, it would be fantastic for us (Bishop Amat vs.  Fontana) to meet again in the playoffs."  </P> <P> TIMES' PREP POLL  </P> <P> Southern Section  </P> <P> PRESEASON POLL  </P> <TABLE

</ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Note -- City begins Sept. 14  </P> <P> With the first official games of the 1989 Southern Section season scheduled for  Thursday night, here are several interesting questions:  </P> <P>  -- Can Loyola shake off its disappointing finish of last season?  </P> <P>  The Cubs were perfect for 12 weeks and appeared headed to their first Southern  Section championship since 1975 before losing, 16-0, to Bishop Amat in the  Division I semifinals. With a weak Del Rey League schedule and the return of  injured quarterback Brian Dennis and players Justin Yarro and Keven Dell'Amico,  Coach Steve Grady and Loyola should rebound.  </P> <P>  -- Will this be a down year for LB Poly?  </P> <P>  The highly-regarded Jackrabbits were hurt by injuries last season, which led  to their first-round playoff loss. Co-coaches Thomas Whiting and Jerry Jaso  will try to rebuild behind quarterback Eucharis Tupuola and speedy tailback  Andre Green on offense, and linebacker Willie McGinest on defense. Poly will  miss All-Division I defensive back Jason Jones, who currently is not enrolled  in school.  </P> <P>  -- Who will be the next great back?  </P> <P>  With the graduation of Russell White of Encino Crespi, Curtis Conway of  Hawthorne and Derek Brown of Anaheim Servite, a void is left. One spectacular  player returning is Lynwood quarterback Charles Levy. The 6-2 Levy proved to be  a quadruple-threat last season, scoring touchdowns passing, rushing, catching  and kick returning.  </P> <P>  -- Has there ever been a small-school with more talent than Montclair Prep has  this season?  </P> <P>  Coach George Giannini has to be smiling. Starting with tailback Michael Jones,  who gained 1,514 yards last season as a junior in becoming one of the country's  leading recruits, the Mounties have junior fullback Derek Sparks, who  transferred from City power Wilmington Banning after making first team All-City  and being named the state sophomore of the year. Joining them will be another  transfer in junior quarterback Leland Sparks (Derek's cousin from Texas), who  will direct the offense.  </P> <P>  -- Will Fountain Valley be one of the worst defending champions?  </P> <P>  Coach Mike Milner has only three returning lettermen from last season's  Division I championship team. Behind the play of quarterback David Henigan, the  Barons made it to the Division final two consecutive seasons, but with Henigan  gone, Milner is faced with a major rebuilding task.  </P></p>

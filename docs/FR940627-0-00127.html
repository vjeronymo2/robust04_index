			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sections describe the criteria which determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FA categories for each fuel family. It should be noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria that define baseline F/FA products for each fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family are not meant to be fuel specifications. The baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria used for grouping purposes in this final rule consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential health implications of the composition of the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or additive/base fuel mixture and might differ from previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established commercial fuel specifications, such as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the American Society for Testing and Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ASTM), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), or federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantially similar'' criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gasoline.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA discussed in the NPRM two options (Option A and Option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B) for distinguishing the baseline and non-baseline categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the gasoline fuel family (see 57 FR 13187&hyph;13188). Today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action uses Option A for the classification of gasoline products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A discussion supporting this decision is included in the ``Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Analysis of Comments for the Fuels and Fuel Additives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Registration Regulations'' (available in public docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A synopsis of EPA's analysis follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major differences between the two alternative grouping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options considered by EPA in the NPRM were: (1) The cutoff point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for oxygen content to distinguish between baseline and non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline products, and (2) the approach for handling F/FAs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have received a waiver under CAA section 211(f). Under Option A,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseline category was to be limited to F/FAs having less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 weight percent oxygen by weight. Because the cut-off point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1.5 percent is consistent with the minimum oxygen requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reformulated gasolines, reformulated gasolines would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered baseline under Option A. Instead, gasolines with 1.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent or more oxygen were to be sorted into different non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline groups depending on the oxygenated compounds they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained. In contrast, Option B used an oxygen cutoff point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.7 weight percent, based on current ``substantially similar''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria (see 56 FR 5352). F/FAs which exceeded this limit but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been granted a waiver for the excess oxygen were also to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful evaluation, EPA has selected Option A for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouping of gasolines in this final rule. In arriving at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision, EPA considered the testing and potential health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implications of both grouping options. The main purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouping system is to sort F/FAs based on the similarities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their emission components. After analyzing existing emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization data, EPA concluded that Option B did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an adequate approach for the testing of gasoline F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it does not distinguish between formulations that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have significantly different emission characteristics. EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation showed that the emissions from oxygenated gasolines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not the same as for non-oxygenated gasolines and that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furthermore, the emission profiles differ according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular oxygenated compound present in a fuel formulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Differences in emission species will affect the toxicological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option B was found inappropriate because it would have allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the grouping of gasolines containing significant amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different oxygenated compounds into one single group. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different compounds may have distinguishable toxic effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA selected Option A for the grouping of gasolines in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule in order to adequately examine the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects of the different oxygenated compounds. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes this best effectuates the goal of CAA Section(e) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require testing of each fuel or fuel additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, gasoline formulations are defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on current ``substantially similar'' criteria (see interpretative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule at 56 FR 5352), the sulfur content for all gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations in the gasoline fuel family is limited to 0.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs in the baseline gasoline category must contain no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or sulfur. Gasoline baseline formulations must possess, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an unleaded gasoline and applicable volatility class standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel, D 4814. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the oxygen content of baseline gasolines must be less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 percent by weight. The baseline gasoline category includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all gasoline fuels and additives (evaluated as additive/base fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixtures) meeting the above criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The non-baseline gasoline category is comprised of F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conform to the baseline specifications in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elemental composition, but exceed the specified baseline oxygen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit. Thus, this category includes gasoline formulations with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or sulfur, which have been blended with oxygenates (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol, ether, ester, furan, and any other compound used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation), such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the total oxygen content of the gasoline-oxygenate blend is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 1.5 weight percent. Included in the non-baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline category are reformulated gasolines and oxygenated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasolines with at least 1.5 percent oxygen (by weight), including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of formulations which have previously been granted CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(f) waivers on oxygen content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The atypical category in the gasoline fuel family includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs which contain elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. (Trace contamination by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements does not cause a F/FA to be classified as atypical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Maculan falls 42% in first half Operating profit at Maculan, the Austrian construction group with large operations in eastern Germany, plunged in the first half by 42 per cent to Sch81.7m (Dollars 7.69m). It also forecast lower net income in the full year. Turnover was up 14 per cent to Sch6.9bn, due to a 19 per cent increase in Germany, which accounted for just over half of group revenue. The group said the decline in operating profit was due to delays in Russian housing projects for returning soldiers and to a dispute over the cost of unforeseen difficulties in a tunnel project in Aus-tria.</p>

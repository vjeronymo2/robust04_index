			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Turkish coalition challenged from left THE Turkish government's decision to lift the ban on political parties outlawed after the 1980 military coup has thrown up the first serious challenge to Mr Suleyman Demirel's parliamentary majority, with the revival of the centre-left Republican People's party (CHP). Turkey's conservative-led coalition had long hoped the CHP would be quietly absorbed by the former CHP prime minister Bulent Ecevit and his Democratic Left, arguably the real inheritor of what is the country's oldest political party. But the election last Wednesday of the maverick social democrat Mr Deniz Baykal as CHP leader raises the prospect that up to 20 Social Democratic Populist (SHP) deputies, now members of the coalition, may leave to form a new party as a first step to joining the CHP. Such a move would reduce the coalition's majority to just two seats, a fact Mr Baykal, a skilful politician, will exploit. Mr Baykal says he will not seek to bring down the coalition. However, his group could wield considerable influence over a conservative-led government, which hitherto has shared few of the CHP's old-fashioned leftist ideals. Mr Baykal, a 54-year-old lawyer, has three times unsuccessfully challenged the deputy prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, for leadership of the SHP. His parliamentary group is known to be critical of government policy on a number of issues, including the Kurds, where Mr Baykal favours lifting the emergency rule in Turkey's south-east. He is also opposed on nationalist grounds to extension of the allied air operation over north Iraq to protect the Kurds. Over the weekend, party officials said Mr Baykal already had support from four deputies who represented the CHP before the coup. Mr Baykal can also expect backing from 16 of the SHP's 70 parliamentary deputies, reducing the coalition to 228 seats in the 450-seat parliament.</p>

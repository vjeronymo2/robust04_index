			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: LCH seeks Pounds 120m guarantee from holders A LACK of insurance cover and an unwillingness by enough banks to back it, has forced the London Clearing House, which clears all transactions on London's futures and options exchanges, to turn to shareholders for a Pounds 120m (Dollars 180m) guarantee facility. The clearing house has been unable to renew its Pounds 170m insurance policy from Trade Indemnity, which runs out at the end of January. The policy is available to settle transactions if both margin payments put up by members of the exchanges and a Pounds 30m guarantee from LCH's shareholders, prove inadequate. Mr David Hardy, LCH managing director, said the clearing house was not alone in seeing cover withdrawn, but it reflected an unwillingness by reinsurers to take on financial guarantee business. The clearing house also tried to arrange a syndicated bank guarantee facility through Commerzbank, paying banks a fee of 65 basis points a year for providing the backing. Too few banks came forward, however, and LCH has now turned to its six shareholder banks: Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. The fee to be paid on the facility has not been disclosed, but is believed to be more than 65 basis points. Mr Hardy said yesterday that the reduction in cover would not lead to any reduction in the level of security on the exchanges and the Pounds 170m insurance cover had only been raised to that level from Pounds 120m a year ago after underwriters had indicated a willingness to provide the extra cover at little extra cost. Banco Espanol de Credito has set a Dollars 1bn Euro-commercial paper programme which is backed by corporate loans to prime Spanish names, Reuter reports. JP Morgan, the arranger, said that the securitised deal is the first of its kind in Europe.</p>

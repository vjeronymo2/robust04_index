			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Smith aims at Tory economic record MR JOHN SMITH signalled a combative start to his leadership of the Labour party yesterday when he ordered an all-out assault on the government's failure to deliver its much-promised economic recovery. His call was met by aggressive speeches from Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown accusing the government of using attacks on the new Labour leader as a smokescreen to disguise deep-seated Tory disquiet at the continuing recession. Mr Blair, who is expected to be named shadow home secretary this week, said the barrage of abuse in a series of speeches by Cabinet ministers last Friday was a 'panic-stricken' response to the danger Mr Smith posed them. In contrast to the Labour leader, elected by an overwhelming 91 per cent of his party, Mr John Major led a 'hesitant and divided party' unable to give the country decisive leadership, Mr Blair said. 'They are a government of inertia when the country needs action,' he added. Mr Brown, widely predicted to become shadow chancellor, said the Conservative manifesto's promise of a swift recovery had been exposed as 'a fraud'. He demanded action on the rising unemployment, poverty and inner city deprivation that was now threatening the social cohesion of the country. The resumption of party hostilites comes after three months of relative calm, induced by the Labour leadership election. That ended on Saturday when Mr Smith, 53, was triumphantly acclaimed leader by 1,500 delegates at a meeting of Labour's electoral college in Westminster. His rival Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, recorded just 9 per cent of the poll, suffering heavy defeats in the constituency, MPs' and trade union sections. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary, also won comfortably with 57 per cent of the ballot for the deputy leadership. Mr John Prescott came second with 28 per cent, trailed by Mr Gould with 15 per cent. In his victory speech, Mr Smith pledged to rededicate Labour as 'the party of change' and social justice. But he also insisted that Labour needed to modernise itself by basing its internal democracy on the principle of one member, one vote, and eliminating the unions' block votes. That process begins today when the national executive committee's special review group on Labour's union links begins its work. The group is expected to report early in the new year with policy recommendations to be debated at the party conference in 1993. Smith aides seek unity, Page 6 Editorial Comment, Page 10</p>

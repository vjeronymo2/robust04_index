			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HORNETS SURPRISE HAWKS, 110-108  </P> <P> The Charlotte Hornets are keeping their home fans buzzing.  </P> <P> Robert Reid sank a 15-foot jump shot with 10 seconds left Thursday night at  Charlotte, N.C., as the Hornets beat the Atlanta Hawks, 110-108. The expansion  team rallied from a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter to improve its  home-court record to 10-14. The Hornets are 13-35 overall. Two of the last  three wins have been against top teams. Last week the Hornets beat the Seattle  SuperSonics.  </P> <P> The winning shot was the climax of Reid's best game of the season. He was 7 for  10 from the field in the fourth quarter to help wipe out the seven-point  deficit.  </P> <P> Dominique Wilkins sank a jumper with 30 seconds remaining before Reid made his  go-ahead shot. Kelly Tripucka made one of two free throws to make it 110-108.  At the buzzer, the Hawks' Moses Malone missed a 12-foot jumper.  </P> <P> "This may not have been the best game we've played," said Hornet Coach Dick  Harter. "But I don't think we ever played any harder.  </P> <P> "Despite that, we were down seven. Reid got hot, but we had to work for every  point."  </P> <P> The Hawks were missing injured forwards Antoine Carr and Cliff Levingston, so  Jon Koncak opened at center and Malone shifted to forward.  </P> <P> Chicago 108, San Antonio 103 -- In another game in which the opposition kept  the ball away from Michael Jordan, Craig Hodges came through to end the Bulls'  three-game road losing streak.  </P> <P> Hodges scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter to keep the Spurs at  bay. His three-point shot with 38 seconds left ended the Spurs' hopes.  </P> <P> Jordan, still bothered by a sore knee, had 23 points, nine assists, six  rebounds and six turnovers.  </P> <P> Dallas 94, Utah 87 -- Mark Aguirre blows hot and cold. When he's hot, the  Mavericks are a match for anyone.  </P> <P> In this game at Salt Lake City, Aguirre was sizzling. He scored half of his 32  points in the second quarter to help the Mavericks build a 47-40 lead by  halftime. They never trailed in the second half despite a 30-point performance  by Karl Malone.  </P> <P> The Mavericks have won three of their last four games. In the three victories,  Aguirre, rumored to be on the trading block, had 36, 24 and 32. In the game  they lost, Aguirre scored seven points in 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Sacramento 142, Golden State 117 -- Just 24 hours after beating the Lakers at  the Forum, the Warriors ran into a group of sharpshooters at Sacramento.  </P> <P> The Kings sank a record 16 three-point shots, going 16 for 31. Ricky Berry made  seven, one shy of the NBA record.  </P> <P> Cleveland 108, Indiana 99 -- For a team that came into the game at Richfield,  Ohio, with a 1-21 road record, the Pacers proved very difficult for the club  with the best record in the NBA.  </P> <P> The Pacers played the Cavaliers on even terms until Mark Price and Larry Nance  each scored eight points in a 20-5 spurt midway through the fourth quarter to  break the game open.  </P> <P> The Pacers had four more field goals than the Cavaliers, but Cleveland was 31  of 37 from the free-throw line to 13 of 20 for Indiana.  </P> <P> Washington 110, New Jersey 103 -- The improving Nets led, 82-71, late in the  third period at Landover, Md., before Harvey Grant and Darrell Walker led a  rally by the Bullets.  </P> <P> Each scored six points in a 14-0 spurt that enabled the Bullets to end a  four-game losing streak. Jeff Malone topped the winners with 23 points.  </P> <P> Houston 113, Portland 110 -- Otis Thorpe made a three-point play with 51  seconds left and Eric (Sleepy) Floyd scored 25 points to lead the Rockets at  Portland.  </P> <P> Clyde Drexler scored 36 points for Portland and center Sam Bowie, making his  first appearance after 2 1/2 years of injuries, had six points in 16 minutes.  </P> <P> Denver 117, Miami 92 -- Fat Lever scored 32 of his career-high 38 points in the  first half at Denver as the Nuggets coasted to victory. Miami has lost 14 in a  row on the road. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

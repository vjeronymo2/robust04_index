			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONSPIRACY COUNT AGAINST BUCKEY WILL BE  DROPPED  </P> <P> A single count of conspiracy will be dropped against Manhattan Beach McMartin  Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey, prosecutors said Wednesday, adding that they  expect to proceed on the remaining 12 counts against him, with testimony from  five children.  </P> <P> "We do not intend to proceed with the conspiracy count, which will shorten the  trial considerably and strengthen our case," Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Joe Martinez told reporters after a 90-minute closed-door meeting with defense  attorney Danny Davis and the new judge assigned to the trial, Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg.  </P> <P> Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted in January of  53 child molestation charges involving the now-defunct school. Jurors  deadlocked on 13 other counts against Buckey and a new trial was ordered.  Prosecutors have until Tuesday to file their amended complaint, and the trial  is expected to begin Wednesday on schedule.  </P></p>

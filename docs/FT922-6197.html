			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Fall of the tireless salaryman: Signs of a decline in Japan's famed work ethic HAVING bickered with his daughter over the choice of daytime television dramas, the holiday-stricken salaryman grabs his golf clubs and heads for the driving range. In the cartoon's next frame, he slices the ball, smashing a window in an adjacent house. In the end, not knowing where to turn, he seeks refuge back at the office, behind his faithful desk. Once the hero, portrayed in the glorious style of socialist realism, the factory and office 'warrior' dedicated to building a strong Japan has become a media-mocked buffoon, lacking in social skills, alienated from his family, and comfortable only in the company of his desk. Young Japanese laugh at the thought of emulating him, and company managers are aghast at the pointed criticism that has skewered the salaryman. The salaryman's fall from grace is part of a larger debate over the fate of the country's famed work ethic, said to be under siege by modern comforts and a creeping, corrupting individualism. This theory is partly inspired by the recurring nightmare that Japan has 'peaked', that the economy is in quickening decline and that directionless Japanese youth will lead the country into mediocrity. Mr Akio Morita, Sony chairman, regarded as Japan's Prince Charles for his sometimes lofty though not irrelevant observations, relaunched the debate a few weeks ago with an unexpected confession that employees are underpaid and overworked. He said companies have failed to recognise that the era of aggressive growth has passed and, essentially, should be more caring and sharing. The timing of Mr Morita's comments, just before the annual wage bargaining season, drew gasps of disbelief from other executives who saw the Sony boss as loading the heavy artillery for the unions. However, Japanese unions are weaker than at any time in recent history and quickly agreed to small pay rises after a half-day ceremonial strike by train drivers, who later offered humble apologies for the inconvenience caused. With wage negotiations out of the way, Japanese executives have felt free to express their opinions on the work ethic, and not all disagree with Mr Morita. Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has just received two reports from special committees drafting a New Economic Plan to better balance the priorities of GNP growth and lifestyle. One report urged that Japan become a 'lifestyle superpower', as opposed to a military or economic superpower. And, as one way of attaining this distant goal, recommended that the country's commuter trains, famed for those white-gloved guards who shove excess passengers into already crammed carriages, be 10 per cent less crowded. Another committee found, as committees have in the past, that the present economic structure focuses too much on the company and too little on the consumer, and that while statistically wealthy, Japanese do not feel affluent. But this government committee went further, encouraging the individualism that is widely seen as a threat to 'groupism', company loyalty, and the work ethic. 'We must make Japan a society in which people can attain a better quality of life, an equitable society where every citizen can both appreciate a comfortable and leisurely lifestyle, and have equal opportunities to develop an individual sense of values,' the report recommended. A survey of 2,125 corporate executives by the Keidanren, the employers federation, showed support for shorter working hours and recognition that the salaryman did not have a leisurely lifestyle. This executive support was tempered by the beliefs that Japan 'cannot afford' to reduce the working week and that Japanese had an innate love of work. But a majority of executives also said this 'love' was fading among younger workers, the shinjinrui or new breed, who see no role model in the middle-aged, desk-bound salaryman. By repute, the ethic-less younger generation will take holidays, swap jobs, and refuse to compromise personal interests for the company good. The changes are more in attitude than action. A separate survey of 10,000 residents by the prime minister's office found, across all age groups and both sexes, that only 24 per cent thought personal fulfilment more important than the national interest, though among males aged between 25 and 29, the figure was 39 per cent. Yet graduates' choice of companies this year showed a clear bias towards the neatly drawn career path and lifetime employment offered by the typical large company and the bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the onset of recession has encouraged the electronics makers, which pioneered the unorthodox practice of mid-career hiring, to reduce this intake to a few specialist staff. 'I thought about working in a small company or starting my own business, but it was safer to work for a big financial company,' said a graduate who joined Yamaichi Securities a year ago. He did not particularly like the work or the weight of the hierarchy bearing down on him, but 'I don't really have a choice'. Rather than young Japanese breaking the social contract, some troubled industries are now tempted to lay off staff. Securities companies increased their employees by 41.6 per cent over the four years to 1990, and the mid-sized brokers, most bruised by the stock market collapse, are trying to find a way to close branches without making staff redundant. The government, meanwhile, will soon have to reschedule the official timetable for the reduction of working hours. The aim was to get the official average working year down from 2,050 hours to 1,800 hours by next year. Unpaid overtime pushes the total as high as 3,000 hours in industries such as banking. But, in the Keidanren survey, 44 per cent of companies were not sure that the 1,800 target could be reached by the end of the century. 'One's life is made up of time, and this should be better understood,' explained a sympathetic executive at Coal Resources Development, a coal importer. But the case of another resources company is more illuminating - Mitsubishi Oil became suddenly famous two years ago when news surfaced of a scheme to fine employees who did not take their full complement of holidays. The truth is that the scheme involved only seven employees in one small section of the crude oil import division. Last year, four of the seven workers failed to take a total of 14 days' holiday and the Y14,000 in fines went to buy beer and sake for their end-of-year party.</p>

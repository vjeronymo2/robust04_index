Grants will be awarded for implementing and operating telemedicine systems that link multi-specialty entities with rural health care facilities for the purposes of delivering health care services to the rural sites and exchanging information between the sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A central goal of the program is to demonstrate how telemedicine can be used as an effective tool in the development of integrated systems of health care. Integrated systems of care provide comprehensive, coordinated health care services to the rural residents served by the system through referrals, consultations, and support systems that ensure patient access to a comprehensive set of services and reduce practitioner isolation. In particular, the program is to promote systems of health care in rural areas that link rural primary care practitioners with specialty and referral services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this grant program, telemedicine is defined as the use of telecommunications for medical diagnosis and patient care. A clinical consultation is defined as a person-to-person interaction relating to the clinical condition or treatment of the patient. The consultation could be between two practitioners, with or without the patient present, or between a specialty practitioner and a patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

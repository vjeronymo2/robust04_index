			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Rural folk step warily into computer future: Kington, a small town on the Welsh border, has become the focus of a communications project KINGTON, folded into the hills along the border of Wales and Herefordshire, is trying for the third time to become a significant communications centre. Once it was a servicing stop for sheep and shepherds en route from the Welsh hills to Birmingham. Later it was touted as a rail hub, the Crewe of the west, when trains seemed the answer to all transport problems. Now its future is tied, experimentally at least, to a computer and telecommunications network called the Kington Connected Community Project. Apple Computer provides the machines. British Telecommunications links them to each other and the outside world. The Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission, anxious about economic development, give helping hands. A happy confluence of mixed motives gives Kington access to Pounds 250,000 worth of equipment and technical expertise. Local residents have drawn up a shopping list of computer applications which, if they work, would make Kington both an economic model for other rural communities and a commercial pilot for Apple and BT. But the provision of computers is only half the story. Mr Craig Sears-Black, the Apple manager in charge of the project, said: 'The merging of computers and the communications business is at the centre of all this, integrating telecoms with our products. We see our application of this (in Kington) as a testbed.' The project is based on four schemes. A communications telecentre will act as the technological and social focus for the project. A computerised stock control system based on three sports shops will act as a model of cost-saving and enhanced efficiency for retailers. Local primary schools will seek to computerise some of their administration, again in a bid to cut costs and ensure survival. A further plan is to computerise tourist information so that, for example, it will be available to visitors 24 hours a day at the touch of a button. Other schemes are being discussed. The local historical society wants to computerise its card index. There is the suggestion of offering a computerised marketing service for professional language translators. Two broad issues are at play. First is the search by Apple and BT for new markets. Second is the extent to which computers and telecommunications might strengthen economic diversification in rural communities where farm incomes are falling. Apple Computer has been alert to the commercial possibilities in rural communities since it made computers available to the community of Jacksonville, Oregon in 1990 and monitored their impact on local business. It says those results were promising. But the Kington experiment is more elaborate. The local residents are deciding what they want to do with the computers and Apple is providing staff on the ground to tell the residents how to do it. Kington is convenient for experimentation. 'We needed quite a controlled and self-contained environment,' Mr Sears-Black said. The town's population is 2,200, or 4,500 if five nearby villages are included. But the figures suggest this is a town where vigour is slowly ebbing. Analysis of the 1991 census by CACI Information Services shows that in the 1980s there was a 25 per cent fall in residents aged between 15 and 19, and that the town has 51 per cent more retired people than the British average. Of the working population, 45 per cent are either self-employed or part-time. Although officially the level of unemployment is low, residents point to considerable under-employment as the rural economy, here as elsewhere, weakens. Certainly the community is not an electronic crusader. Although larger companies in the area have used computers for years, there is a degree of caution among individuals and in the small business sector. Mr Miles Swinburne, the project's community manager, accepts this as natural. 'The reason why business is strong is that they move with the times but they don't jump on the bandwagon,' he suggested. One factor behind the slow take-up of computers in the past, he added, 'is that technical assistance is at least half an hour away. Mr Terry James, a Kington farmer and district councillor, said: 'Another reason for reluctance is that the advice people have had is prejudicial - the advice has usually come from someone trying to sell a specific item.' With the project there is the chance to overcome the prejudice, quieten the techno-fear and try out ideas at no cost. Mr Keith Harris, the computer specialist Apple has put into the town to make the project work, said: 'The great thing for Kington is that they've got me for nothing.' But there cannot be a technological holiday for long. The kit comes free but not the running costs. 'Our primary concern is that the initial projects should start to make some money fairly quickly,' Mr Harris warned. Apple and BT are there for a year, and the Rural Development Commission and the district council for three. After that Kington will be on its own again.</p>

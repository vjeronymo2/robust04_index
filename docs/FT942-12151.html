			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: Boom-town Shanghai can learn from its dubious past - Stanley Stewart explores a city at the forefront of China's rush to the future At lunch, the Hong Kong businessman could hardly contain himself. He waved his chopsticks, swallowed a snake, and conjured investors' dreams through mouthfuls of clouds' ears. 'It's big. It's very big. It's almost too big.' He choked on a duck's foot and leant across the table. 'One point one billion people,' he whispered, as if China's population was a secret he felt he could trust me with. 'It's the future.' The future is a big player in Shanghai. From our window seats high above the Bund, the city's gracious river-front boulevard, we could see the future across the Huangpu river. It was busy pushing up concrete towers on the skyline of the enterprise zone of Pudong. A financial district, a manufacturing centre, a free trade area and a science park were being built, part of developments that make London's Canary Wharf look like a suburban estate. China's rush to embrace market forces is turning Shanghai into a boom town, full of feverish speculators. The statistics are staggering: more than 1,000 joint ventures, nearly Pounds 7bn investment in infrastructure, 10bn sq ft of new office space. They say a new company is formed every 11 minutes. Unlike the rest of China, however, Shanghai has seen it all before. Turning your gaze from the skyscrapers of Pudong, you can look down on the classical facades of the Bund, the great banks and trading houses erected in the first half of this century. They are the monuments of old Shanghai, Asia's first and greatest commercial giant. Created by Europeans in the mid-19th century from a fishing village on a mud bank, Shanghai was a concessionary port where foreign traders could operate immune to Chinese customs and laws, a situation that continued until the communist take-over in 1949. By the 1920s, Shanghai was a cosmopolitan city with a huge expatriate population and a dubious reputation. 'One never asked why someone came to Shanghai,' Lady Jellicoe warned. 'It was assumed that everyone had something to hide.' Old Shanghai was a bit of Europe grown grotesque in the hot-house climate of the Orient. In a city caught between the South China Sea and 1,000 miles of rice paddies, you could order a well-cut suit, a French dinner, a new car or a set of monogrammed golf clubs. You could attend horse races, baseball games or football matches. You could gossip in five languages. A suburban colonial life-style offered the reassuring rituals of afternoon tea and club membership but did little to gloss over the baser temptations in which the metropolis had come to specialise. The missionaries who went hunting Chinese souls declared that if God allowed Shanghai to survive, then he owed an apology to Sodom and Gomorrah. Only the pursuit of pleasure rivalled the pursuit of money. Shanghai catered to every taste. Gambling clubs, dance halls, opium dens, freak shows, music halls and brothels vied with each other for trade. 'If you want girls, or boys, you can have them, at all prices,' wrote Christopher Isherwood. 'If you want opium, you can smoke it in the best company, served on a tray like afternoon tea.' Old Shanghai is remarkably intact. The great banks and trading houses, the old hotels, the palatial villas and the clubs still stand. For the European, strolling through Shanghai is like rooting through the effects of a great aunt whose life has long been the scandal of the family. In the grid of European avenues, l met a money changer. He was a retired school teacher, a dishevelled, gloomy individual trying to augment his pension. We went to lunch in what had once been a grand apartment building, now broken into tenements and adorned with laundry. An old woman ran a lunch counter in a hallway: three simmering pots and a couple of tables. All around us was the architecture of half a world away: classical pediments, fanlights, stained glass, French windows opening on to wrought-iron balconies now crowded with bird cages and bamboo chairs. Men shuffled past in bath robes and plastic slippers; from an upper floor, a marital quarrel echoed down the stair wells. I asked the money changer what he remembered of the arrival of the communists. 'It was very quiet, really,' he said. 'Everyone who should have left had left. A few nights before their arrival, Chiang Kai-shek cordoned off the Bund and emptied the banks of their bullion. They carried the gold bars across the road in the glare of headlights and loaded them on to ships for Taiwan.' Within weeks the brothels and bars were closed, the street names changed and rickshaws abolished. The prostitutes were re-educated and sent to work in factories; the White Russians set sail for Australia; the bankers, traders and gangsters went to Hong Kong, Singapore or Sao Paolo, and the international riff-raff went home. After the public avenues of the European districts, the old Chinese city - which lies to the south of the Bund - seems an intimate, domestic place. The inhabitants lunch on their doorsteps and wash their hair at outside taps. Pastry cooks stand in open windows conjuring dumplings from clouds of steam. Tiny shops specialise in buttons, umbrellas, block prints, carving knives, dressing gowns, pet birds and snuff. Nearby, in Salty Melon Street, vendors hawk bucketfuls of crabs and turtles and jellyfish. At the centre of the old city are the Yu Yuan gardens, said to be the inspiration for willow pattern china. Back in the Bund I found the Shanghai Club, a British establishment once so exclusive that the doorman was said to have consulted members before admitting passers-by trying to escape a gunfight in the street. The Long Bar, once the preserve of taipans, is now patronised by Malay midshipmen, broad as tree trunks, arguing over their diminutive Chinese girlfriends. In the billiards room across the hall, nothing seems to have changed in 60 years except the height of the tables. During their occupation, the Japanese cut down the legs to improve their cue action. The centrepiece of the Bund is the Peace Hotel, known formerly as the Cathay. Built in 1929 as the headquarters of the Sassoon empire, it was in its day one of the finest hotels in the world. Noel Coward wrote Private Lives there, sitting up in bed in an uncharacteristically hideous dressing gown, listening to Sophie Tucker records. Having survived spies, Americans and Madame Mao, the Peace has now regained its former elegance. Every evening, a septuagenarian but sprightly jazz band plays a rag-tag collection of tunes. In the restaurant upstairs, the waitresses are once again wearing the cheongsam, the long, split skirt banned by the communists. At night, with the tugs hooting in the Huangpu below, you can gaze along the floodlit buildings of the Bund, like a vast stage set. As for the new stage set across the river, you sense that the script is not written yet. Past and future face each other across the Huangpu, and the former has much to say to the latter. Shanghai's first commercial boom was brought to an end with the communist take-over. With hindsight, the reasons for its demise seem fairly predictable: rampant corruption, an excess of foreign ownership, and an inability to include the widest spectrum of people in the benefits of its boom. On the brink of its second boom, Shanghai would do well to remember that lesson.</p>

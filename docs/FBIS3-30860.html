Spokesmen said that Boross had outlined the serious trade  losses caused to Hungary from UN sanctions on rump Yugoslavia,  and voiced concern over the fate of ethnic Hungarians in  Vojvodina. Hungary hopes for help from Ukraine in peacefully  settling the south Slav conflict, the prime minister added.    Radetskyy noted Ukraine would increase its peace-keeping  force in Bosnia under a parliamentary decision.    Boross said why Hungary wants closer links with NATO, and  stressed the importance of the peace-partnership plan. Both  Boross and Radetskyy hoped for greater business links based on  mutual advantages.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilts market is facing this week in far better fettle than many analysts thought possible in the aftermath of last Thursday's Italian and Swedish interest rate rises. A comparatively robust performance last Friday brought out buyers and there is a general belief that this week's crop of economic figures should sound no serious inflationary alarms. The market is more optimistic in spite of a rise in 10-year benchmark bonds yields to 8.64 per cent late on Friday from 8.4 per cent the week before. Mr Nigel Richardson, of Yamaichi International in London, expects the week to be split into two. The first half will be overshadowed by fears of higher US rates from tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Domestic issues will then take over, with Wednesday's retail price and average earnings data and Thursday's retail sales figures expected to provide further evidence of steady growth with low inflation. Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg believes the market could be thinking about funding questions by the end of the week. He predicts a positive reaction if the Bank of England decides against an August gilts auction, as this would suggest the public sector borrowing requirement poses few problems.</p>

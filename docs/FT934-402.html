			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Unilever steps up race for ice cream group Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is offering FFr1,420 a share for the 15 per cent of Ortiz-Miko, the French frozen foods company, that is listed on the Paris stock market. The Anglo-Dutch group earlier this week mounted a FFr1.9bn (Dollars 327.9m) offer for control of Ortiz-Miko, a family-run company and a force in the French ice cream market, where it is best known for its Miko brand. The announcement of the terms of the public offer marks the second phase of the deal. The first phase, disclosed on Monday, involved Unilever offering to buy 75 per cent of Safral, the company that owns 85 per cent of Ortiz-Miko. Mr Vidal Ortiz, chairman, has not yet announced whether he will sell his 24 per cent Safral stake. Completion of the deal would turn Unilever, already the world's largest ice cream manufacturer, into the market leader in France. However, Ortiz-Miko yesterday revealed the full extent of its financial difficulties. It warned it would make a loss in the current financial year.</p>

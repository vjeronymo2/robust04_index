			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Discounting leaves Silentnight down 11% SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, said that sterling's devaluation was bad news for the UK furniture trade because it would lead to higher import costs. The Lancashire-based company said the precise impact the lower pound would make was difficult to predict at this stage, but estimated that 20 per cent of its raw materials were imported. Silentnight blamed a prolonged period of discounting by UK retailers for an 11 per cent drop in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.62m) in the six months to August 1. However, turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m), and the group said its market share had increased. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman of the family-controlled group, said: 'Further reductions in UK interest rates would assist with a much-needed recovery of consumer confidence.' Mr Davies said the discounting had been an attempt by retailers to stimulate sales. 'Determined efforts are being made to recover margins in the second half, and some early signs of improvements are evident.' Sales by the beds division, rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 45.23m, and trading profits advanced from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 45.2m. All four businesses saw a reduction in margins, but were profitable and gained market share. Sales by the cabinet division increased by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 16.31m and trading profits rose from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 16.3m. Homeworthy continued to grow and held margins, while Silentnight Cabinets completed its factory extension. A new German bed and mattress subsidiary, bought in May, added Pounds 1.5m to the international division's trading profits of Pounds 9m (Pounds 7.9m). It was expected to contribute to the second-half performance at margins similar to those of the UK businesses. International sales were down 5 per cent at Pounds 7.49m, with volume in the north-east of the US depressed by recession. Earnings per share were 10 per cent lower at 5.98p (6.64p) but the intermim dividend was maintained at 2.25p.</p>

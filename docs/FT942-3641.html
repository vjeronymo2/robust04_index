			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Student voucher plan seeks to use market forces Yesterday's recommendation from university vice-chancellors for a 'voucher' system for students to pay for higher education is an un-precedented move. Their report also proposes a radical package of measures to make it easier for students to move between universities, and to re-enter education after a career break. The aim is to restructure higher education following the recent sharp expansion in numbers - which has seen the proportion of 18-year-olds going to university double in five years - while safeguarding quality. The report comes from the Higher Education Quality Council, an agency set up by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, with government backing, to oversee standards in universities. The council also calls for further expansion and extended student choice. The recommendations cover the entire higher-education system, and include proposals to set up a National Credit Framework for further and higher education. This proposal would allow students to accumulate credits towards an eventual qualification in different institutions, taking breaks if they wanted to do so. To back this reform, students would be given a uniform National Credit Transcript, similar to the US model, which would ensure that their progress was being marked to a common standard. This in turn would require an electronic National Credit Register, and an independent central service for evaluating credentials. A new 'associate degree' would be established as an interim qualification into higher education. The quality council believes this could be linked to the General National Vocational Qualifications being introduced as an alternative to A-levels in schools. These qualifications cover broad vocational subjects such as leisure and tourism or manufacturing. The new qualification would not be equal to an honours degree in value, but could be used as a stepping-stone to one. Legislation would be amended to ensure that tuition fees, paid by the government direct to colleges and universities, and maintenance grants paid to students would be portable between different institutions. Institutions would be paid according to a system of credits, earning more credits if more students successfully gained qualifications. Educational vouchers for students would be introduced, which could be redeemed to pay for any course at any university, introducing more market disciplines for education providers. Student information products, such as prospectuses, would be a subject to a quality 'kitemark' to ensure that choices were based on reliable information. Universities would start a consultative forum for professional bodies and employers. Choosing to Change. UCAS, Fulton House, Jessop Avenue, Cheltenham, Gloucs, GL50 3SH. Pounds 25.

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Italy reins in budget deficit: Economic Watch Italy's budget deficit fell by 3.3 per cent last year but was still marginally higher than forecast at L153,539bn (Pounds 62bn). This compares with a projection of L151,200bn and the previous year's L158,840bn. Excluding interest payments on the rising debt stock, there was a surplus close to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Although austerity measures to contain public borrowing were the harshest applied by any EU member, the deficit still represented almost 10 per cent of GDP. Italy is committed to bring the deficit within Maastricht convergence criteria to around L106,000bn (5.8 per cent of GDP) by 1996. The 1994 budget envisages a deficit of about L151,000bn. Consumer prices in the Netherlands rose 0.5 per cent in February from the previous month and were 3 per cent higher than a year earlier. Excluding indirect taxes, the February consumer price index was up 2.5 per cent from a year earlier and 0.6 per cent up from January. Swedish consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in February, and 1.9 per cent since February last year.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Buoyant Smith raises his stock - Smith calls government 'foolishly inept' A BUOYANT Mr John Smith yesterday acted to defuse recent criticism of his leadership style by unleashing a withering assault on the government's credibility and competence. Exploiting a rare opportunity to grapple with Mr John Major head-to-head in a full-length Commons debate, the Labour leader hit back at recent internal rumblings about his 'Horlicks leadership' with a bravura performance which combined sober economic analysis with good jokes. Making the most of his opportunity to take aim at an opponent softened up by former chancellor Norman Lamont's extraordinary resignation statement, Mr Smith dubbed the hapless prime minister 'the man with the non-Midas touch.' The government was 'consistently incompetent, hopelessly accident-prone, so foolishly inept,' he said, listing a panoply of mishaps stretching from Black Wednesday to last month's 'botched' reshuffle. It was no wonder we were living in 'a country where the Grand National does not start and a hotel falls into the sea', he said. Introducing a motion condemning Mr Major's 'betrayal' of election promises, Mr Smith started by concentrating on tax increases announced in Mr Lamont's final Budget, including the extension of VAT to domestic fuel which he said amounted to a 'staggering' Pounds 17.5bn. In the 1992 election campaign the prime minister had promised tax cuts year upon year and said that his party had 'no plans and no need' to extend the scope of VAT. Instead it was 'tax increases year on year,' Mr Smith said. 'The stark truth is that every family in the land will have to foot the cost of this government's perfidy.' The government was 'prepared to promise anything to get elected.' The Labour leader was at pains to emphasise that the less well-off would be disproportionately affected by some of the Budget changes. The main difference between putting 1 per cent extra on national insurance contributions and levying another 1p on income tax was that national insurance hit the lower paid harder, he said. Nor had the Conservatives said in their general election campaign that they would freeze personal income tax allowances in their first post-election Budget, Mr Smith continued. 'National insurance increases, VAT and frozen allowances; not quite the double whammy we kept hearing about (in the election). It has turned out to be the Tories' triple whammy on the British taxpayer.' Brushing off a string of angry interventions from the Tory back benches, Mr Smith argued that what the country was starting to resent was the 'low ambition' the government had for Britain. The people of Britain did not want a 'low-wage sweatshop' economy, or 'high and debilitating' unemployment, or 'confrontation and dogma' in the classroom. What they wanted was a government they could trust. No amount of reshuffling, repackaging and representation could disguise 'the stark reality of a discredited government presided over by a discredited prime minister.'</p>

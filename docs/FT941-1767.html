			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Cambodia troop morale is hit Government troops occupying the former Khmer Rouge headquarters at Pailin are finding unseasonal rain wreaking havoc with a new road built to supply them with food and ammunition, while malaria is affecting their health and morale. After two weeks of heavy fighting, government commanders say they are in control of the former Khmer Rouge base, but guerrillas still occupy commanding positions near by. The victory at Pailin came rapidly; there is talk in the Cambodian capital that this marks the end of the Khmer Rouge as a viable force. It is a bad political blow to the faction, but loss of an important base will not stop rebel units continuing their campaign. The loss of Pailin has also hit the Khmer Rouge in another way: Gem mines and timber in the area have until now earned them millions of dollars a year. Senior officers say at least 10,000 government troops supported by heavy artillery and helicopter gunships were involved in the assault on Pailin. Government soldiers are now pushing into surrounding hills to clear out remaining Khmer Rouge pockets. The main obstacle now facing the government side is the logistics. 'Their ability to supply and communicate with their troops is being severely stretched,' one diplomat said. At least 20 kilometres from the base, the new road is blocked and the rest of the way is only passable to military tanks. On Wednesday, one tank carrying soldiers and three freelance photographers hit an anti-tank mine. Two soldiers were killed. Government troops at Pailin are short of food and medicine; water supplies are low. In one unit, most soldiers had not been given their Dollars 20-a-month wages for six months before the attack. Since losing Pailin, guerrillas have attacked five villages, killing eight people.</p>

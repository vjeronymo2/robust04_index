			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Good relations Trivial pursuit. What has Procter &amp; Gamble, the US soap sud giant, in common with Albright &amp; Wilson, the UK chemicals firm, soon to be refloated on the UK stock market? Answer: Both companies were started by brothers-in-law. William Procter and James Gamble got together in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1837 at the prompting of their father-in-law. Arthur Albright got his big break in 1851, five years after he married the local squire's daughter. He was on the lookout for a chief engineer for his West Midlands phosphorus business and a husband for his sister-in-law. John Edward Wilson came up trumps on both counts.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Postel prepares Pounds 120m deal to save troubled Greycoat POSTEL, the UK's largest pension fund, yesterday announced plans for a Pounds 120m rescue package for Greycoat which will give it up to 87.7 per cent of the troubled property company. The proposals underline the increased enthusiasm for British commercial property among institutions, which consider that property offers good value as the market stabilises. 'We are getting a geared interest in a top-quality portfolio when the market is turning,' said Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel. Postel justified the unusual step of taking a large stake in a single company by its existing expertise in property. Property accounts for about Pounds 2.3bn of Postel's assets under management of about Pounds 20bn. The deal may give Greycoat, which has a stake in the proposed Paternoster Square development next to St Paul's Cathedral, a new lease of life as a developer. It acquired a reputation as one of London's best developers in the 1980s, as a result of projects such as the Embankment Place office block above Charing Cross station. The decline in property values, however, has plunged it into financial difficulties. Analysts were divided yesterday on whether Postel was picking up a bargain. 'This is a backdoor takeover by Postel at the expense of bondholders and shareholders,' one said. Others emphasised that Greycoat will remain a highly geared company, which will work against Postel if there is a setback in the property market. Greycoat, which owns property worth about Pounds 500m, indicated yesterday that it had net assets of at least Pounds 80m. As well as being a potential source of finance for Greycoat's schemes, Postel believes Greycoat's management could exploit opportunities within its own portfolio. In a complex deal, Postel is underwriting a Pounds 58.9m rights issue of ordinary shares at 12.5p and a Pounds 6.25m preference rights issue. Greycoat is also placing Pounds 4.5m of shares with Postel and issuing it with warrants. Postel, which owns 5.4 per cent of Greycoat, will increase its stake to between 27.2 per cent and 87.7 per cent, depending on the take-up of the rights issue, although it intends to dispose of enough shares to allow Greycoat to keep its listing. Mr Ross Goobey and another Postel director will join Greycoat's board. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Isosceles agrees deal on refinancing ISOSCELES, the highly-indebted owner of the Gateway supermarket chain, has reached agreement in principle with its creditors for a refinancing. The proposals are being scrutinised by the credit committees of the 50 banks involved in the negotiations and a final agreement may be reached next week. Yesterday, however, Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the largest US supermarket operators and 53 per cent-owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, joined the growing list of investment institutions which have written off their equity holding in the company. A&amp;P owns 7.2 per cent of Isosceles and is taking an Dollars 89.2m (Pounds 46m) provision to cover the potential loss. Isosceles has long stressed that it is not looking for an injection of new capital but requires a relaxation of its loan covenants to enable it to invest in its new format Food Giant, Somerfield and Solo stores. 'Things have at last started to move, thank God, and that is a great help,' said one party involved in the talks. The company is technically in breach of its banking covenants and has been rolling up the interest on its Pounds 300m of mezzanine debt, but it has continued to service its Pounds 1.1bn of senior debt. A&amp;P had previously valued its stake at cost - which, according to its recent annual report, stood at Dollars 148m at end-February exchange rates. Tax breaks mean the after-tax provision to cover a write-off is less than the cost of the stake, but A&amp;P is now attaching no value to Isosceles equity. The US company's move is the latest in series of write-downs by Isosceles shareholders. Last week 3i, the venture capital group, wrote off its Pounds 45m equity holding. In May, Mercury Asset Management also cut the value of its stake by an undisclosed amount. Murray Johnstone, which has a 1.3 per cent stake, wrote down its holding by 44 per cent five months ago and will review its position this month. However, Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking business which is Isosceles' largest shareholder with a 40 per cent stake, still carries the holding at cost. Wasserstein said yesterday it would be unlikely to adjust the valuation until calendar year-end. A&amp;P results, Page 23</p>

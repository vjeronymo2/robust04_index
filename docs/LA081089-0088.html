			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CLOSES POPULAR RECREATION SITE;  </P> <P> BUBONIC PLAGUE FOUND IN SQUIRRELS AT PINE MOUNTAIN AREA  </P> <P> The U.S. Forest Service has temporarily closed the Pine Mountain Recreation  Area north of Ojai in the wake of a bubonic plague infestation in squirrels  found in one of the area's two campgrounds.  </P> <P> The Forest Service blocked the entrance to the four-square-mile area's only  access road, off California 33 about 30 miles north of Ojai, said Steve Horne,  a Forest Service employee. The move thwarted campers, hunters, hikers and  hang-glider pilots who take off from Pine Mountain's 5,084-foot peak, Horne  said.  </P> <P> The closure will last past the beginning of bow-hunting season on Aug. 19, and  could be in effect until October, he said.  </P> <P> Thousands annually flock to the area, which includes two semiprimitive  campgrounds and some majestic scenery, including a view southwest across the  Oxnard Plain to the Channel Islands and northward into the Cuyama Badlands,  Horne said.  </P> <P> During a routine check last month, the Ventura County Department of  Environmental Health discovered that squirrels in one of the Pine Mountain  campgrounds were infested with plague-carrying fleas.  </P> <P> After the discovery -- the first "in recent memory" in the Ojai Range area,  Horne said -- the Forest Service shut the campground, and the county tried to  kill the fleas by dousing rodent burrows with insecticidal dust.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plague-Carrying Fleas  </P> <P> But warning signs about the plague discovery failed to deter vacationers, Horne  said.  </P> <P> "We were having trouble keeping people out of the closed campground," he said.  "We'd drive up to check on the area, and people would be picnicking right next  to the sign that said 'bubonic plague.' "  </P> <P> That forced officials to take the more drastic step of eliminating access to  the entire area, Horne said. The area will remain closed until the  plague-carrying fleas are eradicated, he added.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the dusting failed to bring the campground's flea population down to  an acceptable level -- about half a flea per squirrel, said Randall Smith,  Ventura County environmental health specialist.  </P> <P> The county is waiting for the state to deliver a more powerful insecticide  before it tries again, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not That Unusual  </P> <P> Smith said plague is not all that unusual in wild rodent populations throughout  California.  </P> <P> "It's not a bloom of plague or anything like that," he said. "We know that  there is plague in Los Padres National Forest. It's scattered throughout the  forest. We just look in campgrounds because that's where most people would come  into contact with it."  </P> <P> Another Ventura County campground, Chuchupate, near Frazier Park, has been  closed since 1981 because of bubonic plague infestation. The county's  Department of Environmental Health is conducting a plague ecology study in an  effort to track it in the animal population and find a way to successfully  eradicate the carrier fleas, Smith said.  </P> <P> He said the study is due to be completed next summer.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zaire has a new prime minister. The High Council of  the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] today appointed  Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Andre Mounyinga, an  active member of the French branch of Mr. Tshisekedi's Union for  Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS], has reacted to Mr. Kengo  Wa Dondo's appointment. He does not seem at all happy about it.  Mr. Mounyinga was interviewed by our correspondent in Paris,  Mohamed Youssouffou Saliou.    [Begin recording] [Mounyinga] It is an unacceptable  violation  because it does not comply with the transitional text based on  the agreements signed with them. The text does not indicate  that a prime minister should be appointed by the HCR-PT. It is  a violation we are not prepared to accept. We will fight it  just as we fought the violations in the cases of Nguz  Karl-I-Bond, Birindwa, and many others.    [Saliou] How do you see Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's political  future?    [Mounyinga] That is not the point. The question that needs  to be asked is: How do we see the country's political future?  I can only tell you that the whole population continues to  rally behind the ideal of change which Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi  and all the UDPS activists initiated a long time ago. You can  be sure that this popular support will continue all the way.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: OFFICE LEASING RECORD  </P> <P> A record 3.9 million square feet of office space was leased in Orange County in  the past year, according to a survey by Newport Economics Group.  </P> <P> Most of the space, said the firm's president, Robert Dunham, was leased by  large companies currently located in Orange County and expanding.  </P> <P> Almost as much office space was built last year as was leased, Dunham said, so  vacancy rates remained relatively high, registering 19.4% at the end of the  year.  </P> <P> As before, the John Wayne Airport area had the most construction and the most  new tenants, but Irvine Spectrum has 1 million square feet under construction  already committed to major tenants, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Reduction in capital gains depresses Rhone-Poulenc Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which was privatised last year, reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net profits to FFr189m (Dollars 32m) from FFr676m in the first three months of 1993. The company said the decline, which contrasts with improved results at other European chemicals groups, largely reflected the sharp reduction in capital gains on the disposal of assets and the absence of currency gains. Both factors lifted profits in the same period last year. Operating profits slipped by much less than the net result, falling to FFr1.68bn from FFr1.74bn. Sales increased to FFr20.09m from FFr19.8bn for the three months. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, said the results showed the beginnings of an upturn in sectors sensitive to recession and a stabilisation in the group's healthcare activities. However, in spite of the improvement, he said the company did not expect a genuine upturn in the European economy this year. Organic and inorganic chemicals activities benefited from improved sales, lifting profits to FFr57m from break-even last year in spite of continued weakness in prices. The fibres and polymers division recorded strong gains, increasing profits to FFr134m from FFr51m, while specialty chemicals saw profits rise by 22 per cent to FFr179m. The healthcare division, which includes US-based Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, reported slightly higher profits of FFr1.23bn. The most difficult problems were encountered in the group's agricultural activities, which include herbicides, pesticides and insecticides. . Operating profits declined by 29 per cent to FFr343m. According to Rhone-Poulenc, sales were affected by bad at the beginning of the year in Europe and the US. The market has since started to recover, the company said, adding that the division was on course for improved profits for the full year. Industry observers said full-year profits for the group as a whole were difficult to predict because of the importance of asset sales. In the first quarter of last year, for example, gains on asset sales amounted to FFr244m, compared with just FFr17m in the first three months of this year.</p>

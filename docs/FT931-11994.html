			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A hint of nostalgia AFTER TUESDAY'S surprise cuts in bank base rates from 7 to 6 per cent, Britain is enjoying the lowest nominal short term interest rates for 15 years. The comparison is evocative. In 1977 the country was perceived to have an appalling balance of payments problem, a huge burden of public sector debt and a banking system that was struggling under the impact of a property market crash. Plus ca change. Yet with hindsight the gloom was hopelessly overdone. The balance of payments was necessarily in deficit in the 1970s, as investment built up in the development of North Sea oil. Despite all the talk of strikes by investors in the gilt market, the Bank of England demonstrated an unexpected flair for marketing 57 varieties of government IOU. In the event, the late 1970s turned out to be that rare thing, a period of successful export-led growth, which came just as the world was about to make the transition from inflation to disinflation. Could the early 1990s also turn out to be better than they felt at the time? The case is easier to make than a spate of gloomy recent economic statistics might suggest. As in the late '70s, the high current account deficit is in part a reflection of high business investment. Instead of North Sea oil, Britain now has inward Japanese investment, especially in the motor industry, which is only beginning to build up export impetus. And it is possible to detect a silver lining even in Thursday's dismal trade figures, since the buoyancy of imports owes much to the investment-related inflow of intermediate and capital goods, which are up 15 per cent and 10 per cent respectively on the year. Poor response As for the government's funding position, it is clearly uncomfortable, even in a world now largely devoid of exchange controls. Estimates for the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 range upwards from Pounds 50bn, while total annual institutional cash flow, most of which normally goes into equities, is a little under Pounds 50bn. The poor response to the government's gilt-edged auction this week carried a notable echo of the 1970s. Yet if the government confronts an investors' strike, its wounds are partly self-inflicted: it persists in applying the so-called full funding rule, whereby the PSBR has to be financed entirely from outside the banking sector. A safe prediction for 1993 is that this funding rule will prove no more durable than the government's commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. And it would make sense to be rid of it sooner rather than later. The threat of inflation, on which the rationale for the rule rests, is greatly overstated in the government's rhetoric when its own figures show that the broad M4 definition of money actually shrank in December and dropped out of its 4-8 per cent monitoring range. Strict proviso In an economy that has suffered two years of shrinking output, the need for further cuts in interest rates is blindingly obvious. Even after the recent weakness of sterling, the exchange rate is still less competitive than in the second half of the 1970s. And by offering a steeper yield curve, whereby short gilt rates are substantially below long rates, the government would be offering the banks a means of recapitalising themselves by making low risk profits, just as the US banks have done. Encouraging banks to buy gilts would not only stop the shrinkage in broad money, since reduced sales of gilts to the non-bank institutions would lead to more deposits in the banking system; it would also give a fillip to bonds and equities, thereby reducing the cost of capital to industry and commerce. There is, however, one vital respect in which this rosy scenario remains strictly conditional. In the 1970s the International Monetary Fund was there to impose a tight fiscal embrace on the Labour government. Today, although the PSBR is heading for comparable magnitudes as a percentage of GNP, the IMF is absent. This matters, because if export-led growth is not to run into a balance of payments constraint and, ultimately, a renewed upsurge in inflation, the government has to rebalance policy to ensure that aggressive monetary relaxation is matched by a courageous fiscal policy designed to address the structural element of the budget deficit. Nothing, alas, in the recent record suggests that the government is up to the task.</p>

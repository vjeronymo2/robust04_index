			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO ASSISTANT NAMED HEAD GRID COACH AT SOUTH HIGH  </P> <P> Don Morrow, offensive coordinator at Redondo High and a former standout  quarterback in the South Bay, has been named head football coach at South  Torrance High, the school announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Morrow succeeds Joe Austin, who stepped down after last season to enter  business with his brother. Austin coached the Spartans to a 108-63-2 record in  16 years.  </P> <P> Neil Griffith, assistant principal in charge of athletics at South, said Morrow  had been the school's No. 1 coaching choice for several weeks but did not  conclude the deal until there was a full-time teaching position for him. Morrow  teaches chemistry.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased to have Don Morrow," Griffith said. "He came highly  recommended from Redondo High, from the coach (Les Congelliere) there and from  everybody who has played against him. He certainly was our top choice."  </P> <P> Griffith said Morrow was chosen from a field of four or five candidates who had  applied.  </P> <P> Morrow gained a reputation at Redondo as an exceptional offensive coach with a  flair for developing quarterbacks.  </P> <P> He was an all-CIF quarterback for defunct Aviation High and played at El Camino  College and Cal State Northridge.

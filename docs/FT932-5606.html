			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: S Korean credit for China chemical deal SAMSUNG, the South Korean conglomerate, is providing a Dollars 48m (Pounds 31m) credit to help upgrade an ethylene project in China's north-east, under an ambitious plan to make the plant one of the largest producers in Asia. Samsung's involvement will help increase ethylene production to 300,000 tonnes a year. An agreement was signed at the weekend with the Jilin Chemical company and China National Chemical Construction. Last September, the South Korean company won a Dollars 200m contract to modernise the Jilin plant, China's largest producer of chemical fibres. Mr B H Kim, Samsung's chief representative in Beijing, said Jilin Chemical would use the export credit loan to buy ethylene glycol production equipment made under licence in Korea. He said there were also plans to build petrochemical plants at Shandong, Hubei and Guangdong.</p>

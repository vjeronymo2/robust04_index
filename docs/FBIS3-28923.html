Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a press  conference that working-level officials may hold an emergency  meeting on the collapsed trade talks Tuesday [15 February] to  prepare for a similar meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and key cabinet members possibly later in the week.    The framework trade talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral  trade imbalance, broke down last weekend over a U.S. proposal  that "objective criteria" like numerical targets be set to gauge  Japan's efforts to open its market to foreign goods and services.    Government sources said Hosokawa appears unwilling to  hastily  restart the framework talks. Rather, they said, the premier  wants to fashion a sort of new action program to present to the  U.S. in a bid to break the ice on the bilateral negotiations.    At a meeting earlier in the day of government and ruling  coalition parties, Hosokawa vowed that Japan would make  voluntary efforts to bring down its trade surplus with the U.S.  before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic  powers in Naples in July.    The sources said the forthcoming government meeting on the  collapsed framework talks will study such measures as further  deregulations to help correct the wide gap between domestic and  overseas prices and boost imports, and more voluntary efforts by  the private sector to open the market.    Asked what Japan will do about bilateral trade with the  U.S.,  Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also said earlier in the day that  the government will consider "whatever macro and microeconomic  steps Japan should take."</p>

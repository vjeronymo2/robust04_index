The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Where to Obtain Additional Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under Sections 104(i) (14) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 [42 U.S.C. 9604(i) (14) and (15)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities. This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $1,340,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 19 awards. It is expected that 10 noncompeting continuation awards will be made for approximately $598,000. Approximately 9 new awards will be made for approximately $742,000. The average new award will be $80,000 ranging from $75,000 to $85,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, with a 12-month budget period within a project period of 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period are made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overall purpose of the program is to work toward the ultimate goal of reducing exposures to hazardous substances and mitigating potential adverse health effects from such exposures. Applications should describe how progress toward this goal will be measured. This program will assist State health or environmental departments to identify, develop, disseminate, and evaluate appropriate educational materials and programs on the potential health effects, prevention, medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosis and treatment of injury or disease related to exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. Special emphasis will be placed on exposures found at or near Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites, and other sites identified by ATSDR's Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP). See Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) below for a description of HARP. (Superfund sites are defined as sites on, or proposed to be on, the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL)). HARP sites include petitioned sites and consultation sites, in addition to NPL sites. A list of HARP-recommended sites will be included with the application package. Following are definitions or descriptions of the activities to be performed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

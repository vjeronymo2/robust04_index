			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Representatives of parties  and movements constituting the Realistic Bloc (RB) agreed on  Monday [2 May] that the RB would not split, RB Executive Council  Chairman Vaclav Grulich told journalists today. The RB is formed  by the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Liberal Social  Union (LSU), Christian Social Union (KSU), Greens Party (SZ),  Zemedelska strana [Agrarian Party] (ZS), Farmers' Movement (HZ)  and Czech Women's Union (CSZ).    During the Monday meeting, the RB Caucus and RB Coordination  Council agreed that the practise of rotating RB chairman once a  month hindered serious work, Grulich said, adding that this was  why a three-strong Executive Council was formed, including  Grulich (CSSD) as its chairman, Radek Navratil (LSU) and Marta  Bartonova (CSZ). Two members of the Council will be rotated  once every six months, Grulich said.</p>

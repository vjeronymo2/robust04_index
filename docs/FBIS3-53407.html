The enemy has begun to demand its share of land  and water and to weasel its way out of Resolution 425.    After meeting with a delegation from the photographers'  union, he added that the forced military service campaign  practiced by the occupation and its agents in the occupied  border strip is an attempt to justify introducing Lahd's army  within the ranks of the Lebanese Army.    Speaker Nabih Birri discussed some changes that have taken  place on certain matters: the revival of sectarian grudges in  sports, for example, as happened between the teams of al-Ansar  and al-Hikmah; Rabin's visit to the border strip; and the  introduction of Israeli reinforcements. He noted that this is  not mere coincidence. He said the Lebanese have once again  proven that adherence to unity is the best kind of action and  one of the conditions for resistance. He stressed that there is  a Lebanese problem before a problem with Israel. There might  also be a Lebanese-Syrian problem and a Syrian-Jordanian  problem. He adds: I believe that efforts should be made on the  internal front to clarify these conspiracies. The Lebanese  people are capable of taking a united stand.    He drew attention to the fact that there are many villages  that have been wrenched away from Lebanon such as al-Mtullah and  the seven villages. Talk about Israel's owning 400 dunums  (approximately 1.4 acres) of al-Mtullah is an Israeli attempt to  circumvent Resolution 425 and deceive the public.</p>

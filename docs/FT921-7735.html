			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar takes a breather THE DOLLAR took a break yesterday from its recent hectic scramble, even ignoring better than expected consumer price data, writes Peggy Hollinger. It finished the day in London slightly weaker at DM1.6470, compared with DM1.6480. Strong rumours that the Federal Reserve had been checking dollar/D-Mark prices pushed the US unit down from DM1.6475 to DM1.6425 at one stage. The market had previously speculated there would be no hint of intervention until the dollar rose to DM1.70. In New York it eased to DM1.6430. Economists stressed that yesterday's decline was minimal and the dollar was expected to stay strong. 'It will not be rampant any more,' said Mr Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank, 'but it is not going to go down either.' The dollar enjoyed a half-hearted rally on the announcement of core consumer prices up just 0.3 per cent, as opposed to the forecast 0.6 per cent. However, stop-loss trading was triggered when it hit DM1.65, forcing the US currency down to the low DM1.64 levels in the afternoon. The long-awaited Humphrey Hawkins speech to Congress from Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan offered no surprises. Economists said Mr Greenspan had narrowly avoided congressional criticism over Fed actions to encourage economic recovery, by announcing the easing of credit requirements the night before the speech. The dollar continued its cautious rise against the yen, closing in London at Y128.35 from Tuesday's Y128.00. Rumours that the Fed had also been checking dollar/yen prices in New York held the US unit back in Europe. But earlier in Japanese trading the dollar enjoyed a more healthy rally from Y127.17 to Y128.20. The Bank of Japan checked dollar/yen rates at the Y128.10 level, but to no avail. In New York last night it ended at Y128.20. Sterling was tarnished by the dollar's muted performance, remaining unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.8850. Encouraging UK retail sales figures had little effect as the market was looking towards today's fourth-quarter GDP numbers. The speculation about a base rate cut was 'bubbling away in the background', said Mr Austin, but had done little damage. Rumours of an interest rate cut co-ordinated between the Spanish and British central banks could resurface in three weeks when Spain releases its next set of inflation figures. 'That would fit in conveniently with a cut around (UK) Budget time,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. The pound remained at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism grid and was at its limit against the peseta, which slipped from Pta 62.56 per D-Mark to Pta 62.61. The Bank of Italy had been buying D-Marks at the Milan fix with an eye to keeping the lira at about L750, said Mr Cocker. It ended at L750.05 per D-Mark, against L750.13.</p>

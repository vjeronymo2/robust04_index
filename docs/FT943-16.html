			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -North America (54): America's Teflon economist - Profile / Alan Greenspan As chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan has enjoyed an unusually long, five-year streak of lower interests. But in February, the Fed changed direction. By mid-August, it had raised short-term interest rates in five separate stages, lifting the discount rate by a percentage point to 4 per cent and the federal funds rate by 1 3/4 percentage points to 4 3/4 per cent. The Fed chairman's position is lonelier when interest rates are rising, and Mr Greenspan's reputation was all the more firmly in the balance because of the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, and the corresponding fall in share prices, which the Fed's reversal triggered. Stranded by the erratic movements of monetary aggregates, and convinced that the consumer price index provides only an erratic and tardy reading of inflation, Mr Greenspan has been compelled to scrutinise an eclectic mix of statistics to develop his reading of inflationary pressures. Mr Greenspan's gradualist policy of tightening in small increments was accused of inflicting a water torture on the markets, which were constantly anticipating the next small rise in interest rates. Meanwhile, the Fed chairman was portrayed in a much-criticised book on President Clinton's economic policy by Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter, as having struck a Mephistophelian bargain with Mr Clinton, convincing the president that if he cut the budget deficit long-term interest rates would fall. At moments, Mr Greenspan appeared in danger of losing the label William Seidman, the sharp-tongued former chairman of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, had once given him: 'the only Teflon economist I know.' Yet at the same time, decision-making within the Fed has appeared to move out of the sole control of the chairman and into a more collegiate process involving the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee, comprising the six central governors and a rotating sample of the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, meets every six to eight weeks, and sets the overall framework for monetary policy. In the past, the FOMC used to recommend a 'symmetric' stance, meaning rates should stay the same, or an 'asymmetric' stance, opening the way to a rise or a fall in interest rates; the actual decision to move was left to the Fed chairman, acting between committee meetings. This year, however, the FOMC has not only raised interest rates on the day of its meetings, it has also announced the moves publicly. Some of the regional Fed presidents, too, have begun to speak out more openly about their monetary policy views. 'In terms of the management of monetary policy, Greenspan's style has led to the democratisation of the Federal Reserve policy process,' wrote Manuel Johnson, who served as vice-chairman under Mr Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul Volcker, in a recent article in the magazine International Economy. With most economists now convinced that the economy is gliding into a soft landing, Mr Greenspan is now getting more credit for his monetary engineering. Mr Johnson, indeed, says he is 'within striking distance of becoming one of the most successful chairmen in the history of the Federal Reserve'. Mr Greenspan, meanwhile, remains as enigmatic as ever after seven years in the job. He appeared to take it as a compliment at one recent hearing on Capitol Hill when a member said he was 'worse than the State Department' in his ability to avoid answering the question. He once kept a dinner gathering of Washington economists on tenterhooks for an entire evening, waiting for some hint of his thinking on monetary policy, while he regaled them with a discourse on the effects of falling transportation costs on world trade. Yet Mr Greenspan, who studied music at the Juilliard School in New York and played bass clarinet in a jazz band, is quite a socialite, playing weekly tennis games with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and featuring prominently on the Washington cocktail circuit. With only two years to go before his term expires, however, it is his relationship with Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist appointed by Mr Clinton to be vice-chairman, which is under most scrutiny. At a recent conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, sponsored by the Federal Reserve bank of Kansas City, Mr Greenspan appeared to wince when Mr Blinder declared: 'In my view, central banks through macroeconomic policies do have a role to play in reducing unemployment.' That may not represent a radical disagreement with Mr Greenspan. Mr Blinder insisted that this role was in the short term, and that macroeconomic policy had nothing to do with the unemployment rate five or 10 years out. Mr Greenspan, for his part, has told visitors he sees the task of the central bank as promoting economic growth and not only controlling inflation. Moreover, there appears to be no disagreement between the two on current monetary policy, at least in the US; Mr Greenspan would never be as outspoken as Mr Blinder was in his criticism of European monetary policy. But Mr Blinder may have to learn some of Mr Greenspan's discretion if he is to take over the chairmanship in 1996.</p>

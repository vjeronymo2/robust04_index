			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah followed </F> by remarks in answer to a question by unidentified reporters, on  27 February; place not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] This is an al-Ibrahimi-mosque-style attack  against Christians. The perpetrator is the same and the  objective is identical. The perpetrator in both cases is  Israel. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you think that the bombing is aimed  against the visit of His Holiness the Pope to Lebanon [scheduled  for May]?    [Samahah] It may be directed against the visit ... [pauses]  Among other things, it may be directed against the visit by the  Holy See to Lebanon. I certainly hope that those who have  expressed opposition to the Pope's visit have nothing to do with  this morning's incident in Sayyidat al-Najat Church. [passage  omitted]</p>

The 71-year-old Cambodian monarch, who underwent surgery on  October 7 to remove a tumor in the prostate area, left the  hospital "recently" after he "endured the treatment very well."    King Sihanouk is to travel to Pyongyang at the end of the  month to visit his longtime friend, President Kim Il-song,  before returning to Phnom Penh on April 8 for Khmer New Year.    A Western diplomat said that after his anti-cancer  treatment,  King Sihanouk had lost his hair but had gained weight.</p>

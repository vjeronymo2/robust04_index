			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: NEW, USED DREAMS FOR SALE  </P> <P> For us, the dream is over. We sold out and someone from Los Angeles bought it.  Why not? The property is only a 700-mile drive for the new owner.  </P> <P> According to the lore, anyone living between Guadalajara and Anchorage lives in  terror of being taken over by Californians, a fact celebrated in bumper  stickers that say, "Don't Californicate Oregon." Portland and Seattle have  become hot spots of these real estate ravishment fantasies. But even quiet  little towns in central and northern California such as San Luis Obispo and  Mendocino seem worried.  </P> <P> Of course, when the locals speak of the Californians they fear, they are not  referring to tweedy, ecologically minded, culturally sensitive San Franciscans.  The nightmare is hordes of muscular blondes in fluorescent bras on  roller-skates together with tan, hairless-chested surfer boys on bodyboards  careening down Main Street.  </P> <P> The locals also fear the couple who drive up in front of the  Victorian-plus-five-acres in their powder-blue Mercedes 450SL. Will the  visitors get on their cellular phone and say, "One eighty-nine five? Is all  cash OK?"  </P> <P> The monsters in the Mercedes are the modern Attila: Rich Invading People from  L.A. RIPLAs are unwanted by everyone. Except the sellers.  </P> <P> Even rumors that rich people from L.A. are in an area can send real estate  prices higher than a palm tree on a Beverly Hills lawn. Just a whiff of Robin  Williams in the air sent real estate prices soaring in Gualala, a tiny coastal  town. Ditto with Sylvester Stallone in a remote part of Maui. If he wanted to,  Jack Nicholson alone could boost Portland prices 25% overnight.  </P> <P> I don't think Nigel Fingerman is actually rich. All I know about him is that he  lives in L.A., he has something to do with the music business, he made us an  offer, and he now owns our dream.  </P> <P> The dream we sold to Nigel was 20 acres of raw land with what is known as a  "blue water view." That means the Pacific Ocean sits out there like a mirage --  too far to walk to, too beautiful to walk away from. You can't really walk  anywhere because the land is densely forested except for the deer trails and  the old dirt logging road that leads you to it. There's no water, no power and  no people. All there is is a place to imagine.  </P> <P> Imagine a cabin here. Imagine if we find a spring there. Imagine a little  garden here. Imagine a play structure there.  </P> <P> When we bought the land 10 years ago, our dream was this: We would go up every  weekend despite many hours driving on the twisted coastal highway with a  carsickness-prone child. ("Prone" here means you pull over in terror every time  she coughs.) We would improve the land but still keep its natural character.  (Ha! How little we understood nature's imperative to maintain her own overgrown  self.) Eventually we would retire there and live like Ma and Pa Hippie Kettle,  sleeping by moon, cooking by wood, taking only what we needed, back to the  land.  </P> <P> In 1980, one still had these pre-Reagan visions.  </P> <P> My husband and I forgot one thing: We were city people. Our parents had  struggled to get away from the land they came from and get to the city, where  they could earn a living and buy some luxuries like a refrigerator.  </P> <P> One other problem: We had no skills and no tools (except the checkbook). And we  had no time to acquire them. We hardly had time to drive up there. We were too  busy working the jobs that allowed us to indulge in a 20-acre dream.  </P> <P> As dreams go, it wasn't all that expensive. Less than a time-share. Way less  than a house -- even in Portland. Less than even the cheapest Mercedes.  </P> <P> So, we got a little trailer up there and kept it stocked with all the  necessities -- dishes, diapers, fresh roast coffee. For a few years, we went up  maybe 10 times a summer. Then the kids got bigger and work got more hectic and  we had what is known as "scheduling problems."  </P> <P> Nature soon let us know that unless we planned to stay there and fight her, she  would reclaim the land. We would have to regrade the dirt road. We'd have to  evict the critters in the trailer. We'd have to keep clearing the trails we had  cleared. We'd have to cut trees to keep the view. Someone suggested we get us  some marijuana sharecroppers to maintain the land.  </P> <P> Instead, we sold to Nigel Fingerman of Los Angeles, making no money on the  deal. If we had put the money in a passbook account at a crumbling S&amp;L,  we'd have done better.  </P> <P> Yet, I'm not even sure why we sold it. I think we just felt like jerks as we  realized how far our fantasy was from reality.  </P> <P> The day after we signed the paper giving Nigel Fingerman permission to act out  on our dreamscape, all the newspapers reported that a movie star had bought a  house down the road and real estate prices in the area were expected to jump.  Did Nigel know something from the old L.A. Dudes Network or was it just our bad  luck?  </P> <P> When we bought the land in 1980 with our earnest chunk of cash and our  infatuation with redwoods/ocean/sun, the agent said in all candor, "I sell new  and used dreams."  </P> <P> Ours is used up now, and the land is more natural than we found it. This land  was our land, this land is Fingerman's land -- until the next used-dream sale.  </P> <P> All I'm saying is that if you're in the north woods and see a guy in Ray-Bans  and a Lakers T-shirt gathering twigs and carrying a bucket of water, give that  ugly Californian his chance.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its ground as currency declines Wall Street US STOCK markets held their ground yesterday in the wake of a declining dollar and some mostly negative economic reports, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.91 up at 3,266.26, having spent the day near to Monday's close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.04 at 416.07, while the Nasdaq composite added 2.49 at 565.61. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly light at 174m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 945 to 738. Although the stock markets have been hostage to the dollar's fortunes in recent weeks, yesterday's drop in the US currency's value to an all-time low against the D-Mark had little effect on equities. Attention was otherwise focused on economic news. A 0.1 per cent rise in July leading indicators, a 0.6 per cent decline in construction spending in the same month, and the slight fall in the National Association of Purchasing Management's August index confirmed that economic activity remained extremely sluggish in spite of the lowest domestic interest rates in 30 years. Lennar lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 on news that some Florida homeowners, whose Lennar-built houses were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, plan to file a suit against the company. The decline may also have been a natural correction to recent gains in Lennar stock, prompted by expectations that the company would benefit from the demand for new homes in south Florida. Another stock affected by the hurricane was American Reliance, which dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange on the expectation that the company will incur substantial direct losses from property damage in Florida. Airline shares were in demand as investors anticipated an improvement in carriers' business now that the summer fare war is over. UAL advanced Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 107 1/2 , Delta rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52 1/2 , USAir put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 13 1/2 and AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 . Oil issues, which have posted strong gains in recent months after a long period in the doldrums, were mostly lower after broking house Wertheim Schroder cut its ratings on six big oil companies, arguing that they had reached, or were near, their target prices. Royal Dutch shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 90 3/4 , Texaco Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , Atlantic Richfield Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 114 3/8 and Amoco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 . Canada TORONTO share prices closed steady for the second consecutive day. The TSE 300 index gained 4.7 at 3,407.6 and advancing issues led declines by 294 to 218 after a fair volume of 30.2m shares. MDC 'A' rose 7 cents to 55 cents and topped the actives list on volume of 5.3m shares after heavy block trading. PWA said it has begun legal action to have Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems declared insolvent. Gemini termed the action without merit, said it has a strong financial position and that PWA had boycotted meetings of the Gemini board. PWA, up 43 cents on Monday, lost 15 cents to CDollars 3.15. Air Canada, which is a partner with Gemini, gained 10 cents at CDollars 4.50.</p>

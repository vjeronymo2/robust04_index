			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Phan Van Khai, party Political Bureau member and </F> deputy prime minister, at the midterm conference of the Ho Chi  Minh City fifth party committee: "Ho Chi Minh City Must Move  Forward More Quickly and Firmly in Economy, Culture, Society,  Security, and National Defense" -- date not given]    [Text] Dear Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the party  Central Committee, and dear Comrades;    I am very happy to attend the midterm conference of the Ho  Chi Minh City party committee [HCMCPC], a party committee with a  glorious revolutionary tradition in the national liberation and  unification undertaking. This tradition is also manifested  clearly with its dynamism in renovation and socioeconomic  stabilization and development. This city holds an important  position and provides great shares to implementing the two  strategic duties of national construction under the socialist  direction and national protection.    On behalf of the party Political Bureau, I welcome the  delegate comrades and convey the trust of the leading party and  state organs in the HCMCPC and people.    The HCMCPC political report presented by Comrade Secretary  Vo  Tran Chi correctly and straightforwardly evaluates achievements  and progress as well as shortcomings in implementing the seventh  national party congress [SNPC] resolution and the HCMCPC fifth  congress resolution. It also analyzes and forecasts major  opportunities and challenges and outlines major duties and  measures for the coming period to satisfactorily execute the  SNPC resolution.    Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the party Central  Committee, has delivered a speech contributing his views on the  lines and measures to stabilize and develop the socioeconomy and  strengthen national defense and security. I would like to  address four issues to contribute further to your debate.    I. The Position and Responsibility of Ho Chi Minh City in  the New Period of National Development.    1. Throughout the national revolution process led by the  party over harsh and dangerous stages, the HCMCPC and people  have always contributed deservingly to the common national  cause. In 30 years of two consecutive resistance wars for  national independence and unification, the Saigon residents  faced a widespread mechanism and force of brutal oppression  directly on enemy territory. Overcoming great losses and  sacrifice, grassroots party establishments in this city have  ceaselessly consolidated and developed. Under the HCMCPC  leadership, our people's political fighting movement and Armed  Forces in Saigon and Gia Dinh have always been an exemplar of  the ironed-walled South Vietnam.    The entire party and people are thankful to the people here  for their stalwart fighting which greatly contributed to our  total victory to liberate Saigon and South Vietnam and unite the  nation. We share the feeling of "happiness with tears" as music  composer Xuan Hong wrote in his popular song.    We also cannot forget that soon after, the socioeconomic  situation in this city plunged into a crisis with numerous  difficulties. Life was so hard that the laboring people were  forced to partly substitute barley corn for rice for their  meals. From city leaders to grassroots cadres, our party and  state organs had to spend most of their time and energy finding  rice, vegetables, meat, and fish for the people's meals.    In that situation, the HCMCPC and residents not only proved  their spirit for enduring difficulty and hardship, but they also  developed dynamism and creativeness to improve the situation.  This city contributed practical experiences with new ideas and  actions at quite an early stage, creating a foundation for our  party to review and outline the renovation line.    Always being among the localities which lead the way in the  process of transforming to the market economy under state  management, Ho Chi Minh City has actively contributed to forming  new structures, developed its bridging role in international  relations, and helped stabilize and develop the economic  situation in South Vietnam and in the entire nation.    At present, with only 6.4 percent of the national  population,  Ho Chi Minh City (including all economic units in this area)  shares about 16 percent of the gross national income, creates  nearly one- third of the national industrial products and postal  and transportation volume, reaches more than half of the  national export volume, sells one-fourth of all retail goods,  contributes one-fourth of the budget revenue, attracts nearly  half of direct foreign investment, and trains more than half of  all college students. These figures prove the important role and  position of Ho Chi Minh City in the country.    2. In the past three years, the city economy has enjoyed a  development rate higher than the national average. It has  mainly overfulfilled key targets set forth by the Ho Chi Minh  City fifth party congress. Earlier, its retail price index was  higher than the national index. In 1993, the city reduced its  inflation rate below the national rate (1.6 percent compared  with 5.2 percent).    The recorded achievements together with geographical,  socioeconomic, and international relations advantages have  created better conditions for this city to develop in the new  stage. In reality, the new period actually started in the city  two years ago, creating momentum for faster and firmer  development steps in the coming period.    However, there are many challenging issues in this city at a  higher and complicated level such as: a lack of discipline and  order in socioeconomic activities, poor management of state  property, the prevalent practice of corruption and waste, the  difficulty in maintaining political stability and social order  and safety, the increase of social evils and poisonous and  harmful cultural products, and so forth.    In our city, great opportunities go in hand with harsh  challenges in terms of economy, politics, and society.    3. Our country is entering a new development stage, the  stage of industrialization and modernization, when the speed of  economic growth rate will be greatly accelerated and the social  equity and social progress will be better implemented.  Henceforth, Ho Chi Minh City will have a more important  position and bear heavier responsibility.    The core content of industrialization and modernization is  the fundamental and comprehensive transformation from a manual  and backward industry to a modern and advanced industry which  utilizes technological and scientific progress to reach higher  labor efficiency and attain better social advancements. It is  indisputable that in the industrialization and modernization  process, Ho Chi Minh City in particular and the southern  economic region (including Dong Nai and Ba Ria-Vung Tau  provinces) in general, have the most advantages, the most  important locations, and higher development levels than other  localities. Our party Central Committee and government always  consider this region a driving force in the industrialization  and modernization process, a force playing a decisive role in  national development and in the effort not to let our economy be  left further behind those of other countries. Ho Chi Minh City,  therefore, should bear the tremendous responsibility and task of  being a vanguard locality, and should strive for faster and more  steadfast advancements in all economic, cultural, social,  security, and national defense fields. It is an life-long  demand, a great honor, and a heavy responsibility for Ho Chi  Minh City to maintain the undertaking to construct and protect  our fatherland.    II. The City Can Only Develop Strongly and in the Right  Direction When It Forms an Alliance and Cooperates Closely With  Other Regions and Localities Under the Unified Leadership of the  Central Level.    1. In the context of national strategy and state planning,  Ho Chi Minh City, with its strength and advantages, should  develop its role as an industrial center by having an ever  increasing technological level, a trade-finance-services center,  a head of the transportation system, and a  culture-science-technology center for the southern region and  the country as a whole.    To fulfill that role, the economic structure of the city  should be developed in the direction of increasing the  proportion of industry and services. It does not mean that we  should adopt any types of industry or services, but only those  with high technology which do not cause pollution. In other  words, we should strive to increase the scientific and  technological contents of the city's produces and services, and  move production activities with low technology and high manual  labor to outlying suburbs and other areas. The reason is that  we need to develop the city's advantages, which other localities  lack, and at the same time we need to try to maintain a  reasonable city population and avoid a high population density  that would lead to complicated problems in living conditions,  public transport, environmental protection, and above all,  social vices.    The industrial sector of the city currently still has high  proportions of production activities in food grains, food  staples, chemicals, fertilizer, rubber, timber processing,  paper, construction material, ceramic and glass products (these  products comprised 62.9 percent of production output value in  1990 and 63.5 percent in 1993). In the meantime, areas such as  machinery production and electronics constitute much smaller  proportions, and were decreasing (9.9 percent in 1990 to 9.2  percent in 1993). Though the situation is complicated and cannot  be explained by a single reason, it shows us clearly that in  entering a new development stage, industrial development needs  careful planning to channel all the advantages of the city,  using them in effecting logical and efficient changes to the  economic structure. The city must have an increasing ability to  accept modern and advanced technologies so that it can transfer  them later to other localities.    In the development of trades and business, employment is now  a high priority issue. But if we follow the direction of  developing trades and professions which mainly employ manual  labor, then the demographic population growth rate will be  higher and the employment problem will become more tense. In  1993, the demographic population growth rate was 1.67 percent,  higher than the natural growth rate, which was 1.58 percent. In  the last few years, the population of the city has increased by  approximately 150,000 to 160,000 people each year -- about the  population of a district -- half of them (in fact, it could be  more) were from other localities.    The problem cannot be solved by administrative measures. It  can only be solved by the combined measures of reforming the  economic structure of the city and improving transport and  communications, and most of the living conditions of the areas  around the city. It requires the close alliance and cooperation  of the city and the ministries, sectors, and other localities.  It requires the elimination of departmentalism and  sectionalism, which alienate localities from the central level.  From now on, the setting up of business and production  establishments in a locality will be considered completely in  terms of the long-term socioeconomic benefit for that locality,  not in terms of whether the capital contributors and business  managers are from that locality or not. Organizations and  individuals from Ho Chi Minh City are entitled to invest in  production establishments in other localities, and vice versa.  Capital and expertise cannot be limited by boundaries between  localities or authority levels. We need to motivate all  available sources of capital and we also need to foster and  utilize skills. (With investment projects that produce fast  economic benefits such as hotel, services, and so forth, we let  foreign investors contribute most of the capital for joint  ventures, because the motivation of domestic capital in our  country is still made difficult due to rampant departmentalism,  localism, and sectionalism; or is even restriced by the small  scale of an organization).    2. In addition to the transformation of the economic  structure in the direction of increasing the proportion of  industry, the city must further develop its roles as the  finance-trade-service center, the spearhead of the national  transportation network and international external relations, and  also the center for culture, science, and technology. The  number of visitors to the city and the merchandise, capital, and  technologies going through the city are enormous. The city  should see them as advantages, because activities in these  areas, which we generally describe as services, will constantly  increase in proportionate to economic growth.    To be able to fulfill these requirements, the city  authorities should concentrate all available resources on the  construction of the socioeconomic infrastructure. Foreign  sources can also be included, but state fund should be the main  source. The electricity and communications networks have been  strengthened, but the work done so far is still inadequate. The  water supply and drainage systems; the transport system;  facilities for education, public health, scientific research,  technology, and so forth require greater investment. It is the  responsibility of the state authorities to solve these issues.    In the development of business and production activities, we  rely on development investment drawn from all economic sectors,  including from the people and from direct foreign investment.  The state is not the main investor in business and production  fields; it only supports these activities by providing  investment credit or contributing shares in essential  establishments.    At present individual businessmen and the general public  have  not yet invested eagerly in production. They tend to choose to  do business in trade, services, real estates, and so forth. The  main reason for this situation is that our policies, laws, and  structures have not been able to create trust among people. We  also lack guidance and support, and sometimes we even hinder  development efforts or are confused and sluggish in forming and  developing the capital market. Once we overcome these  weaknesses the development investment in the city will see a new  boom.    So far, whenever we have mentioned the leading role of the  state- run economic sector, we have referred only to state-owned  business establishments. Now we need to correct this  misconception and realize that the state economic sector  comprises not only the state- run business establishments but  also other resources and assets, the finance and state bank  systems, and national reserves. If we could utilize and manage  these resources effectively in combination with our legal  institutions, the state would be perfectly capable of guiding  all economic activities in the directions it chooses. We need  to see this clearly in order to understand and implement  uniformly the multisectoral economic policy, to positively  reorganize management structure in state business  establishments, and to be confident in developing other economic  sectors.    III. Culture and Society Are Core Elements of Development.    This is our party's viewpoint, which accords well with  international convention and is also the strength of the city.    The development in the quality of education, health  protection services (including physical education and sports),  cultural and art activities, as well as social and charitable  activities has been thus far carried out with outstanding  results, that serve as precious experiences in the  "socialization" work that we should fulfill with the people's  support.    Our main efforts at present should be to combine  "development  with suppression": we need to develop cultural, educational,  health, and social activities, and at the same time strive to  suppress social vices -- namely, prostitution and drug abuse,  which are directly connected with the risk of spreading  HIV/AIDS, and represent a degraded, pernicious culture. The  expansion of the market economy and external relations require  us to protect our society more vigorously against those vices --  from the small family unit to schools, agencies, enterprises,  and mass organizations. Resolute legal and administrative  measures should be carried out in parallel with education and  motivation work that focus on building cultured individuals,  families, and society. All cadres and party members must strive  to build cultured lives for themselves and for their families,  and must consider the effort a necessary part of the duty of  being a model for society.    IV. The Organizational Mechanism and Cadres Are Decisive  Elements    1. In all areas we already have policies, directions, and  measures. The essential elements that decide the results are  the organizational mechanism and cadres.    The further we have proceeded on our renovation, the more  apparent we have found the inadequacies in knowledge, ability,  and moral standards among the organizational mechanism and  cadres in all sectors and echelons. Therefore, it is obvious  that we need to combine economic reform with administrative  reform. Within the administrative reform there are three most  important parts we need to focus on to improve our ability to  develop a market economy within the effective management of the  state on the path of socialism:    -- Fundamentally reform the financial-monetary system in  accordance with a market economy.    -- Continue the rectification of the efficiency of state  business enterprises to improve them.    -- Reorganize the cadre mechanism.    2. The adjustment of the state mechanism to stop its  awkwardness, bureaucracy, and corruption must start with its  structure.    While discussing the anticorruption line, the party  Political  Bureau clearly defined that corruption is the result of many  causes, of which the fundamental cause is our structure and  policies. Our current policies have too many gaps and  loopholes, which are a feeding ground for corruption and  bribery. What does corruption live on? Mainly state property  and money. Who are corrupt? Most of them are the party and  state cadres.    There are many issues relating to corruption and  authoritarianism. The prominent ones are:    -- The current state mechanism is still confused between the  role of state administration management and the role of state  property ownership, and it has not ended its intervention in the  business management of the state enterprises. Therefore, we  must clearly distinguish these roles, set up a structure to  separate the state property management from the state  administration management, and establish a system of ownership  in state enterprises to ensure that the property in these state  enterprises has a real owner. Then, we must gradually eliminate  the system of managing organizations and rearrange the state  mechanism to reduce the number of specialized ministries and  departments.    -- We must build a structure with clearly defined  responsibilities in the management of state property and in the  use of public funds, reform the capital funding and the use of  state capital, and improve the collection of tax and budget  revenue (including fees, fines, and so forth). These tasks  require us to reform and improve our system of accounting,  editing, public finance, and the control and supervision of  public funds to prevent arbitrary spending of state property.    -- We must fundamentally reform the administration  procedure,  clearly define what authority can introduce administration  regulations (including fees), reduce matters requiring state  permission, eliminate complicated procedures, and publicly  announce procedures and regulations that government officials  must conform to in receiving and solving public inquiries. We  also have to organize public campaigns to encourage the public  to contribute their view for the improvement of our  administration procedure. And we must immediately conduct an  investigation into and deal with stage organs and officials  violating the working procedure.    -- We must enhance the supervision and control role of  public  elected organs (the National Assembly and people's committees)  and establish a structure to ensure public supervision of the  performance of state organs and officials. We must proceed with  the setting up of administrative tribunals to settle disputes  between citizens with state organs and officials.s    Reforming the structure to counter authoritarianism and  corruption must be linked up with public education and  participation. A corrupt official both violates the law and  damages his morality and character. He not only destroys  himself, but also stains his family. In fighting corruption, we  need the punishment of the law, the condemnation of society, and  prevention by colleagues and family.    The aforementioned are tasks that cannot be delayed. But  they must not be conducted in a simplistic and hasty way. The  government has its own program for executing those tasks on a  national scale. Recently, this city has positively performed  some tasks (such as the administrative reform). It is necessary  to draw experience for future reference.    3. The cadre-related issue has a very significant meaning  for  the party leadership and state management in this city.    Ho Chi Minh City enjoys favorable conditions for attracting  cadres from variable sources, especially the concentration of  outstanding cadres in many fields. The problem here is how to  create mutual trust, unity, and respect at work. We have to  give priority to common benefits and work results without  discrimination regarding the origin of the cadre. This is the  first important factor in developing the ability of cadres and  attracting more talented people to create the city strength.    The increase of training and refresher training for cadres  need to go together with the evaluation and check through actual  work to select for promote the cadre according to their  morality, ability, work efficiency, and management ability.    In Ho Chi Minh City, the cadre-related work has a decisive  meaning. Therefore, it is necessary to have a high unanimity in  perception and line in this work before making it a party  resolution, which will serve as a foundation for the evaluation  and selection of cadres, thus strengthening the city party  committee and government to turn the city into a regional and  national center in many fields, including the field of  cadre-related work.    Dear delegate comrades.    My meetings with delegates of different generations in this  conference have made feelings and experiences arise in me that I  obtained while I worked here, especially for 14 years after the  liberation of this city.    I profoundly acknowledge and always remember the people here  with their revolutionary enthusiasm and love, the dynamism and  close comraderie cooperation among cadres in different sectors  and levels, and the attentive leadership and guidance of  well-eperienced key cadres. These were elements helping me to  develop and accomplish various duties in different positions  during my work here.    Together with other cadres from this city now working at the  central organs, we always follow every developing step of this  city with all our sentiment and knowledge. We consider our  responsibility for this home city an obligation, honor, and  pleasure.    With a sincere and respectful feeling, I wish the conference  to have successful and earnest discussions and high unanimity in  perception and action to lead our city in moving more quickly  and more firmly in the new developing period. I hope that the  party committee and people, with their past achievements, will  heighten their determination to meet the requirements of  everyday life and excellently accomplish the duty entrusted upon  them by the party and state, deserving the love and trust of the  people in the entire nation.</p>

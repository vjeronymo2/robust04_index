			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: A good drinking companion - Asa Briggs raises a glass to an alphabetical, illustrated, treatise on wine THE OXFORD COMPANION TO WINE edited by Jancis Robinson Oxford University Press Pounds 30, 1086 pages In editing this massive Oxford Companion to Wine, Jancis Robinson, Financial Times wine writer, has accomplished a unique double. She was the first person to present a television wine series. Now she is the first person to offer to a smaller but more knowledgeable public an impressive reference volume that treats wine as English literature, music, art, mind and medicine have already been treated. She calls the writing of it 'the greatest challenge of my life'. There are more than 3,000 alphabetically-arranged entries, many of them illustrated, which cover an immense range of subjects, some of which could include cross references to other OUP Companions. There is an interesting entry, for example, on wine in English literature though none, surprisingly, on art or music. There is, too, one on 'Health, Effects of Wine Consumption' with a reference in the reading list to Sir Richard Doll. There are many references to mind. Under Herodotus, for example, we learn that 'far from regarding drunkenness as undesirable or immoderate behaviour, the Persians, if Herodotus is to be trusted, viewed it as an altered state of consciousness that is as valuable as sobriety'. The very presence of Herodotus in the volume demonstrates that the ancient world is given due attention. History, indeed, is well treated throughout. The 19th century is not neglected, and some of the interesting British writers on wine are included, like AIexander Henderson (a medical doctor) and Cyrus Redding, 'England's answer to the great wine explorer of France, Andre Jullien'. Both Redding and Jullien were travellers, and Redding, convinced that geography mattered more than history, discussed wines from all parts of the world. Geography and history have always travelled well together in studies of wine, both academic and popular, and more than one-third of this volume is devoted to specific wines and wine regions: there are 31 regional maps. Some of them reveal the topical strains to which wine making is subject. The article called Yugoslavia incorporates a map called 'former Yugoslavia'. The article on Cyprus is as problem-laden as Cyprus itself. Azerbaijan and America have articles too. Apparently vineyards in Azerbaijan account for 7 per cent of cultivated land and grapes for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of agricultural output. There are 12 articles on the former Soviet Republics (as revealing as the excellent articles on Argentina and Chile) and one on 'Soviet sparkling wines', a specific term devised according to European Union law ('See European Union'). Gorbachev, who tried to cut alcohol consumption (there is no article on him or on Yeltsin) does not appear as a liberator in this context. He makes a dramatic entrance, for example, into the article on Bulgaria: 'Gorbachev's arrival as Soviet premier had dire consequences for Bulgarian wine.' Politics - and economics - are less fully handled than most other disciplines in the interdisciplinary mix, although there is an article (all too brief) on taxation and scholarly articles on investment in wine and on auctions. There might well have been an article on Gladstone, who cut taxes on French wines, and when we reach the 20th century there is too little on the retailing and pricing of wines and on the changing roles of stores, chains and supermarkets. There is little, too, about competition from other alcoholic beverages not based on the grape or about soft drinks and mixers. Aperitifs have an entry, but there is no reference to cocktails, and while aquardente and aquardiente are mentioned and there are long articles on armagnac and cognac (the latter making one cross reference to vodka), there is no sign of calvados, whisky, beer or, for that matter, black velvet. A brief article on alcohol makes the point that 'the alcohol content in a perfectly balanced wine should be unfathomable'. The articles on food and wine are sketchy, too, but the place of science both in viticulture and in vinification is handled in expert fashion, and the brief article on traditions ends with the comforting words that 'traditions are likely to have evolved for a reason, often one that is eventually explained by science'. The article on 'training systems' that follows almost immediately is concerned solely with vines, not people. The first two entries in the volume are abboccato and abocado, medium sweet, and we are directed to the article on sweetness. In the absence of an index such direction is all, but no one interested in wine should miss the aroma wheel on pages 58 to 59. Not all writers on wine could be described as medium sweet, but all those whom Jancis Robinson has recruited to make this volume such a good companion, a companion for all times, deserve a collective toast. Unfortunately, it must be taken from outside the volume, where under 'toast' we read only that 'toast given to a barrel when forming it over a heat source, is one of the processes in barrel making that most obviously affect eventual wine flavour'. Roll out the barrel.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] China yesterday stepped up its attack on a move by  the Government to increase its openness, claiming the proposal  violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the unilateral move  involved "major changes to the operation of government  departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to Hong Kong's  smooth transition".    Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang disagreed and said:  "We do not see that there is any contravention of the Joint  Declaration". Mrs Chan on Thursday unveiled a code of practice  detailing what information the public would have access to,  although the code has no legal backing. It is not expected to  be fully implemented until 1996. The proposal, she said was  "simply a further move towards making the whole machinery more  transparent in accordance with the wishes of the community".    A government spokesman said the measures would "contribute  to  a smooth transition by responding effectively to developing  public expectations". He said: "It is premature to make  specific judgments about the effect on the operation of  government. But a central objective will be to improve the  efficiency of the civil service and enhance the accountability  of the Government."    Supporters of the call for a freedom of information act  rejected the measures as inadequate.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said "the so-called  package of measures to further enhance the public's access to  information" involved major changes over how the executive  branch would be operated. Those matters should be discussed by  the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) in accordance with  the 1997 agreement, he said.    "The unilateral move by the British Hong Kong Government  without prior consultation and agreement with China is  unacceptable to the Chinese side," Mr Shen said. The Joint  Declaration says the JLG should discuss matters relating to the  smooth transfer of government in 1997.    A senior mainland official insisted that the proposal would  bring about a "major impact" on the existing internal operation  of the Government. "To say the least, it will adversely affect  the efficiency of the Government," he said.    "At present, the Government can do whatever it wants to  without having to publicise information. Under the proposal, it  will have to prepare a set of information that the public can  have access to.    "We have to take on board the fact that there's only three  years to go (before 1997). It will increase uncertainty if you  bring about a lot of changes to the system." The official said  the move was a government plan to institute changes to the  system of the post-1997 government.    United Democrat Martin Lee Chu-ming said he could not see  any  provision in the Joint Declaration that would not allow Hong  Kong to set up a human rights commission and access to  information rules. Mr Lee said China's reaction reflected a  different interpretation of law. The party yesterday urged  Governor Chris Patten to give the go-ahead for the access to  information law.    Legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai urged China to explain how  the Joint Declaration had been violated. She said Hong Kong had  been promised the principle of "one country, two systems" under  which it should be allowed to introduce policies according to  the society's needs.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, TAKES THIRD PLACE  </P> <P> Consistency kept the Sunny Hills High School boys' basketball team out of the  championship game of the Brea-Olinda Tournament.  </P> <P> Consistency at the right times helped Sunny Hills (9-5) clinch third place with  a 69-60 victory over Brea Saturday.  </P> <P> "At times we look real good and at times we look real bad," Sunny Hills Coach  Steve White said. "We're just not executing very well right now, but we'll be  there once we get our timing down."  </P> <P> This season, Sunny Hills (9-5) has split two games with Brea tournament  finalist Gahr (a 70-67 preseason victory and a 78-53 loss Friday in the Brea  semifinals).  </P> <P> Saturday night, Sunny Hills' height advantage was the difference.  All-tournament selection Terry Mann, Sunny Hills' 6-foot-7 junior forward,  scored a game-high 26 points before fouling out with 5:06 left.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills guard Dominic Carnesi added 11 points and swingman Matt Hopkins,  who had nine points, made nine of 10 free throws down the stretch.  </P> <P> Brea (4-9) was led by guard Matt Savala, who scored 12 points off the bench,  including two three-point baskets. A three-pointer by Savala gave Brea a 51-49  lead at the end of the third quarter before Sunny Hills pulled away.  </P> <P> Drew Hubbard and Doug Yeo each had 10 points for Brea.  </P> <P> In other consolation-round games:  </P> <P> La Habra 68, Whittier Christian 66 -- Guard Ryan Kaneko scored 15 to lead La  Habra to an overtime victory.  </P> <P> Compton 78, Sonora 60 -- Wilson Huang led Sonora with 23 points, but Compton  had four players in double figures.  </P> <P> St. John Bosco 78, El Dorado 68 -- Brett Tomko of El Dorado scored 22 points in  the consolation championship and had 116 in the tournament.

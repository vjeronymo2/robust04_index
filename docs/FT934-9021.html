			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Culture in industry Sir, Professor Leslie Hannah's reference to 'many decades of domination of industry by the public school elite' ('Old boy network. . .', November 10) hardly sounds like an 'anti-industrial culture', while Nigel Rudd's claim that 'there's certainly an anti-industry culture in the British upper classes' appears to be a misunderstanding of those 'many decades', inspired perhaps by easy acceptance of Martin Wiener's thesis about British industrial decline. The 1968 Royal Commission on Public Schools showed that more than 70 per cent of the directors of prominent companies came from the public schools. The social historian, Harold Perkin, notes that by the late 1960s 'the public school men were dominating the commanding heights of all the major professional and managerial hierarchies, and it was no longer true that they neglected business'. Dr Perkin also shows (The Rise of the Professional Class) that while British aristocracy has traditionally been entrepreneurial, the anti-industrialism detected by Wiener is related to penetration of British business by the public service ('wet') ideals inculcated by the public schools in their mainly middle-class intake.

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: FIRST THE GOOD NEWS -- THEN MORE GOOD NEWS  </P> <P> Good news travels last. At least in the newspaper business. Bad news travels  first. Calamities get priority. If you want to be happy, skip Page 1. Go right  to the Food section.  </P> <P> Recently, New York magazine took cognizance of this melancholy trend in daily  journalism and invited readers to send in examples of what they would consider  good news for subscribers.  </P> <P> The samples, as reprinted in Reader's Digest, were interesting:  </P> <P>  -- "Sony Bought by IBM."  </P> <P>  -- "Acid Rain Dissolves Styrofoam."  </P> <P>  -- "Don't bother with the whole form, just fill in your name."  </P> <P>  -- "This program is presented without commercial interruption."  </P> <P> It occurred to me the sports pages are not exempt from the unfortunate trend of  the times and could certainly use its own quota of happier headlines. We offer  herewith a few suggestions:  </P> <P>  -- "Denver Broncos Fail to Make Super Bowl This Year."  </P> <P>  -- "Ivana Trump Gets $500 Million and New Jersey.

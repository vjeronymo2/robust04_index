			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): At last - the bumper book of facts THE ECONOMIST YEAR BOOK 1992 Economist Books Pounds 25, 340 pages ATTENTION all fans of the Economist. At last you can throw away those unruly piles of back issues with a clear conscience, for the first Economist Year Book contains everything the average reader will want to remember about 1991 and more. It should appeal to those who tire of the magazine's flippant content - there is a welcome air of seriousness about the work. The pages are clearly laid out along familiar divisions and the statistical section is as useful as anything on the market. The Year Book should eventually build into a fine reference collection. But readers will need to buy an aspidistra or two to fill up their shelves in the meantime.</p>

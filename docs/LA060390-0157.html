			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULLS TO FACE PISTON MALICE IN THE PALACE;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: CHICAGO MUST PLAY GAME 7 TODAY IN AUBURN HILLS, WHERE IT HAS  GONE 0-5.  </P> <P> The Detroit Pistons head into Game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals  against the Chicago Bulls today at the Palace of Auburn Hills with far more  big-game experience. But the Bulls have Michael Jordan, which can neutralize a  lot of factors.  </P> <P> Besides, as Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said of the Bulls: "They're fairly playoff  hardened. I don't know if we have an advantage on that point."  </P> <P> Chicago has been in similar circumstances two years in a row. Last season, the  Pistons won in six games. This time, the Bulls can finish a comeback from an  0-2 deficit with one more victory.  </P> <P> "All we can do is lay our guts on the floor and see what happens," Jordan said.  </P> <P> Beating the Pistons in Chicago Friday proved the Bulls' fortitude, but Chicago  hasn't won here all season -- a stretch of five games, three in the playoffs.  Today, they may be without starting guard John Paxson, who took treatment but  did not practice Saturday after re-injuring his right ankle in Game 5.  </P> <P> The return of Craig Hodges should be of some comfort to the Bulls. Hodges' 19  points helped the Bull reserves outscore their Detroit counterparts for the  first time.  </P> <P> Only once in their 24-year history have the Bulls been this close to the title  round. In 1975, they held a 3-2 advantage over the Golden State Warriors, only  to lose it.  </P> <P> But Friday night, more than one Bull was heard to say today will be for a  franchise and a city, not just a team.  </P> <P> "I think there's going to be a lot of speeches made," Jordan said. "Certainly,  as a leader I'll have to throw my two cents in to let them know that (in) the  years I've been in Chicago, we've progressed each and every year. We've taken  it a step further, and this is an opportunity to take it another step further.  We may never get this opportunity again."  </P> <P> And the Pistons will have history to contend with, too. Trying to join  Minneapolis/Los Angeles and Boston as the only franchises to win back-to-back  titles, Detroit is 0-3 in previous seventh games. The most recent attempt came  against the Lakers for the 1988 championship.  </P> <P> Plus, only four teams have come back from 2-0 down to win a seven-game series:  Boston against the Lakers in 1969, the Lakers against San Francisco in 1969,  Baltimore against New York in 1971 and Portland against Philadelphia in 1977.  </P> <P> Eastern Conference Notes  </P> <P> The championship round will open Tuesday night. If Detroit wins today, the  Pistons will have home-court advantage. If the Bulls win, the series will begin  at Portland and go to Chicago for Games 3, 4 and 5 in the 2-3-2 scheduling  format. . . . After losing Friday night, the Pistons arrived at Midway Airport  and were told that the nose of their private jet had been cracked when a fuel  truck backed into it. . . . Michael Jordan has shot 48.7% and averaged 35  points in the three games at Chicago Stadium while shooting 39.2% and averaging  22.8 points at Auburn Hills. . . . The Bulls are shooting only 41.5%.  </P></p>

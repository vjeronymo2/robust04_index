			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Carlos Menem gave his firm backing to  businessmen Francisco Macri yesterday [10 March], saying he had  complete faith in his honesty and work ethic. The remarks came  moments before it transpired that Macri would be summoned to  court on charges of tax evasion while importing cars to the  country.    "Nobody can doubt that Francisco Macri is one of the people  to have brought the highest amount of investment into the  country and that he has breathed new life into the car  industry," Menem told reporters in Government House before  leaving for Chile yesterday to witness today's inauguration of  new Chilean President Eduardo Frei.    However he added that his personal view should in no way  influence the decision of the national courts and in particular  that of Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, who has been  investigating the claims of tax evasion.    In reference to other news Menem touched upon the  controversy  surrounding alleged bribes demanded by the PAMI [Comprehensive  Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners medical plan, saying that  the accusations against the organization's head, Matilde  Menendez, were part of a "scaremongering" campaign.    He also hinted that Menendez, who will be standing for  election to the Constituent Assembly on April 10 on behalf of  the Justicialist Party in the Federal Capital, was being  targeted as part of a political witch-hunt.    "These (accusations) will continue to be bandied about by  real mafiosos who are part of the political set-up and are  intent upon damaging her candidacy," Menem told reporters.

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: BP America to axe 600 jobs BP of America, citing the impact of recession, last night said it planned to cut its US operating costs by Dollars 125m by eliminating 600 to 700 jobs in its corporate headquarters staff and refining and marketing divisions. The job cuts, to be felt largely in the Cleveland, Ohio, region, where BP of America is based, were presented as part of the British energy group's programme of seeking Dollars 750m of cost reductions. The new US cuts, which include the near halving of BP of America's Cleveland-based corporate headquarters staff of 610 people, mirror the UK head office job reductions announced in April. At that time, BP said it was eliminating 700 of the 1,450 jobs from its head office at Britannic House in London. Beyond the 250 to 300 job cuts at it Cleveland headquarters, BP of America also plans to eliminate between 375 and 500 refining and marketing jobs from its BP Oil and BP Chemicals divisions in the US. The US job cuts come less than three weeks after BP of America said it was planning to dispose of assets in Florida and California, including more than 300 petrol stations and two distribution terminals. That decision marked a turnround in BP's US strategy of building up its west coast network of filling stations. Last month, in another part of the group's worldwide cost reduction and asset disposal programme, BP raised Dollars 314m by selling off its 56.94 per cent shareholding in BP Canada. Mr Rodney Chase, the recently-named chairman and chief executive of BP of America, last night said he regretted the new US job cuts, but added: 'We must reduce our costs to stay competitive and meet the challenges of the industry.' Mr Chase called competition 'fierce' and said the recession had reduced demand for BP products. He added that prices were down, both at the wellhead and at the petrol pump. After the new job cuts BP of America will still have nearly 35,000 employees. Its 1991 turnover was Pounds 9.3bn (Dollars 17.2bn).</p>

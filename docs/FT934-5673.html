			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Docklands Sinfonietta Two nights after the BBC Symphony played Szymanowski and Lutoslawski superbly at Maida Vale, both composers reappeared in the Docklands Sinfonietta's programme in the Queen Elizabeth Hall (also live on Radio 3). Szymanowski's Songs of a Fairytale Princess came from the same rapturous-exotic period as his First Violin Concerto, and they, too, keep their soloist up in the stratosphere; he wrote them for his sister, who must have been a remarkably assured high soprano. So, fortunately, is Eileen Hulse, who warbled and floated through them on Friday to enchanting effect. They will never be in the repertoire of many sopranos, for it is a rare voice that is both at home on those heights and has enough succulent tone to fill out the luscious swoops of the music. It is a little unfair to hear them so soon after the glorious Concerto, for they share its heady atmosphere - not quite so rich, for here the orchestral part is transcribed from the piano original - without the memorable tunes. Still, hearing them at all is an unusual pleasure; Miss Hulse made it so, and Sian Edwards conducted with delicacy and insight. I was less sure about Lutoslawski's recent, delightful song-cycle Chantefleurs et Chantefables, on children's poems by Robert Desnos. Miss Hulse, who was replacing an indisposed singer at short notice, sounded well in command of the subtle, funny verses, and the conductor captured the gaits of Desnos's fauna (grasshopper, tortoise, alligator) wittily - yet the set sounded 'careful', without the crisp bite that all Lutoslawski music should have. One more rehearsal might have got it. Two more were needed for Roussel's rackety Petite Suite: there were trumpet problems, and a dearth of irony and elegance. By the end of the concert, however, the Sinfonietta had found its proper form, and delivered Haydn's Symphony no. 60, 'Il Distratto', with all due alertness and verve. Haydn's score stemmed from some theatre-music; Edwards and her players warmed to that, and it all gleamed with character. Sponsors: Morgan Stanley, BSIS</p>

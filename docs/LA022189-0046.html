			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, which was directed by President  Bush to reform and revitalize federal ethical standards, is framing  recommendations that would sharply reduce requirements for financial disclosure  by government employees, the Washington Post reported. Among the proposals  being considered are ones to eliminate requirements to report estimated income  from stocks, partnerships and rental properties; gains or losses from sales of  such assets, and the size of personal debts over $1,000, sources said. At a  meeting Feb. 14, the panel took a preliminary vote to eliminate the need to  assign estimated values to a person's financial holdings. One source said that  "the public doesn't need to know" details of a person's financial situation,  other than the names of holdings worth more than $1,000.  </P></p>

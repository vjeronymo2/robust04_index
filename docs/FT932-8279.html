			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch mount assault on manure mountain THE DUTCH government has reached agreement with the country's highly productive livestock farmers on reducing pollution-causing manure surpluses by the year 2000, averting the threat of forced cuts in the size of the Dutch pig, cattle and poultry herds. Under an accord reached last week after long and difficult negotiations, pig and poultry producers will be required by 1995 to cut the amount of harmful phosphorous in manure produced on their farms by 30 per cent compared with with the level in 1986. The government and farmers' organisations are confident that the phosphorus reductions can be achieved entirely by changes in the diets of their pigs and poultry, meaning that the actual number of animals does not need to be reduced. The Netherlands has 115m head of livestock, compared with human population of 15m. Modern animal husbandry techniques have left the country with more manure than can be safely absorbed by farmland, causing stubborn problems such as air and water pollution. A central element in the new system for controlling manure surpluses will be a 'mineral ledger' to be kept by livestock farmers starting in 1995. The ledgers will keep track of the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen arriving at farms in the form of animal feed and artificial fertiliser, the amount effectively absorbed by the animals and the amount left as residue in manure. From 1996, livestock farmers who exceed the mineral quotas will be subject to a 'super levy' designed to discourage surplus manure production. Pollution caused by excessive manure production will also be curbed by stricter controls on the amount of manure that farmers can spread on their land. From 1995, farmers will be allowed only 150 kg of phosphorus a year to each hectare of grassland, down from 175 kg at present. By the year 2000 the phosphorus limit will gradually be cut to 65 kg a ha. This is meant to encourage livestock farmers to deliver surplus manure to processing plants for conversion into manure pellets destined for export markets. Other options open to farmers are large-scale conversions of existing barns and sheds to prevent the seepage of manure into the air and waterways.</p>

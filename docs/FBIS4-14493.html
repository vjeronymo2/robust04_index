			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- A session of the  Republic of Crimea's Central Electoral Commission took place on  31 March. Issues of confirming the results of elections in  multiseat districts were examined at the sitting. The  commission's chairman Viktor Alsufyev read out a statement by  the political council of the "Union in Support of the Republic  of Crimea" [Soyuz v podderzhku Respubliki Krym] party, in which  are given -- in the opinion of the statement's authors -- facts  of violations in the course of the election campaign and the  elections, in particular the call by Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov on the eve of the elections to vote for the "Russia"  bloc, and also the holding of a poll of Crimean citizens at the  same time as the elections.    In connection with the numerous violations, the political  council of the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea is  demanding that the elections be recognized as invalid and that a  new time-scale for holding elections be set. It has become  known that practically all of the autonomy's parties of a  centrist tendency supported the statement.    Having examined the statement, the Central Electoral  Commission decided to hand over the materials to the judicial  bodies for examination because, as the resolution notes, "only  the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court can recognize the  elections as invalid."    The results of the elections in the multiseat district for  political parties were examined. According to the election  results, the Communist Party of Crimea got two seats out of the  14, the "Russia" bloc 11 seats, and the Party of Economic  Revival of Crimea one seat.    In the opinion of observers, supporters of Crimea's  President  Meshkov can reckon on 60 of the 98 seats in the Crimean  Parliament.    Results of the elections in the Crimean Tatar multiseat  national district were also examined. In all, 76.18 percent or  102,379 electors of Crimean Tatar nationality took part in the  voting. Some 90,959 votes were cast for the kurultay of the  Crimean Tatar people. Thus, the kurultay got all 14 seats.  Commenting on the results of the voting to a UNIAN  correspondent, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the majlis of  the Crimean Tatar people, who is first on the list from the  kurultay, said: "This is even more than we expected, and I am  pleased that our people showed wisdom in voting for candidates  from the kurultay."    In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on the election  results in the multiseat district for political parties,  Volodymyr Shevyev, cochairman of the Party of Economic Revival  of Crimea, who was confirmed as a deputy from the Party of  Economic Revival of Crimea by the Central Electoral Commission  on 31 March, noted: "The people supported the president in the  elections. I think great prospects are ahead for Crimea if  there is unity of judicial, legislative, and executive power."    The results of the election in single-seat national  districts  were also examined at the sitting of the Central Electoral  Commission.</p>

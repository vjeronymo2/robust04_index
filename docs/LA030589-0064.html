			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO POLICY IN A SPIN  </P> <P> The positive tone of the Feb. 12 story, "The New International Auto," belies a  more disturbing side of the trend toward globalization in automobile  manufacturing.  </P> <P> The story said "a dizzying array of joint ventures . . . is rapidly blurring  the distinction between the major Asian, European and American auto makers."  Auto markets, however, aren't working the same way. While the wheels of  commerce spin most markets into a "dizzy" mix, the borders of South Korea and  Japan enclose an unnatural calm.  </P> <P> Globalization of production fosters innovation and quality, diminishes  insularity and encourages peace -- but only if it occurs across the board.  Currently, Asian auto makers build plants in the United States and elsewhere,  and sell cars in cooperation with American manufacturers, while Asian  governments deftly prevent our Big Three from doing the same on their soil.  </P> <P> The Times story concluded that "in more and more cases, there aren't any  differences between American and foreign cars." The flavor is much less  "global" on the streets of Seoul.  </P> <P> Why do we have so little will to get as good as we give? What we truly need are  Asian trade and business ownership policies that match our own.  </P> <P> JIM REILLY  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM cuts zinc output at Queensland mine MIM Holdings, the Australian miner, has responded to sick world metals markets with cuts to zinc and lead production at its Mount Isa-Hilton complex in Queensland. The managing director of MIM, Mr Norman Fussell, said the company would reduce output of zinc-lead ore by 15 per cent and the concentrator at the Hilton mine would switch to processing stockpiled copper converter slag. 'The decision to curtail zinc-lead mining acknowledges the developing weakness in world markets for those metals, aggravated by exports from former Soviet bloc countries,' Mr Fussell said. MIM is the second big Australian mining company to announce production cuts this month. Earlier, Western Mining Corporation said it planned changes at both its Kambalda and Leinster nickel operations, but did not spell out the exact effect on output. Mr Fussell said despite the cuts, zinc and lead would remain core businesses for MIM. 'Market studies indicate that the long-term trend of growing demand for zinc and lead will resume after the recession and a window of opportunity in the market will arise about 1995-96,' he said. 'Hence, the decision of MIM and its joint venturers to develop the McArthur River mine. We are confident that the use of zinc will increase as an effective and economical anti-corrosion protector of steel and in other applications, while the future of lead will be linked to batteries, including the development of electric vehicles.' Hamersley Iron, the Australian iron ore miner, will reduce its workforce by 400 at its Pilbara operations in Western Australia because sales have been lower than expected since June.</p>

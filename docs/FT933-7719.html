			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Barclays appoints banking outsider as chief executive: Shareholders welcome choice of Courtaulds Textiles head BARCLAYS, the largest UK bank, yesterday ended a year of controversy over its senior management by appointing Mr Martin Taylor, the 41-year-old chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, as its chief executive. In one of the most radical corporate appointments in recent years, Barclays hired Mr Taylor, a former Financial Times journalist, to split the running of the bank with Mr Andrew Buxton, its executive chairman. The news was welcomed by shareholders who have criticised Barclays since it was disclosed in April 1992 that Mr Buxton would combine the roles of chairman and chief executive. The decision to split the roles was announced last January. Criticism of Barclays' management increased earlier this year when the bank disclosed that it made a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss last year, and cut its final dividend. It announced first half profits of Pounds 335m this month as bad debt provisions fell. One investor described the hiring of Mr Taylor, who has been widely praised for his restructuring of Courtaulds Textiles, as 'almost too good to be true'. Barclays shares rose 4 per cent, while those of Courtaulds Textiles fell 2.6 per cent Mr Buxton said Mr Taylor would have responsibility for running the bank's three operating divisions, including its UK branch bank and BZW investment bank, while he would retain primary responsibility for strategy and external relations. However, Mr Buxton emphasised that Mr Taylor would also have a large role in forming strategy. 'There are bound to be some important strategic decisions over the next few years, and we will make them together,' he said. Mr Taylor was appointed chairman of Courtaulds Textiles in March, but was approached by Barclays' headhunting company in June. He said he had already intended to become non-executive chairman and seek a job elsewhere within a year. Courtaulds Textiles appointed Mr Noel Jervis, the director responsible for fabrics, as managing director. It said Sir Christopher Hogg, Mr Taylor's predecessor and currently a non-executive director, would resume the chair in January. Mr Taylor, who studied Mandarin at Oxford, is regarded as one of the most intellectually gifted corporate executives of his generation. Barclays did not disclose how much it would pay him, although he said it constituted a 'small rise' on the Pounds 206,000 he earned last year. He will be employed for two years and then on a rolling one-year contract. Mr Taylor said he intended to stay at Barclays for 10 years. He will join the board on November 1 and become chief executive on January 1. The largest immediate challenge would be to improve customer service, he said. He becomes the youngest chief executive of a British clearing bank, although Mr Derek Wanless, who was appointed National Westminster Bank's chief executive last year, is only four years older. Banks have appointed more executives from other industries in recent years, but Mr Taylor is the first chief executive of a clearing bank with no banking experience.

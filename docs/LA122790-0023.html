			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AID TO THE SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> President Bush's support of the $1-billion credits to aid the Soviet Union is  nothing less than support for a Communist dictatorship and the Soviet empire  created by aggression and maintained by a brutal force. It is clear who will  benefit, especially when it was announced in advance that the KGB, whose hands  are still red from the Georgian massacre, will be put in charge to administer  such aid.  </P> <P> What is the difference between Saddam Hussein who occupied Kuwait and Gorbachev  who insists on continuing the occupation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia? Both  of them claim that these small countries are part of their empires. Both of  them have their tanks and their armies in the occupied areas, yet we are  willing to spill our blood to depose one and our tax dollars to save the other,  all in the name of international law and American interest.  </P> <P> Since it is customary to acknowledge people for accomplishments at the end of  the year, I would like to nominate President Bush for two awards. First, for  the Hero of Soviet Union, which he is trying to save at any cost. The second, a  membership in the Pallbearers of Lithuania's Independence.  </P> <P> KEST MIKENAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Farmers say proposals could be boost for horticulture Horticulture could receive a big boost from the change in eating patterns encouraged by the Coma report if they are adopted widely by the public, the National Farmers' Union said yesterday. Fruit and vegetables account for annual sales of roughly Pounds 6bn with 82 per cent of vegetables and 15 per cent of fruit provided by home growers. Large growers are already expanding to cope with increased demand and are moving into further processing of fruit and vegetables to meet the needs of supermarkets. For example, lettuce growers often package their own salads by washing them and presenting leaves in a plastic bag as a way of meeting consumer demands for convenience foods. One NFU official said: 'If people do respond to this report, there is clearly a big opportunity for certain sectors of agriculture and for others more of a challenge.' Demand for leaner meat is likely to prove more difficult for farmers. The livestock industry has reduced the fat content of most meat considerably over the past 20 years in response to the demands of healthier eating. The pig and poultry sectors have had most success at reducing fat levels in meat with the fat content in pork falling 35 per cent since 1975 to 3.5 per cent. Farmers have reduced the fat content in beef by 15 per cent and lamb by 11 per cent to an average of 5.5 per cent. Some cuts of meat such as pork leg now contain as little as 1.7 per cent fat. The reduction in fat has been achieved by using low fat feeding programmes and continental breeds of cattle rather than the indigenous Herefords and Anguses, which are more fatty. However Mr Martin Burtt, a livestock farmer from Yorkshire, said: 'You cannot breed out fat entirely, meat has to have fat to give it flavour and hold it together. We're close to optimum levels of fat now.' Sir David Naish, NFU president, said: 'We have been encouraging farmers to respond to signals from the marketplace and I believe this report, which offers sensible guidelines on healthy eating, will help us to do that.'</p>

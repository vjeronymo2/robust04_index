			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN HITS ROAD AND ROAD HITS BACK  </P> <P> Maybe they should have taken the hint. Travel was just not in the master plan  for the Cal Lutheran baseball team last Saturday.  </P> <P> First, the team was informed that school vans would not be available for a trip  to Westmont College near Santa Barbara because they already had been reserved  by other teams.  </P> <P> Undaunted, Coach Rich Hill arranged for the squad to travel by a makeshift  caravan consisting of a "1970-something" Ford station wagon, an early model  Oldsmobile and Hill's own Honda Accord.  </P> <P> Strike two. The Oldsmobile didn't make it out of the school parking lot without  needing a jump start.  </P> <P> Once the team hit the road its problems continued to mount. Hill's Honda, which  was carrying the coaching staff, blew its water pump just west of Ventura.  </P> <P> After borrowing a wrench from a Caltrans worker, Kingsmen pitcher Jay Anderson  got the car started again.  </P> <P> But the quick fix was only temporary. A few more miles down the road the car  began to overheat and Hill once again was forced to pull over.  </P> <P> With game time quickly approaching, the coaches hitched a ride -- "with some  guy driving a Ford Bronco," Hill said -- and made it to the game.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran's misfortune had not ended yet, however. Westmont swept the  doubleheader, 3-0 and 6-3. Anderson, with a save as a mechanic to his credit,  was unable to come through as a pitcher. He started the second game, allowed  five runs in 4 1/3 innings and took the loss.  </P> <P> "It was an eventful day," Hill said. "We had the car problems, then we got  swept, then there was a food fight at the cafeteria where we were eating  dinner."  </P> <P> Hill said that Westmont students were the only ones hurling hash, which is a  good thing. "I wouldn't have been too happy if we'd have started throwing peas  and macaroni," Hill said.  </P> <P> To his credit, Hill did not let one bad day ruin his entire weekend. On Sunday,  Hill and his wife Lori went back to Santa Barbara to pick up his car.  </P> <P> "We had a nice time," Hill said. "We went to the (Santa Barbara) Mission, had a  great day and made the best of a bad situation. Everything turned out all right  except in the won-loss column."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran has lost three in a row after dropping a 6-3 decision to Southern  California College on Tuesday. The Kingsmen (23-14 overall) are in third place  in the Golden State Athletic Conference with an 11-6 record.  </P></p>

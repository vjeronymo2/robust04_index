			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER QUIZ IS TEST OF NERVES  </P> <P> The Super Quiz, the last contest of the ninth Los Angeles County Academic  Decathlon, attracted the most attention because it was the only part of the  event open to the public.  </P> <P> Saturday's contest at the Gahr High School gymnasium in Cerritos attracted  crowds of screaming parents and well-wishers. The winning Super Quiz team gets  a trophy and bragging rights regardless of how well it scores in the overall  competition.  </P> <P> The Super Quiz works this way: One student from each team goes to the gym  floor. Each contestant is handed five questions, with multiple-choice answers  to choose from. Announcers read the questions aloud for the audience. Students  write their answers and the results are recorded.  </P> <P> Each team member gets a turn in the spotlight. Results are posted, question by  question, to the cheers of the spectators.  </P> <P> This year's Super Quiz topic was astronauts and space travel. One question, for  example, asked students to identify the propulsion system for the Apollo space  program. (Answer: Saturn V rocket.)  </P> <P> The contest among the 73 competing teams came down to the last round, with West  High School of Torrance and Wilson High School of Hacienda Heights in a virtual  tie. Finally, it was down to the last two students. The West student scored a  tough-to-beat four correct of the five questions.  </P> <P> Wilson's Michelle Ivey tallied a perfect five.  </P> <P> Her teammates crowded around her as she collapsed with exhaustion at the foot  of the bleachers. "I can't breathe," she mouthed silently, unable to speak. But  her face was beaming.  </P> <P> Wilson Coach Jim Kelly hugged his students as they hugged each other. Kelly  looked more relieved than elated. He was ready for the pizza party that had  been scheduled -- win or lose -- at Ivey's house.  </P> <P> "It's not how rich or smart you are," he said of the results. "It's how hard  you work."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUPER QUIZ RESULTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County schools: 1st, Wilson High School, Hacienda Heights; 2nd,  West High School, Torrance; 3rd, Mira Costa High School, Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city schools: 1st, University High School; 2nd, (four-way tie)  Garfield, Taft, El Camino and Palisades high schools.  </P> <P> Southern California private schools (private and parochial schools in Los  Angeles and Orange counties): 1st, (tie) Loyola High School, Los Angeles, and  Servite High School, Anaheim; 2nd, Brethren Christian High School, Cypress.  </P> <P> Complete academic decathlon results will be announced at banquets next week.  Overall winners will compete in the state championship.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following submittal of the additional information required by the 1990 Amendments, the SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine its completeness, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The final submittal was received on March 5, 1992, and a letter dated April 14, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. As noted in this action, EPA proposes to approve the Wyoming PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP submittal for Sheridan, and invites public comment on the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Accurate Emissions Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. See, for example, section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the attainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wyoming submitted an emissions inventory in 1989 for base year 1986. This base year emissions inventory was subsequently revised and resubmitted in March 1992. The base year inventory (both versions) identified fugitive road dust as the primary cause of nonattainment contributing over 74.35 percent of the total emissions during the time that the violations were recorded. Additional contributing sources included natural gas, 0.01 percent; coal burning, 1.61 percent; wood burning, 14.80 percent; automobile emissions, 0.51 percent; Veterans Medical Center, 1.12 percent; Sheridan Forest Products, 0.75 percent; Wyoming Sawmill, 2.38 percent; and Burlington Northern, 4.38 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  For further details see the Technical Support Document (TSD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA issued guidance on PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP Development Guideline.

RACM (Including RACT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, the initial moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). The EPA's interpretation of this requirement is set out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> here only in broad terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State should first identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State may reject an available control measure if the measure is technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three source categories were identified as contributing to the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment problem in Sheridan. However, the SIP only relies on one control strategy to demonstrate attainment, the Sanding Winter Maintenance Program (SWMP), which was adopted on July 17, 1989. This plan, developed by the Sheridan Air Quality Committee, designates streets to be sanded during the winter season. Included are major streets, hills, school zones, and dangerous intersections. The plan specifies a material application rate which has been determined to provide adequate traction, and sanding material specifications which insures use of a clean and durable media. A comprehensive street sweeping and flushing program will remove material before dust problems occur. The reduction in PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from fugitive road dust, between the base year inventory (911.84 tpy), and the attainment inventory (738.11 tpy) was calculated at 19% or 173.73 tpy. Credit for this reduction is given to the SWMP only. No credit was taken for two other control strategies outlined in the SIP, a voluntary woodburning curtailment program and dust control plans for three industrial sources. The reduction in ``total'' PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions between the base year inventory (1238.98 tpy) and attainment inventory (1137.39 tpy) is 8% or 101.19 tpy. (The reason for the reduction in fugitive road dust emissions being greater than the reduction for total emissions between the base and attainment years, is that there was an increase in fugitive dust emissions over the same period of 87.35 tpy from two industrial sites. The overall result, however, is a net decrease in emissions). The voluntary woodburning curtailment plan and the industrial dust control plan were submitted with the SIP; EPA is taking no action on these two programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. RACM does not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and the implementation of additional available control measures would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13543. The implementation of Wyoming's PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment plan control strategy will result in the attainment of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by December 31, 1994. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  By this document, EPA is proposing to approve the Sheridan SIP, which includes the proposal to approve RACM (including RACT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires demonstration of attainment by December 31, 1994. However, when this SIP was submitted, the Group I requirements called for attainment demonstration in 1989, with maintenance through 1994. Although the State did submit additional information in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments, the demonstration of attainment did not change. EPA believes, however, that since the Wyoming DEQ has shown maintenance of the NAAQS through 1994, the State has met the requirements to show attainment by December 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

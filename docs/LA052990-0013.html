			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SURPRISE SOAKING FROM STORM TURNS THE HOLIDAY INTO AN INDOOR EVENT  </P> <P> A late spring storm brought cooler temperatures and rain to San Diego County  Monday, dampening Memorial Day barbecues, wreaking havoc on area freeways and  driving traditional holiday crowds away from the beaches.  </P> <P> The surprisingly strong rainstorm was part of a cold front that moved through  most of California over the weekend. The U.S. Weather Service reported gusty  winds of up to 35 m.p.h., accompanied by thunderstorms, over the mountains and  deserts.  </P> <P> Travelers' warnings were posted in the afternoon for vans and motor homes in  the mountains and deserts east of San Diego, as the cold front made its way  toward the Plains states. Winds of 30 m.p.h. were recorded in the desert town  of Ocotillo Wells in Imperial County.  </P> <P> As of 4 p.m. Monday, rainfall measured .40 of an inch at Lindbergh Field in  downtown San Diego, with the temperature reaching no higher than 66 degrees,  said Weather Service meteorologist Dan Atkin and 0.58 of an inch was recorded  across town at Montgomery Field.  </P> <P> In other parts of the county, 1.80 inches of rain fell at Mt. Laguna in East  County, while 1.72 inches was recorded at Palomar Mountain. Cuyamaca Rancho  State Park in the Laguna Mountains reported 1.16 inches of rain. San Diego  County's coldest spot over the weekend was Palomar Mountain, where a  temperature of 40 degrees was recorded Sunday.  </P> <P> Most of the heavy rain fell in North County, where 0.93 of an inch was recorded  in Fallbrook, 0.86 of an inch at Oceanside Harbor and 0.80 of an inch in  Escondido. In contrast, Campo, near the Mexican border, reported 0.21 of an  inch and Chula Vista in the South Bay reported only 0.18 of an inch.  </P> <P> The sun broke through the clouds for a brief period in San Diego about 4:30  p.m, but a sudden shower darkened the sky and soaked the downtown areas an hour  later.  </P> <P> "We weren't expecting this much rain," Atkin said. "The storm was a bit  stronger than we expected."  </P> <P> The surprisingly high amount of rain is not expected to have any measurable  effect on the drought that has plagued San Diego County and the state for four  years.  </P> <P> "Of course, any rain will help. But this will certainly not end the drought of  above normal yearly rainfall," Atkin added.  </P> <P> He predicted warmer temperatures and sunny skies for today.  </P> <P> Monday's showers did not cancel Memorial Day services at Fort Rosecrans  National Cemetery, where tribute was paid to fallen veterans. The graves were  decorated with the traditional miniature U.S. flags.  </P> <P> Several rain-related accidents were reported by the California Highway Patrol  and local law enforcement agencies, causing numerous injuries.  </P> <P> Eight people were injured in a six-car pileup on northbound Interstate 5 at  Poinsettia Lane at 5 a.m. CHP officials said the accidents occurred during a  downpour. About four hours later, CHP officials called about six tow trucks to  Interstate 805 where it connects with Interstate 8 in Mission Valley to  untangle several vehicles involved in another rain-related freeway accident.  </P> <P> Harried CHP dispatchers said they were too busy keeping up with calls of other  fender benders on the freeways to release any details of the latter accident.  </P> <P> San Diego police reported one traffic fatality late Sunday night. A police  spokesman said that Robbie Lee Reney, 22, died at 11:19 p.m. when the compact  car he was driving went out of control on Torrey Pines Road and hit a tree.  Five passengers in the car were ejected, and three suffered serious injuries.  </P> <P> According to a police report of the accident, Reney was driving 60 to 70 m.p.h.  when he lost control of the car and hit a tree. Police reported finding several  liquor bottles and "a strong odor of alcohol" in the car.  </P> <P> The rain also drove away the annual Memorial Day crowds that flock to local  beaches and forced the cancellation of other beach activities. The only  beach-goers seen Monday were an occasional person, bundled up, walking at the  edge of the surf.  </P> <P> Parishioners at St. Catherine Laboure Catholic Church in Clairemont were forced  to cancel their annual Memorial Day picnic at Crown Point.  </P> <P> "It was our first cancellation in 19 years. But about 100 parishioners brought  food and goodies to the parish hall, where we ended up having the picnic," said  Monsignor Bill Cuddihy.  </P> <P> Many people who planned on going to the beach ended up at movie theaters and  shopping malls instead.  </P> <P> "The rain didn't keep them away. That's for sure," said Karen Hurst,a customer  service representative at University Towne Centre. "I expect it to get more  crowded when the rain stops. The theaters have long, winding lines of people  waiting to get in."  </P> <P> "There's tons and tons of people inside and outside the theaters waiting to see  a movie," said Donna Washington, an employee of the Sports Arena Six theatres.  </P> <P> "I guess you can blame the rain for this."  </P></p>

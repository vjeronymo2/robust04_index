			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Revised views on rates THE DOLLAR lost two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday amid continuing signs that the Russian crisis was calming down and that there would be little immediate narrowing in the interest rate differential between Germany and the US, writes James Blitz. President Boris Yeltsin's continuing grip on the political situation in Moscow was bound to lead to a decline in the dollar's safe haven status. But yesterday's fall, which took the dollar from a morning peak in Europe of DM1.6320 to an evening low of DM1.6130, reflected factors that may have been more substantial than a simple shift in short term funds. It closed in New York at DM1.6123. Instead, the dollar's fall was rooted in a growing reassessment of the outlook for US and German interest rates. The story of the last 18 months in currency markets has been one of continuing disappointment for those who expect US rates to go up and German ones to come down. It was the same story yesterday. Speculation that US rates may descend one more time has mainly been triggered by publication of minutes of the recent meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which saw a move from a tightening stance to one of 'neutral'. The US economy's sluggishness is clearly making American policymakers less concerned about inflation. It may be, too, that the recent cut in the Japanese official discount rate to 1.75 per cent has had some effect. Dealers are beginning to see just how cheap money can be when the central bank in an industrialised country wants to stimulate the economy. In Germany, the outlook for lower rates is by no means certain. There will probably be no easing in official rates for three weeks. Mr Hans Tietmeyer's first council meeting as Bundesbank president in 10 days' time is unlikely to coincide with an easing of policy. The outlook for German consumer price inflation is good, for sure. The cost-of-living data in the state of Hesse, for example, showed an increase of 0.2 per cent in September, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.2 per cent, the same as it was in the year to August. But dollar investors took fright yesterday when Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank council member, said he saw little chance of the inflation rate falling below 4 per cent in the near future. That caution led to D-Mark strength against most European currencies. Sterling finished at DM2.4525 from a previous DM2.4650. It also helped to trigger a fall in the dollar/yen rate. The yen's rise may have been due to short term investment flows, with Japanese banks repatriating dollars before the month's end. But another factor may have been surprise at how little came out of the meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa at their Monday summit. The dollar closed at Y105.25, down from Y105.85. In New York it ended at Y105.00.</p>

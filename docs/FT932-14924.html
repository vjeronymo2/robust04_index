			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Steel users warn over price increases STEEL USERS yesterday warned that they would be forced to pass on to their customers the second round of price rises to be announced this year by British Steel. The company this week notified customers of further price increases of up to 9 per cent which will be imposed during the next three months on a range of products. Increases of between 4 per cent and 13 per cent announced in January have been fully implemented in recent weeks. British Steel, which recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m in the six months to last October, said the planned rises would only partly reverse the severe reductions in steel prices experienced over the past two years. Some prices had dropped by up to 35 per cent since 1990. British Steel said continuing inadequate levels of return meant further price rises appeared likely over the next six months. The British Constructional Steelwork Association, whose members supply fabricated steelwork to the construction sector, said that it acknowledged the need for British Steel to raise prices, given increases in the company's own costs. But it said its members could not absorb higher prices. The association said: 'We have cut down to the bone and beyond in terms of prices. The last British Steel price rises were all passed on and we will have to do the same again.' British Steel said that it would reduce rebates available on the majority of its structural section products from May 1, representing increases of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent. A cut in rebates for steel plate, representing rises of 6 per cent, will take effect on June 1. Strip products will rise in price from July 1 by up to 9 per cent. British Steel said that the past six weeks had provided evidence of a marked improvement in sales, largely because customers appeared to be rebuilding stocks.</p>

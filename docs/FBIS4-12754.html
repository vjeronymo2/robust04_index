			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the PFLP-GC on its 29th anniversary -- date </F> not given]    [Excerpts] Masses of our militant Palestinian people,  today, we celebrate the 29th anniversary of the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command's [PFLP-GC]. As  this takes place, our Palestinian people continue to record,  with Palestinian blood, their historical struggle against the  unjust Zionist enemy. Meanwhile, most parties conspire with the  Zionist enemy against them and sit at the same table with the  enemy.    'Arafat's distant command over past years has been hostile  to  the national movement. 'Arafat had even chosen to stand in the  trench of our people's enemies and to conspire against them.  [passage omitted]    Our militant masses, we in the PFLP-GC, from a position of  responsibility, call on all the sectors of our people who are  concerned over their homeland to carry out the following duties:    1. Reject all the defeatist plans submitted by Yasir  'Arafat;    2. Ignore differences that could hamper our militant march;    3. Escalate the Palestinian intifadah with the intensity  that we saw during the militant days following the Hebron  massacre;    4. Escalate the national armed struggle as it is the road  to liberate Palestine from the river to the ocean;    5. Be wary of yellow journalism that squirts out venom  against Palestinians who oppose the defeatist agreements;    6. Reject the autonomy conspiracy embodied in the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, and confront it;    7. Enhance the sense of national belonging within  Palestinian frameworks.    Let the 29th anniversary of the PFLP-GC's establishment on  11  April be a day when we renew the pledge to our martyrs, wounded,  and detained, and a day of confrontation against the Zionist  occupation forces. Let us make of this day a day of sweeping  wrath against the traitor defeatists in the Palestinian arena.    We promise our people and our martyrs that we will continue  to fight the Zionists and to avenge their pure blood that has  saturated the soil of Palestine. It is a promise we make to  Hebron and Gaza to avenge our martyrs who fell while defending  the soil of Palestine. We promise our front to remain loyal  soldiers until the land of Palestine is cleansed of occupation  and the Palestinian state is established on all Palestinian  national soil, with Arab Jerusalem, the Jerusalem of Muslims and  Arabs, as its capital.    It is revolution until the liberation of land and man.    [Signed] The PFLP-GC</p>

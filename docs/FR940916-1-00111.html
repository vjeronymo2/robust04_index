			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA would offer additional incentive by proposing to allow freight trains to travel up to 2,500 miles between brake system tests if all the conditions for travelling 1,500 miles between tests are met and the configuration of the train remains unchanged except for setting out defective cars or changing motive power. As an incentive to encourage the continued development of improved train brake system technology, FRA proposes to permit trains to travel up to 3,500 miles between train brake system tests if those trains meet all the conditions required of 2,500-mile trains and they are equipped with the type of new technology or its equivalent described in paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA believes these new and inevitably controversial proposals offer a significant opportunity for railroads and railroad labor organizations to cooperate to improve both the competitiveness and the safety of the industry. Railroad employees will benefit from the better training and higher quality brake system inspection, testing, and maintenance programs they commented were generally lacking in the industry. In addition, if railroads use this proposed flexibility to become more competitive with other modes of transportation, railroad jobs will be preserved. Furthermore, railroads will save costs and improve delivery times by the elimination of the 1000-mile inspection and the authorization of railroads to operate trains longer distances between brake system tests. Other incidental benefits will include better quality inspections for Freight Car Safety Standard defects. Finally, the public will benefit from better freight service and improved safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.313. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section describes the circumstances that would trigger the duty to perform a Class 2 train brake system test. Basically, FRA proposes to require the performance of a Class 2 brake test whenever a train changes configuration that does not require the performance of a Class 1 brake test. This section also proposes to require that a Class 2 brake test be performed on freight trains that provide repetitive service, such as unit coal trains, after each cycle of that repetitive service. For purposes of this section, a cycle will be deemed completed when the train returns to the point from which it started.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.315. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section describes the tasks comprising a Class 2 train brake system test. The proposed Class 2 test continues the long-established procedure of verifying trainline continuity after it has been disturbed by switching moves. Based on the multitude of comments attesting to the reliability and accuracy of EOT devices, FRA proposes to permit the use of EOT devices to verify trainline continuity as an alternative to the rear-car application-and-release test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.317. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section proposes the required steps that make up a transfer train brake test. The proposed test requirements for transfer trains are no different from what is currently required; however, new definitions, in &sect;232.5, would exclude ``yard trains'' from the definition of ``transfer trains.'' ``Yard train'' would be clearly defined in proposed &sect;232.5 as a train that only performs switching functions within a single yard complex. Movement by ``yard trains'' would not require a transfer train air brake test. ``Transfer train'' is defined in &sect;232.5 as a train that travels between a point of origin and a point of destination without intermediate switching. FRA's determination of whether the movement of cars is a ``train movement,'' subject to the requirements of this section, or a ``switching movement'' is and will be based on the voluminous case law developed by various courts of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reactionary Nature of Bourgeois Humanitarianism" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an article contributed by Dr. Choe Chol-ung exposing the  reactionary nature of bourgeois humanitarianism loudly  advertised by the imperialists and the reactionaries of history.    Noting that humanitarianism assumes the class nature in  every  respect, the article says:    Bourgeois humanitarianism is the world outlook reflecting  the  demand and interests of the capitalist class. The unscientific  and reactionary nature of the bourgeois humanitarianism lies in  that it is based on a wrong viewpoint that regards social human  beings as individual biological beings that exist, dominated by  nature, adapting themselves to the circumstances according to  the instinct of animals, by bringing the social human beings  down to the level of wild animals.    The reactionary nature of bourgeois humanitarianism is  clearly manifested, first of all, in its deceptive preaching of  "philanthropy" and "humanity."    It is the universal law governing the capitalist society  that  the stronger swallows up the weaker. Humanity and philanthropy  are unthinkable in the capitalist society where exploitation and  oppression prevail.    Love and sympathy cannot be expected between the present-day  wage slave-owners who abandon themselves to pleasure by  overdriving the workers and the wage slave workers who have  everything trampled down under harsh oppression and exploitation.    The reactionary nature is also concentrically revealed in  hypocritical preaching of "human rights" and "freedom."    In the capitalist society based on selfishness, the  principle  "human beings are wolves toward human beings" prevails in human  relations. Therefore, the society is replete with falsity,  hypocrisy, swindle, fraud, antagonism, jealousy, plot and enmity  which are fundamentally contrary to humanity.    The popular masses cannot enjoy genuine freedom and rights  in  that society where it is the universal phenomenon to antagonize  each other and sacrifice others for one's own ease and pleasure.    Genuine humanitarianism can never be actualized in the  capitalist society where human conscience, justice and all other  human things are ruthlessly violated by money.    The falsity of "humanitarianism" advertized by the  imperialists and the reactionaries is proved by the reality of  capitalism.    In the capitalist society where a handful of capitalist  class  monopolizes everything including the state power and means of  production, the working people are excluded from the rights to  the exercise of sovereignty and the socio-political activities.  Worse still, they are denied the rights to working, food,  clothing, housing, medical treatment and learning.    The situation is pretty much the same in those countries  where socialism has collapsed and capitalism revived. The  collapse of socialism has brought to the people an  inhumanitarian society, capitalism where exploitation,  oppression and social inequalities prevail and the human nature  is trampled underfoot, not a "humanitarian and democratic  society."    The humanitarian idea can never be realised in the  capitalist  society where class oppression and confrontation constitute the  mainstay of social relations.</p>

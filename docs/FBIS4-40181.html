			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Pivovarova (POSTFACTUM) specially for </F> SEGODNYA in the "Struggle" column: "The Federal  Counterintelligence Service Promises Tough Measures Against  Bandits. The State Duma May Not Support Them"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Security Council and the  General Prosecutor's Office are to supervise the implementation  of the 5 trillion ruble program to control organized crime.  This was announced at a press conference at the end of last  week by Security Council Deputy Chairman Vladimir Rubanov and  Acting General Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko. On 23 June an  expanded collegium will be held at the General Prosecutor's  Office on the issue of fighting organized crime.    The new program envisions international cooperation in  controlling organized crime, as well as participation by a  number of ministries and departments. According to Vladimir  Rubanov, work is fully under way on implementing the program.    Counterintelligence chief Sergey Stepashin reported that in  combating organized crime, all regular and covert operation  means will be employed. Approximately 800 experienced  investigators are to be involved. Stepashin said that there is  preliminary agreement with major banks on cooperation. In the  very near future documents will be signed on dividing functions  between the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] and the  Internal Affairs Ministry. Stepashin admitted that in  implementing the program, to make sure that the rights of 99  percent of citizens are protected, human rights will be violated  to an extent. In this connection, the FCS chief expressed  concern that the State Duma may not approve the proposed drastic  measures.    Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr  Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Press Service, who was present at  the press conference, said: "If we recall history, in 1918 the  capital was swept by robberies and lootings, with people afraid  to go out into the street. And then a Moscow commission took  emergency measures. The commission made sure that all criminals  were caught and shot." In the present conditions, Mikhaylov  said, "any tough measures which will be taken with respect to  the criminal world will be supported by society."</p>

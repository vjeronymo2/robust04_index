			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / German industry's resolve undiminished GERMAN industry's resolve to keep wage settlements low this year is unlikely to be weakened by the terms of last night's public sector pay deal, judging by comments from employers. IG Metall, the engineering union, yesterday continued demonstrations aimed at countering the employers' offer of 3.3 per cent and upholding its 9.5 per cent demand. Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the German employers' association, said the public sector pay award should not be taken as a guideline for industry. High private-sector settlements could increase unemployment and inflation. He said that private industry would do its utmost to see that pay deals were lower than in the public sector. He was speaking as last night's settlement with the public sector union was becoming clear. In recent weeks, employers have warned of the consequences of high wage settlements at a time when the domestic boom, sparked by unification, is slowing down, foreign markets have yet to recover fully from recession, and competition is increasing from lower-cost countries. In the car and components sector especially, companies have stressed the need to cut costs and improve efficiency. Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Opel (part of General Motors of the US) have all said they intend to reduce their workforces in coming years, though avoiding redundancies where possible. Some companies have also been locating more investment overseas. 'Unions don't consider the psychological impact on companies' investment thinking of wage claims of around 10 per cent,' said Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, head of Metallgesellschaft, the mining, metal and engineering group. Its car-parts subsidiary intends to raise output in Brazil and France to help offset high domestic costs. Kugelfischer, a bearings company, has been reducing staff to combat the effect of high costs at a time of slack worldwide demand. 'What we need is a couple of years with no wage increases,' said Mr Wolfgang Masuch, Kugelfischer's commercial director.</p>

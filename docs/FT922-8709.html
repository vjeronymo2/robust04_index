The loss, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 79,000, was largely due to low oil and gas prices throughout the 12 months. Turnover expanded from Pounds 116,000 to Pounds 377,000, reflecting the first full year of trading activities. Losses per share emerged at 1p (earnings 1.2p). Directors said completion of the capital reduction and share consolidation exercise provided the ability to pay dividends out of future profits.</p>

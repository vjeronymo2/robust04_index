			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLS QUITS UNDER FIRE AS HEAD OF DWP  </P> <P> After weeks of battling with Mayor Tom Bradley, Department of Water and Power  General Manager Norm Nichols voluntarily resigned Tuesday, saying the giant  city-owned utility was becoming a "political playpen."  </P> <P> "We know of too many instances where politically motivated agendas have  replaced sound business judgment," Nichols said in his letter of resignation to  the DWP Board of Commissioners. "I cannot manage this business wherein  political considerations are paramount to prudent management decisions."  </P> <P> Nichols, 55, said in an interview with The Times that he felt political  pressure from Bradley's staff in recent months and particularly since April,  when he initially opposed Bradley's plan to implement mandatory water  rationing.  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to vote today on the mayor's proposal requiring  water customers to reduce their consumption by 10% or pay fines.  </P> <P> Nichols said he quit because he felt the agency was under siege. "I saw that it  was going to be an issue-of-the-week scenario," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Nichols was publicly criticized by Bradley and City  Controller Rick Tuttle for what they said were excessive spending for charter  jets and DWP tours.  </P> <P> "The employees of this department . . . do not deserve to suffer the  distraction and publicity associated with the continuing effort by the mayor  and the controller to use the department for their own personal  aggrandizement," Nichols said.  </P> <P> Bradley said Nichols' statements "clearly indicate that he is out of step with  the people of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The people demand that our environment be protected and that public money be  spent efficiently," he said. "Mr. Nichols apparently failed to recognize these  fundamental facts of Los Angeles life."  </P> <P> Said Tuttle: "Mr. Nichols blames me in part for his difficulties. In fact, Mr.  Nichols has been the architect of his problems. He was unwilling to change his  practice of traveling on charter flights at an exorbitant cost to DWP  rate-payers."  </P> <P> City Council members and DWP commissioners were split in their reaction to the  sudden announcement. Nichols, recognized as an effective manager and strategic  planner, also was seen by city officials as aloof, arrogant and unwilling to  bend to political considerations.  </P> <P> City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky immediately called for a full council hearing  on Nichols' allegations of political intrusion at the department. "Mr. Nichols  made some serious allegations in his letter of resignation," Yaroslavsky said.  "The council feels that he owes it to the City Council and to the people of Los  Angeles to tell us more specifically what he is referring to."  </P> <P> Bradley said it was not enough that Nichols ran "the best public utility in the  nation." He said Nichols also had to understand that the mayor "is elected as  administrator of all city government."  </P> <P> Bradley acknowledged that he had no differences with Nichols until April, when  the general manager initially balked at endorsing the mayor's rationing plan.  </P> <P> Bradley and Nichols agreed that he was not asked to leave the post that pays  $151,359 annually, second only to the manager of the Department of Airports in  salary.  </P> <P> Nichols, who was appointed general manager by the DWP commissioners in 1988,  said his decision to leave after 33 years was not a "knee-jerk reaction" to  Bradley's tongue-lashings about expenses.  </P> <P> His decision, he said, was one of great personal anguish that simmered for  months. And Nichols said he hoped his exit would refocus attention on the need  to keep the DWP independent of political interference.  </P> <P> "I would hope customers would ask, 'Hey, where's this going to take us?' "  Nichols said.  </P> <P> The DWP, with more than 11,000 employees and an annual budget of nearly $3  billion, is the nation's largest municipal utility. It provides water and  electrical power for more than 3 million city residents and contributes more  than $100 million a year to the city's general funds. In California, only  Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. are larger  than the DWP.  </P> <P> Bradley made it clear that he plans an aggressive environmentalist agenda for  the DWP and that Nichols was slow to get on board.  </P> <P> The mayor is expected to soon name Mary Nichols (no relation to Norm Nichols),  an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former Bradley  campaign manager, to replace commissioner Carol Wheeler, who resigned Monday at  Bradley's request.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Bradley appointed Mike Gage, an environmentalist and his  former aide, and Dorothy Green, of Heal the Bay, a watchdog group that monitors  Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> This "loading up of the board" with environmentalists, as Norm Nichols put it,  was among the reasons he cited for stepping down. Nichols urged the DWP  commissioners to "advise the City Council to . . . to ensure that balanced and  reasoned viewpoints can be heard" on the DWP board.  </P> <P> Although Nichols was under fire for allowing $700,000 in chartered private jets  and a $1-million VIP tour program, his resignation was a surprise to his staff,  the mayor's office and the City Council.  </P> <P> Reaction from commissioners and City Council members to Nichols' announcement  was mixed.  </P> <P> Upon being told of the resignation, DWP Commissioner Gage said, "So be it. Some  people don't adapt to change very well."  </P> <P> But commission President Rick Caruso lauded Nichols as a brilliant manager and  said, "It's unfortunate to lose someone with his talent."  </P> <P> City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called him a "political scapegoat. . . .  Apparently, the mayor's getting mostly political advice now, and the  environment is a hot ticket."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores agreed that Nichols may have been mistreated by  the mayor. "I'm not sure the mayor ever sat down with Nichols and said, 'We've  got some differences.' (Bradley) just called press conferences instead. That  must be demoralizing."  </P> <P> Said Councilman Michael Woo: "What Mr. Nichols is calling political pressure we  call accountability." Woo said the council and mayor are trying to respond to  public concerns about the environment. "Norm Nichols is the first casualty of  that battle," he said.  </P> <P> But Councilman Richard Alatorre said he was disturbed by the turn of events.  "This should serve as a warning that we need to allow general managers to do  their job," he said. "I think we lost a good general manager."  </P> <P> Walter Zelman, a former DWP commissioner and former director of the political  watchdog group Common Cause, said, "I think the recent assertion of City Hall  political needs and agendas into department activities has been excessively  heavy-handed and not in the long-term best interests of the department or of  the city."  </P> <P> Nichols immediately will be replaced on an interim basis by Assistant General  Manger Dan Waters, DWP officials said. Bradley promised that a nationwide  search would be launched immediately for a successor.  </P> <P> But commission President Caruso said he "will strongly resist any effort to go  outside" the department to find a new general manager because there is adequate  management talent within the DWP.  </P></p>

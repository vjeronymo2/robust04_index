			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: FO busy in Shanghai Sir, Ms Spence's letter ('Poor UK show in Shanghai', July 2) asked why the Foreign Office does not stop being archaic and get down to business. It has, long ago, and it does, every day. She has clearly not had enough contact with us to know this. If she has any complaints about the quality of our post in Shanghai, she would give us details and we will investigate them. We have had no other complaints about it. Our exports to China for the first four months of this year show a 75 per cent increase over the same period last year. One of the FCO's main tasks is to help British business. Nearly 25 per cent of our resources are devoted to it directly. Indirectly, much more. Our customers tell us that we are providing them with the service that they want. We wrote more than 6,000 market information reports for them last year. Ninety per cent said they would use our services again. The opportunities for British business in the Far East are enormous. The FCO can help firms win that business. Let us all work together to improve Britain's performance there even more. Alastair Goodlad, minister of state, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, London SW1A 2AH</p>

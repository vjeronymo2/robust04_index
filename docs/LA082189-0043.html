			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOGNE TRACK AND FIELD;  </P> <P> AOUITA EASILY BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN 3,000 METERS  </P> <P> Said Aouita of Morocco broke the oldest major running-event world record with a  time of 7 minutes 29.45 seconds in the men's 3,000 meters at a Grand Prix track  and field meet Sunday.  </P> <P> Henry Rono of Kenya had set the manually timed record of 7:32.1 on June 27,  1978, at Oslo, Norway.  </P> <P> "It was the hardest of all world records to get," said Aouita, who also holds  world records in the 1,500, 2,000 and 5,000, meters, as well as a world best in  the rarely run two-mile race.  </P> <P> "I wanted another world record. Three days ago, when I registered for the  event, I knew I was going to win and set a world record."  </P> <P> Aouita took over the lead with two laps to go, when pacesetter Charles  Cheruiyot of Kenya dropped out.  </P> <P> Yobes Ondieki of Kenya tried to follow Aouita, but the Moroccan ran the last  lap by himself.  </P> <P> "Every year I have gotten closer and closer to it (the record), but when I was  younger I wasn't so worried because I had time," Aouita, 29, said. "Now I'm  getting older.  </P> <P> "I like the track here. It's very fast and the pacemakers did a great job."  </P> <P> Aouita ran 7:32.23 at the same meet in 1986. That had been the second-fastest  time.  </P> <P> The only individual world record older than Rono's is in a field event -- Bob  Beamon's long jump of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches set at the 1968 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Rono, who set four world records within a 90-day span in 1978, no longer holds  one.  </P> <P> Also Sunday, Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union barely missed breaking  countryman Sergei Bubka's world pole vault record of 19-10 1/2. In his third  attempt at 19-11, Gataullin appeared to have the necessary height, but toppled  the bar with his chest.  </P> <P> Butch Reynolds of the United States, the world record-holder, won the 400  meters in 44.30, the second-fastest time of the year.  </P></p>

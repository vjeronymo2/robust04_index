			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: London After several weeks of being buffeted by overseas influences, the gilts market will have some chunky UK economic statistics to chew on this week. But traders will still be watching for signs of Federal Reserve tightening and Bundesbank easing. 'Gilts are being driven by what is happening across the Atlantic,' according to Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell. Many analysts have argued that the economic fundamentals do not justify the recent falls in European bond markets, which started when the US raised interest rates on February 4. European markets, say analysts, should be able to decouple from the US influence; but so far they have failed to do so. Gilts have fared particularly badly, and suffered once more on Friday. 'The fundamentals may allow gilts to decouple at the shorter end of the yield curve, but we are not yet at the stage where the market can decouple at the longer end,' reckons Mr Barty. This week's information includes unemployment and retail sales, which will be scrutinised for signs of the strength of the recovery; and producer prices and average earnings, which will be monitored for inflationary pressures. Mr Barty says next week's data 'will help the gilts market if it shows continued low inflation and modest growth'.</p>

Monory, the highest French leader to visit China since the  normalization of Sino-French relations last month, is the 24th  foreign parliamentary leader which the National People's  Congress (NPC), the Chinese version of parliament, has received  since last March, when the Eighth NPC Standing Committee was  formed.    Also touring China at present are the Italian Senate  President, the chairman of the Turkmenistan Grand National  Assembly and the chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly.    It is rare for so many foreign parliamentary leaders to  converge on China at a time just before the NPC annual session.    Involved in the policy of expanding influence and making  friends, the NPC Standing Committee has carried out considerable  contacts and exchanges with its foreign counterparts, which have  led to its busy diplomacy, said Yin Zuojin, an official of the  NPC General Office in Charge of Foreign Affairs.    In the past year, the standing committee sent out 17  delegations to visit 27 countries and regions and attend seven  international conferences, while receiving 37 groups from  foreign parliaments, including 24 headed by parliamentary  speakers or chairmen.    According to Yin, the number of delegations -- sent out and  received -- is larger than any previous year.    Observers here said that 1993 saw the congress's diplomacy  with four characteristics.    First, as a part of the country's diplomacy, the congress  paid much attention to strengthening relations with parliaments  of neighbouring countries.    NPC Chairman Qiao Shi's visit last July to the five  Southeast  Asian countries marks the first trip there by a Chinese NPC  chairman. Meanwhile, other senior NPC leaders toured the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea,  five countries in middle Asia and Japan.    Parliamentary leaders from Russia, Japan, Thailand, the  Philippines, India, the Republic of Korea and other neighbouring  countries came to China at the same time.    Second, the congress exerted more efforts to increase its  contacts with parliaments of Western countries.    In January, 1994, Qiao Shi became the first Chinese NPC  chairman to make a trip to Germany, Switzerland and Austria.  Other NPC delegations' visits to Sweden, Norway and Denmark,  restored China's association with these countries' parliaments.    In the past year, the NPC received five delegations from the  U.S. Congress, more than it did in any previous year.    Last year also found the speaker of the European Parliament,  the delegation of 19 members from nine countries of the European  Parliament and a delegation of the French National Assembly as  well as parliament delegations from eastern European countries  treated as guests in China.    Increasing exchanges with parliaments in the Third World  countries was another feature of the NPC's diplomacy in 1993.    The NPC's delegations visited Mexico, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt  and other Third World countries, including Paraguay, which has  no formal diplomatic ties with China.    The congress was also active in taking part in multilateral  diplomacy, with several delegations attending various  international conferences.    Yin pointed out that the parliamentary diplomacy not only  built closer relations between China's national congress and  foreign parliaments and promoted friendship and cooperation, but  also provided foreign experiences for China to learn in its  economic construction and legislation.    He expected that with further reform and opening-up, the  congress's diplomacy will gain even stronger momentum in future.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OF SEWERS AND SURF: FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE MALIBU CAMPAIGN TRAIL;  </P> <P> CITYHOOD: BEFORE THE SUPERVISORS WILL LET THE 'GLAMOUR CAPITAL' GO, THEY WANT  TO IMPOSE THEIR SANITIZED VISION ON IT. THE RESULT IS RAW POLITICS.  </P> <P> Once more the deceptively laid-back community of Malibu is aflame with  political fury. Billed as a fight over cityhood, the issue is actually sewers,  a subject that has long dominated conversation at Malibu dinner parties.  </P> <P> Briefly, many residents hope to incorporate as a city, free of what they call  the tyranny of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> In truth, the supervisors, wielding both legislative and executive powers, are  closer to being absolute monarchs than any other elected officials in our  democracy. As the late Supervisor John Anson Ford told me in 1937, when I was  trying to persuade him to run for mayor: "Each of the five supervisors enjoys  twice the clout of any mayor -- and one-fifth of the headaches."  </P> <P> Today's supervisors, with Ed Edelman dissenting, want to impose a comprehensive  and enormously expensive sewer system on Malibu before they will let it go.  Without sewers -- the need for them is still a subject for debate -- there can  be little further development, and developers are primary sources of the funds  with which supervisors win elections.  </P> <P> The supervisors, in particular Deane Dana, in whose district Malibu lies,  picture themselves as enlightened tribunes whose dreams of progress and  sanitation are thwarted by the selfish millionaires of Malibu, lolling on their  exclusive beaches. To the proponents of cityhood, it is a case of the sturdy  yeomanry of Mailbu protecting their idyllic way of life from the rapacious  barons of development and their ruthless seneschals, the supervisors.  </P> <P> At the moment, the supervisors have reluctantly yielded to a court order and  scheduled a cityhood election for June 5, with the proviso that incorporation  be delayed until March 28, 1991, when construction of the sewers could be under  way. Although the original sewer plan has been greatly reduced by the  California Coastal Commission, assessments for homeowners have been raised. So  the battle will continue, with much figurative blood still to flow.  </P> <P> But then, politics in what Malibuites like to think is the glamour capital of  the world have been tinged with ferocity ever since the redoubtable May K.  Rindge's armed horsemen patrolled the borders of what was then her private  estate to fend off railroads, highway and other intrusive tentacles of  development.  </P> <P> Since then, Malibuites have survived many threats to their cherished way of  life: In the 1950s, it was plans for a nuclear reactor in Corral Canyon; in the  1960s, projected freeways from Santa Monica and the valley, interchanging near  Malibu Canyon; in the 1970s, a grandiose plan by the county engineers to create  a flat coastal plain by filling in all the coastal canyons ("You'll love it," a  county official told us, "it'll be just like Miami Beach").  </P> <P> Sometimes, the warfare was internal. Malibu, with its many movie people, was a  major battleground during the witch-hunts and blacklists following World War  II. Like the current war over cityhood, this was not a class struggle. There  were affluent members of the Communist Party here, and, living in hillside  shacks, what could be described as right-wing hippies, who packed guns and  hoarded food against an imminent takeover by the "commie hordes."  </P> <P> In 1947, when I was helping organize a protest against the House Un-American  Activities Committee, I was severely handicapped by not having a telephone,  there being a postwar shortage of such amenities. I borrowed the phone of an  opulent colleague and rang up several-hundred-dollars' worth of calls to  congressmen, journalists and New York theater people, enlisting their support  and detailing our plans for a protest flight of stars to Washington. I was  surprised by the distress my action evoked in my colleague, even as I handed  over a check for the full amount. Years later, I learned that I had broadcast  our plans over the telephone, probably tapped, of a stalwart member of the  Communist Party.  </P> <P> Far less opulent was a handyman my wife and I employed, an equally stalwart  member of the John Birch Society. He always asked for payment in cash, and when  he died he left not only a large collection of guns, but bundles of cash  concealed in lavatory cisterns, pillows and even garbage cans. I'm not saying  that all was extremism in Malibu politics. My neighbor Kyle Palmer, then  political editor of The Times and widely believed to be the de facto Republican  boss of California, joined with me in launching charity drives in the community  -- and I had, quite erroneously, been identified by national political  columnist Drew Pearson as Kyle's Democratic counterpart. So here and there  political sweetness and light prevailed.  </P> <P> But not much of it is in evidence today. As for the June election, my hunch is  that cityhood will win, despite the combined political muscles of developers,  land speculators and Pepperdine University, whose plans for massive expansion  depend on the supervisors' regional sewers. I base my guess not on the  unpopularity of the sewer system itself and its huge assessments but the  problem presented by Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> PCH, as we Malibuites call it, is possibly the worst thoroughfare in all  America. It is at once a principal route north, the commuter road not only for  thousands of Malibuites but for commuters from inland developments who want to  avoid Ventura Freeway gridlock. It is used by local shoppers and Los Angeles  beach-goers, by tourists, by hundreds of bicyclists, by California Highway  Patrol cars and ambulances screaming toward the all-too-frequent accidents, and  by joggers and casual strollers in swimsuits, often accompanied by dogs, on and  off the leash. If the traffic can move at all, to observe the 45 m.p.h. speed  limit is to be tailgated, rear-ended, shouted at and even shot at.  </P> <P> There is absolutely no way that PCH can accommodate a huge buildup of traffic,  and that will be on the minds of many voters. Even the developers must wonder  how they can hope to sell choice properties if the buyers can't get in or out.  </P> <P> But this is Malibu, where anything can happen. In 1962, Richard M. Nixon ran  for governor of California, and looked like a shoo-in until the extreme right  challenged him in the Republican primary with Joe Shell, a former USC football  player. Malibu was ablaze with Shell bumper stickers and billboards, with Shell  posters on every power pole. There were Shell meetings, barbecues and parades.  Malibu Republicans, in effect, were so Shell-shocked that they seemed quite  ready to jettison their quondam national standard-bearer. One day my wife was  driving our children home from school when our 10-year-old spotted a car with a  Nixon sticker. "Look, Mommie!" she cried -- "Liberals!"  </P> <P> I have often wondered if Nixon lost the final election to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown  Sr. because enough rightists with 10-year-old mentalities mistook him for a  liberal. In Malibu, it is unwise to bet the ranch on anything.  </P></p>

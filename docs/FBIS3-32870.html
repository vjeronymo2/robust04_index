On 31 January, the president signed the call for sessions  that, when Congress starts to meet in about 10 days, will  propose the discussion of some 25 items.    Among the items is the laws regulating the universities'  financial system and the draft bill on invention patents and  traffic, and amendments to the Social Security and film-making  laws, the tax on personal assets, and the penal and procedural  (regarding preventive custody) codes.

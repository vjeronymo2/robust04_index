			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Norcros rises 32% to Pounds 7.36m NORCROS, the building materials and specialist print and packaging group, yesterday reported higher interim profits mainly reflecting sharply reduced reorganisation costs and a modest recovery in trading conditions. Pre-tax profits increased by 32.1 per cent to Pounds 7.36m for the 27 weeks to September 30, up from a restated Pounds 5.56m in the 26-week first half last year. Earnings per share increased to 2.8p (2.4p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3.5p. Operating profits, including contributions from associates, rose to Pounds 12.56m (Pounds 9.01m) on turnover up by 9.57 per cent to Pounds 209.5m (Pounds 191.2m.) The results have been prepared on an FRS 3 basis, and comparisons have been restated accordingly. The main impact of this change was to reduce operating profits in the comparable period by the Pounds 2.65m reorganisation and redundancy costs previously shown as extraordinary items. Turnover from continuing operations increased by 9.58 per cent to Pounds 208.1m (Pounds 189.9m) while operating profits were almost 40 per cent higher at Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 8.7m). Pre-tax profits were also boosted by a reduction in net interest costs from Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 5.2m reflecting lower interest rates and a reduced level of borrowings following the group's successful rights issue in June. Net borrowings at the end of September stood at Pounds 76.4m representing gearing of 44 per cent. In the core buildings products division turnover increased by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 83.2m while operating profits grew by 22.8 per cent to Pounds 3.9m mainly reflecting the lower reorganisation costs. In the ceramics division turnover rose by 15.4 per cent to Pounds 63.8m and operating profits jumped 44.4 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. Meanwhile the print and packaging division increased its turnover by 10.4 per cent to Pounds 51.9m and operating profits by 33.3 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. The group has also made further progress disposing of its property assets. During the first half Pounds 5.2m was received from the sale of properties and, of the Pounds 40.8m balance at the half year, Pounds 17.2m of assets were under offer.</p>

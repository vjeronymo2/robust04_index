			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Russia updates air traffic control - A Dollars 10bn modernisation project RUSSIA is considering a series of proposals to modernise its antiquated air traffic control (ATC) network - a project which could cost Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5bn) and take more than a decade to complete. Thomson CSF, the French group, and a rival consortium of international companies called Gatss (Global Aviation Transport Systems and Services), have each submitted detailed feasibility studies to the Russian government. A provisional decision is expected by the end of the year. It is likely to be followed by other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which in June signed a co-operation deal on regulating the use of airspace in their countries. The pressure for a new ATC system is growing. More than 60 airlines have apparently emerged since the break-up of the old Soviet Union. Thirty have already received licences for international carriage, and 20 are being registered with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which assigns airline designators and codes. More capacity in ATC might also encourage western airlines travelling between Europe and Asia to fly over Russia and pay it fees in hard currencies. Westinghouse of the US, part of the Gatss consortium, stresses a strategic need. 'I do not think that the Russian economy will go anywhere until they begin to implement this ATC system. You have to be able to move goods across the country. It is a key element in stabilising this entire area,' says a spokesman. Russia has indeed named aviation as a strategic industry for development, and improving ATC is part of the drive towards better civil aviation. The government has identified the ATC network as a priority field for investment  -although its ability to pay for the project is limited by budgetary constraints. Mr Anatolii Pyshyi, head of Russia's governmental commission on air traffic, says western involvement is vital. 'This is a very urgent issue because the ATC system is about to disintegrate and there is no other way to solve the problem. Russia is not able to modernise the system on its own,' he said. Although a big up-front capital investment will be needed to initiate the modernisation project, western experts believe further development could be largely self-funding. At present, they argue, airspace over the former Soviet Union is wasted: for historical security reasons commercial aircraft are still restricted to very narrow corridors. Gatss is widely seen as the front-runner among the competitors for the contract, on technical grounds. It pools the skills of seven western companies including Westinghouse, Hughes Aircraft, IBM, AT&amp;T, the Jerry Thompson design company from the US, German's Daimler-Benz group, and C. Itoh of Japan. It has developed a five-stage plan to modernise ATC for the former Soviet Union, involving up to 8,000 individual projects. The programme would take until the year 2015 to complete. However, a rival set of proposals from Thomson CSF, which has experience of introducing regional ATC networks in the former Soviet Union, also has many attractions, including financial backing from the French government. Western aviation experts believe that unless the CIS countries move soon to co-ordinate a development programme, some former Soviet republics will introduce incompatible ATC systems. The Baltic states, for example, have been more concerned to become integrated with western European networks than with those operating in the CIS.</p>

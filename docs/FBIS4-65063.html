			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg (DPA) -- In Luxembourg on Monday [9  May], the foreign and defense ministers of the Western European  Union (WEU) further harmonized their plans for the setting up of  police forces in Mostar. In addition to the European Union  [EU], the WEU wants to contribute in this way to developing the  administration of the capital of Herzegovina.    FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced in Luxembourg  that the use of German police forces in Mostar is being  considered. However, a final decision has not yet been made.    Hans Koschnick, former Social Democratic mayor of Bremen,  has  meanwhile held several talks there, Kinkel said. The EU  appointed Koschnick as the chief coordinator for the development  of Mostar. The beginning of the EU action is still open,  because it is to start under peaceful conditions.</p>

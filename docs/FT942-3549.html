			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Banner Homes at Pounds 1.2m and sees housing market recovery Encouraging demand helped Banner Homes Group, which obtained a full listing in December, increase pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 1.2m. Turnover was ahead at Pounds 8.31m (Pounds 6.63m). Housing output more than doubled with 68 units sold, up from 32, and Mr Stuart Crossley, chairman, was optimistic about a recovery in the market. 'As values edge upwards negative equity problems appear to be receding. There is now a whole new generation of home owners who, since the market bottomed out, have seen the value of their home increase and the cost of their mortgage decrease.' The Pounds 3m proceeds of a rights issue received in January have been invested in new sites and the company plans to have 278 units under construction on 20 sites by the end of 1994. Gearing at the year end was 104 per cent, with borrowings covered by the Pounds 900,000 income stream from the fully let industrial properties. Earnings came out at 8.3p (1.9p). Dividends are resumed with a proposed final of 1p.</p>

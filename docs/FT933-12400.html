			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major left hanging on by Pyrrhic victory - After months of bitter warfare, Tory MPs bowed to the threat of a general election and gave the final go-ahead to the Maastricht treaty. But there is renewed speculation about the prime minister's future THE TIRED, anguished looks said it all. By taking his party to the brink of self-destruction Mr John Major at last secured the vote of confidence it has denied him almost from the moment of his general election victory. But as Mr John Smith launched a savagely forensic attack on the prime minister's leadership at the start of the Commons debate, the serried rows of glum, grey ministerial faces exposed the depth of the government's malaise. The events of this week may prove to have broken Mr Major's premiership. Keeping Britain in Europe may cost him his own political future. Certainly many of his colleagues fear so. In spite of the synthetic unity shown in yesterday's votes, the Conservative party may also have lost the will to govern. It was hard for a dispassionate observer of the bitterness and anger on display this week to reach any other conclusion. As the prospect of electoral suicide restored the appearance of discipline on the party, there was a valiant attempt by senior ministers to preach the message of a new beginning for the government. After a year-long struggle, which has torn apart the government, the Maastricht chapter had been closed. Even the leaders of the Euro-sceptic camp were doubtful that the eccentric legal challenge to the treaty launched by Lord Rees-Mogg will do more than enrich the lawyers. The economy was growing much faster than the electorate yet realised. Parliament's long summer recess would provide a refuge for the prime minister while the political mood began to adjust gradually to the new economic realities. It was plausible stuff. Some sounded as though they believed it. Mr Major, courting colleagues in a calculated appearance in the members dining room, could not afford to admit otherwise. But by and large the public expressions of confidence did not carry conviction. As one senior minister admitted in a more private moment, yesterday's vote offered Mr Major a respite, not a reprieve. After the most tumultuous year in recent political history - on occasion it has made even the last days of Thatcherism seem relatively calm - there are no longer any certainties in British politics. Mr Major's colleagues are unsure in their hearts whether he will survive the next few months let alone the next few years. Some doubt whether their party retains the will to sustain any Conservative prime minister in office. The next general election will not now be on September 2, but it looks much more likely to be held in 1994 or 1995 than in 1995 or 1996. Mr Major's leadership is in crisis. It may be unfair - there are many who believe that no leader could have rebuilt the tired and embittered party which was Baroness Thatcher's legacy. But the word has got around that Mr Major, nice though he is, is not up to the job. In fact, Mr Major is a more tenacious, skilful political leader than he has ever been given credit for. Not a Lady Thatcher - but then the Conservatives had had enough of ideological heroism. The problem is it does not matter whether the charge is true or false. Conservative MPs hear it every time they visit their constituencies. They repeat it in the bars and tearooms of Westminster. It is becoming part of the received wisdom of the political establishment. It was there in the eerie silence of Tory MPs when Mr Smith belittled Mr Major by lavishing praise on the political skills of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Major will not again be able to threaten a general election. The succession of crises over the past year have drained his authority. Another crisis like that of this week would see the prime minister, not the government, depart. The threat comes from several directions. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty has staunched the bleeding, but it has not healed the wounds over Europe. Even as Tory party managers drove them into the Commons lobbies in support of the government, the rebels were warning of fresh conflict ahead. The next few months hold many traps for a prime minister. The looming defeat in the Christchurch by-election on Thursday has been heavily discounted at Westminster. Yet if the result turns out to be as bad as some ministers are predicting it will take more than a few weeks for the shock waves to dissipate. The government should not underestimate its unpopularity in the country  - and among the constituency party activists who are threatening already another rough autumn conference for Mr Major. The squeeze on public spending necessary in the November Budget - much tighter than many Conservative MPs have yet appreciated - will create fresh conflicts at Westminster. So too will even a whisper that Mr Clarke is preparing to increases taxes. Then there are the rebels. For many of them their enforced retreat yesterday will simply fuel many resentments which have made them indifferent to the fate of Mr Major's premiership. The preparations for next summer's European elections will offer another opportunity for the sceptics to exercise the power they now claim they have over Mr Major's policies. There is talk already of a November challenge for the leadership if the political atmosphere does not improve. The sceptics have no credible alternative, but the aim would be to deliver the final blow to the prime minister's authority. Amid the talk of retribution and revenge swirling around Westminster there were suggestions also that Mr Norman Lamont is biding his time. Still burning with resentment over his dismissal as chancellor, he might choose to fire another broadside from the fringe of the party conference. Concluding yesterday's debate Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, offered an eloquent exposition of an altogether more optimistic outcome once the frenzy of the past few weeks has subsided. Economic recovery would gradually transform the political mood; the Conservative party would unite behind a new domestic agenda; Europe would slip to the backburner. For a few moments smiles replaced the scowls on the government benches - but in hope as much as expectation.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Chirac offer to Balladur Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of France's ruling RPR Gaullist party, has invited Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to run as number two on his presidential ticket next year, in an attempt to avoid fratricide between the two Gaullists. With no vice-presidential slot in France, Mr Balladur would be designated as prime minister again if Mr Chirac won the presidency. Mr Chirac said at the weekend that the idea of such a Chirac-Balladur ticket had been 'imagined some time ago' and would still 'not necessarily be the worst solution'. But Mr Balladur appears to have no intention of playing second fiddle to his party leader. According to an IFOP poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche, Mr Balladur's popularity has dropped sharply, with 52 per cent of French declaring themselves satisfied with his government, compared with 63 per cent in August. But even 52 per cent is a high rating for a French prime minister, and Mr Balladur continues to do much better than Mr Chirac in surveys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (PL) -- The friendship  between Colombia and Cuba today overflowed as pro-Cuba  solidarity organizations gathered here to greet President Fidel  Castro. Some 400 people from several Colombian cities attended  the meeting with the revolutionary leader at the auditorium of  Cartagena de Indias' Professionals Club.    One by one, the leaders of the friendship groups expressed  to  the Cuban leader their admiration and full support for the  persistent resistance of his people to harassment by the United  States. All speakers demanded the lifting of the U.S. blockade  on Cuba and stressed their decision to continue to support what  they called a "temporary period." Visibly moved, the president  responded to their display of solidarity and answered some  questions from attendees.    One of the questions was asked by a young 18-year-old girl,  who asked Castro why he arrived in Colombia to attend the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit wearing a guayabera instead of his  traditional green army uniform. The revolutionary leader  replied that he wore a guayabera in response to suggestions made  by conference organizers, who asked the rulers to attend the  summit wearing informal clothes to confront the hot Cartagena de  Indias weather. He pointed out that he did not know whether he  would return to his country in plainclothes, adding that he will  definitely wear his legendary guerrilla uniform again.    Professionals Club President Carlos Cruz inspired a very  special moment when he asked the Antillean chief of state to put  his signature on the main wall of the auditorium, which will  henceforth be called Fidel Castro Auditorium. The Cuban  statesman grabbed a black marker and drafted his signature in  big letters amid cheers and chants loudly uttered by  sympathizers of the Cuban cause. Another affectionate and funny  situation took place as the local Friendship Association gave  him a long-sleeved white guayabera, similar to the one he wore  on the first day of the summit.</p>

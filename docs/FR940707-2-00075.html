We will make every effort to coordinate this priority area's activities with the Department of Education and other Federal agencies. We will also make every effort to collaborate with our national network associations during the funded projects' grant period. We agree with the recommendation for information dissemination and evaluation. The final priority area project design requirements include dissemination, evaluation, and composition of the project's advisory body. In addition, because there was interest expressed that ADD focus this priority area on youth leadership development, the final leadership education and development priority area will be an inclusive one_to cover individuals and families of all ages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADD received fifteen comments on Proposed Priority Area 2, Expanding the Scope of Developmental Disabilities Councils. The majority of the comments received in this priority area were supportive of what ADD proposed in the published notice. Some of the comments also provided recommendations for project length, specific suggestions for which Councils should be eligible for funding, and ideas on project design. There were two non-supportive letters submitted in this priority area. Those letters will be addressed at the end of this discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was a recommendation that the project conduct an assessment of the population of persons with disabilities served by the developmental disabilities network (Developmental Disabilities Councils, University Affiliated Programs, and Protection and Advocacy Systems) in their States. Several writers suggested that participation in the fifteen month pilot studies not be limited to just the additional five States. It was also noted that six months to complete the short-term study would be too short of a time frame. ADD was also encouraged to receive input for the studies from the States and not limit participation to the network associations. We were cautioned that each of the DD program components not lose sight of their specific mission and focus during the expansion studies. This was reiterated in one of the non-supportive letters, in addition to the fact that expansion would duplicate the efforts of other State and Federally funded agencies. The other non-supportive letter indicated that the Councils were not adequately addressing the issues of the disability groups they already serve, and suggested that the Councils make some changes in the way they do business before they take on expansion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The expansion priority area is a legislatively mandated activity. ADD is limited in the number of States to participate in the pilot studies or the length of time to complete each phase of the expansion study. In addition, the short term study of Councils and the national study have already been funded under a separate contractual solicitation. The fifteen month pilot studies are the only part of the expansion study to be funded through this grant announcement. We do, however, agree with the remainder of the comments (including the non-supportive ones) and the final priority area reflects such, as well as a sensitivity to specific foci of Councils and their ability to take on expansion activities without negatively impacting their original mission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADD received three comments on providing technical assistance (through separate contractual solicitations) to improve the functions of the developmental disabilities planning council, protection and advocacy system, and the university affiliated program; and to develop information and referral systems. Two letters supported and expanded upon what we proposed. One letter was non-supportive. The supportive letters recommended specific technical assistance activities, i.e., ongoing technical assistance and information and referral on cultural diversity; and technical assistance activities on self-advocacy of consumers. The one non-supportive letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that the technical assistance contract solicitations be provided to all Councils, P&amp;As, and UAPs, and not a sole source contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

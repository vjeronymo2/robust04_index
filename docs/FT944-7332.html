			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / MPs back 4.7% ministerial pay rise MPs last night voted by a large majority to give ministers a 4.7 per cent pay increase next year, in spite of the opposition of the Labour leader and prominent unionists. Amid growing controversy about recent increases in the salaries of top executives, MPs approved the government's recommended pay rise, which is about 2.3 per cent above the level of inflation. At the end of a debate forced by Labour MPs, the Commons voted by 179 to 13 in favour of the rise, a government majority of 166. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, defended the increase, saying it made up for earlier freezes. Opening a debate on the pay award, he said that MPs had lost about Pounds 2,000 each and ministers up to Pounds 4,000 each because of a salary freeze over the last two years. 'That money has gone for good,' he insisted. 'It's not something made up. It is a permanent loss.' However, Labour MPs condemned the proposals, saying they were unacceptable when public-sector workers were being asked to accept pay restraint. Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, said the increase would 'stick in the gullet' of the public. Another Labour MP, Mr Jeff Rooker, claimed that it was 'demeaning' for the Commons to debate such proposals. Ministers were worth their pay in ultimate responsibility, but not in terms of their productivity which had been 'absolutely pathetic', he added. According to figures released by the government yesterday, the increase will boost the prime minister's salary from Pounds 78,292 to Pounds 82,003 at the start of next year. A cabinet minister's salary will rise to about Pounds 67,000, an increase of about Pounds 3,000. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, could claim a rise pushing his salary up to Pounds 64,255. However, he has made clear that he will not accept the rise 'when millions of others are having no increase at all'. Mr Alan Duncan, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, branded Mr Blair's decision not to take a rise as 'an opportunistic stunt'. He said the Labour leader had one policy, 'and that policy is to feed discontent and then to milk it for all it's worth'. Mr Duncan added: 'He is choosing to seize on grievance and cash in on the politics of what I call the lowest common denominator.' Earlier this week, Mr John Major faced fierce questions about the 75 per cent salary increase recently awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive of British Gas. At the same time, senior unionists have attacked the increase. Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, has said that the rise would make the government's public-sector pay freeze 'even more unsustainable'.</p>

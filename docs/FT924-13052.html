			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont cedes a point Yesterday's 1 point cut in base rates can be summed up as the right decision for the wrong reason. As recently as Monday, when sterling closed at DM2.5125, the chancellor promised to take the exchange rate into account when setting monetary policy. When he cut rates yesterday, it was some five pfennigs lower. The decision smacks of political pressure. The satisfaction the equity market might have taken is offset by the realisation that policy has become as unpredictable as the government's relationship with its own backbenchers. Moreover, it is doubtful whether a low interest rate policy can be sustained without serious damage to sterling. Euro-sterling rates have not fallen below their D-Mark equivalent since the spring of 1981. During the following autumn base rates were raised from 12 to 16 per cent. That pattern need not be repeated this time because the government may be resigned to sterling weakness, and because German rates should be falling next year. But it still suggests there is a limit to any further cuts. One explanation for the equity market's lukewarm response is that currency risk will deter overseas investors at a time when UK institutions are pretty fully invested in shares. A weaker currency may also prompt the government to bear down even more heavily on public spending and the PSBR which would be bad for growth. Perhaps it is because recovery prospects are still so bleak that the gilts market sailed through yesterday with such ease. Yet currency risk is as much a cause for concern in gilts as it is in equities.</p>

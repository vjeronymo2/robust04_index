Less than 5  percent of this immense amount of drug was seized and destroyed  in 1993 despite the Armed Forces joining the fight to eradicate  this scourge.    Powerful international market forces have consolidated a  demand that pressures -- in the face of the lack of real and  competitive alternatives, besides many other factors -- humble  coca-producing peasants who have gradually become cocaine base  producers.    Given the business' illegal characteristic, the "firms" and  organized gangs that stock cocaine base and transport it either  domestically or abroad are the ones that obtain the greatest  percentage of the "added value." This is so because the risk of  transporting this particular kind of merchandise to Colombian  laboratories where it is transformed into cocaine hydrochloride  is very big.    This business requires armed groups for protection and for  administering an efficient and modern corruption network at all  levels. The latter is much more important than the former to  ensure the business' success. That is why new "clandestine"  airports are opened as soon as others are closed down.    The solution to this problem has social aspects and  presupposes very large financial investments. It also requires  efficient and intelligent police repression. But no matter how  you look at it, there is no justification for military  intervention in drug enforcement.    If the power of drug trafficking to finance terrorism has  been clearly established, it is senseless to allow -- now under  the current situation of subversion -- the Armed Forces to  assume the main responsibility for fighting this scourge in the  drug trafficking zones.    The risks are very big and the consequences very serious.  Once I heard a high-ranking Army officer commissioned to the  Huallaga Front say: "...my officers go out with very high  morale; they are willing to confront the subversives and fight  under the most difficult conditions, but I am not sure they can  resist an envelope with $10,000."    The case is that if a battalion officer engages in criminal  actions, he is interested in involving other soldiers to ensure  their silence and avoid sanctions. A wrongly understood  comradeship could end in complicity.    Those who do not accept such complicity can be the object of  arbitrary sanctions or persecution by other officers involved in  drug trafficking. There are also many other honest officers who  do not accept getting involved but prefer to remain silent in  order to avoid problems.    The case of "Vaticano" has negatively affected the Armed  Forces' image, especially the Army. Why must the Armed Forces  continue doing a job that strictly pertains to the police? Would  it not be better to look for another Ketin Vidal [police officer  who arrested Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman] to fight drug  trafficking?</p>

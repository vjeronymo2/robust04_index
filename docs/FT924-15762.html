			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Ofwat call for 2% cut in charges hits water share prices WATER company shares fell yesterday after Ofwat, the water industry regulator, decided to seek a 2 per cent cut in water charges for 1993-94 from 19 of the 32 water companies in England and Wales. Because of the recession, the 10 publicly quoted water and sewerage companies, and nine of the 22 water-only companies, have been able to carry out their capital investment programmes at lower cost than projected in 1989, Ofwat said. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said yesterday: 'I need to ensure that customers get the service for which they have paid.' His decision follows Ofwat's warning last month that water bills could double in real terms by 2005 because of the huge investment needed to meet new environmental rules. Ofwat's report was described as 'short-termism - worse than ever', by Mr Michael Hoffman, chief executive of Thames Water, who said the government had committed the industry to a 'major, long-term capital programme to improve standards'. However, Mr Graham Hawker, group managing director of Welsh Water, said: 'Ofwat wants us to keep 1.5 points below the maximum increase allowed - which we had already told customers we would voluntarily do back in July.' The 10 water and sewerage companies on which Ofwat has served notice are: Anglian, Welsh, North West, Northumbrian, Severn Trent, Southern, South West, Thames, Wessex and Yorkshire. The nine water-only companies are: Bournemouth and West Hampshire, Cambridge, East Worcester, Mid Kent, North Surrey, South East, Tendring Hundred, Three Valleys, Wrexham and East Denbighshire. Last year Ofwat asked water companies to volunteer to hold back price increases by an average of 1 percentage point. It is now formally recommending that they continue that reduction, and also make a further 1 point cut in increases from April 1 1993. Ofwat's decision, an Interim Adjustment, surprised the stock market. Analysts had not expected changes to the charging structure ahead of Ofwat's Periodic Review in 1994, a wide-ranging industry assessment. In its 1991-92 Report on Capital Investment and Financial Performance in the Water Companies in England and Wales, also published yesterday, Ofwat said 'the pre-tax profits of the regulated water companies, adjusted for inflation, rose by 8 per cent in 1991-92 to Pounds 1.2bn - rather faster than had been expected'. Water companies can issue a counter-notice to Ofwat within the next 14 days if they believe other capital spending has offset the benefit from lower construction prices. London stocks, Page 44</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: IG Metall's collective bargaining Sir, Unfortunately it is necessary to correct your report on the legal issue of the collective bargaining contract in the metal and electronics industry and the steel industry of the new federal lands of Germany ('Morale suffers in the old east', April 30). Part of the contract is a revision clause and in addition to this is an arbitration clause. In both industries the two possibilities of revision and arbitration had been put into action, but without any success for the employers' case. The independent chairpersons of the arbitration committee (ie not arbitration tribunals) decided, in each case, in favour of the trade union IG Metall. The employers' association was not able to prove facts and figures in order to claim that the agreed pay rise - starting on April 1 1993 - would ruin companies. It is a completely different issue to rescind unilaterally a collective bargaining contract by the employers. There is no clause in this contract allowing one side to do so. This way of dealing with an agreed contract a year before the first possibility to withdraw must be considered as a danger to the German law of contract according to our civil law code. Peter Senft, I G Metall, Alto Jacobstrasse 148-155, W-100 Berlin 81</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ashok Sharma] </F>   [Text] For over four years now, Pakistan has been turning  all international meetings into a battleground to embarrass  India, particularly on human rights issue. Constrained somewhat  by the accepted of not raising bilateral issues at such  gatherings, Pakistan has taken to raising the Kashmir issue  under the garb of the alleged human rights violations in the  valley. In this attempt Pakistan has been encouraged to a great  extent by the Clinton administration making the human rights  issue its major policy plank. A view seems to prevail in  Islamabad that Washington can intercede on its behalf and force  India to agree to a solution on terms favorable to Pakistan.  Excelling her predecessor Mr. Nawaz Sharif in anti-India tirade,  Ms. Benazir Bhutto's private attitude toward India has vitiated  whatever atmosphere had been generated for good-neighborly ties  in recent years.    Recently, the dispute drowned all hopes at the Human Rights  Commission meeting at the Geneva with Ms. Bhutto stopping just  short of calling for an all out war against India. Her aim  seems to build pressure on the Human Rights Commission of the  United Nations to pass a resolution against India. She said  that success of any future talks between Islamabad and New Delhi  had to be linked to the human rights situation in the Kashmir  valley. Pakistan's insistence on the implementation of UN  resolutions on Kashmir belied its intentions. Indian finance  minister and leader of Indian delegation to the 50th session of  the UN Human Rights Commission at Geneva, Dr. Manmohan Singh,  exposed the game plan of Pakistan and said to this date 45 years  later, Pakistan continues to remain in illegal occupation of  one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in violation of the UN resolution  and, therefore, there is no possibility for a plebiscite as a  precondition of this said UN resolution demands that Pakistan  will have to withdraw all its forces and tribal population from  the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Accession of Jammu and Kashmir  to India not only enjoys perfect legal validity, but had also  been sanctified by a popular will. Seeking the support of the  world community in its struggle against Pakistan's sponsored  terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Manmohan Singh said that  this externally inspired terrorism challenged India's  territorial integrity and sought to divert its intentions from  the basic task of nation-building. Lambasting Pakistan for  misusing the UN forum to launch an uncalled- for tirade against  India on human rights, he said that an index of India's  commitment to human rights and the rule of law was the restraint  shown during the Hazratbal crisis generated by the seizure of  the holy shrine by Pakistan-supported terrorists.    Earlier, replying to Pakistani Prime Minister Ms. Benazir  Bhutto's harp on human rights in Kashmir, former chief minister  of jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, termed the propaganda  as false and malicious and said that it was a well-planned  attempt on her part to promote terrorism in the state with a  view to grab it. He also reminded Pakistan of the tragic plight  of the Ahmediyas, the Sindhis, Shi'ites, Christians and other  minority communities in that country which is a telling  commentary on Islamabad's concern for human rights.    Human rights in India are well protected. A national  commission for human rights has been established which is quite  powerful. Indian legal system also provided sufficient remedial  framework of punishing human rights violations. Permanent under  secretary of British Foreign Office, David Gillmore, who is on a  visit to India has lauded the sensitivity of Indian Government  toward human rights. He has praised India's continuing and ever  greater transparency in Kashmir on human rights issue and called  for strong action by international community against states who  are guilty of cross border terrorism.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONLY JORDAN CAN CONTROL A BULL MARKET  </P> <P> Lyrics for $800, please. Answer: "Stephen Sondheim had him in mind when he  wrote, 'Isn't it rich?-Aren't we a pair?-Me here at last on the ground-You in  mid-air."'  </P> <P> Who is Michael Jordan?  </P> <P> Yo, Mike, you can come down now.  </P> <P> Last of the Wright Bros., Air Man, Holy Ghost of Hang Time . . . What else can  we call him? His arms and legs, they're so pliable, and the way he bends them,  so they look like they're coming at you from 800 different angles -- he's  Gumby!  </P> <P> Elgin, Connie, Doc, they were all electrifying in their day, but Jordan has  turned it up a kilowatt with those tongue-wagging, crowd-gagging, arms-waving,  legs-splaying, morale-shattering, reputation-flattering, bullet-headed tomahawk  jams. These are indoor gyms; where's the wind beneath his wings blowing from?  </P> <P> Seriously, Mike, did I ever tell you, you were my hero? You're everything I  would like to be. Part of it, of course, is that you're going bald. Those of us  who've blazed that trail always appreciate a superstar athlete with faltering  follicles. You're our first bald sex symbol since Theo Kojak, if you don't  count Beldar The Conehead. (Kareem is in another category because of those  goggles. Every time he trots onto the court I keep expecting Han Solo and  Chewbacca to follow.) That Nike deal is sweet, Mike, but Rogaine would pay you  billions. Think of it: "Hair Jordan." Be still my foolish scalp.  </P> <P> How do you like his numbers so far? He averaged 39.8 against Cleveland, and  he's getting 34 against the Knicks -- plus 11.5 rebounds, a preposterous total  for a guard. Not that it's new ground Jordan's plowing: In a three-game set  against Boston in 1986, His Airship averaged 43.7 points, and last season in  five games against Cleveland, he went for 45.2. Only Jerry West (46.3 in a  six-game series against Les Boulez in 1965) ever averaged higher.  </P> <P> No wonder CBS has devoted so much time and energy to Jordan. With Bird out, and  Magic, by virtue of so many finals, having become the perennial closing act of  the playoffs, CBS was eager for a new hook to hang its coverage on. Jordan is  clearly ushering in the 1990s; if it's time to rock 'n' roll, he's Jerry Lee.  So each little thing he does attracts camera overload. We see him before the  game, pulling up to Chicago Stadium and climbing gingerly out of his Testarosa.  We'll see Michael wanna-bes make their fashion statement wearing black high  tops. Everyone in Chicago wears them; the Bulls cheerleaders, probably even  Mike Ditka. We talk to his mother -- (CBS declared her Miller Lite's player of  the game on Mother's Day. Society's approaching the point where you're nobody  until you're the Miller Lite something or other; you might as well be dead. Any  day now CBS Sports will name Noriega Miller Lite's dictator of the hemisphere  and a $1,000 scholarship will be donated in his name) -- his father, his  trainer, his doctor. How does he feel? What did he eat for breakfast?  </P> <P> Could he always jump this high, or was he kidnapped by aliens, and injected  with anti-gravity particles? We see television guys insinuate themselves into  his life to make themselves invaluable to the hype; for example, Tim Brant  breathlessly recounted a perfunctory conversation with Jordan: "Michael said to  me, 'I gotta tell you, Tim' . . . " (Why is it every time Brant reports a  coach's instructions to his players, someone's always spittin' or bitin' or  sniffin' or scratchin' or clawin'? He makes every event sound like alligator  wrestling.)  </P> <P> The further Chicago advances in the playoffs, the more concentrated the CBS  coverage. By the semis we'll get hour-long specials about where Jordan does his  dry cleaning, and his exclusive ratings of the seven Santini Bros. If the Bulls  reach the final, Jordan will anchor the evening news instead of Dan Rather.  </P> <P> Most people can't fathom the Bulls coming this far. Without Jordan, they're  Charlotte. They don't have any players who'd automatically start on every other  team. In fact, none would start on more than a handful. Other nondescript teams  have ridden an irrepressibly hot player to the NBA finals: the Warriors won in  1975 with Rick Barry; the Rockets reached the final in 1981 with Moses Malone.  But Barry had Jamaal Wilkes; Moses had Calvin Murphy. No guard has ever done so  much with so little help as Jordan.  </P> <P> Switching Jordan to the point was the smartest thing Doug Collins did this  season. (It's hard to tell how good a coach Collins is, since all he's required  to say in huddles is, "Get the ball to Michael.") He has the ball in the middle  of the court, which means he sees the whole floor. And he initiates the action,  which means everyone else must react to him. He'll draw defenders to him like a  magnet, then pitch off to a teammate as wide-open as a car wash. Think what the  Bulls could do with a drop-dead shooter like the Bullets' Jeff Malone. (Malone  and Terry Catledge or Mark Alarie for Will Perdue and Chicago's lottery pick,  provided it's lower than No. 1, 2, or 3, hmmm.)  </P> <P> Even with Jordan, though, it would take a miracle for the Bulls to win the NBA  title. Which reminds me of a story: At the 1988 Final Four, Oklahoma Coach  Billy Tubbs was answering questions at a news conference. Sitting next to him,  moderating, was North Carolina's droll sports information director, Rick  Brewer.  </P> <P> "Billy," Tubbs was asked, "do you think God is on your side?"  </P> <P> "Our side?" Tubbs responded, rolling his eyes. "I've never seen God in an  Oklahoma Sooners uniform, have you? What number does he wear?"  </P> <P> Quicker than a heartbeat, Brewer said, "No. 23."  </P></p>

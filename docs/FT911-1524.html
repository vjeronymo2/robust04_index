			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: The range of schemes available The current pensions framework consists of: The basic flat rate state pension of Pounds 52 a week for a single person or Pounds 83.25 per week for a married couple. Every person qualifies for this pension, subject to paying the required contributions. Serps - employees automatically belong to Serps unless contracted-out. Employers can contract their members out of Serps and provide the benefits through a company scheme. Employees not in a company scheme can contract out of Serps with a personal pension. Employees, whether in or out of Serps, can provide for further benefits with a personal pension. Company schemes usually provide higher benefits in addition to the equivalent Serps benefits. However, employees in company schemes can provide addition pension though an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC) scheme, either through an in-house arrangement or through a free standing AVC from a life company or other provider.</p>

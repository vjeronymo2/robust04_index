			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Core Treasury tasks may be contracted out THE GOVERNMENT'S drive to contract out Civil Service operations to the private sector is closing in on core Treasury functions including recruitment, training and economic-model building. The Treasury has said it intends to start market testing - the testing ground for contracting out - on the TSG (the Treasury Security Guard), the internal audit, the library and several other areas. The main controversy surrounds economic-model building, which has an important input into economic forecasting. The Treasury said yesterday that outside companies would not have access to sensitive information and that the modelling function to be market tested was 'a technical matter'. But critics believe that model-building does have implications for forecasting that are unavoidably political and market sensitive. Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of FDA top civil servants' union, said: 'It is extraordinary that the government has chosen to market test areas that are crucial to what should be politically neutral advice given by civil servants to government ministers.' She also said that the government had not made clear whether companies tendering for the work would have to prove a freedom from political bias. The Treasury's computerised economic model contains hundreds of variables that simulate how the economy works. It is central to Treasury forecasts, published twice a year. The job of updating the model is currently the work of the Treasury's 80-strong team of economists. But partly because of mistakes in forecasting the Treasury has been looking at ways of contracting out more development work on the model. It has already given contracts to update parts of its model to Strathclyde University, Warwick University and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Similar groups would probably win contracts if the modelling function was contracted out.</p>

He said: These battles will continue until there is total  victory over the opposition.    He also announced an agreement on a temporary cease-fire to  transfer the wounded.    The spokesman for Rabbani also spoke about heavy clashes in  northern Afghanistan and around the city of Mazar-e-Sharif and  denied the announcement of any cease-fire in that city.    'Aziz Morad said three areas in the Faryab Province, in  northern Afghanistan, have come under the control of forces of  General Esmai'l Khan, an important commander of Jami'at-e Eslami  [Islamic Society of Afghanistan] in western Afghanistan.    Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] and the  Northern  Meli-ye Eslami [Islamic Front] Movement say they have also  achieved fresh victories in the battle fields in northern  Afghanistan.    They announced the main condition for cease-fire is the  resignation of the president and the formation of a summit  between the leaders of jehadi and political groups. [passage  omitted]</p>

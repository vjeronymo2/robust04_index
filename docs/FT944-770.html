			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: CRA provides more for copper buy-out costs CRA, the Australian mining group, said yesterday that it would take a further ADollars 115m (USDollars 89m) after-tax provision to cover the costs of buying out its Japanese partners in Southern Copper, and closing and possibly demolishing the smelting operation, writes Nikki Tait. The provision is in addition to writedowns on the investment in previous years, and will be treated as an abnormal item against 1994 earnings. The decision to close the facilities has already been announced, but CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, said yesterday that it formally bought out its partners, Nissho Iwai and Furukawa.</p>

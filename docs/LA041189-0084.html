			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> TEAMING UP FOR A RECORD-SETTING PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar High School had one of the best days in his  career Saturday at the Arcadia Invitational track and field meet.  </P> <P> Lavelle, The Times' athlete of the week, finished second in the 1,600 meters  with a time of 4 minutes 11.94 seconds -- the fourth fastest time in the nation  this season.  </P> <P> A fine individual performance.  </P> <P> But nothing compared to his teamwork.  </P> <P> Lavelle, a senior, was part of the distance medley relay team that set the  Orange County record with a time of 10:09.71, breaking El Modena's mark of  10:15.06 set in 1981. It also was a meet record and the fastest time in the  nation this season.  </P> <P> "It's too bad they don't run the distance medley at more meets," Lavelle said.  "It really can bring a team together. We've had one of the best days running  we've ever had."  </P> <P> Which is saying a lot.  </P> <P> Lavelle, Jay Lightburne and Greg Shryock -- who teamed with sprinter Mark  Barnum in the relay -- have been running together since they were 9 years old.  </P> <P> "There used to be a pretty good youth program in this county, but it's dwindled  in the last few years," Corona del Mar Coach Bill Sumner said. "Eddie, Jay and  Greg are products of that program when it was at its height."  </P> <P> All three ran for the Orange County Blue Angels, a club team in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "We talk about those days from time to time, nothing specific, just about how  much fun it was," Lavelle said. "That's why it was really nice to get the  record. It was something we had to each work equally to get."  </P> <P> Lavelle ran the 1,600-meter leg of the race just two hours after finishing  second in the 1,600. However, he didn't show much fatigue, as his time in the  distance medley (4:13) was less than two seconds slower than his time in the  1,600.  </P> <P> "We've monitored Eddie for a few years, so we know he can come back in two  hours," Sumner said. "We know what he can do."  </P> <P> Lavelle anchored the race, with Shryock leading off in the 1,200 meters.  Lightburne, the 800, and Barnum, the 400, were in the middle events.  </P> <P>  "We've run together so long, but we've never run like that. That's what made  it so special," said Lavelle, who orally committed Monday to attend Notre Dame  on a track and field and cross-country scholarship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Eric Grove of Tustin had a two-run homer in a 2-1 victory over Saddleback  Wednesday. He also had three hits and an RBI in a 10-2 victory over Corona del  Mar Friday.  </P> <P> Chris Johnson of Villa Park had two home runs and seven runs batted in against  Canyon Friday -- all in the same inning. Johnson hit a three-run homer in the  first inning and hit a grand slam later in the inning.  </P> <P> James Johnson of La Quinta had two home runs, four RBIs and scored four runs in  a 17-9 victory over Santiago Friday.  </P> <P> Louie Muniz of Woodbridge won the 110-meter hurdles in 15.09 and the 300  hurdles in 39.16, and was named the running athlete of the meet at the Orange  County track and field championships Saturday.  </P> <P> Kevin Obergfell of Irvine pitched nine scoreless innings in three games last  week. He went two-thirds of an inning for the victory on Monday, pitched 4 2/3  innings on Wednesday and went 3 2/3 innings for a save on Friday.  </P> <P> John Rodriguez of Orange went six for seven with six RBIs in victories over  Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach. He also had a save against Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set meet records in the long jump (22-10) and  triple jump (50-3) at the Orange County track and field championships Saturday.  His distance in the triple jump was only one-half inch of tying the county  record of 50-3 1/2 set by Ken Williams of Troy in 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eddie Lavelle  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High  </P> <P> Position: Distance runner  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-3, 168, Senior.  </P> <P> Last Week: Lavelle finished second in the 1,600 meters at the Arcadia  Invitational. His time of 4:11.94 is fourth fastest in the nation this season.  </P> <P> Season: Lavelle is undefeated in Sea View League action and has the fastest  Orange County time in the 1,600 meters this season.  </P></p>

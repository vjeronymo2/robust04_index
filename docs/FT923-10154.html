			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henry Ansbacher climbs 73% to Pounds 1.91m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Henry Ansbacher, the merchant banking group, rose by 73 per cent in the half year to June 30, after a strong performance from its offshore operations and asset trading depart ment. Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman, said that the increase had been achieved despite the recession and without any improvement in market conditions in the UK or the US. Talks about a possible takeover by Singer &amp; Friedlander are continuing but the group declined to give further de-tails. Two of Ansbacher's main shareholders - Pargesa, the Swiss investment group controlled by Belgians and Canadians, and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, which together own about 62 per cent of the shares - have been in contact with Singers for more than two months. Pre-tax profits, after all provisions, were Pounds 1.91m, compared with Pounds 1.1m last time. In the year to December 31 1991, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.23m. Its banking operations continued to shrink. The total loan book net of cash backed loans was Pounds 99.1m at the end of June compared with Pounds 155.5m a year earlier. Corporate finance was said to have done well. Losses by the group's mergers and acquisitions division were said to be well down on those of 1991 as a result of cost reductions made in July 1991. The New York mergers and acquisitions operation will be wound down gradually, allowing remaining senior staff to serve out their contracts while the rump of its operations in London have been merged in the group's corporate finance department. Group central costs were up by 4.7 per cent, from Pounds 523m to Pounds 548m. Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 0.2p).</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO FEEL SOME GUILT  </P> <P> None of us who heard our mothers admonish us to finish our spinach by reminding  us of the "starving children of China" can but feel guilty when we waste food,  even though some of us now leave food on our plates simply to save our figures.  </P> <P> But, during this coming week, proclaimed Hunger Week by the Orange County Board  of Supervisors, perhaps it is a good idea to let the guilt jab at our  consciences. The fact is, as mother said, there are starving children in many  parts of the world. And even in an area as affluent as Orange County -- where  the median income tops $45,000 -- there are thousands of people who go to bed  hungry every night.  </P> <P> Hunger Week is part of a larger program, including World Food Day on Monday, in  which 140 countries will focus on hunger in observances sponsored by the Food  and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In Orange County, events  will include food drives, school talks, fund-raising and other programs.  </P> <P> Finding a hungry person sometimes means looking only as far as next door.  Nationwide, estimates are that a majority of adults aged 55 to 75 consume less  than two-thirds of the nutrients they need to stay healthy, in many cases  because they can't get out to buy food or have no one who cares for them. And  one-fifth of all American children are below the federal poverty level,  according to the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, with  hunger a direct result of poverty.  </P> <P> America is spared the tragedy of massive starvation. And, while it had nothing  to do with finishing spinach, so is China. But deadly hunger persists in Africa  and parts of Central America, South America, India and Southeast Asia,  according to the United Nations.  </P> <P> Up to 18 million people -- three-fourths of them children under the age of 5 --  die of hunger each year, hunger agencies say. Only 10% of them die directly  from lack of food, with the rest dying of illnesses that someone with enough  food would easily survive.  </P> <P> It is good to focus on hunger, especially in Orange County, where this past  year some services to the poor have been threatened by city councils responding  to fears of some residents that the homeless will breed crime in their  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> While understanding some of their concerns, we recognize those who do not  complain. And we especially admire those who open their eyes to the needs of  their neighbors and who commit themselves, during Hunger Week and all year  long, to finding food for the hungry.  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / EU steel cuts deal 'politically contrived' The German steel industry faces two years of 'severe pain' following last month's Brussels agreement on state subsidies in the European Union steel sector, a leading UK consultancy warned last night. More jobs will be cut at all the big German plants as a new wave of restructuring takes place and further plant closures are inevitable, said Sheffield-based Meps Europe in its latest quarterly review of world steel outlook. The report comes nearly four weeks after the agreement by EU industry ministers on state subsidies, which has been widely criticised by non-subsidised steel companies in Germany, France and the UK. Yesterday Meps added to the simmering row over the agreement by claiming that the 5m tonnes of capacity cuts by subsidised companies hammered out at Brussels was a 'politically contrived' figure to embellish the deal. 'The effective capacity cut from the subsidised companies is nearer to 2.5m tonnes,' it says. Non-subsidised companies are now left to find 25m tonnes of capacity cuts to meet the original target of 30m tonnes across the entire industry. However Mep says the subsidised companies offered less capacity cuts than were expected. 'Other enterprises are not likely to increase their offers of capacity reductions now that the terms of the agreement with the subsidised companies are known.' Meps said the German steel sector would carry a large proportion of the capacity cuts and job losses in any plan for the non-subsidised steel companies. The agreement by industry ministers to allow Ekostahl, the struggling east German producer, to build a hot strip mill would reverberate throughout the German industry. But the effect would be felt mainly in western Germany, where many more jobs would go - on top of some 2,200 job cuts from last year's closure of the Krupp-Hoesch Rheinhausen plant. Meps forecasts EU crude steel production will be 127m tonnes this year, down 3m tonnes or 2.3 per cent on the expected out-turn for 1993.</p>

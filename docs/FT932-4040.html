			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Failure on market access could 'sink' Gatt round - David Gardner and Tim Coone interview Peter Sutherland, the newly appointed chief of Gatt FAILURE to reach a market access agreement at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo could sink prospects of concluding the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations, according to Mr Peter Sutherland, the newly appointed director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'If there is a failure to deliver (in Tokyo), then I think we have a serious crisis,' Mr Sutherland said yesterday. Strong leadership and tough decisions by the US and European Community would be required if Gatt's Uruguay Round were to be successfully concluded by its December 15 deadline, he said. A former EC competition commissioner from 1985 to 1989, who built up a formidable reputation for overcoming resistance from government ministers and powerful industrial lobby groups in breaking down internal EC trade barriers, Mr Sutherland now sees the responsibility for the task of breaking down world trade barriers as lying firmly with the industrialised nations. 'An enormous responsibility rests with the G7 countries to re-ignite the process, which will then have to be rapidly multi-lateralised. We must look to the EC and the US as essential players and we are very fortunate in having Mickey Kantor (the US trade representative) and Leon Brittan (the EC trade commissioner) who are both committed to completing the Uruguay Round, but leadership will have to come from the highest levels. Difficult decisions will have to be taken,' he said. It will be of vital importance that progress is made over the next two months if the Uruguay Round is to be completed, he said. 'There has to be progress in the short term. Without progress this side of August, it will be difficult to complete the round by the December deadline.' He said that the G7 meeting in Tokyo next month would be the key to this, and he expected advances to be made there on market access. 'A solution to the Uruguay Round is going to require a recognition of legitimate interests, particularly those of the developing world, which have to be taken into account by the developed world,' he said. 'The multilateral negotiating system is on trial and so is facing a very dangerous time. There has to be a recognition that the blow to confidence that would result from a failure of the round would be global and that strength in negotiations does not depend on the ability to point a figure at who is to blame.' Looking beyond the Uruguay Round, which he says is the sine qua non for Gatt's future development into a more powerful multilateral trade organisation proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the outgoing director-general, Mr Sutherland believes that in the short-term the Gatt secretariat must have additional resources for 'organic growth to develop its overall competence to monitor and analyse competition issues in world trade'. There was a need for a speedier resolution of disputes, he said, and the functioning of the various trade panels 'has to become more effective, and should not become paralysed by the need for unanimity'. In a tribute to Mr Dunkel, whom he will replace on July 1, he said: 'He has been an exceptional public servant, who has delivered us to the stage which allows (the Uruguay Round) to be completed.' But he warned that the various statements from around the world of willingness to complete the round 'should not be taken as proof that we are irreversibly on course to concluding the round. We have had various false dawns before and we are faced with a very short time frame to conclude the negotiations'. Should the unthinkable happen and the Uruguay round fail 'it will still be vital that Gatt itself continues. Otherwise the world will revert to a group of warring trading blocks.' Mr Sutherland, told the FT he was 'not pessimistic, but I'm realistic' about the chances of a deal in Tokyo and concluding the round by its December 15 deadline. Hopes have been raised in recent weeks that the US, EC, Japan and Canada can reach binding agreements on cutting tariffs on manufactured goods and the liberalisation of services at Tokyo. But the evidence was 'not yet there to justify optimism over conclusion,' he said. 'We've had too many false dawns.' Mr Sutherland, who does not take over at Gatt until July 1, would not confirm that he will be at the Tokyo summit. Nor was he prepared to comment yet on French opposition to the EC-US agreement on the farm chapter of the Round, negotiated at Blair House in Washington last November by his successor in Brussels as Ireland's commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry. 'It seems to me that Blair House is the basis, and will remain the basis for discussions leading to the conclusion of the Round,' Mr Sutherland said. He did not believe the Gatt talks would collapse over agriculture. 'I still believe that will be solved,' he said. The former commissioner, who played a leading part in designing the EC's single market programme, made very clear that he would take a hard line against any country obstructing progress towards a world trade deal. 'I see my role as a political role, where I'm going to say it as it is, and, I hope, bluntly face negotiating parties with their responsibilities.' Gatt, he said, and by implication the multilateral trade organisation which could succeed it, could and should become 'a major organisation in world governance.'</p>

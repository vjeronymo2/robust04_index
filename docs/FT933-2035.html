			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Bond issues push MAI up 13% to Pounds 80m RECORD bond issues by governments and companies fuelled a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at MAI, the financial services, information and media group headed by Lord Hollick. The group, which yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 80.2m for the year to June 30, also revealed that its 61 per cent-owned broadcasting company, Meridian, was ahead of budget. Meridian won the ITV south of England franchise with a Pounds 36m bid. MAI's results, struck on turnover 36 per cent up at Pounds 528m including an Pounds 86.6m contribution from Meridian, were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. Forecasts were upgraded by as much as Pounds 7m to Pounds 96m for the current year. Lord Hollick, managing director, said profits had been driven by currency gains and the group's securities business in the US and UK. Governments had increasingly sought funding from bond markets. The decline in interest rates had also boosted activity in securities investments. Foreign exchange dealing had been less satisfying, with the poorest performance out of Asia. Business in Japan had been held back by turmoil in the Japanese banking sector, and the collapse of the Tokyo stock market. Overall, money broking and securities increased trading profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 55.9m. The information division saw a 70 per cent rise at the trading level to Pounds 8m, due to cost savings from the merger of the market research groups NOP and MRI and a maiden contribution from financial information. Retail financial services enjoyed a strong contribution from Wagon, the car finance operation. MAI's decision in 1990 'not to write any more business at suicidal margins' had stood Wagon in good stead, said Lord Hollick. On the downside, the insurance arm, Safeguard, had been hit by intense competition from direct telephone sales. The group's move into broadcasting appeared set to pay early dividends, with Meridian on course to break even in the year to December, six months before budget. The division, included for six months, incurred a loss of Pounds 3.5m. MAI ended the year with net cash of Pounds 55m. Earnings per share rose from 13.7p to 15.8p. The dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 4.9p, for a total of 6.9p (6p). Lex, Page 20; Picture, Page 23</p>

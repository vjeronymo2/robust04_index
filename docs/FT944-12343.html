			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Bank reports improved outlook on inflation The inflation outlook has improved over the last three months and 'remains favourable', Bank of England says in its quarterly inflation report, released yesterday. The Bank now expects RPI(X), the government's target measure of inflation - which excludes mortgage interest payments - to rise slightly next year from its current 2 per cent level but to remain below 3 per cent. By the first half of 1996 it should be around 2.5 per cent, in line with the government's aim of getting inflation within the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. The Bank gives three main reasons for lowering its medium-term inflation projection. About half the fall in the projection is due to September's increase in base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent. The Bank reckons that, at the moment, a rise in base rates has a slightly less than one-for-one effect on inflation after two years or so. In other words, a half percentage point rise in rates leads to a reduction of slightly under 0.5 percentage points in inflation. The rise in rates should lead to an increase in saving, a reduction in borrowing, and a cut in the disposable income of indebted households and companies. The report says the effect of the move will probably be greater than in the past, because of the continuing high level of indebtedness in the personal sector. 'It is also possible that the signalling effect of an increase in rates earlier in the recovery than many had expected might lower inflation expectations', the report adds. Recent inflation figures have been lower than expected, which has led to a fall in the starting point of the projection. Real average earnings have increased less rapidly than expected, reducing companies' unit labour costs. The Bank also says that its own measure of 'core' inflation, RPI(Y) - which excludes indirect taxes as well as mortgage payments - is likely to be even lower than RPI(X), reaching only just over 2 per cent in early 1996. However, the Bank warns that its central projection is only the single most likely outcome. 'The risk of inflation being higher than the central projection is greater than the probability of it being lower.' The main uncertainty for the Bank is the recent differential between producer price inflation - the price of goods at the factory gate - which has recently picked up speed, and retail price inflation - the price of goods in the shops - which has remained low. 'It is not clear how far price pressures will be passed down the production and retail chains' the report says. One uncertainty is whether increased competition in the retail sector is structural, or cyclical. If the latter, this may mean that retailers' margins will widen - and prices rise - as the economy expands. The labour market represents a further risk to the projection. The Bank has assumed that real wages are more sensitive to the labour market than they used to be, and that inflation expectations among wage bargainers have fallen. 'Neither assumption is certain,' the report warns. Finally, the Bank points to the rapid growth of narrow money, or M0, which grew at 7.3 per cent in the year to October, well outside its 0 per cent to 4 per cent monitoring range. 'M0 growth has proved a good leading indicator of retail inflation in the past, so the fact that it remains higher than expected is cause for concern', it says. The Bank also says that UK output is likely to continue growing at a rate faster than long-run potential, and from a level closer to potential than was previously thought. This implies that the so-called 'output gap' is lower than the Bank thought. The output gap is the difference between an economy's long-term trend of output growth and its actual output. Economists believe that when actual output is below the long term trend - that is, an output gap exists - inflationary pressures will be subdued. However, the Bank also noted that the output gap was likely to close at a slower rate than in the recovery to date, implying that the rate of gross domestic product growth - 3.6 per cent in the year to the third quarter - might slacken. The risks to the inflation forecast are mainly on the upside, the Bank says, as is likely to be the case when inflation is low. Since the central forecast is at the top of the 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent target band, this does not leave any margin for comfort, implying interest rates will need to rise over the coming months. The Bank noted approvingly that the financial markets had responded positively to the increase in base rates in September, suggesting that the credibility of the monetary authorities has been enhanced.</p>

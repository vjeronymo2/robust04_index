			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China's reform to  turn state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies has been  a hot topic among deputies to the National People's Congress  (NPC) now in session in the Chinese capital.    Conversion of state enterprises into joint-stock companies  is  one of the prominent reform measures that have been taken in  China to establish a modern enterprise system.    Deputies point out that experiment in this regard has  achieved marked progress in the past decade, which has proved  that the share-holding system has injected vigor into state  enterprises.    According to He Guanghui, vice minister in charge of the  State Commission for Economic Restructuring, economic  restructuring in China has always been concentrated on the  central task of reforming enterprises.    "Establishment of a share-holding system has been at the  core  of the task of changing the operational mechanism of state  enterprises. China has accumulated experience and achieved good  results in this regard," he said.    Reform of state enterprises has gone through a series of  phases in the past 15 years, evolving from operational autonomy  for enterprises, to contractual responsibility, and to  transformation of their operational mechanism.    But on the whole, state enterprises are yet to be  invigorated.    Deputies say that, since the government has decided to  establish a modern enterprise system, the share-holding system,  as a prominent form of organization that clearly defines  ownership relations and operational mechanism, has become an  important way of choice for invigorating state enterprises in a  market economy.    As state enterprises have different conditions, there should  be many ways to invigorate them, deputies say. Their consensus  is that a single formula will not do when it comes to enterprise  reform.    Zhang Shouye, an NPC deputy from Linyi, Shandong Province,  says that different enterprises should adopt different ways of  reform. They can choose from a share-holding system, a  share-holding cooperative system, management by collectives or  individuals, leasing, and auction.    He said: "If an enterprise adopts a share-holding system,  its workers will have a strengthened sense of being the owners  of the enterprise involved, and that will enable them to do a  better job and the enterprise to prosper."    Economist Wang Jue says that the more share holders an  enterprise has, the more there are people who care about its  performance.    Xiao Guojin, professor of Wuhan University, says that an  important content of building a modern enterprise system is to  organize an enterprise in the form of a company and raise funds  by issuing shares.    Large state enterprises should be transformed into limited  liability companies, he says.    According to Wang Jue, in a typical joint-stock company,  one-third of its shares are sold to its employees, another  one-third are sold to outside investors, and still another  one-third are owned by the government, which can thus control  the company.    Today, according to official figures, there are over 11,500  enterprises in China that have adopted a corporate system.  Among them, more than 3,000 are limited liability join-stock  companies, with a total stock value of around 300 billion yuan.  These companies are distributed in 30 provinces, autonomous  regions and centrally-administered municipalities. And the  number of their share holders has reached 25 million.    Deputies stress that transformation of state enterprises  into  joint-stock companies must be carried out prudently.    According to Wang Genyuan, director of the Dezhou Textile  Mill in Shandong Province and an NPC deputy, before such  transformation, a number of problems must be sorted out. These  include: asset evaluation, ways to preserve and increase the  value of state-owned assets, and relations between the share  holders conference and the workers' congress.    He Jiezhi, an NPC deputy and chairman of the Jincheng Paper  Co. in Liaoning Province, says establishment of a corporate  system requires certain conditions, among which are existence of  a social security system, and freedom from debts and government  interference.    "If these problems are not solved, a corporate system cannot  be established," he said.    That is why, according to He Guanghui, the share-holding  system is still at an experimental stage.    "Most enterprises embracing the share-holding system will be  limited liability companies," he said. "Only a few will be  listed on stock exchanges."    At present, the government still exercises controls over the  number of listed companies and the amount of shares issued. To  date, a total of 183 companies in China have their shares  listed. And last year the government allowed five billion yuan  worth of shares to be issued, and this year only a marginal  increase is expected.    According to government policy, share issues will be limited  largely to companies in energy, transport and raw materials  sectors.    Inside sources say this year China will continue to  encourage  a number of enterprises to issue shares in Hong Kong and the  United States.</p>

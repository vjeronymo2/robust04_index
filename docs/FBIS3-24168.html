			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Juhan Kivirahk: "All Institutions of Power </F> Improved Their Standing  <H6>  Public Opinion in January </H6>   The internal political tensions of January, stemming  from the change of ministers, opened the door for changes in  approval ratings given the government and the president.  However, as one can see from the results of a survey published  in yesterday's paper, the performances of the political theater  no longer have the impact they used to have--public opinion  remained indifferent to what was happening. This is why there  were no major changes in the ratings for major institutions of  power. Instead, there was a slight gain in the ratings for all  of them--the government, the parliament, the president, and even  the opposition.    Those who are used to viewing Estonia's political landscape  as a battlefield, where positions are firmly drawn and where one  forward step by one side inevitably means a step back for the  opposition, will find it difficult to understand these results.  Indeed, a battle (of words) was being waged for all the people  to see. First, an attack was made by the president, who gave a  devastating assessment of the government's leader. Then,  virtually the entire political establishment, along with most of  the media, came down on the president himself. The board of  Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] even received a legislative  bill to protect the president, the government, the parliament  and the people...from the president.    People do not seem to sense any particular danger from the  president as they give, month after month, progressively better  ratings to the institution of president. The president's  activity is considered to be fully or basically in line with the  interests of the people by 54 percent of those queried (57  percent among Estonians, and 49 percent among non-Estonians). A  month ago, the president had a 50 percent positive approval  rating.    Quite remarkable is the sudden drop in `cannot tell'  responses for the presidential ratings by non-Estonians--in  December they amounted to 28 percent, now only 15 percent. This  also accounted for an 8 percent increase in positive, and a 5  percent increase in negative ratings.    However, the president was not the only one to improve his  ratings. January's survey ratings also went up for the  parliament and for the government. Those gains, however, were  not sufficient to offset the predominance of negative ratings.  Riigikogu's performance was rated to correspond to the interests  of the people by 40 percent of the respondents (36 percent in  December), and not corresponding by 48 percent (December 51  percent) of the respondents. For the government, the ratio of  positive to negative ratings was 35 and 53 percent respectively  (33 and 56 percent for December).    The confusion around the so-called overhaul of the  government  certainly came in handy for the opposition, whose ratings also  went up somewhat. Supporters of the opposition currently number  about the same as those of the government (32 percent, compared  to 29 percent in December), opponents are fewer (37 percent,  same in December), with the number of respondents in the 'cannot  tell' category up considerably.    Public opinion does not follow any black-or-white rules of  logic. Here are some examples taken out of today's range of  problems.    In the course of changing ministers, there was a definite  clash between the attitudes of the president and the government,  and between the president and the Isamaa [Fatherland] faction.  If we look at how the performane of the president and the  government is being rated by those observers who support the  Isamaa faction, we get above average ratings for Riigikogu (69  percent of the responses are on the positive side), the  government (64 percent), and also (and especially!) the  president (80 percent!).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To what extent does the performance of Riigikogu, government, president and  |  |opposition correspond to the interests of the people?                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |RIIGIKOGU                                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully                                 |2 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly                                |38 Percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cannot tell                           |12 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not at all                            |10 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly not                            |38 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PRESIDENT                                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully                                 |8 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly                                |46 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cannot tell                           |13 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not at all                            |9 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly not                            |24 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |GOVERNMENT                                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully                                 |3 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly                                |32 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cannot tell                           |12 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not at all                            |16 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly not                            |37 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |OPPOSITION                                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully                                 |3 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly                                |29 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cannot tell                           |32 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not at all                            |9 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mostly not                            |28 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: EMOR, January 1994            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Even out of the supporters of the Entrepreneurs' Party  which,  through its only member in the parliament is more often than not  opposed to the government, 65 percent approve the performance of  both the government and the president. For supporters of the  central and coalition factions the 'polarity' is in place, of  course, with 75 and 63 percent respectively not satisfied with  the government's performance.    The clearest positions on powers-that-be are taken by those  respondents who support the Democratic Labor Party and the  League of Pensioners--62 percent of the first, and 53 percent of  the second support neither the government nor the president (all  these examples are based on opinions held by Estonian citizens).    As usual, we also asked a separate question to establish the  most trusted institution of power. "Please compare the  performance of the parliament, with that of the president and  the opposition, and say whose performance you trust most?"  was the question. Responses to this question also show the  president taking the lead.

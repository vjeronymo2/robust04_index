			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / France bans imports of house refuse FRANCE banned imports of household waste yesterday and charged a fourth businessman in connection with hospital refuse from Germany, Reuter reports from Paris. Germany said the ban, which came into effect yesterday morning, had blocked disposal of up to 700,000 tonnes of everyday rubbish from German homes and companies. The ban was announced earlier this week after customs officers in eastern France stopped a dozen trucks from Germany carrying syringes, bloodbags and other hospital refuse concealed in ordinary household waste. The owner of a quarry where some of the refuse was dumped, Mr Georges Perreux, was held yesterday on charges of illegally importing waste which could be health and environment hazards. His son and two other businessmen face similar charges.</p>

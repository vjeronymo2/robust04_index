			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Developers move in on the Black Pearl - Nigel Andrews heads for the hills on the Adriatic coast They call it the Black Pearl of the Mediterranean. The Romans knew it as Cossyra. To the Phoenicians it was Yrum, the isle of birds. From the highest point of Pantelleria, Montagna Grande, the continents of Europe and Africa are visible 100 miles apart. To the north is Sicily; to the south Tunisia. Though the island belongs to Italy, Arabic names survive in the villages of Khamma and Bugeber. Bazaars in the main town, also called Pantelleria, sell African jewellery and clothes richly embroidered with tigers and elephants. This is not package-tour territory - not yet. Last September the EU gave Pantelleria a grant: part of an initiative to promote Mediterranean islands and create employment in tourism and service industries, for mechanisation is reducing the numbers of traditional jobs on the land. A quarter of the island's 8,000 population works on wine production. The famous one is Passito, a dessert wine similar to Sicily's Marsala. Once picked, the grapes are spread out to sunbathe for three weeks, losing half their water content (Passito means 'past it'). The result is a sweet amber-coloured wine of about 16 per cent alcohol; there are also less potent crisp dry white table wines such as Cossyra. A second important local industry is growing capperi. Capers form the base for many sauces. The piquant flavour goes well with swordfish, mussels, squid and other seafood. Pantelleria has an area of only 32 square miles. You can sail round it in a day - the best way to view the rocky coastline, sculpted by erosion in places into strange shapes. The Punta dell'Arco promontory is nicknamed dell'elefante because it resembles a huge trunk dipping into the sea. Cacti, palms and olive trees, figs and prickly pears all flourish in the sub-tropical climate. The landscape is dotted with dammusi, dwellings built by the Saracens. Arched doorways and passages reflect the lack of building timber on the island, while white-painted cupola roofs serve to collect another rare commodity, water. Older than the dammusi are the sesi: remains of neolithic tombs from 5,000 BC built of black cindery rock. The best-preserved examples are at Mursia, south of Pantelleria town. The people of Pantelleria, the panteschi, retain their own dialect: casteddru, for example, in place of the Italian castello. They concede their capital is not the most beautiful town. Thirty-three days of shelling in the second world war demolished many buildings, which were replaced with the unattractive low-rise flats common elsewhere in suburban Italy. Part of the EU grant is earmarked for improving the town's image and to make safe its centrepiece, the massive Barbacane castle. A recently-installed plaque on the castle wall reminds you that, though you are on a remote island, the politics of Sicily and the mainland are never far away. It commemorates Paolo Borsellino, the Palermo magistrate who, with his bodyguards, was assassinated by the Mafia last July. Crime is almost unknown on Pantelleria. In a small community everyone knows everyone else, and anyway escape is difficult. There is one little airport and an overnight ferry to Trapani in Sicily. The island's remoteness helps make it - for now - an upmarket destination. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has a holiday dammuso where he entertains foreign royalty. Well-off Romans and Milanese come in August, many for the cure, for the volcano of Montagna Grande still slumbers. In two dozen places steam wisps out of the rocks; a cave at Sataria is a natural sauna. The only lake, Specchio di Venere (Venus's mirror), is rich in sulphur and potassium. Bathing in it - or, better, rubbing your body with lakeside mud - is claimed to be good for the skin. Private developers, attracted by the EU's money, are preparing plans for a spa centre. Rudimentary facilities for scuba diving and wind surfing will be upgraded. A dozen lidos - there are no beaches on Pantelleria - are planned round the coast. A yacht marina is scheduled for the main port. Scauri on the south coast has a small harbour, but the weather frequently makes its use difficult (as we discovered, needing three attempts to land). Improved transport is another priority. It is hoped to introduce a hydrofoil service to Malta, 100 miles east, where the airport is already on the international map and large enough for charter traffic. For accommodation, the island's 1,000 beds will be increased by introducing agriturismo in renovated dammusi. This form of self-catering has been successful in mainland Italy and is a growth market. Will all these developments, over the next four or five years, spoil Pantelleria? Go now, and experience the uncommercialised beauty of the Black Pearl. It may all be different in a few years. Avoid August, the Italians' holiday month. January and February are wet and in late May the sirocco, a hot sticky wind from the Sahara, blows. Sea temperatures stay relatively high to December. Self-catering villas or dammusi are available from about Pounds 350 per week, sleeping four. There are only a few hotels, including The Port (inquiries: via Borgo ltalia, Pantelleria, TP, Italy, tel: 0923-911257). Half-board is around Pounds 300 per person per week.

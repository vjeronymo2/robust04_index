			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs cut back early Dow advance Wall Street AFTER posting strong early gains on short-covering by dealers, a round of late afternoon sell programs left US share prices little changed at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.09 up at 3,443.28, some 25 points below the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.49 ahead at 442.80, while the Nasdaq composite closed 1.38 firmer at 682.82. New York SE volume was 230.6m shares. The week opened with investor sentiment still subdued amid growing concern about the US economy, but there was some good news from Europe, where the existence of a fragile ceasefire in Bosnia reduced the likelihood that President Clinton would order an immediate military intervention in the region by US-led UN forces. Last week, analysts attributed some of the softness in markets to worries that US troops would soon become enmeshed in the Yugoslav civil war. Political factors aside, and in the absence of fresh economic data, the markets yesterday were primarily hostage to technical forces. At the opening, dealers bought stocks to cover recently established short positions, both in the underlying cash and futures markets. This lifted prices sharply in the first hour, and persuaded investors to join in the buying, allowing the markets to gain some momentum for the first time in a while. Airline shares rallied initially, but ended mixed after the late sell-off. AMR firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 67 7/8 , but UAL lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 134 and Delta Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56. USAir was unchanged at Dollars 21 1/2 . There was a similar pattern to trading in drug issues, which firmed early on but ran into selling later. Johnson &amp; Johnson was finally Dollars  5/8 up at Dollars 43 7/8 . Eastman Kodak improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 50 3/4 after two broking houses, Merrill Lynch and Wertheim Schroder, raised their ratings on the stock, apparently in anticipation that the company will soon announce the sale of an asset. Some cyclical stocks were in demand, notably Caterpillar, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 69 7/8 , General Motors, Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 40 3/4 , and RJR Nabisco, Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars 5 7/8 . Philip Morris, which rallied last week on news that a rival tobacco manufacturer was discontinuing price cuts on its discount brands, made further strides, finishing Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 52 3/4 in volume of 6.9m shares. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 89 1/8 after brokerage firm Alex Brown made positive comments on the company. Canada LOSSES IN heavily weighted Northern Telecom and several forestry firms offset an advance by gold shares and left the Toronto market little changed. Overall activity was moderate. The TSE 300 index was off 0.5 at 3,778.5, while declines narrowly led rises by 341 to 320 after volume of 53.8m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices lost ground, led by industrial products, off 1.1 per cent. The gold shares index climbed 1.5 per cent, while conglomerates rose 1.2 per cent. Traders said talk that analysts are downward revising Nortel's second-quarter earnings estimates hurt the stock, which fell CDollars 1 7/8 to CDollars 43 5/8 .</p>

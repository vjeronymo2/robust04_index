			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): Vehicles for insurance or a gamble - Derivatives TRAVEL TO the Cannonbridge building, near Cannon Street station, in London, and you witness the bizarre sight of dozens of young men and women in brightly coloured jackets, gesticulating as wildly as bookies at a racecourse. They are participating in one of the most arcane corners of the financial service industry - the derivatives market. Derivatives is the name given to the 'risk management' family of financial instruments, such as futures and options. These instruments have two functions - as a means for investors to insure the value of their holdings, and as a vehicle for speculation. Futures involve a commitment to buy or sell a commodity at a future date. The market grew out of the sharp fluctuations in commodity prices which can ruin many a farmer or manufacturer. In the 1970s, the techniques that had been applied to commodity futures trading were translated to the financial markets. Suppose a fund manager owned a large portfolio of US stocks and was worried that the US stock market was about to fall, but could not sell his portfolio without moving prices substantially against him. The existence of stock index futures, which will move roughly in line with the underlying market, gives him an alternative. He can sell the stock index future and benefit from any fall in the value of the market. Similarly, if he thought the market was about to rise, he could buy the future. What makes this doubly attractive is that he does not have to put up the full value of the contract, but a small proportion, known as the margin. The margin system also offers scope to the speculator. If one can purchase, say, a Pounds 100,000 contract with margin of only Pounds 6,000, then a 6 per cent increase in the value of the contract would represent a 100 per cent profit on the investment. The risk is that a small fall in the value of the contract would wipe out the original investment. Private investors rarely take a direct involvement in the futures market, but there is plenty of scope for them to buy and sell options. Options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy and sell a given commodity at a given price over a given time. In return for this right, the purchaser pays a fee, known as a premium. A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy a commodity at a given price within a set period; a put option gives him the right to sell. The most practical use of options for a private investor is in the stock market. Take the insurance aspect first. An investor with a holding in, say, ICI, might be worried about a short-term fall in the price, but not want to sell the shares. In late January, he could have bought a put option, giving him the right to sell shares in April at the 'strike price' of 1250p. This would have cost him 54.5p. If, by late March, the shares have fallen to 1000p, then the shareholder has two courses of action. The option will have increased in value - to at least 250p - so the shareholder can sell the option and retain the shares. The profit on the option will offset the loss on the shares. Alternatively, the shareholder can exercise the option and sell the shares. He has saved himself from a large chunk of the fall in ICI's share price. Options also offer a speculative side. The premium is just a fraction of the share price. Those who are convinced that a share is going to move sharply will have the greatest profits if they buy an option. The April 1250p call price of ICI at the end of January was 48.5p. Someone gambling on a bid for the company at, say, 1500p would have a chance of quintupling his money by buying the option. If he bought the shares, his profit potential would be merely 20 per cent. The flipside of the higher reward is higher risk. If a bid did not occur, the speculator might find that the option expired worthless; whereas if he had bought the shares directly, he might break even. Options are therefore best used by sophisticated investors who understand the risks. This is particularly true of those who plan to sell (write in the jargon) options to others. If you sell a put option without owning the shares involved, your risks are enormous. Say you sold a put option which gave someone the right to sell you 10,000 shares at 100p, in return for a premium of 6p per share or Pounds 600. If the shares collapsed to 5p, the optionholder would exercise his option, and you would have to pay him Pounds 10,000 for shares worth Pounds 500 in the market, a loss of Pounds 9,500. Those who find futures and options exciting, but too complicated to get involved in directly, can now buy special unit trusts called futures and option funds (Fofs). These have caused some controversy in the unit trust industry, because of the fear that a spectacular collapse might tarnish the name of the sector. As a result, by end January, only Legal &amp; General and John Govett had entered the field. Such funds need not necessarily be excessively risky - much will depend on how conservatively they are run. But investors may be tempted to hold back until they see a performance record established.</p>

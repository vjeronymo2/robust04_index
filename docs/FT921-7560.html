			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Money supply figures show no sign of upturn THE PICTURE of an economy stuck in recession was underlined yesterday with news of weak figures for the growth of money in circulation. The Bank of England said narrow money or M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins and indicates underlying demand pressures, grew 2.2 per cent in the 12 months to January on a seasonally adjusted basis. This was the smallest year-on-year growth figure for M0 since August and followed an increase of 2.8 per cent in the 12 months to December. The figure was 2.9 per cent in November. M0 fell 0.2 per cent bet-ween December and January. That ended a run of four months in which the month-on-month M0 figures showed a small rise. M0 is among the main economic indicators tracked by the Treasury, which said the latest figures showed inflationary pressures were weak and gave no concrete signs of any upturn. Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the M0 data indicated 'a flat economy'. Broad money or M4 - notes and coins, and sterling deposits at banks and building societies - grew 6.2 per cent in the 12 months to January, the same as in December. In November the figure was 5.6 per cent. M4 grew 0.4 per cent between December and January. Bank and building society lending in sterling rose Pounds 3.4bn last month. City economists had predicted Pounds 2bn. The rise is not thought to indicate any underlying increase in demand for credit. Much of the increase is believed to have been due to short-term bank loans taken on by companies to finance payments of corporation tax. The British Bankers Association, which represents nine big high street banks, said their lending increased by just Pounds 400m in January. It added that demand for borrowing by consumers and industry 'remained weak'.</p>

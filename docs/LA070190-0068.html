			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** MANO NEGRA, "PUTA'S FEVER," VIRGIN.: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This Parisian octet's debut album includes songs in English, French, Spanish  and Arabic, and sports a rough-edged, sprawling approach reminiscent of the  Clash's "Sandinista" album. There's a gospel/metal rap about a dead Rasta, a Bo  Diddley-knows-rockabilly exercise, pure salsa, loopy carnival music. . . . The  genre-hopping means "Puta's Fever" suffers from an occasional loss of focus,  but when drummer Santiago Casariego kicks into overdrive, a rowdy verve  pervades the music. DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

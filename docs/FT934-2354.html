			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Fisons offers to buy back or exchange outstanding issue Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company which yesterday announced a radical restructuring plan, sought to protect investor confidence by offering to buy back its outstanding bonds or exchange them for new bonds with a shorter maturity. In October, Fisons made its first public bond offering since 1986 when it raised Pounds 100m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds with a coupon of 8 per cent. At the launch, the bonds were priced to yield 120 basis points over the 8 per cent UK government bond (gilt) due 2003. At the time, the yield spread was judged to be fair in view of the company's lack of a long-term credit rating and its poor equity performance. However, the bonds did not perform well in the secondary market and their yield spread over gilts widened gradually. By last Friday, the bonds were yielding 145 basis points over 10-year gilts. JP Morgan, which lead-managed the deal for Fisons, said that holders of the bonds could sell them outright at Friday's closing level or exchange them for a new offering of five-year bonds with a coupon of around 7.5 per cent on a one-for-one basis. The new bonds will be priced to yield around 150 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due 1999 on the first day of the exchange period, which is expected to take place in the new year and last for four business days. 'Fisons is concerned about its standing with the public investor base and as a result is taking responsible action in order to ensure an orderly market,' a JP Morgan official said. Fisons's market stabilisation operation appeared to have been successful yesterday. Although JP Morgan said it had bought back some bonds, there no reports of panic selling and the spread on the bonds remained at 145 basis points. Syndicate managers said that most investors appeared to be waiting for the dust to settle before deciding whether to sell their bonds or exchange them for the shorter maturity. The news of the restructuring prompted Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the international rating agencies, to place Fisons' commercial paper ratings, of A-1 and Prime-1 respectively, under review for a possible downgrade. Elsewhere, the Australian subsidiary of Toronto Dominion Bank raised CDollars 100m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The proceeds were thought to have been swapped into Australian dollars. An official at lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said that the issue would inject fresh liquidity into the five-year area of the Euro-Canadian dollar sector which currently appeals to retail investors in the Benelux region. The bonds were priced to yield 42 basis points over the new five-year Canadian Treasury benchmark and when they were freed to trade the spread remained unchanged.</p>

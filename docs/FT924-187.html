			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Unit trust funds up to record Pounds 61.95bn UNIT TRUST funds under management rose to a record Pounds 61.95bn in November, the Unit Trust Association says today, John Authers writes. The Pounds 258m net inflow was the highest since September 1991, and may have been boosted by savers transferring out of building societies following last month's cut in the base rate to 7 per cent. The Building Societies Association saw a net outflow of Pounds 184m for the same month. Cash and fixed-interest unit trusts attracted a gross Pounds 820m.</p>

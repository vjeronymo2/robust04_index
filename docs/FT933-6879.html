			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Observer: Word from the grave No surprise that a debate is under way about the future of French monetary policy in the wake of the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism. But it comes as a shock to learn that it is being led by an ex-King of France, who has not been heard of for nearly 1,500 years, and Galileo, the Italian sunspots expert. Clovis, the first King of France, is the pseudonym of a writer advocating the surrender of the Balladur government's strong franc policy. Writing last week in Liberation, the French daily, he condemned the 'Ayatollahs of the Franc fort' and the 'theologians of the Bank of France' and urged more expansionary economic measures. Galileo has a similar view on post-ERM policies. Expounding his views in the Revue des Deux Mondes, he writes of the 'tragedy of the strong franc' and blames Balladur and his advisers for the unnecessary pain of their rigid anti-inflationary policies. However, help is at hand for the embattled government in the form of one Jean-Claude le Franc. He has argued in the pages of Le Monde for continued adherence to policies which have reduced French inflation to just 2 per cent and raised industrial productivity above most of France's competitors. Calling on the services of the imaginary and the dead reflects the sensitivity of the subject among France's officials, politicians and bankers. But it also reflects a state of shock in the government as it tries to come to terms with the upheavals in the ERM. The real problem for Balladur will come when the civil servants and bankers who are behind the articles drop their disguises and the debate breaks out of the press. Like Galileo, the government may then be forced to change its views on the way the world works.</p>

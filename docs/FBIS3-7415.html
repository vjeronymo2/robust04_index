			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [AFP/YONHAP from Beijing] </F>   [Text] On 25 March, one day before President Kim Yong-sam's  China visit to seek China's active role in resolving the North  Korean nuclear issue, nuclear experts in Beijing said North  Korea is moving its nuclear facilities under suspicion through  connecting underground passages to other places in Pyongyang.    Meanwhile, Beijing sources anticipate that, although  President Kim will try to induce China to play an active role in  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue during his five-day  visit to China by using the ROK's economic strength, China will  not immediately change its position on the issue.</p>

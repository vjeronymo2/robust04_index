A letter from  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council  obtained by AFP said he had ordered his special envoy Yasushi  Akashi to draft contingency plans for the besieged cities of  Tuzla and Srebrenica.    "It was clear that other military assets would also be  required, as the use of air power, or the threat of its use,  could not alone achieve the desired objectives," Butrus-Ghali  said in the letter. "I have instructed Mr. Akashi to prepare  forthwith detailed plans for military operations, with the use  of air power as required" to reopen the airport in Tuzla and  ensure a Canadian troop contingent in Srebrenica can be relieved.    However in the same letter, Butrus-Ghali said he had  received  a letter from Russia which repeated its position that no  military action be taken in the former Yugoslavia without  consultations with the Security Council. Russia as a permenant  member of the Security Council has the right of veto.    Akashi said in a report to the secretary general that use of  air power -- as suggested at last week's NATO conference --  would be inadequate if not accompanied by a stronger presence on  the ground.    UN officials in Geneva said the Bosnian Serbs had already  agreed to the replacement of some 180 Canadian troops stranded  for six months in Srebrenica, making military action  unnecessary. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by  the Yugoslav TANJUG news agency, said his self-styled parliament  had decided the Dutch could take the Canadians' place "as of  tomorrow" provided they were "the same number and with the same  weapons."    But Therese Gastaut, spokeswoman for Butrus-Ghali, said the  rotation would not take place before the second half of  February. There was no immediate explanation for the delay.    In refusing to allow the reopening of Tuzla Airport, closed  since May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills,  Karadzic said the facility "would only be used to rearm the  Moslems." Karadzic said all of Bosnia's airports should be  reopened "but in no case before signing a peace treaty."</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (6): Just a little Letzebuergesch as she is spoke - Jul Christophory gets to grips with the Grand Duchy's local lingo LETZEBUERGESCH is the language of everyday communication of Luxembourgers with each other. Foreign observers have always been at a loss to pigeon-hole the one language really spoken in Luxembourg by native Luxembourgers. At first sight, the country's linguistic situation seems to be a curious cocktail of three idioms mixed with a large foreign population - and influenced by the pragmatism of its inhabitants, much to the confusion of many Luxembourgers themselves. Nowadays, when 'Jos', 'Pit' or 'Mich' dials a number, he (or she) will first inquire whether the person on the other end of the line speaks Letzebuergesch or not. Half the time, he/she will not - nearly half of the working population is foreign. In Parliament, official announcements are made in French but most of the debates are held in Letzebuergesch. Parliamentary documents and draft laws, as well as their published texts, are also in French. If they are destined for a wider public circulation, they are translated into German (and increasingly, into Portuguese). Most newspapers are written in German, with some French articles, mainly in the arts section. Government offices use French as far as possible, but are supposed to answer letters in the language of the inquirer, be it German, French or Letzebuergesch. In church, German is the primary language. In the courts, French is the dominant language. (Lawyers who plead in Letzebuergesch are still considered mavericks.) In primary schools and in the junior classes of the lycees, German tends to be the language of instruction - only to be replaced by French as the language of instruction for middle school and senior classes. Letzebuergesch will not normally be used for teaching purposes, but teachers use it for informal conversation - and pupils are always reprimanded in Letzebuergesch. Nobody would ever speak French or German in public unless addressing a foreign guest. However, in many a high street, when ordering a beer in a bar or inquiring in a shop, you may wish to speak French because nowadays most staff come from France, Belgium or Portugal. This seemingly intractable state of affairs is deeply rooted in history. Up to 1839 the Duchy's territory was situated on the dividing line of the Germanic and Roman languages; it consisted of two geographical parts: one French and one Germanic (that is, Letzebuergesch) speaking region. When the French-speaking region was incorporated into neighbouring Belgium in 1839, and Luxembourg was reduced to its present size, bilingualism still prevailed - with a strong preference for French, especially among the educated elites. Letzebuergesch remained the language of everyday communication. German (as in Switzerland) was the written expression of a dialect rooted in peasant culture. Increasingly, though, Luxembourgers now consider Letzebuergesch to have achieved the status of a language per se. For Letzebuergesch is alive and well, spoken by almost 100 per cent of the native population. Novels and poetry are written in it;, films are shot in it; Asterix and Tintin - beloved heroes of children's stories - are translated into it; local radio broadcasting is thriving in it. Since last year there has been a one-hour daily news bulletin in Letzebuergesch on television. In a rapidly evolving Europe, Letzebuergesch has become Luxembourg's one real symbol of national identity. This stems from the the second world war. A plebiscite was forced upon the country by the occupying forces; the Nazis implied that, in answer to the question asking which language was spoken, Luxembourgers should specify German. When it became clear that a whispering campaign was spreading the word that everyone should specify 'Letzebuergesch', the Germans called off their plebiscite. Since that time - as a reflection of its weariness about being bullied around by foreign powers - Letzebuergesch has come to personify the Luxembourg spirit. What, then, is Letzebuergesch like? For linguists it is the western-most branch of Moselle Franconian (Moselfrankisch): it originated with the invasion of the Rhenish and North Sea Franks who began to settle around the river Moselle during the 3rd century AD. In layman's terms, this means that its consonants are roughly halfway between High German and Dutch. Its vowels are something else altogether. And there are syntactical particularities. To regard Letzebuergesch simply as a predominantly Germanic dialect, however, is to tell only half the story. Even in its heyday - in the 15th century, when a Luxembourger sat on the throne of the Holy Roman Empire - the lands of the Dukes of Luxembourg contained more French than German speakers. Luxembourg has therefore always looked westwards, and this is reflected in its vocabulary ('d'fotell': le fauteuil in French: armchair), and in an enormous number of verbs ending in '-eieren' (for example: 'proposeieren'), devised whenever Luxembourgers need a new word and do not want to look to Germany to find it. For most Luxembourgers, German is as much a foreign language as French. Thanks to its position as the language of a sovereign state, Letzebuergesch has managed to avoid the decline suffered by other 'little' languages of Europe. By a law of 1984, it has officially become Luxembourg's national language. (An 'official' spelling had already been introduced in 1975 - but most Luxembourgers do not really care; they go on writing phonetically. Foreign residents in Luxembourg know how important it is to know the language - be it only to catch bits of local gossip at the village stores. Language courses are thriving. As a result of the sorry state of Luxembourg demographics, there may be fewer Luxembourgers, but there is an ever-increasing number of Letzebuergesch speakers. An important political party has even considered whether Letzebuergesch should be elevated to the status of official language for the European Community - with the proviso that Luxembourg itself would refrain from insisting that it be used as a working language. But who knows? Jul Christophory is head of Luxembourg's National Library</p>

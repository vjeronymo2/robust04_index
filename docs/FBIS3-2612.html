An advertisement seeking a general manager for a commercial  center was published in January in Nanjing, capital of east  China's Jiangsu Province -- offering a record annual salary of  150,000 yuan (about 17,240 U.S. dollars).    This medium-sized business had suffered losses for 14  consecutive years of its 15-year life, with 13 managers coming  and going.    The position finally went to Zhuang Zongping, former deputy  manager of the city's Gulou Department Store, after an open  selection contest held by relevant authorities.    Experts described the move as a great change from the usual  practice of officials being appointed by higher authorities.    Bai Meilin, director of the city's Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, said that a new leadership system is  important for a smooth shift to the modern enterprise system.    Jiang Yu, a general manager of the Xinjiekou Department  Store, said that advertising for talent with high pay is an  effective way to get qualified persons for posts which they want.    At his inauguration ceremony, Zhuang handed in a risk pledge  of 16,000 yuan to the parent company, which won't be refunded if  the center fails to produce an annual profit of 1.6 million yuan  under his administration.    According to the contract, he has decision-making power in  areas such as employment, direction-setting, personnel  assignment and resources distribution.    Zhuang, aged 43, was considered daring in the city's  business  circles, as he had made the sales volume of the Gulou Department  store jump from 30 million yuan to 250 million yuan within three  years.    This time, with his good business sense and his practical  and  bold plan, he defeated six rivals, who were selected from quite  a few officials, private bosses and agents for foreign companies.    His measures to invigorate the center include improving the  shopping environment, restructuring commodities, distinguishing  its promotions from neighboring stores and strengthening its  internal management.    Qian Hao, general manager of the Gulou Department Store,  said  the store will not be affected by Zhuang's leaving, because it  has a group of experienced personnel and a healthy management  system.    Relevant leading officials pledged that Zhuang will be given  full power to enforce his program on his new post.    Now Zhuang is setting about renovating the center, which  will  reopen on April 8.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "F-16s Are Totally Capable of </F> Intervening in Bosnia, Air Force Says"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 17 Feb (BELGA) -- On Thursday [17  February] the Air Force "relativized" the "weaknesses"  attributed by the media to its F-16 fighter aircraft, and  affirmed that its planes and pilots were totally capable of  participating in operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside the  allied countries, if the government decided to send it on  missions in the former Yugoslavia.    Thanks to their advanced on-board systems, Belgian F-16's  were able to carry out precise aerial bombardments against  traditional targets, the Air Force staff said in a statement.    The current absence of electronic countermeasures (ECM) --  until the delivery of the first systems, which will take place  at the start of next year -- could also be overcome, the Air  Force explained: Either by having recourse to electronic  warplanes owned by other countries, or by "borrowing" or  "renting" certain items of ECM equipment from other NATO  partners, thanks to a mutual support procedure.    The use of ECM pods does not require specific training for  pilots, the Air Force staff said.    As for the ability to carry out precise bomb attacks on  targets -- such as the artillery pieces surrounding Sarajevo --  the Air Force stressed that its F-16's were already able to  carry out precise air attacks against traditional targets.    In order to carry out so-called surgical attacks on very  small targets and limit damage to the surrounding area to a  strict minimum, it would be necessary to use guiding weapons and  systems which were not yet available to the Air Force, the  statement added. It nevertheless noted that Belgian pilots could  very soon start to be trained in using this type of weapon,  thanks to the purchase of AGM-65 "Maverick" air-to-ground  infrared missiles, which the government approved last year.    While waiting for these missiles, Belgian F-16's could carry  out precision attacks using laser-guided bombs, by modifying the  current bombs using a "relatively cheap" guiding kit. However,  another (allied) plane or ground troops would have to  "illuminate" the target with a laser beam, the Air Force noted.  Training in this technique could be done in a short period of  one to two weeks, according to the Air Force.    The Air Force said that therefore it was "totally capable of  and qualified to" participate in integrated operations in the  former Yugoslavia, and "will do so if the political authorities  so decide," the statement continued.    The Air Force staff noted, however, that it would be "useful  to acquire some additional equipment" through the mutual support  procedures while waiting for the command systems to be  delivered, in order to "reduce risks" and "increase the  efficiency" (of its planes).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Eight political parties  and organizations of Pakistan including the National Party, the  People's Democratic Party and the Pakistan organization for  Afro-Asian people's solidarity issued a joint statement on April  24 supporting the April 20 memorandum of the Foreign Ministry of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that clarified the  main obstacle to the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula and its background.    The statement sharply condemned the United States and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for demanding a total  inspection of the DPRK in a sinister attempt to stamp out its  political system, ignoring the special position of the DPRK that  suspended temporarily the effectuation of its withdrawal from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).    "We are convinced that the DPRK Government is showing  fidelity with regard to the nuclear policy and highly estimate  the DPRK Government for sincerely implementing the DPRK-U.S.  agreement and pushing ahead with nuclear development under the  strict surveillance of the IAEA.    "We castigate the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security  Council for openly applying the double-standard to the nuclear  issue under the baton of the United States," the statement said,  and stressed: "We warmly hail the declaration of the great  leader President Kim Il-song that the DPRK neither has nuclear  weapons nor needs to manufacture them."</p>

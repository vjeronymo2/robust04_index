			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (12): An awesome task lies ahead - Eastern Europe / There is a realisation that the economies of these countries are fragmenting faster than their political arrangements THE original assumption that the 420m people living in that vast area between the Elbe and the Pacific Ocean constituted the last megamarket has given way to a sense of awe at the complexity of the task ahead, and sober realisation that the economies of most of these countries are fragmenting even faster than their political arrangements. In 1991, direct private investment in eastern Europe was no more than Dollars 3bn and just over half of that flowed into Hungary, which has emerged as the tip of the eastern ice-breaker. Clearly, investment on this scale is not sufficient to have any discernible effect on the FT500. But in the longer run some of the European companies now taking the plunge, or at least dipping their toes, in this extraordinarily complex area have made strategic choices which will ultimately strengthen their role as global players. It is too early at this stage to spot eastern European companies which might emerge after privatisation as future members in their own right of the FT500, although the most likely candidates could be the new, vertically integrated, oil and chemical companies which are supposed to emerge in Russia with the abolition of the old ministerial monopoly structures. It is also conceivable that some of the Soviet megafactories, such as the Kamaz truck plant in Tartaria, could find their way into the FT500 as they forge links with western companies willing to trade injections of capital and know-how for ready-made access to the Russian and post-Soviet republican markets. But the speed with which this huge area spawns new private companies is dependent upon an infinite number of unpredictable political and other variables. One crucial variable is the rate of progress towards the privatisation of state-owned companies. Here, as in so many other areas, the frontrunners are the three central European countries of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia which became associate members of the European Community in December. But even among the frontrunners, as Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pointed out recently, the slow pace of foreign investment is directly linked to the slow pace at which privatisation of large companies is taking place. This, in turn, is a result of the enormous legal and organisational problems involved in establishing clear ownership rights. Other problem areas include the accounting, evaluation and actuarial difficulties involved in establishing the value of assets. Sorting out these problems has provided a huge growth area for western accountants, bankers, and other professional firms who are the busy foot soldiers in the gigantic enterprise of changing the management culture from that of the former command economy. Meanwhile, a few areas have emerged where leading European companies are making the strategic investments designed to bolster their global position. The targeted industries include the automotive industry, telecommunications, power generation equipment, chemicals, anti-pollution equipment, construction materials - especially glass and cement - and pharmaceuticals. The biggest single investment has been connected with Volkswagen's purchase of a 70 per cent stake in the Czech automobile company, Skoda, and its much smaller investment in the small Bratislava-based BAZ plant in Slovakia. However, only a relatively small portion of the nearly Dollars 7bn to be invested in making a new VW-Skoda model and upgrading the business will come from VW directly, as the bulk will be raised from local and foreign banks. Volkswagen's decision to invest in a new, low labour cost production centre was part of its Europe-wide competition with Fiat for number one slot in the European car market. Fiat, with its long-standing involvement in the Polish and Soviet motor industries, took a similar decision to invest Dollars 1.36bn in Poland, buying a 51 per cent stake in the FSM company in which Fiat has invested heavily to produce the new Cinquecento model for Europe-wide sale. Fiat has also been involved in negotiations for a stake in Autovaz, the largest Soviet car maker, which has been producing Fiat models at Togliatti for more than two decades. But it is in the electrical engineering field that some of the canniest manoeuvring has taken place as Siemens of Germany, the Swiss-Swedish ABB, GEC Alsthom, the UK-French group, and others have focused on a sector with perhaps the greatest growth potential in coming decades. In November, Siemens emerged as the victor from a year-long competition with ABB and Westinghouse for a wide-ranging co-operation deal with Skoda Pilsen, Czechoslovakia's heavy nuclear and conventional engineering company. ABB, which has taken over a clutch of companies employing more than 10,000 people, has specialised in investments involving relatively small amounts of capital but large injections of management know-how linked to large-scale re-training of local staff up to the general levels of competence of the rest of the group. Meanwhile, recognition that average real incomes in the region are likely to decline further has influenced the investment plans of other consumer sectors. Most investments have been small-scale, cautious and altogether insufficient to have a significant effect on any European company's relative standing in the FT500. But they reflect the fact that the past two years have seen emergence of a growing market for western consumer products as wages and incomes have started to diverge significantly after decades of egalitarianism which kept overall wages low and wage differentials small. The growing class of new-rich traders, entrepreneurs and professional people are demanding high-class imported products, and even ordinary people are making sacrifices to acquire the individual high-quality item. The hunger for a wide range of branded consumer goods, demonstrated most vividly in the display of imported goods at newly-privatised retail outlets and markets in Poland and Hungary, has attracted investment in areas such as processed foods and detergents where the multinationals have been busy seeking local partners to form a basis for expansion.</p>

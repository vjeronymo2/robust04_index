			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Japan's trade surplus heads for record JAPAN'S TRADE surplus for June rose 24 per cent over a year earlier to Dollars 8.97bn (Pounds 4.7bn), bringing the surplus for the first six months to Dollars 49bn, the largest recorded for any half-year period. With the surplus on target to surpass the record annual figure of Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) will announce a new import promotion campaign later this week. The campaign is a response to criticism from the US and EC about sluggish Japanese imports. The trend was clearly shown in the first half, when exports rose 8.6 per cent and imports fell 3.3 per cent, leaving a surplus larger than the Dollars 48.5bn recorded in the second half of 1986. In June, imports were 5.1 per cent higher than a year earlier at Dollars 19.12bn, while exports rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars 28.09bn, reflecting the desire of Japanese companies to increase foreign sales to compensate for lower ones in a slowing domestic economy. The new import promotion campaign will have little immediate influence on the surplus, as it is designed to encourage foreign investment in Japan and increase imports by setting up provincial trade zones. But Tokyo hopes the surplus has peaked, and pointed to an easing of the seasonally adjusted surplus from Dollars 9.7bn in May to Dollars 7.9bn last month. Seasonally adjusted exports rose 4 per cent on May, with imports 16 per cent higher. Mr Russell Jones, senior economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the surplus would remain large for the next 18 months or so, prompting an intensification of international presure on Japan to stimulate a weak economy. 'The key to the Japanese surplus is domestic demand. In recent years we have seen the yen's adjustment has only had a marginal effect on the surplus. At the moment, Japanese companies are turning to export markets.' The import figure in June was bolstered by a 22.8 per cent increase in textile imports and a 16.3 per cent rise in foodstuffs, but these increases highlighted the continuing importance of primary or partly processed products in Japan's import mix. The most significant increase in exports were of transport machinery (up 16.4 per cent) and ordinary machinery (up 14.1 per cent). Japan's car makers have increased exports to soak up excess domestic production lines' excess capacity. During the month, exports to the US rose 7.5 per cent on a year earlier to Dollars 7.6bn, while imports from the US edged 0.8 per cent higher at Dollars 4.44bn. Exports to the EC were up 10 per cent at Dollars 5.2bn; imports from the EC were 8.3 per cent higher at Dollars 2.6bn. Trade continued to expand rapidly with south-east Asian countries, while the most notable leap was in bilateral trade with China. Imports from China in June rose 33.1 per cent, while exports to China were 31.8 per cent higher than in the same month last year.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology: Uniformity on the high seas - Cost-conscious oil companies are moving from bespoke platforms to standard designs North Sea oil and gas production platforms, some of the biggest and most expensive structures ever built, are rarely thought of as architectural jewels. Yet each is custom-designed and built to a bespoke set of specifications, detailing everything from steel strength to the exact power output for the gas turbines that provide enough electricity to supply whole towns. In an age of standardisation they are the industrial equivalents of racing cars, with the focus on performance and little thought given to cost. Their designers have pushed technology to suit the harsh operating environment; which is why the basic above-sea structure of North Sea platforms can cost four times that of similar ones in the Gulf of Mexico, while materials and equipment can cost 70 per cent more. The need for massive amounts of documentation to accompany individual designs and excessive technical requirements results in a 25 per cent cost penalty, say industry experts. The high cost of customisation, however, has been of secondary importance to arriving at the most perfect technical solution to the twin priorities of withstanding the rigours of the North Sea for up to 20 years and efficiently draining individual oil fields. But the era of spending more than Pounds 1.5bn on individual North Sea platforms may soon be over. The prospect of finding more of the very large fields which could justify such investments is fading. Tax changes earlier this year removed the fiscal incentive to maximise production through customisation. In addition, the outlook is for oil prices to remain relatively low for some years, while cost-cutting is seen as the key to the future profitability of big oil companies. But a shift away from tailor-made technological solutions to standardisation will not be easy. 'There is a cultural, historical prejudice' against standardisation in the industry, according to Rex Gaisford, director of projects at Amerada Hess, the US-based company which accounts for about a tenth of UK North Sea production. Just how strong that prejudice remains is being tested this week as the Crine Committee, an industry-wide study group under the aegis of the UK Offshore Operators Association (Ukooa), unveiled its proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the way in which big offshore engineering projects are undertaken. Ukooa, whose 36 member companies participated in the 'cost reduction in the new era', or Crine initiative, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in capital costs could be made within two to three years if the basic proposals were implemented. Such cost reductions, however, can only be realised if changes are made in the relationship between the oil companies and their main engineering contractors. Given that in each of the last 20 years the offshore oil and gas industry accounted for as much as a quarter of the total capital investment in UK producing industries, the impact of the Crine initiative could be felt across the industrial sector. The main proposals centre around a series of codes, practices and specifications for machinery. Gaisford, who headed one of the main Crine committees, hopes that agreement on them will give suppliers the confidence to develop standard North Sea products, rather than wait for the 'mountain of paper' which currently accompanies the order for a new bespoke platform. Simplification of contract language and the elimination of 'adversarial clauses' would give contractors more confidence that operators 'would not just stand back and throw rocks at them if they get it wrong', according to Gaisford. He also believes that such an approach would lead to greater technological innovation in the offshore industry. 'Standardisation in other industries, like car manufacturing, has led suppliers to invest in the most promising technology,' he says. In addition, 'new technology would come in on a far more rational basis' than the almost haphazard way in which it is currently introduced. Safety, too, would be enhanced by a move towards standardisation, because reliability would improve. 'It's the same as if you designed and built your own car to meet your family's specific needs,' says Gaisford. 'It's bound to be less reliable' than a standard product. Amerada Hess' Scott platform, which is in its final assembly phase 130 miles off Aberdeen, may be one of the last of the big North Sea platforms built under the prevailing design philosophy. The large reservoir dictated a big platform, although Amerada was keen to try out new concepts which may point to future standard practices. Seven sub-sea wells were drilled to ensure that oil and revenues could flow as soon as Scott was commissioned. The platform was built on a 'fast track', with individual production modules weighing up to 10,000 tons assembled and commissioned on shore to save time and money. They were then lifted into place by giant crane barges. Such techniques are increasingly common in the cost-conscious industry. But Amerada Hess' request for three off-the-shelf power generation turbines suitable for North Sea operations caught European Gas Turbines, a GEC subsidy, by surprise. It is, however, introducing a North Sea package, built around a standard product to which options can be attached, a development which the Crine initiative would encourage. But would implementation of Crine recommendations lead to a radically different way of approaching a similar project in the future? Gaisford says that a combination of Crine measures and other innovations could cut by half the size of a Scott-type of platform built 10 years from now. Ships capable of drilling, producing and storing oil, while maintaining precise positions through satellite navigation and a series of computer-controlled propellers along the hull are only now making their appearance in the North Sea. But their presence in greater numbers will allow the removal of the large drilling units now located on platforms such as Scott. For some of the smaller fields it may even be possible to order a standard platform and equipment package. The big task is not technical, according to Gaisford. 'Crine represents a huge cultural change. Some people and companies will be left behind.' Changing the attitude of oil industry engineers could prove to have much in common with stopping a fully-laden supertanker travelling at speed. It takes a little thought and a lot of time.</p>

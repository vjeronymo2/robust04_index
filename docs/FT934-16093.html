			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Names back corporate membership the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - is to recommend its members vote in favour of the market's plans to admit corporate members at an extraordinary general meeting later this month. The decision of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents up to 9,000 Names, will boost confidence at the market where there are hopes that as much as Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will back Lloyd's syndicates next year. However Lloyd's still faces potential opposition from a second group representing Names involved in legal action. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party said he would reserve judgment until 18 October, two days before the EGM. Mr Neil Shaw, the association chairman, said its committee had studied an independent report which showed Names would not be disadvantaged by the entry of new corporate investors. The association and the working party commissioned the report. It is understood the advisers, who have not been named, are a leading firm of actuarial consultants. 'In their overall opinion the proposals will be beneficial to Lloyd's and all of its members and may even be necessary for the future prosperity of the society,' said the association. Mr Shaw said it was 'satisfied' with assurances given by Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, that Names will be able to maintain their market involvement at 1993 levels. Although Names have been hard-hit by losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the last five years, many are now anxious to continue trading in view of insurance rate rises and improved prospects for profits. Lloyd's is aiming to make an out-of-court offer to Names taking legal action to recover losses before the end of the year. The association said they had been told by Mr Middleton that if a settlement is reached, arrangements will be made for them to resume underwriting. The association has also advised its members not to delegate responsibility for voting at the EGM but the working party wants proxy votes to allow it to press for better settlement terms.</p>

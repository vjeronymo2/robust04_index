			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOT CHANGING STYLE, BANNED DRIVER SAYS  </P> <P> emotional Ayrton Senna vowed today that a six-month ban hanging over his head  would not affect his driving style in Sunday's Australian Grand Prix.  </P> <P> Senna, who appeared close to tears a number of times during a press conference  today, was responding to the $100,000 fine and six-month suspension handed up  by the International Automobile Federation on Tuesday. The federation said  Senna had endangered other drivers on several occasions this season but  withheld implementation of the suspension for six months. The panel also upheld  Senna's disqualification from the Japanese Grand Prix on Oct. 22.  </P> <P> Senna, 29, said he will not moderate his aggression. "I'll drive the way I have  driven all my career," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: GLENDORA;  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER APPOINTED  </P> <P> Art Cook, who has served as interim city manager since the Aug. 31 resignation  of James Evans, has been appointed to the post permanently, Mayor Lois Shade  has announced.  </P> <P> Cook was chosen last week from among 56 applicants who responded to a  nationwide search for a successor to Evans, City Clerk Culver Heaton said.  Applications were screened by a committee of three area city managers, and the  City Council interviewed four applicants from among those rated highly by the  committee, Heaton said.  </P> <P> However, Cook's appointment was not unanimous. Councilman David S. Bodley said  he and Shade voted for the hiring of another applicant, whom he refused to  name.  </P> <P> "I believe there were other individuals whom we interviewed who had better  qualifications for the position than Mr. Cook, and that's why I cast my vote  for another applicant," Bodley said. "But both Lois and I have made it clear  that we are going to work with the new city manager. It is our intent to  provide support on the council."  </P> <P> Cook is a career Glendora city employee, beginning as an engineering aide in  1956. He became the city's director of public works in 1969, holding that  position until he replaced Evans as city manager.  </P></p>

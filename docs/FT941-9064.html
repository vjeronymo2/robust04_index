			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India favours sugar imports while awaiting crop revival The Indian food and commerce ministries have reacted favourably to a sugar industry call for the import of 500,000 tonnes of raw sugar in the current season (October-September). According to industry officials, the imports can be matched by forward sales from the bumper sugar crop expected next season; while refining the raws for local consumption will utilise the Indian mills' considerable idled capacity. Earlier, the federal government had allowed the import of raw sugar by the Indian Sugar and General Industry Export Import Corporation, the industry's trading arm, so that it could maintain exports to neighbouring countries. The government intends that sugar exports should become a permanent feature of India's foreign trade. The need to import sugar for domestic consumption has been highlighted by the reduction of the current season's production estimate from 11m tonnes to 10.8m. Moreover, the government, in its eagerness to keep the open market sugar prices in check, has started making liberal monthly releases of the commodity. According to the Indian Sugar Mills Association, it should be possible to import raw sugar from Thailand, though the prices will be high. This is the second year in a row that India has suffered a major setback in sugar production. Last year, the production declined to 10.6m tonnes from 13.4m in 1991-92. According to industry officials, a combination of factors, including a 3.5 per cent decline in land under cane cultivation is responsible for this season's shortfall. 'The farmers were not keen to grow cane as last year, the majority of sugar factories were taking too long a time to clear the cane bills,' explains Mr OM Dhanuka, spokesman for Isma. 'At one point the industry's payment backlog on the cane account was around Rs5bn (Pounds 108m).' To make matters worse for the sugar factories, when the overall supply of raw material is not comfortable, gur and jaggery manufacturers are reported to indulge in 'large scale poaching into cane grown in the captive fields of sugar mills'. In a normal year, the gur and jaggery units use about 36 per cent of the cane production. The industry officials are quite hopeful, however, about the prospects for next season. As cane growing states have on an average raised the minimum cane price by Rs10 a quintal (100lb) for the 1993-94 season and the sugar mills are clearing the cane bills on time the growers' interest in the crop has revived. 'Both the autumn and spring cane plantations are highly encouraging. We are expecting a 20 per cent increase in cane production during 1994-95,' says Mr Dhanuka. The 1994-95 season will open with low stocks of about 2m tonnes of sugar, against 3.22m tonnes for 1993-94. But this should not create a supply problem as most Indian sugar factories should be able to start crushing in October itself because of the expected improvement in raw material availability. And it is confidently expected that the federal government will offer a package of incentives including excise relief and the granting of a higher percentage of sugar for open market sales to the mills, which will start production early. The industry expects that sugar production next year may top 1991-92's record of 13.4m tonnes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The State Duma is holding hearings into the  Partnership for Peace program today.    [Correspondent Dmitriy Vinsker] Representatives of the  foreign and defense ministries who spoke at the hearings  insisted on the need for Russia to join in this program. In  their opinion, Russia outside the Partnership for Peace program  will be on the path of self-isolation, but if Russia joins it  can develop the program in ways which are necessary for Moscow.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's International  Committee, spoke against joining. According to him the idea of  the program is good but, in his words, the devil is hidden in  the details, and these details, as Lukin stressed, incidentally  just like the positive and negative sides of the program, are  insufficiently thought through. It is worth noting that  Vladimir Lukin's stance is shared, to a lesser or greater  degree, by virtually all the deputies of the lower chamber.    Dmitriy Vinsker, Ekho Moskvy, the State Duma.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "K.B.": "Unexpected Protest Against Easier </F> Arms Exports"]    [Text] Bonn, 5 Jan -- Several leading members of the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU]/[CSU]  Bundestag group have criticized foreign policy spokesman Lamers  for his statements on arms export controls. Lamers had demanded  the establishment of common European export rules. This would  make arms exports easier than they are in line with the current  German regulations. The Federal Government, too, is skeptical  about this suggestion. So far, it has been assumed that a  memorandum of the Foreign Policy Working Group, headlined  "Common European Defense -- Common Arms Market -- Common Arms  Export Policy," which was drawn up with Lamers' participation,  meets with approval by the Bundestag group. This memorandum,  which was published at the end of November, is now causing  excitement with some delay. On Wednesday [5 January] deputy  group chairman Gerster came out against loosening the German  export rules. Before one can think of approving regulated arms  exports along broader lines and for larger areas, one must  emphatically counteract excessive illegal deliveries of armament  materiel in an internationally coordinated action. CDU Deputy  Eppelmann, the former GDR defense minister, thinks that it is  rather necessary to tighten the arms export rules instead of  loosening them.    To combat illegal arms trade, Gerster demands additional  legal regulations. It must be possible to use evidence the  Federal Intelligence Office [BND] has obtained from monitoring  German arms dealers in court. Germany must not become the  turntable for weapons from the former East Bloc. Therefore,  checks at the borders must be tightened not only by the Customs  Administration and the Federal Border Police, but also with the  help of the Bundeswehr.    Eppelmann criticized the Lamers' proposal and the Foreign  Policy Working Group for not aiming at solving conflicts.  Lamers does not speak of disarmament; the working group seems  to want to resign itself to current conditions.    As was confirmed on Wednesday, the Federal Government does  not intend to follow the demand for loosening the export  guidelines and export control regulations. However, there are  indications of considerations to change the examination and  licensing procedures with the final decision in the Federal  Security Council. This is aimed at making the German armament  industry better able to cooperate in Europe. This would be a  reaction to complaints from the armament industry that purely  private cooperation projects between German and European  companies are delayed so much by the licensing procedures that  German companies are on the brink of becoming incapable of  cooperation. The procedures should be made equal to those for  the smoother official cooperation projects initiated by the  state.    In the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] it has been  confirmed that it opposes any loosening of regulations both for  arms exports as well as for civilian supplies that can be used  for armament. SPD economic expert Schwanhold said that the  Military Materiel Control Law and the Foreign Trade Law must  continue to be handled strictly. The strict German rules  should, if possible, become the standard for harmonization in  the European Union. The goal of German policy in the new role  of the country must be worldwide disarmament and the conversion  of armament industries to civilian production facilities.  Deputy SPD Chairwoman Wieczorek-Zeul said that arms exports  cannot safeguard Germany as an industrial location. Arms  exports would only hurt Germany's reputation in the world.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS MINIMUM WAGE LAW  </P> <P> President Bush signed into law today legislation to boost the minimum wage to  $4.25 an hour, promising that the first increase since 1981 will "put more  money into the pockets of our workers."  </P> <P> The White House ceremony marked the formal end of a nearly decade-long deadlock  between the Congress and the Reagan and Bush administrations over the issue of  raising the wage level.  </P> <P> With House and Senate leaders at his side, Bush signed the legislation and  commended the bipartisanship that crafted a compromise. After the brief  ceremony in the Oval office, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said he,  too, is pleased, although he had initially hoped for more.  </P></p>

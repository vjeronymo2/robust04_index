			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Attacks on Israel blamed on Syria ISRAEL yesterday blamed Syria for an upsurge in attacks by Arab guerrillas based in southern Lebanon and said it was considering how best to retaliate, writes Julian Ozanne from Jerusalem. Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's chief negotiator with Lebanon at the Middle East peace talks, said Syria was responsible for the latest escalation of artillery duels, which last week left five Israeli soldiers dead. 'This escalation requires different treatment than others up to now,' he said. Syria, which has up to 40,000 troops in Lebanon, yesterday responded by saying Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, scene of the clashes, was an 'explosive trap'. Meanwhile, Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator of the peace talks, is currently shuttling between Middle East capitals as part of an intense diplomatic effort to break the deadlock in the US-backed peace process.</p>

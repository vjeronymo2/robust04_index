			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / CBI calls for 2 point rate cut: 'Partnership for prosperity' urged between industry and government THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a 2 point cut in interest rates to 6 per cent in conjunction with Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement on Thursday. It also renewed its call for maintained or increased government spending on capital projects. Speaking on the eve of the CBI's annual conference in Harrogate, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said the government was showing signs of a new attitude to industry. 'What we are looking for from the chancellor on Thursday is what that attitude actually means.' Mr Davies said that while CBI members believed in principle that Britain should rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, the necessary conditions were unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future. Mr Douglas McWilliam, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: 'We can't go back in when we want 6 per cent interest rates and German rates are still at 8.5 per cent.' Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said that, over the past few weeks, ministers had listened intently and encouraged business leaders to present fresh ideas. 'I think they really realise that something has to be done.' Sir Michael called for action on electricity prices. Drawing attention to the closure of two plants by Imperial Chemical Industries last week on grounds of high electricity costs, he said that in certain European countries electricity was subsidised. 'If other people are not prepared to play the game according to the rules, we may have to do likewise.' The CBI presented the first report from its new National Manufacturing Council, calling for a 'partnership for prosperity' between industry and government. The report, which aims to improve the UK's competitiveness in manufacturing, calls for increased productivity, doubled investment per employee and a higher share of world export markets. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, who is attending the conference, supported the CBI's objectives in the report. But he described as 'extremely disappointing' its lack of emphasis on the role of unions in reviving the economy. Script for recovery, Page 6</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Enel to be sold off before Stet Enel, the Italian state electricity utility, will be privatised before Stet, the telecommunications holding company, according to Italy's industry minister. In an interview published in the weekly magazine L'Espresso, Mr Vito Gnutti said Stet would not be privatised until 1995, whereas 'in September or October we should have the papers ready for a decision on Enel'. Such a timetable, if confirmed, is likely to disappoint Stet's former managing director, Mr Michele Tedeschi, who took over last week as chairman of Iri, the state holding company which is Stet's parent. He said a week ago that he hoped Stet would be privatised in the autumn, as originally planned. Both privatisations are likely to be complicated by political and market pressures. Enel and Stet will be among the largest state companies to be privatised in the two-year programme of sell-offs, and are politically the most sensitive. The government must set up regulatory authorities for the two industries before it can even attempt privatisation. The Italian treasury announced at the weekend that it had raised L4,512bn (Pounds 1.87bn) in June by selling half of Ina, the state-owned insurer, in the largest privatisation so far. Ina's shareholders, which include a range of Italian and foreign funds, will have a chance to vote for new directors of the company at an autumn assembly, the treasury confirmed.</p>

The "transparent" borders and the unstable situation create  practically ideal conditions for drug dealers. Possibly, this  compelled the undersecretary general of the United Nations, the  executive director of the United Nations International Program  for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio Giacomelli, to visit  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other "hot" spots in this respect.  Indeed, only jointly can one cope with the "narcotics fire" that  is swiftly getting out of control. Understanding this, Russia  and Tajikistan have concluded an agreement on cooperation in the  exchange of information on the question of the fight against  narcotics. Kazakhstan has come out as the initiator of the  signing of such a document among the Central Asian CIS  countries, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. The special  services and the militia are making every effort to take control  of the situation. What the results of this are, judge for  yourself.    . . . Machinist Vladimir Kruchinin sent a bucket filled with  briquettes in red "sweet" wrapping, into the furnace. A moment  later, a powerful column of poisonous dark smoke leapt up high  into the sky. The fire of 1,500 degrees left only water from the  narcotics. Among those who supervised the destruction of the  hashish was also the undersecretary general of the United  Nations, the executive director of the United Nations  International Program for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio  Giacomelli. "I have had the occasion to participate in a  multitude of actions connected with the cutting off of the  illegal dissemination of narcotics, but such wizardry  [feeriya]," Giacomelli acknowledged, "I see for the first time.  . . ."    For us, too, this is the first such action. But, judging by  everything, not the last.    Already since the times of the Great Silk Route, Uzbekistan  has played the role of an important staging post, through which  many thousands of intercontinental cargoes passed. With the  collapse of the [Soviet] Union and subsequent weakening of  border protection, international narcotics dealers did not fail  to use the convenient transportation arteries--dealers for whom  the transparent borders inside the countries of the Commonwealth  mean additional income and the reduction of risk in the  transportation of the goods.    How are the narcotics conveyed? Only a few examples.    Thirteen metric tons of hashish turned out to be in boxes  with raisins in transit through Uzbekistan. Another batch,  weighing about two metric tons, was concealed under the packing  for walnuts. . . .    Today almost every investigator who is involved with the  transit of narcotics has among his material evidence a grooved  metal pipe--with magnet attachments. This is today the most  powerful method of transporting narcotics in batches of up to  several kilograms. The cavity of the pipe is filled with  narcotic substances and tightened up with a lid. Then, with the  help of the magnet, it is fastened to any metal surface--the  plating of a barge, a river boat, the bottom of an automobile, a  railway car. . . .    Thus, more than 14 metric tons of narcotics were detained at  the border of Uzbekistan and destroyed in the fire. Such a catch  cannot even be boasted of by the specialists working in the  region of the so-called "golden triangle." However, this also  inclines the special services of Uzbekistan to a serious manner.  You know, according to the assertions of analysts, we succeed in  detaining only 12 percent of the poison that is being  transported.</p>

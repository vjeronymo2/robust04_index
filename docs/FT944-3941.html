			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hopewell turns its back on bond market Hopewell Holdings, the property and construction group controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, has never been a company to do things by halves. In June 1991, the group pulled off Hong Kong's biggest rights issue, raising HKDollars 5.7bn (USDollars 740m), and last year notched up the colony's biggest spin-off when it sought a separate listing for its power stations in a combined HKDollars 5.94bn offering. This week, Hopewell said it had secured a HKDollars 7bn loan arrangement facility with the colony's two biggest banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The innovative structure of the loan, which grants non-transferable options to subscribe for shares over five years, will see the banking group take a long-term strategic stake in the company with which it has been closely aligned since Mr Wu was a bright 20-something engineer. Details of the financing package, taken favourably by the market, end weeks of mounting speculation that attended the run-up to December 6, when Hopewell's second instalment on its partly-paid shares in Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the spun-off power interests, fell due. Peregrine Holdings, Hopewell's merchant bank, had been eager to launch its own foray into the bond markets with a USDollars 1bn issue for Hopewell. Peregrine's endeavours, which included the acquisition of a credit rating, have not been wholly in vain and its fixed income team will play a role in the planned bond issues for CEPA. For Hopewell, whose gearing according to stockbroker Jardine Fleming now climbs from 35 per cent to 46 per cent, the decision to rely primarily on bank loan appears a sound one. It was assigned a BBB- senior implied debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, which would not totally have excluded it from the capital markets but certainly increased its entrance fee. W. I. Carr (Far East) reckons Hopewell would have had to pay about 10 per cent interest on a bond (being US Treasury bond rates plus between 200 and 300 basis points), whereas the loan is understood to be set at around 100 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor is used as the bulk of the funds to be drawn are US dollar denominated). Unlike the coupon on a bond, interest is paid only when funds are drawn, and at least HKDollars 2bn - representing the final instalment on the CEPA shares - will not be required until this time next year. The second instalment, also of HKDollars 2bn, was paid earlier this week. Hopewell's mooted bond was also shelved because of the poor market conditions, which would have exacerbated the difficulty of distributing a big issue. CEPA, which is sitting on cash of about HKDollars 5bn to HKDollars 6bn, can afford to wait and pounce when the time is right, a luxury not afforded to Hopewell which has some HKDollars 11bn worth of debt on its balance sheet. As a pure play on the power sector, CEPA is a more straightforward and, perhaps, attractive animal to investors than Hopewell which is evolving from a Hong Kong property company into one involved in infrastructure projects throughout Asia. Its net cash position increases its likelihood of obtaining a better credit rating than its parent. The bank loan facility secured by Hopewell should see it comfortably through the next 12 months, analysts say. About HKDollars 3bn remains after the third and final instalment is paid on the CEPA shares next December and the bulk of this money is likely to be targeted at the super-highway project in Guangdong province and the southern Guangzhou ring road. On a broader scale, Hopewell's lengthy review of its options reflects the changing dynamics between Asian companies and their bankers. Before the review, Hopewell's banking relationship was principally with Hongkong Bank and it has cemented that relationship by granting the sweetener options which enable the HSBC group to take a stake of up to 4.2 per cent in Hopewell. Mr Simon Moules, senior manager for corporate banking at Hongkong Bank says: 'This type of structure is innovative and somewhat unconventional and reflects the closeness of our relationship with Hopewell.' However, he notes that the bank holds stakes in a number of Hong Kong corporates, especially those related to infrastructure development. By going for bank financing, Hopewell is reaping cost advantages and benefiting from a simpler, more flexible package - although it remains prey to rising interest rates. But equally, CEPA will raise its funds on the capital markets - a trend which HSBC insists is complementary to, rather than competitive to, its own activities. Besides, Mr Moules adds: 'The vast majority of project financings which have been undertaken in the region in recent years have been financed by bank loans and export credit, and not by capital market instruments. As far as corporate lending goes, we have seen capital markets activity grow, but the volume of loans is not down.'</p>

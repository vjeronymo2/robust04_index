			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> *** THE HAVALINAS, "THE HAVALINAS," ELEKTRA.: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM FIVE STARS  (A CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).  </P> <P> The L.A. trio has a go at our troubled times, offering encouragement to the  downtrodden with the sentimental spirit and the ramshackle, acousti-rock sound  of a street-corner Stones. There's also some romance stuff, and a road-tempo  dope-murder narrative delivered with a hipster twang. It's sometimes  overbearing, but rhythmically propulsive (former Rockats and Cruzados at work)  and undeniably good-hearted. Richard Cromelin  </P></p>

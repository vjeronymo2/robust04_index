Longi Chelidze, a "Mkhedrioni" leader, told reporters on  Tuesday that any member of the organisation refusing to obey the  order to give up his weapon will be reported to the law  enforcement bodies of the republic.    By January 15, all weapons should be collected and sealed in  dumps. The operation has been already completed on Tuesday in  the republic eastern regions of Kakheti and Rustavi.    Not long ago the "Mkhedrioni" units, playing a big role in  the Georgian political drama, got the status of a governmental  structure called "Georgia's Rescuers".    Local observers believe the "Mkhedrioni" leaders decided to  get rid of weapons in a bid to evade any accusations of illegal  activities against the members of the organisation.    The "Mkhedrioni" were founded in 1989 by Djaba Ioseliani,  once a supporter of the late ex-president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia,  who later inspired the downfall of the first popular-elected  president of Georgia.    In November 1990, Ioseliani told ITAR-TASS That the  "Mkhedrioni" had been created to prevent ethnic conflicts and  preserve the republic's integrity. The "Horsemen" actively  participated in the Georgian coup d'etat of December  1991-January 1992, combat operations in Abkhazia and western  Georgia on the side of the government troops.    Experts assess that "Mkhedrioni" consist of some three  thousand well-equipped gunmen, possess armour and modern means  of liaison.</p>

Over the past 6 months or so, people have seen through  the media that a succession of measures aimed at combating  corruption and promoting honesty were promulgated, major cases  of corruption were brought to light one after another, and  corrupt elements were punished by party or administrative  sanctions one after another.    According to information released by the discipline  inspection and supervision authorities, since the second plenary  session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection  which was held last August, some 470,000 party and government  organs at and above the county (division) level across the  nation -- including nearly 19,000 cadres at the provincial level  -- have conducted self-examination and self-rectification in  line with the five-point regulations for observing clean  standards and self-discipline set by the Central Committee.  Compared to the corresponding period in 1992, the number of  major bribery cases involving over 10,000 yuan that were  investigated nationwide from September to December last year  rose 2.1 times, and the number of cases involving economic  offenses by cadres at the county (division) level rose 6.8  times. Relevant central departments and local authorities at  various levels have abolished 5,370 illegal fees. The  localities and departments have stopped some 1,600 unqualified  groups from taking tours abroad.    The people -- after seeing the Central Committee's  determination to combat corruption, improve discipline, and  promote clean and honest government and the results that have  been made -- have increased their confidence. A poll by  relevant authorities shows that nearly 67 percent of the pollees  believed that the negative and corrupt manifestations "have been  contained somewhat" since the anticorruption drive was launched;  69 percent believed that there have been "some improvements" in  regard to observing clean standards and self-discipline in party  and government organs; nearly 59 percent said that are  "satisfied or somewhat satisfied" with the progress in the  investigations of major cases; 50 percent believed the unhealthy  practices of illegal fees and government-funded sightseeing  tours abroad have been "by and large halted." Reports from  various quarters and sectors indicate a strong momentum in the  anticorruption drive, which has produced the expected results of  halting the spread of the negative and corrupt manifestations  and has fully asserted the correctness of the Central  Committee's game plan for combating corruption.    Meanwhile, we must be soberly aware that although we have so  far achieved some progress in the anticorruption drive,  corruption remains serious and many deep-rooted problems remain  unsolved; what has been achieved so far still falls short the  requirements set by the Central Committee and the expectations  of the masses. Moreover, it is impossible to root out  corruption -- a problem left over by history -- overnight.  Combating corruption and promoting honesty is a long-term task.  We must not, in the slightest degree, lower our guard; rather,  we should attend to it perseveringly.    It is necessary to focus, in a given period, our resources  and build up the momentum to quickly halt some corrupt  manifestations and unhealthy practices about which the masses  are most dissatisfied. However, if we do not remove, once and  for all, the soil that breeds corruption, it will resurface --  or become even more aggravated -- after each attempt at  rectification. Therefore, to implement the anticorruption drive  in a deep-going and sustained manner, we must treat both the  symptoms as well as the root cause; we should start with the  sources of corruption and tackle the deep- seated problems in  terms of the structure, rules and regulations, and  administration. In addition to putting a stop to irregularities  and rectifying discipline, we should also formulate new rules  and regulations, introduce and amplify step by step norms and  standards governing the conduct of party members and public  servants as well as supervision and restraining mechanisms for  fighting corruption and promoting honesty, step up efforts in  formulating rules for party discipline and supervision, and  bring this work within the jurisdiction of law step by step.    As development of the socialist market economic system picks  up pace and reform measures are promulgated one after another in  the new year, there will certainly be new conditions, new  problems, and new contradictions. In the changeover from the  old structure to the new, inadequacies and shortcomings in the  structure and mechanisms will emerge, inevitably creating  opportunities for some people to take advantage of. Therefore,  the anticorruption drive and the efforts to improve party  workstyle and administrative honesty must evolve closely around  and safeguard the general interests of reform, development, and  stability; around the central task of economic development; and  focus on critical problems that hamper and affect reform,  development, and stability; there must also be clearly defined  tasks and goals for the various phases of the drive. We must  step up law enforcement and supervision; see to it that all  policies and orders are implemented to the letter; safeguard the  seriousness of political discipline; facilitate and ensure that  the series of major policies and measures adopted by the CPC  Central Committee and State Council for deepening reform,  developing the economy, and safeguarding stability are fully  implemented; and create a good environment for the defense of  political stability, the establishment of a socialist market  economic system, and the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth  [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660  4099 1455] of the economy.    An ancient poem puts it this way: "All nations and families  past tell this story: diligence leads to prosperity and  extravagance to disaster." Looking squarely at corruption and  combating it with a firm and clear-cut stand -- this is the  CPC's, the ruling party, answer on how to get out of the  "historical cycle." It is also an indication of the party's  strength and confidence. So long as we persist in Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's strategic policy of "attaching equal importance to  both and being careful not to emphasize one and neglect the  other," the long-tested CPC will -- by relying on its own  strength and the people's support -- certainly be able to root  out corruption and, together with people of all nationalities  and in a new pose, help one another like passengers in the same  boat, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, and  jointly build a modern socialist country with Chinese  characteristics.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Italy rejects EU steel accord as row with Brussels worsens THE POLITICAL row between Italy and the European Commission over restructuring west Europe's steel industry erupted into the open last night when a meeting of European Union industry ministers broke up in acrimony and disarray. Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's minister, rejected a Commission compromise on subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker. Senior commissioners and the Belgian presidency of the EU warned that the impasse would be highly damaging not only for Europe's ailing industry, but for the new Union itself. Italian opposition to a 2m tonne capacity cut at Ilva now seems likely to be discussed, at least informally, at the EU summit in Brussels on December 10. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, called it a 'black day' for the EU, and Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgium's industry minister, who chaired the meeting, said the outcome did not bode well for the relationship between the Union's institutions. Mr Wathelet said he would only call a follow-up meeting of ministers, on December 17, if there was a chance of a deal. The British industry, however, which has already cut jobs and capacity severely, welcomed the fact that ministers had resisted agreeing other restructuring plans which Britain believes insufficiently strict. The Commission had asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in east Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final agreement on subsidies must be unanimous. There was friction between Germany and Britain over UK opposition to a new hot rolling mill at Ekostahl, east German steel producer, 60 per cent of which is being offered for sale to Riva, a private Italian company. The Treuhand, the privatisation agency handling the Ekostahl sale, will today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva to answer 'crucial questions' about the new mill before the sale can be concluded. British Steel welcomed the tough line taken by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK minister, saying that by allowing subsidised new capacity at Ekostahl, Brussels had not grasped the nettle. Mr Sainsbury had told fellow ministers 'no agreement would be better than a bad agreement' on subsidies. Denmark, Luxembourg and France are understood to have some objections to the east German and Spanish plans.</p>

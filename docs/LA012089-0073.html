			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> New York sculptor Joel Shapiro forges a curious blend of Minimalism and  geometric abstraction in a series of new pastel drawings. Staunchly traditional  modernist work that poses formal questions concerning line, mass, color and  space, the drawings -- all untitled -- offer few clues as to how Shapiro  intends that they be interpreted, and that theoretical ambiguity is  simultaneously chic and worrisome. It's always hip to play it close to the  vest, yet there's something vaguely fretful about these stark compositions.  </P> <P> Shapiro's basic recipe involves one or more squares of intensely saturated  color, tilted and cocked at odd angles, while floating in a smudged white  field. Jaunty, almost recklessly self-confident, the work exudes the breezy  good taste of a cover for the New Yorker magazine, yet one can't help  suspecting that there's something academic and perhaps a bit pedantic afoot.  (Asher/Faure, 612 Almont Drive, to Feb. 11.) KRISTINE McKENNA  </P></p>

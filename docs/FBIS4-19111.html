			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FR: "Van Miert Tired of Paying Lip Service </F> to European Union -- European Labor Unions Criticize  `Non-Debate' on Employment"]    [Excerpts] More and more often, Europe is divided by  discussions, which seem theological at times, between employers  and employees about the question whether employment or public  debt must be the priority issue to be dealt with, and between  the European Commission and national governments. "The European  Union (EU) cannot function as a Union unless there is a  willingness to cooperate on the part of the member states,"  European Commissioner Van Miert (Flemish-Speaking Socialist  Party) stated yesterday.    These sterile debates form a fundamental impediment to the  employment conference of the European socialists, which started  in Brussels yesterday. The conference is presided by former  Swedish Finance Minister Allan Lansson, and is attended by  delegations from labor unions, employers and politicians of the  twelve EU member states and of the four applicant member states.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  White Paper </H5>   Karel Van Miert came up with another reason why Europe is so  powerless, while there is an increasing need for action now that  the army of unemployed has grown to 20 million. Yesterday, on  behalf of Jacques Delors he was supposed to come and explain how  the implementation of the latter's white paper was proceeding.  Instead, his speech soon turned into a complaint about the  reasons why we are not much further with the white paper and  with many other European initiatives. "The European Commission  has its hands tied," he argued. "Ninety percent of the white  paper is connected with national and even regional powers. Who  is responsible for its implementation?" Van Miert wondered.    Van Miert believes that Europe has insufficient means to  fight unemployment on a European scale. He does consider the  Maastricht Treaty to be a step in the right direction, but  regrets the lack of willingness on the part of the member states  to actually cooperate. According to Van Miert, this paralysis  also explains why so much potential still remains undeveloped  within the unified market. He was mainly referring to  telecommunication networks and the transportation  infrastructure, but also to post offices and to the energy  sector. Companies such as the national railways do have the  technical means, but lack the financial capacity to cooperate  within Europe. That is why Van Miert also calls for more  support to companies which are taking chances for European  integration. According to Van Miert, this inadequate support is  due to a lack of ambition for "ideological and political  reasons." He says that both employers and unions are being  obstructive because they are primarily concerned about national  interests.</p>

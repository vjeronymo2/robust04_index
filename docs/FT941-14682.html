			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Chrysler beats all forecasts at Dollars 777m Chrysler, the US carmaker enjoying strong growth in market share with the help of popular new products, yesterday reported that fourth quarter earnings had more than doubled, easily beating Wall Street expectations. The smallest of Detroit's Big Three manufacturers, and the first to report year-end figures, had net earnings of Dollars 777m, or Dollars 2.11 a share, compared with Dollars 356m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, in the same period of 1992. Sales for the quarter totalled Dollars 12bn, up from Dollars 10.2bn. The mean Wall Street forecast was for earnings per share of about Dollars 1.60. Chrysler shares rose Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 62 1/2 . The results underscore Chrysler's remarkable recovery since the early 1990s, when it was financially stretched, losing market share and entering a recession, with its shares hovering at little more than Dollars 10. Its turnround is due to tight control of costs, more efficient methods of developing products, and a range of new vehicles, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the sleek LH series of family-sized saloon cars. The company now makes substantially more money per vehicle in North America than Ford Motor, while General Motors is losing money in the region. Chrysler said yesterday its pre-tax profit per vehicle averaged Dollars 1,335 in 1993 and Dollars 1,727 in the fourth quarter. Chrysler's North American car and light truck market share rose to 14.8 per cent in 1993, up from 13.4 per cent in 1992, while its sales increased 19 per cent to 2.27m units. The company has only a small presence outside the US, but its international sales rose 45 per cent to 106,000 units, helped by increased European sales of mini-vans and Jeeps. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said Chrysler's priority was to keep up its momentum. It still faced important challenges. 'The economic recovery in the US continues at a slow pace and our balance sheet still is not where we want it to be.' Chrysler reported a full-year net loss of Dollars 2.55bn, or Dollars 7.62 a share, after taking Dollars 5bn of charges for changes in methods of accounting for employee benefits. At a pre-tax level, 1993 profits totalled Dollars 3.8bn, compared with Dollars 934m, and the previous record of Dollars 2.4bn set in 1984. Upbeat sound, Page 19</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Tenneco to spend Dollars 73m in production upgrade Tenneco plans to spend Dollars 73m upgrading the linerboard capacity at its Packing Corporation of America division. The investment will boost PCA's linerboard output by 16 per cent and give Tenneco a stronger hold in the rapidly rebounding containerboard market. Linerboard is used to make corrugated boxes. The investment in its packaging division is part of Tenneco's strategy to redeploy capital into high-return growth opportunities in its packaging, automotive parts and natural gas businesses. Last week, the company announced a Dollars 60m acquisition for its Tenneco Gas unit. Tenneco is in the process of spinning off its J. I. Case farm equipment subsidiary. Analysts expect Tenneco to use the proceeds from Case's sale to make a Dollars 1bn acquisition in either packaging or vehicle parts during the next year. Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco chairman, has said that a significant European acquisition is in the works which could be completed by year-end. The linerboard project will add new equipment to an existing linerboard machine at PCA's mill in Counce, Tennessee, already the largest of PCA's five linerboard production sites. The upgrade will add 120,000 tons of annual production to PCA's existing linerboard capacity of 2m tons.</p>

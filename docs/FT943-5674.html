			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Airsprung Pounds 9m expansion Shares of Airsprung Furniture jumped 18p to 255p after the Wiltshire-based group accompanied a sizeable acquisition with a cautiously optimistic statement on current trading. Airsprung is paying up to Pounds 9m cash for Intasco and Mensaco, both suppliers of components and finished products to furniture markets. Initial consideration is Pounds 7.16m with the balance on a performance-related basis. The eventual total will be met from existing resources and facilities. In the year to June 30, Intasco reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 567,000 on sales of Pounds 3.66m; Mensaco made Pounds 703,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 4.92m. Trading between the two companies, which were under common ownership, amounted to Pounds 1.31m. Airsprung's trading since its March year-end had remained difficult, Mr John Pierce, chief executive, said, but the first quarter had shown a 'satisfactory' increase in sales and profits.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (6) A program shall be established whereby mix blade shaft and bearings are monitored and changed before becoming worn and allowing loose play in the blade shaft. Maintain a record of such checks, mixer blade adjustments, and any damage to the mixer blades and bowls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Wet mixing shall not be started until adequate solvent is added to preclude dry mixing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The operating procedures shall contain provisions to verify acceptable blade/bowl clearance, bowl and shaft rigidity, and bearing wear prior to introduction of materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Electrical service to propellant mixers shall be interlocked with fire protection system controls so that the mixer cannot start when the fire protection system is inoperative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.76  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Pressing, extruding, and pelleting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) Pressing operations shall be conducted with personnel protected by substantial dividing walls, barricades, or operational shields; or shall take place at intraline distance from the operator and other operations. When it is necessary to repair, adjust, or otherwise clear a jam on a press or extruder, the pyrotechnic material shall be removed from the hopper and the bay or press room before such repairs or adjustments are made. Only those adjustments of ram speed or conveyor speed routinely controlled by the operator may proceed with material in the bay. Under no circumstances shall repair or adjustment requiring the use of tools be permitted with pyrotechnic material in the bay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The quantity of composition at the pressing location (behind the barricade) shall not exceed that required for the components undergoing the pressing operation. The quantity of composition in the remainder of the building at any one time shall not exceed the minimum required for a safe, efficient operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each individual press, extruder, or loading device shall be located in a separate building, room, or cubicle, and be designed to limit an incident to that area and protect operators. Multiple installations may be permitted within a bay or cubicle, provided that tests or hazard analysis demonstrate that facility and personnel hazards are not increased. Adequate means of pressure relief shall be built into each bay or cubicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.77  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Assembly operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Individual assembly operations shall be adequately separated from each other, and shall be located in a separate cubicle or building from mixing, blending, and consolidation operations. Pyrotechnic composition shall be kept in closed or covered containers at all times except during processing. Surge, storage, and in-process transit between operations shall also be accomplished with closed containers whenever not absolutely prohibited by the operational configuration. Components in any assembly room, bay, or building, shall be limited to the smallest quantity necessary for safe and efficient operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.78  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Granulation, grinding, and screening. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) Material to be reduced in particle size shall be processed over a mechanical or magnetic separator to remove foreign materials before grinding. Following grinding, the material should be re-screened or passed over a magnetic separator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the operation of ball mills, hammer mills, granulators, or screeners, the operator shall be protected from the effects of a potential incident by substantial dividing walls or operational shields. Every effort shall be made to fill and discharge grinding, granulating, and screening equipment remotely. Cleaning of such devices shall also afford maximal operator protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Working surfaces, containers, and hand tools shall be appropriately bonded and grounded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.79  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Transportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Pyrotechnic compositions shall be moved in closed containers only. Individual containers and the transport vehicle (hand cart, hand truck, etc.) should be fabricated of the lightest materials compatible with the composition and having the requisite strength. This shall minimize fragment generation if an incident should occur. Transport vehicles should be equipped with ``dead man'' brakes. On- and off-loading of transport vehicles should be conducted only in weather-protected areas designated for this purpose. Racks or other support, suited to the size and shape of composition containers, should be provided to prevent them from falling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.80  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Rebowling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Rebowling operations transfer materials, typically sensitive and in small quantities, from one container to another. They may be done to recover remains of small quantities of materials, or to subdivide large masses for processing. Operational shields shall be provided to protect operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.81  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Machining of pyrotechnic material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) Machining of pyrotechnic materials shall be accomplished remotely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) When required, coolant shall be compatible with the pyrotechnic composition. Positive automatic interlocking devices shall ensure that the machine cannot be started until the coolant is flowing. These controls shall also be capable of stopping the machine should the flow of coolant be interrupted. When it is essential to cut off the coolant to adjust machine tools, it shall be restored, and all automatic controls operating, before machining resumes. If a cutting edge overheats during machining, it is most dangerous when continuous contact with the pyrotechnic material is maintained after the machine has stopped. It is, therefore, essential that coolant continue flowing until the cutter is removed from contact with the pyrotechnic material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sensors are recommended to detect tooling malfunctions or other potentially hazardous conditions. Machine tool power-consumption monitors, tool force gages, sound or noise detectors, temperature-indicating devices, or IR detectors can be used in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

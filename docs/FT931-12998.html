			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / New York tabloid in death defying sensation THE New York Post seemed as good as dead on Sunday, but the smallest and most sensational of the Big Apple's three leading tabloids received a last-minute reprieve after a weekend of intrigue and frantic negotiations. Last weekend Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's owner, found himself facing a crisis when Bankers Trust, his chief backer, threatened to pull the plug on a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) credit line that had jumped to Dollars 6m in recent weeks. The newspaper ran a deficit last year estimated at about Dollars 5m. Mr Kalikow thought he had resolved his problems by arranging for Mr Leon Black, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, to invest in the Post. But advisers close to the deal say Mr Black lost interest, which led Mr Kalikow to warn last Friday that the Post faced closure by the end of the weekend if no one else could be found. A 20 per cent wage cut for the newspaper's 719 employees plus a cover price rise from 40 to 50 cents were rushed through on Sunday afternoon as a supposed alternative solution, but proved inadequate for Bankers Trust. That is when New York's big guns stepped into the fray. It was Ms Cindy Adams, the Post's gossip columnist, who got most heavily involved in the search for a buyer. She worked the telephones throughout the weekend, ringing 'my rich friends or my smart ones who know rich ones'. By late afternoon on Sunday Mr Kalikow was telling staff he feared the paper would have to shut down. But behind the scenes Ms Adams and Mr Howard Rubenstein, king of the New York public relations world, were in touch with Mr Bill Fugazy, the limousine mogul, searching for an angel. Mr Fugazy, in turn, contacted Mr Steve Hoffenberg, a little-known 48-year-old financier who owns Towers Financial, a factoring and accounts receivable business. 'Everybody who was anybody was calling everybody else on Sunday to try to save the Post,' said one investment banker whose client turned down the deal. And that included Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York. When Messrs Rubenstein and Fugazy could not find Mr Hoffenberg it fell to Governor Cuomo to send out a state trooper to track down the financier. The police could not find him, but Mr Vincent Tese, the state director of economic development, talked to Mr Hoffenberg. Mr Hoffenberg eventually surfaced and a series of conference calls resulted in a last-minute agreement on Sunday night. The deal called for Mr Hoffenberg to provide an immediate Dollars 300,000 and to guarantee the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. In exchange he is now in pole position to spend the next four weeks deciding whether to go ahead and become the newspaper's new owner. The reprieve could still fall apart, but that did not stop the tabloid from plastering yesterday's front page with the words 'NEVER SAY DIE]'</p>

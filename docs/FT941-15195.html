			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Partial clean-up in Everglades The US administration is renewing its efforts to make sugar producers help to restore the Everglades, the swamp at the southern tip of Florida, writes George Graham in Washington. The Interior Department last week won the agreement of Flo-Sun Inc, one of the biggest sugar producers, to a clean-up plan that could cost it Dollars 70m-Dollars 100m (Pounds 47m-Pounds 70m) over the next 20 years, reviving a more extensive agreement in principle reached with the sugar industry last summer. That deal broke down last month amid disputes between environmentalists and sugar growers over details. But Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the Everglades were a test case for US ability to restore an ecosystem. He promised to press for a comprehensive agreement.</p>

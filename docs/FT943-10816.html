			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Jobs: Figures add up nicely for chartered accountants - Age is proving no barrier to future employment in at least one sector Middle class angst about job security and future full-time employment prospects appears to be widespread this summer as many companies continue to cut their managerial ranks in the name of global competitiveness. But not all white-collar occupations are proving equally vulnerable. Take chartered accountancy, for example. The latest guide to salaries in accountancy, published by the Hays business service group for the first half of the year, suggests the demand for accountants has started to grow strongly again in the economic recovery. As a result, salaries for accounting staff are rising at a much faster rate than inflation and are now on average 5.7 per cent higher than this time last year. The upward pressure on earnings is even more noticeable for the support staff in accountancy, whose pay has climbed by 7.25 per cent compared with last year. For graduate recruits in public practice the picture is very promising, with an 8 per cent increase in their training contracts to an annual national figure of Pounds 10,042. Salaries for finance directors in industry and commerce have risen by a national average of 10.5 per cent to Pounds 39,277 a year compared with the first half of 1993, while credit control clerks have seen their national average earnings grow by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 9,319 a year. There have also been national average increases in pay of 8 per cent for trainee accountants in industry and 7 per cent for general accounts clerks with one to two years' experience. The survey also points out that companies are recruiting accountants at all ages and levels of experience. The lifting of recruitment freezes at the junior end has reflected strong demand. Even what the survey describes as 'mature candidates' are being sought by employers to take on vacant accountancy posts. Accountancy Personnel believes this new interest in recruiting older people is due to the combination of the 'demographic time bomb', with not enough younger staff available to meet demand. And the cuts made in training and recruitment during the recession reduced the pool of skilled young people on which employers could draw in the upturn. But the survey also suggests there is another important reason why employers are keen to hire mature staff, even if 40 per cent of employers still appear actively to discriminate in job placement on grounds of age. More companies have apparently woken up to the fact that older staff can 'best help them attain their business goals'. It seems these more 'world-wide' applicants can 'leave a more credible impression on the customer with whom most accounts departments have a much more regular interface than ever before'. The survey highlights a number of other underlying trends in the market for accountants. In the recession, the level of earnings in accountancy between the north and south of the country narrowed, but there are signs that the current revival is particularly strong in southern England, and this could lead to a rewidening of the pay gap. It is also clear from the survey that the much-maligned public sector is regarded as the best place for recruits to train in accountancy skills because it offers better day release facilities and more time off from work to revise for examinations than the private sector. Just as important, perhaps, is that the public sector is now offering levels of commercial salary to trained accountants competitive with the private sector. The pressure on local councils and health authorities to improve their internal auditing and the spread of compulsory competitive tendering has enhanced the demand for more accountants in the public services. But would-be accountants should not become over-confident in the bullish jobs market. The survey also suggests many employers may be ready to hire more candidates, but only for spells of temporary work before deciding whether or not to offer them full-time employment. That greater prudence also provides temporary accountants with more flexibility, which many of them want.

Bridging the gulf David Lodge's novel Nice Work portrayed with painful humour the uncomprehending gulf of understanding that separates the world of engineering from that of academia. In Britain it was ever thus. But perhaps times are starting to change. Lucas Industries, the large Midland engineering group, has just launched a pilot training project designed to improve the technological literacy of its management. Managers with an expertise in finance, sales, buying and communications are being taught the rudiments of engineering. The company's 'engineers for non-engineers' programme is the first of its kind in Britain. Lucas in partnership with Warwick University's Manufacturing Group, has been awarded Pounds 96,000 by the Department of Employment to run a pilot scheme. It is about two-thirds of the way through and apparently proving highly successful. 'Our aim is to create a new cadre of managers who can interpret engineering and manufacturing issues more thoroughly and confidently', says Mr Bryan Mason, the company's personnel director. Mr Alan Bateman from the Department of Employment, who organises the programme, is already convinced it provides a good model for other companies to emulate in the future. There are 15 managers on the 12-month induction programme who are spending 30 hours a month at Warwick University learning about engineering in the classroom, but also working on practical workplace projects at different Lucas plants four days a month. A second group starts the programme next month and there are plans in place for more next year. The company is keen to remove much of the mystery from what it regards as the 'closed club of engineers', so other managers outside the manufacturing process will be able to participate more intelligently in the debate and decision-making on new product investment and design. Lucas also sees the programme as a means of enhancing managerial career mobility. It will not turn out fully-qualified engineers but provide the company's managers with 'the language and confidence' to interact with its engineers. The company is well aware that Bosch, its main German rival, benefits enormously from having a more technically aware management in a country where engineering enjoys a much higher professional status than it does in Britain. But at least the Lucas scheme looks like helping to remedy the shortage of senior staff in the company with a real grasp of how its gear boxes and power systems are produced. The programme is no soft option but rigorous and intellectually demanding. It consists of six modules covering, for instance, operational management techniques, products and manufacturing processes, innovation and the role of support functions. Those on the programme seem to be enthusiastic about its value for them. 'I believe it will help us to be more effective in multi-disciplinary management task forces', said one. 'In the past I have kept quiet when engineers have been talking. Now I feel I can make a contribution', said another. The Department of Employment hopes other companies will follow the Lucas example. The current programme may be tailor-made for Lucas's needs but it provides a model for use elsewhere. Managers at Lucas acknowledge their company is trying to make up for their lamentable ignorance about the engineering process. If business schools cannot find the time to do this, then the companies will have to fill the gap. So far Lucas remains the lone pioneer.</p>

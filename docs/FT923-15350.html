			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The UK's EC presidency WHAT CAN reasonably be expected of the UK presidency of the European Community? One thing at least can be hoped for: that the UK should start from sensible priorities. It should, this once, let internal developments largely take their course, and concentrate instead on the EC's external obligations. This is not to deny that the internal agenda of the EC is a substantial one. On it, for example, can be found completion of the single market, the 'Delors II' proposals for an increase of one third in EC revenues by 1997, ratification of the Maastricht treaty and enlargement. Among these items, the UK presidency should focus on completion of the single market programme, which will probably contribute more to the welfare of the ordinary European than everything else on the table. If the UK is as committed as it claims to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, it will also have to accept an increased EC budget. The need for budgetary discipline remains. But it would be foolish to allow everything to be halted over whether the EC spends 1.37 per cent of its forecast gross domestic product by 1997 rather than only 1.2 per cent. Ratification of the Treaty on European Union is now in the hands of the French voters. Only when the treaty has jumped this and the other national hurdles, will it be possible to go back to the Danes. For the moment all the EC can do is wait and hope. The British government's proposed bait to the Danes is an elaboration of the concept of 'subsidiarity'. This is to be convincing enough to change the Danish vote, but not so convincing that it amounts to a renegotiation of the treaty. Intellectual jellyfish This looks a hopeless quest, not merely procedurally. The relevant article of the treaty states that: 'in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed actions cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can, therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action be better achieved by the Community.' How can backbone be inserted into this intellectual jellyfish? The UK would argue that interference in working hours is a violation of subsidiarity. Others claim that it is the EC's crusade against state aids which must be moderated. The meaning of subsidiarity depends, therefore, on what people think can be 'better achieved' by the EC. The notion cannot determine what the EC would, in fact, achieve better. Further centralisation Little less hopeless is the UK's zeal for an immediate start on enlargement. It cannot be broached until it is clear what the new members are to join. Nor can one ignore the difficulty - adumbrated by the Commission before the Danish 'no' - that the EC, already unwieldy, would become unmanageable once it has a host of additional members. Further centralisation of power would probably be inevitable, at least if the EC is not to turn into the free trade area that the UK's partners have rejected for a generation. Once one has eliminated the impossible, one must concentrate on what is left, however improbable. The EC represents a quarter of the world economy; it is the world's biggest trading power and by far the most important economic partner for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Here are challenges that will not wait, challenges that will figure on the agenda of the summit of the group of seven industrial countries in Munich next week. Here also is where leadership is needed. Mr Major did not have much success as chairman of the last G7 summit. Perhaps he can do better as president of the EC. It is difficult to accept that infinitesimal differences over farm policy should still block a deal with the US over the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. It is depressing that the need to open markets to the products of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union should still be evaded. The world needs EC leadership now. If the UK cannot provide such leadership, what good are its pretensions to a global vision?</p>

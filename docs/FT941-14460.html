			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy It is strange that the UK equity market should get into such a lather over yesterday's economic figures. Retail sales last month were certainly poorer than suggested by either the CBI or retailers' gossip. But annual sales growth is still running at 4 per cent in volume terms. That is unlikely to drive the chancellor to an early interest rate cut, at least while other economic indicators are pointing in the right direction. The December sales figures should anyway be treated cautiously, since Christmas poses particular problems for the Central Statistical Office, as the large revision to the December 1992 data confirms. Reassuring news on inflation might leave the chancellor with more room to cut rates should the economy take a turn for the worse. Underlying inflation of 2.7 per cent presents no immediate threat. That said, eight of the 14 categories in the retail prices index are still rising at an annual rate of more than 3 per cent. Even allowing for the impact of higher taxes on the latest figures, this is a reminder that inflation has been subdued rather than vanquished. With sterling sliding below DM2.61 yesterday, the chancellor does not need to cut rates to hold the currency down. On that basis, the excitement in equities - including a 135-point rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 index - arose from something other than a cool assessment of the economic outlook. If a widespread shortage of stock throughout the London market is to blame, that gain could quickly be reversed.</p>

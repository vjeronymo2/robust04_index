			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (u) Arises in respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or custom duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Is a claim for which a remedy is provided by the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C. 741&hyph;752) or the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C. 781790), or cognizable under subpart H, unless specifically authorized by the Commander, USARCS. (See &sect;536.147(d).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (w) Is a claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App, sections 1&hyph;31). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8d.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (y) Results wholly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or his or her agent. Claims involving comparative negligence are not barred by this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (z) Arises out of malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (aa) Is for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the DA, the Treasury, or by regulation of the monetary system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.154  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In determining an appropriate award, the law and custom of the country where the incident occurred will be used to determine what elements of damages are payable and which individuals are entitled to receive compensation. However, where the claimant is an inhabitant of another foreign country and only temporarily in the country where the incident occurred, the quantum of certain elements of damages, such as lost wages and future medical care, may be calculated based on the law and economic conditions in the country of the claimant's permanent residence. Punitive damages and interest will not be allowed. Court costs, attorney fees, bail, costs of filing a claim, and similar charges also are not allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Local law or custom pertaining to contributory or comparative negligence and to joint tortfeasors will be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.155  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Computation of amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The amount allowed will, to the extent possible, be apportioned among claimants as prescribed by local law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) After appropriate compensation for the total damages suffered has been computed, any payment claimant has received from the tortfeasor, or any joint tortfeasor, will be deducted. This includes amounts collectible from a tortfeasor's or joint tortfeasor's insurance company or amounts paid by any other third party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deductions for insurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Normally there will be deducted from any award the amount of any applicable insurance coverage recovered or an amount that can be reasonably expected to be recovered and which has been or will be paid to the claimant. In this regard, every effort will be made to monitor the insurance aspect of the case and encourage direct settlement between the claimant and the insurer. (See &sect;536.151(c)(1).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When efforts under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are of no avail or it otherwise is determined that an insurance settlement will not be reasonably available for application to the award, settlement may be accomplished without making a deduction. In such cases, an assignment of the insured's rights against the insurer will be obtained and, in appropriate cases, reimbursement action will be instituted against the insurer under applicable procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the reason that an insurance settlement is not available is due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the insurer, no award will be made until prior consent has been obtained from the Commander, USARCS. In this event, a report on a bankruptcy will be forwarded without delay setting forth all pertinent information including the alleged reasons for the bankruptcy and the facts concerning the licensing of the insurer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Settlements will be stated in the appropriate foreign currency. To determine the proper approval authority, the settlement or the claimed amount (in claims where a settlement cannot be reached) will be converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent (based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account exchange rate, where applicable) on the date of the commission's action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Payment will be made in the currency of the country in which the incident occurred or where the claimant resided at the time of the incident. However, if the claimant resides in another foreign country at the time of payment, payment in an amount equivalent to that which would have been paid under the preceding sentence may be made in the currency of that third country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) No more than 20% of the total cost of an award to the United States may be paid as attorney fees or as a fee by any representative. This fee limitation should be made a part of all settlement agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) In appropriate cases, a commission or other approval authority can require a structured settlement with periodic or deferred payments if it is feasible to make such arrangements in the country where the claimants reside. Such settlements are especially appropriate on claims of minors. In cases where the time, duration, amount or need for any element of future damages is uncertain, the part of the award for such damages may be paid into a reversionary trust with the reversion to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Claims Commissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.156  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Appointment and functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Claims cognizable under this section will be referred to a foreign claims commission for processing regardless of the amount claimed. The commander senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service will appoint necessary foreign claims commissions to action claims arising within his or her geographic area jurisdiction, and on claims arising in another geographic area jurisdiction that are transferred by agreement between the commanders involved. The senior Judge Advocate may delegate this authority to commander or chief of the command claims service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS A&amp;M IN HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Its Cotton Bowl hopes extinguished with Texas' 23-13 victory Saturday over  Baylor, Texas A&amp;M accepted a bid from the Holiday Bowl after a 56-10  victory over Texas Christian.  </P> <P> And a few minutes after the traditional trading of congratulations and glowing  praise between school and bowl officials, Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum  turned his attention to the Holiday Bowl matchup Dec. 29 with No. 4 Brigham  Young, the Western Athletic Conference champion, and Heisman Trophy candidate  Ty Detmer.  </P> <P> "We're excited about the opportunity to play what I think is probably the best  (college) football team in the country," Slocum said. "That guy Ty Detmer has  my vote for Heisman Trophy."  </P> <P> Actually, Slocum doesn't get a vote, but that's OK. He didn't give defensive  coordinator Bob Davies a vote on whether the Aggie defense wants to face the  No. 2 offense in the nation (562 yards and 44 points a game).  </P> <P> "We didn't ask Bob Davies for his vote," Slocum said wryly. "Obviously, the  head coach made this decision. This presents a great challenge for our defense.  </P> <P> "(Holiday Bowl team selection committee chairman) Vinnie (Vinson) kind of hurt  my feelings a while ago when he said he thought the (Holiday Bowl) score could  be 48-47. As an old defensive coordinator, that kind of hurts."  </P></p>

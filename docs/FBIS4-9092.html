			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--Decisions were made, we all admitted  our mistakes--matters must move on, President Lech Walesa said  during his news conference on Wednesday at the Sejm, commenting  on his earlier meeting with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  parliamentary floor group.    "I am satisfied with the apology and the admission that I  was  right, after all," Walesa said. During the meeting with the SLD  group, its leader, Aleksander Kwasniewski, had acknowledged that  the president was the author of the citizens' constitutional  initiative. "I am not saying this in order to fight, in order to  prove who was better. It is good that we have removed one of the  problems that makes cooperation possible," the president added.    Lech Walesa said there had been no concessions on either  side; there was the logic of facts and "a logic that said that a  platform for talks has to be found." Answering a question from  journalists on what he had won as a result of the meeting,  Walesa replied, "I do not want to win anything for myself; I  want to win peace, calm, and a good solution for Poland, and  this has been achieved for today, it seems. There will be no  tinkering with the Small Constitution, there will be no attempt  on the powers of parliament and the president. We are left with  work."    Asked by journalists if he accepts the coalition's aim of  putting its representatives into the posts of deputy ministers  in the ministries subordinate to him--Foreign Affairs, Internal  Affairs, and National Defense--the president recalled the plan  by Foreign Ministry head Olechowski, under which the political  structures in his ministry would be made separate from the  organizational structures, staffed by professionals. "If the  coalition accepts that plan and brings it into those three  ministries, I have nothing against that," Walesa said, adding  that the agreement of the ministries concerned would, of course,  be essential.    "If need be, of course--yes," the president said in answer  to  a question on whether he will soon meet representatives of the  coalition. He added that, "for today," he does not see such a  need. In the president's opinion, a suitable forum for this type  of regular meeting in the future would be the National Security  Council.    Walesa announced that he would soon be visiting all of  Poland's provinces. The president denied that this is to be the  beginning of his election campaign. "Encouraging people to take  part in the local self-government elections, to make good  election choices, that is not an election campaign, it is  helping all those people who take the good of Poland seriously."</p>

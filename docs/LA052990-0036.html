			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> We Didn't Start the Rumors: Billy Joel is trying to squelch stories that his  marriage to Christie Brinkley is in trouble.  </P> <P> The reports started when Brinkley was seen with race car driver Danny Sullivan,  and escalated with a tabloid story about Joel and another woman. "Our marriage  is very solid," the singer told People magazine. "It always has been. I guess  when celebrity news is slow, the press starts cooking up the old Billy-Christie  split story. The most aggravating thing about it is that there is a child  involved here (Alexa Ray, 4, their daughter) who is still young enough to be  troubled by these rumors. I say enough is enough. Leave us alone." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

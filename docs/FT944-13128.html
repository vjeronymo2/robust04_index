			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (5): Action plan for business - Industrial policy You can always tell the pioneer in Portugal, he's the one with the arrows in his back. This was one of the unofficial findings of an extensive study of the Portuguese economy carried out under the direction of Michael Porter, Harvard's leading professor of business strategy and national competitiveness. Mr Porter's consulting company, Monitor, was sponsored by 47 of Portugal's top companies to spend a year investigating the country's economic strengths and weaknesses and to draw up a strategy for building competitiveness. One conclusion of the hefty report, produced earlier this year, is that Portugal needs action more than reports. Other findings by Monitor, which mobilised 500 people for the investigation throughout 1993, overturn long-held consensus views on Portugal's problems and how to overcome them. If Mr Porter's assessment that anti-individualism is hampering progress is correct, business leaders who are already beginning to act on his proposals will find their backs becoming extremely sore. Brushing management jargon aside, Monitor investigators describe the hierarchies and bureaucracies they believe are obstructing Portugal's development as a 'cover your ass' attitude. Attitudes have been moulded by a long history of autocratic rulers, they say, from the despotism of the Marquis of Pombal in the 18th century through Salazar to a brief flirtation with a dictatorship of the proletariat following the 1974 revolution. Government in Portugal is still too big and powerful, argues Monitor, saying that the state's capacity to bestow patronage through the allocation of European Union funds serves to strengthen autocratic tendencies. Fearing reproof, the Portuguese shy away from individual initiative and take refuge in committees and red tape. People at the top of companies or civil service departments become out of touch because those lower down are reluctant to approach them. Because of this emphasis on government and institutions, Portugal tends to 'look for supply-side rather than demand-driven reforms'. According to Ian Smith, managing director of Monitor's European division: 'The result is a tendency to distribute capital that no one knows how to use, to build laboratories that conduct experiments that no one wants, or to plant trees that burn down because farmers have no incentive to care for them.' Portugal may be relieved to know it is not alone. Monitor believes the World Bank and the European Union commit the same sort of mistakes. The message that Mr Porter wants to get across is that individuals, not institutions, create change. His tenet that 'firms compete not nations' has particular relevance to Portugal, the report concludes. Portugal gives too much emphasis to macro-economic issues such as exchange-rate policy and financial markets, it finds, but neglects the concrete concerns of individual companies. 'That is like a tennis player watching the scoreboard instead of the ball,' says Mr Smith. Macro-economic policies are important but insufficient in themselves to improve living standards, says Monitor. Too much concern with them implies overlooking the need for business to 'achieve superior satisfaction of consumer needs, cost effectively'. The report challenges as 'deeply flawed' views long cherished by many Portuguese politicians and economists: the view that the country needs to build high-tech industries such as robotics, computers and biotechnology; that resources should be directed to sectors chosen as strategic; that big companies should be fostered as engines of growth; and, particularly, that the economy is dependent on too narrow a group of industries, such as agriculture and traditional products, mainly textiles and footwear. Monitor advises Portugal to focus on seven 'clusters' - groups of interconnected industries - which it identifies as: material and metals, forest products, petroleum and chemicals, transportation, food and beverages, housing and household goods, textiles and apparel, and tourism. These sectors already account for almost 90 per cent of exports and, according to Mr Porter's team, represent important strengths on which Portugal can build. The finding that Portugal's future lies in its traditional industries has provoked criticism that the Monitor team mobilised vast resources - and received a large fee - only to arrive at a conclusion that is plain common sense. Mr Smith replies that few people were talking common sense before the report came out but were discussing moving into sectors such as sub-micro technology, automobiles and jet fighters. 'We believe we have changed the debate for the better.' The government has welcomed Monitor's contribution to economic discussion. But the report has received a warmer response from the opposition Socialist Party (PS). 'Michael Porter has made a reasonable diagnosis of Portugal's problems and put forward positive proposals for the future,' says Antonio Guterres, the PS leader. He says the government, on the other hand, has sought to devalue the report. Monitor gives Portugal eight imperatives for becoming more competitive and suggests ways to implement them. The recommendations are: focus on sophisticated and demanding customers; formulate a competitive strategy; increase productivity; co-operate with suppliers, distribution channels and customers; create representative associations; build a home base; develop a civil society; and invest in human capital. The largest section of the report is on how to mobilise people to work for change. Concerned that its efforts may be blighted by bureaucracy, Monitor has left behind a network of task forces that are already beginning to challenge existing policies. 'Portugal has a lot of very good people,' says Mr Smith, 'It's up them to pick up these ideas and run with them.' They may have to dodge a few arrows on the way.</p>

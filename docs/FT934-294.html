			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: State near completion of Koor sell-off Israel's government is to sell its remaining shares in Koor Industries - Israel's largest trade and industrial conglomerate which is spearheading commercial links with Arab companies in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. The move follows the announcement that Koor and Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest banking group, have signed separate deals with Morrocan companies to set up investment and banking companies in the first concrete signs of a thawing of Arab-Jewish commercial relations. Koor said it was establishing a Dollars 60m joint venture company to make investments in the occupied territories with Moroccan and Palestinian partners. Bank Leumi said it had signed an agreement last week in Casablanca to set up a new commercial bank to operate in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soon to come under Palestinian self-rule. Together the projects mark an important breakthrough for Israel in developing trade and business ties with Arab partners after years when Israel was isolated by the Arab economic boycott which, although loosened recently, still remains in force. The opening of trade ties with Morocco also follows indications that King Hassan is preparing to broaden his country's economic co-operation with Israel in a package which includes an air agreement between El Al and Royal Moroc; direct telephone and mail links; and the exchange of business delegations. The government said next Thursday it would sell the last tranche of the 10.5 per cent of Koor's equity it acquired in 1989 as part of its role in saving the company from a financial crisis. The government has been selling off its stake over the past six months and now has only 1.9 per cent of the company to sell in an offering expected to fetch at least Dollars 27m. The sale will boost Koor's plans to exploit new business opportunities in the Middle East and help increase annual sales which last year reached Dollars 2.65bn.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Capital Radio advances by 33% to Pounds 11.7m Capital Radio, which yesterday announced a one third rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.7m for the year to September, is seriously considering applying for the third national commercial radio franchise. The Radio Authority will advertise the franchise, which has to be mainly speech-based, next week and the station could be on air by autumn 1994. Mr Richard Eyre, managing director, said: 'A lot of work needs to be done but it is too big a deal to turn down at this stage'. The format specified by the Radio Authority for the last national commercial channel in the UK for some time would mean that at least 51 per cent would have to be speech. Capital, on its two London services already offers music and sport and could add a more substantial news service. Capital's profit increase came after excluding the exceptional gain of more than Pounds 2m from the sale of the Duke of York's Theatre. Earnings per share rose by 30 per cent to 11.3p. The dividend is up by 9.5 per cent from 5.25p to 5.75p. Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, said yesterday there had been a revival of confidence in radio advertising in the last three months of the year. 'Our efforts to make radio more competitive in the media market place are bearing fruit,' he added. Turnover in existing businesses increased by 6.7 per cent while costs were cut by 1.2 per cent. In the six months since its acquisition, the chairman said the Midlands Radio group contributed Pounds 1.1m to group operating profits. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 14.5m for the current year. The main priority for Capital now is to retain its two London licences when they come up for renewal next summer. Mr Eyre said yesterday that Capital FM remained London's number one radio station with a 17.3 per cent share, 5 percentage points ahead of BBC Radio 1; Capital Gold remains the number two commercial station with an 8.5 per cent market share. The shares rose 14p to 223p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (EFE) -- Ernesto Samper  Pizano, who won the internal primary of the ruling Liberal Party  to select the presidential candidate for the upcoming 8 May  elections, appealed today for a "convergence to defend the  excluded."    Samper Pizano, a 43-year-old Bogota attorney and economist,  former financial leader, former senator, former minister, and  former ambassador to Spain, won the ruling Liberal Party's  "internal primary" and became the presidential candidate for the  1994-98 term to replace President Cesar Gaviria.    "I am satisfied and happy with the results," Samper said,  thanking those who voted for him in the primary, which was held  simultaneously with the legislative elections. He said he is  "committed with all Colombians of goodwill."    "Our challenge is to seek a new opportunity so the liberal  ideas will continue to prevail to the benefit of all  Colombians," Samper said. He vowed to return to the policy of  credibility. If he wins in May he will head the third  consecutive Liberal administration since 1986.    Ernesto Samper, whose victory will be affirmed on 18 March  during his party's national convention, obtained 46 percent of  the votes, beating Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lleras de la  Fuente, Carlos Lemos, Rodolfo Gonzalez, David Turbay, and Gloria  Gaitan.    Samper urged his rivals to "set aside our differences to  join  in the common task of reuniting, renewing, and transforming the  party, to achieve a rapprochement," not in exchange for  bureaucratic posts, rather, through "basic understanding."    He also announced the economic opening carried out by  current  President Gaviria, under whom Samper was development minister  and ambassador to Spain, must be complemented by creating more  jobs and "improving many Colombians' standards of living."    "The people have spoken and have shown they still trust  Liberalism, its principles and ideas, as the best way to govern  Colombia," Samper said. He said the liberal majority elected in  the Congress today "must be confirmed by a triumph in the  presidential elections."    "The people of Colombia, as in other parts of Latin America,  want a change of course. They want more job opportunities and  better living conditions for their families," the Colombian  candidate stated.    Although the 8 May presidential elections will have 10  candidates from different parties, Samper and Conservative  presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana are favorites and have  registered a "technical tie," according to recent polls.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Utah Admin.

R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application for a major coal exploration permit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations.

Substantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules That Are Substantially Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed revisions to the following rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantially identical to the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Utah Admin.

R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah Admin.

The Director approves these proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310, Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration'' instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in relation to an approved permit area.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 15017&hyph;8; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve, as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application, and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant to the appropriate rules for coal exploration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, 645&hyph;201&hyph;223, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;310 are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves these proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220, 645&hyph;200&hyph;230, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130, Responsibilities of the Division and Coal Exploration Plan Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed revisions to its rules at (1) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and enforce the terms of each notice of intention to conduct coal exploration; (2) Utah Amin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;230 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and approve or disapprove major coal exploration applications and issue, condition, suspend, revoke, and enforce major coal exploration permits and coordinate with other government agencies; and (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review coal exploration plans on lands which are not subject to the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, and to provide that, on lands [Federal lands] where the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 apply, the review of coal exploration plans will be guided by the appropriate part of 43 CFR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 772 establish the requirements and procedures applicable to coal exploration operations on all lands except for Federal lands subject to the requirements of 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487. The Federal regulations at 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 pertain to operations for the exploration, development, and production of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The responsibility for administration of the Mineral Leasing Act is vested with the Bureau of Land Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

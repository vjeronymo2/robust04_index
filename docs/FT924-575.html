			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: French retailers caught in a chilly climate - Alice Rawsthorn examines a series of upsets in the sector which is facing intense pressure on prices WHEN Mr Jean-Jacques Delort this week resigned as chairman of Printemps, one of France's most famous department store groups, he closed the latest chapter in the saga of French retailing. His departure, following a row with Mr Francois Pinault, whose industrial group acquired Printemps last year, is only one of the dramas to have hit French retailing in the past week. Tesco, the UK supermarket group, last Friday took control of Catteau, a chain in northern France. On the same day, Carrefour, one of the biggest French retailers whose chairman, Mr Michel Bon, resigned this autumn after reporting a sharp fall in interim profits, announced that November's sales had been 'the worst in (its) history', and issued a profits warning. The French retail sector is struggling against weak demand and pressure on prices at a time when Germany's heavy discounters are expanding into France and the big indigenous groups - Promodes and Casino, as well as Carrefour and Pinault-Printemps - are digesting sizeable acquisitions. These problems are aggravated by the historically low profitability of some areas of French retailing, notably food. 'Life has been tough in French retailing for a couple of years, but it has become much, much tougher this year,' said Ms Christiane Thorne, European retailing analyst at UBS Philips &amp; Drew in London. The crux of the problem is consumer confidence which has been hit by high real interest rates and concern about rising unemployment. Some retail sectors, such as clothing, have also been affected by the unseasonally dull summer and mild winter. Hypermarkets saw their sales slip by 0.7 per cent in the first three quarters of this year. Department store sales fell by 2.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the trend for people to trade down to cheaper goods has squeezed margins. Retailers' attempts to adapt to this chilly climate has been hampered by the internal changes within the industry. First, the German discounters, notably Aldi and Norma, have become increasingly aggressive in the food sector. The Germans have accelerated their openings in France over the past two years prompting, the French to expand their own discount chains, as Carrefour has done with Europa and Ed l'Epicier. The discounters are expanding at a time when the saturated state of the French food market is making it more difficult for established retailers to open new outlets. Many of the major players have been forced to contract by closing poorly-performing stores. This problem, combined with the need to increase purchasing power to remain competitive in negotiations with the multinational food manufacturers, such as Unilever and Nestle, has catalysed the recent stream of acquisitions that has reshaped French food retailing. Small companies such as Catteau, a family-owned chain of 90 stores in northern France, have been forced to sell out to larger players, in its case to Tesco. Similarly, Carrefour last year acquired Euromarche and Montlaur, just as Casino this summer took over Rallye. There have been similar deals in other areas of retailing. Pinault's controversial takeover of Printemps included the Conforama furniture shops and La Redoute mail order catalogue as well as the department stores. These acquisitions have intensified the pressure on smaller companies. They have also destabilised the larger groups, thereby making them more vulnerable to the economic slowdown. Pinault-Printemps has been left with heavy debts and prey to boardroom rows of the type that triggered Mr Delort's departure. Carrefour and Casino have hit the downturn at a time when they are still trying to integrate their acquisitions and are not yet able to benefit from their improved purchasing power. Similarly, Promodes is still digesting Plaza, a German business bought last year. 'These companies were all over-optimistic about their acquisitions,' said Ms Claire Kent, European retailing analyst with Morgan Stanley in London. 'The economic slowdown undoubtedly means it will take longer to bring them up to an acceptable level of profitability.' At the same time, the economy shows no sign of improvement. A survey published yesterday by INSEE, the state statistics institute, indicated that more than half the French expect their standard of living to deteriorate over the next few months. Even if interest rates fall, there is no real hope of a recovery in consumer spending until after the March elections. Tesco has chosen a very tricky time to enter French retailing. 'Tesco did say that it saw the Catteau deal as a learning experience,' said Ms Thorne. 'Let's hope it meant it]'</p>

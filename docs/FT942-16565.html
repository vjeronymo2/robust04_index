			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hewitt hit by German activities Hewitt Group, the manu-facturer of industrial ceramics and refractories, saw pre-tax profits drop from Pounds 832,000 to Pounds 8,000 in 1993, primarily because of problems in its German operations. The shortfall had been flagged in a profits warning in January, and the shares rose 1p to 171p yesterday. Turnover rose to Pounds 11m (Pounds 7.76m), helped by an acquisition, while the pre-tax result was buoyed by a Pounds 284,000 profit from the sale of fixed assets and Pounds 166,000 from an associated company. The German subsidiary, Hewitt Industriekeramik, had second half sales significantly below projections, and Hewitt Refractories also suffered because one of its main clients stopped producing storage heaters. It has, however, recently picked up two long-term contracts, which should ensure sales growth in the current year. In April 1993 Hewitt invested Pounds 1.9m in the purchase of 50 per cent of Sphinx Technical Ceramics, and in the nine months to December that company achieved operating profits of Pounds 774,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 450,000. Losses per share emerged at 8.3p (14.8p earnings), but an unchanged final dividend of 1.75p is proposed, making a total of 3.25p (3p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paolo Franchi commentary: "Umberto the Tactician"] </F>   [Text] That much-maligned thing, politics, may not be an  art. But it does seem likely to remain, in our country too, a  discipline having its own rules, its own "fundamental articles,"  and its own internal codes. A discipline in which we are not  all equally expert. Moreover, a discipline whose professionals  reveal their real capabilities when everything seems to militate  against them. And they are forced -- as in the case of Umberto  Bossi, as Lucio Colletti highlighted in this newspaper Saturday  [7 May] -- to perform tightrope acts to try to get out of a very  dangerous predicament.    Let us be clear about this. In such an act, the business of  the Interior Ministry was just an initial step; further very  dangerous steps lay ahead for the League's acrobat, starting  with the imminent European elections. But it was undoubtedly a  crucial test. If, as seems to be the case, in the list of  ministers that Silvio Berlusconi will submit to the chief of  state today, the Interior Ministry will be allocated to Roberto  Maroni, the League will deserve some congratulations, and it is  pointless to deny it. This, if only from those who have never  believed that the demise of the First Republic entailed the  inevitable shelving of politics. For days and days, in the  crude -- to say the least -- language to which the League itself  has greatly helped to accustom us, we have wondered whether, to  what extent, and how Bossi had "adopted a posture of submission"  after Berlusconi's rejection of Maroni's candidacy, for reasons  which, curiously, the prime minister- designate deemed too  delicate to convey to the public.    We wondered about the actual likelihood that [Judge] Antonio  Di Pietro -- perhaps in response to an improbable demand by  [President] Scalfaro -- had acted as a "deus ex machina." An  ever longer and vaguer list was drawn up of other authoritative  magistrates who could have replaced Di Pietro, after his  refusal. We paid serious heed to the League leader's latest  diversion tactic, his suggestion of the Milan police chief  [Achille Serra] as a possible interior minister.    Sooner or later, and rather sooner than later, we will  discover the real background to this incredible performance.  However, even now we must acknowledge that Bossi has proved to  be the most skillful in this game of names. Committed not only,  and not so much, to securing for the League the ministry that  was once the symbol of the eternity of DC [Christian Democratic  Party] power, but also, and above all, to demonstrating what an  arduous task it will be for Berlusconi to transform himself from  the unquestioned winner of the elections into the authoritative  prime minister of the Second Republic. On the basis of the way  things have turned out, Bossi could say that he has succeeded in  this latter, and for him more vital, operation, even if at the  last moment Maroni himself were to fall victim to the hail of  intersecting vetoes.    We are talking about tactics, of course. About the certain  amount of totally unscrupulous tactics which, with apologies to  the proponents of new-style ethics, the formation of a coalition  government necessarily entails -- and this, not through any  unavowable sin on the part of the coalition partners. Strategy  is another matter, of course. Even for that tightrope walker,  Bossi. Let him make the most of things while he can. But he is  probably the first to realize that he needs to resort to  something more than clever maneuvering and perhaps some  half-baked fellow-feeling with the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] in order to impart a new boost to the League.</p>

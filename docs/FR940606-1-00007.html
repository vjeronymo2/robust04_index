Robins AFB has a full time air traffic control tower. This notice further proposes to amend Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, by removing Robins AFB from the Macon, Georgia, Class D description. This notice also proposes to establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when the Middle Georgia Regional Airport control tower is closed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before: July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;6, Manager, System Management Branch, ASO&hyph;530, P.O.

Box 20636, Atlanta, Georgia 30320. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM.

Additionally, the FAA is proposing to amend Class D airspace and establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Prior to Airspace Reclassification an Airport Traffic Area (ATA) and a control zone existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zones,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace''. Robins AFB was incorporated in the Class D airspace for Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full time control tower. However, the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower, which controls aircraft for the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, is part-time. The intended effect of this proposal is to amend the Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport by removing Robins AFB from the Macon, Georgia Class D Airspace and designation. This notice also proposes to establish Class E surface airspace at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, to provide adequate controlled airspace for instrument approach procedures when the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower is closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

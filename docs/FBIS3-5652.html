			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago in Washington] </F>   [Text] On 28 February, the Japanese Embassy in the United  States began to send officials to visit major U.S. newspapers to  explain its view on the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR)  charge that Japan has violated an agreement in the portable and  car phone sector. The embassy seeks to gain the U.S. news  media's understanding by explaining that "the USTR's charge is  full of errors." But some people are cool toward this, saying:  "What Japan should do promptly is to talk with the U.S.  Government rather than do public relations work with the news  media."    The embassy, after consulting with the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, prepared a paper entitled "Refutation of the  USTR's Claim" in English, and explained it to newspapers like  THE WASHINGTON POST and THE WALL STREET JOURNAL individually.  In the paper, the embassy rebuts almost all points raised by  USTR Mickey Kantor on 15 February as violations of an agreement  by Japan. The paper cites specific reasons in refuting the U.S.  charge as a "misunderstanding of facts" or an "incomprehensible  assertion."    The U.S. news media, in reporting on the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, took the position of criticizing the Clinton  administration with respect to its demands for objective  criteria, thus making favorable reports on Japan. But as far as  the portable and car phone issue was concerned, the news media  supported the USTR's assertion, and most major newspapers  criticized Japan in their editorials. Given this situation,  Japan appears to have decided that it should do public relations  work with the U.S. news media in this regard.    After listening to Japan's explanation, a major newspaper's  reporter gave a wry smile and said: "I see that the U.S demands  are rather unreasonable. But what surprises me most is that the  Japanese and the U.S. Governments are too different in their  perceptions and stands." Another said: "The gaps between the  two governments should be filled by the governments themselves.  The news media cannot do that for them."</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN MEMORY OF ANGEL CLARE BY CHRISTOPHER BRAM (PLUME: $9.95)  </P> <P> In this uneven novel, Christopher Bram attempts to tackle the daunting problem  of how to cope with the loss of a young and talented person to AIDS. Months  after the death of budding film director Clarence (Clare) Laird, his  intellectual New York friends are getting on with their lives and careers, but  his former lover, Michael Sousza, remains in limbo.  </P> <P> Clare's friends always regarded him as vacuous and self-involved, and they were  apparently right. He remains a widowed cipher, displaying his grief like a  purple heart. The reader soon tires of him, and joins the other characters in  wishing Michael would get a life -- somewhere else. The narrative falters badly  near the conclusion, as the action flashes backward, forward and sideways; Bram  is obviously a capable writer, but he doesn't seem to know what he wants to say  about the phenomenon of AIDS "widowhood."  </P></p>

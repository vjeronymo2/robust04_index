			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla returns to profit The improving fortunes of the Finnish forestry sector were underlined yesterday when Metsa-Serla unveiled a FM269m (Dollars 49m) profit after financial items for 1993. The group said the result represented a FM559m swing from a FM290m loss in 1992. It is the second Finnish forestry company this week to announce a return to the black, following several years of losses. Enso-Gutzeit announced a FM385m profit for 1993 on Wednesday after a FM192m deficit in 1992. Both groups benefited from cost-cutting, the weaker Finnish markka, and lower domestic costs rather than any upturn in market conditions. Metsa-Serla saw sales rise to FM8.24bn from FM7.75bn. It said its three main divisions all contributed to an increased operating profit of FM964m, compared with FM718m in 1992. Paper and paperboard showed the biggest improvement, doubling operating profits to FM414m from FM199m. Corrugated board and tissue profits improved to FM382m from FM352m, while sawn goods, pulp and chemicals rose to FM263m from FM189m. Another benefit came from lower interest costs, which helped reduce net financial expenses to FM695m from FM1.01bn. The group expects a further improvement in its result this year, due to improving prices, higher volumes and reduced financial costs. Commenting on market prospects, it noted: 'The over-supply situation is expected to ease, but for many products a balance between supply and demand is unlikely in the near future.' The group strengthened its financial position considerably last year, helped by an international share issue and the sale of more than half its stake in Repola, Finland's largest industrial group. Gearing fell to 73.6 per cent from 178.3 per cent. Metsa-Serla is restoring its dividend, after a two-year suspension. It proposes to pay FM2.00 per share.</p>

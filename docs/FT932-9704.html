			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila picks way round obstacles to new heights - The recent equity market rally The Philippine stock market appears to be taking a breather from a record-breaking frenzy since late April. However, analysts expect the rise to resume after the market consolidates this week from an overbought position. The composite index closed yesterday at 1,642, down from a record high of 1,654 on May 5. Excess liquidity caused by a reduction in the volume of Treasury bills auctioned by the Central Bank in early April has kindled interest in equities. According to Mr Francisco Liboro, research head at Belson Securities, technical factors have also favoured a rise in the market. In spite of optimism over the economy since early this year, the market had been trading below the previous peak of 1,581 registered in June last year after the country's first peaceful general election in 25 years. The past two weeks' hectic trading has also pushed turnover to an average 510m pesos (Dollars 21.2m) a day in the first week of May, almost double the usual volume. The sharp increase in turnover is giving analysts reason to believe that the market advance could be sustained for some time. However, fundamentals leave much to be desired. The government has scaled down this year's GDP target to 3.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent because of the adverse effects of the daily power cuts in the main Luzon island, and the failure of a scheme to 'pump-prime' the economy by advancing the implementation of infrastructure projects to the first half of the year. Even that goal may be difficult to attain. Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says his organisation's analysis suggests a 2.5 per cent growth in GDP this year because of the power problem. But he adds that 'the real growth' should come late this year when new power plants are expected to come on line. Corporate earnings, earlier projected to grow by about 20 per cent this year, have not moved as expected. Philippine Long Distance Telephone, for instance, yesterday reported a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter net profits because of a sharp rise in dividend payments to preferred shareholders during the period. Optimism, however, is expected to be sustained by lower domestic interest rates and inflation. Rates on Treasury bills dropped to 11.6 per cent on average last week, compared with 15 per cent at the end of last year. A bill now being debated in congress will establish a new Central Monetary Authority that will replace the Central Bank. Designed to be able to exercise more independence from the incumbent administrations, the new CMA is seen as being more effective in further bringing down interest rates. Since the start of the year the composite index has gained more than 30 per cent, with such favourites as San Miguel advancing 51 per cent, Ayala 20 per cent and PLDT 15 per cent. Among recently listed issues, Manila Electric has already surged 106 per cent since the start of the year, and International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) 75 per cent. Analysts expect such 'recession-proof' stocks as ICTSI and PLDT to continue to lead any market advance in the coming months. PLDT should benefit from the recent drop in the peso rate against the US dollar: the peso has declined by as much as 7.5 per cent from its end-1992 level in spite of occasional central bank intervention. At the height of last week's rally, the market was trading at a price/earnings multiple of about 13. Analysts forecast that in a period of economic recovery the market can grow to a p/e of at least 15. As such, most analysts see room for further growth among equities. Brokerage houses are already talking of a new high of 1,750 and if economic recovery gets under way the target could be 1,800 by the end of the year. A further decline in interest rates is expected to favour corporate earnings, although a reversal of the current trend may develop in the third quarter. Coinciding with a reduction in the bank reserves required against deposits, this should lead to bigger amounts available for lending to corporations. On the other hand, the peso decline should boost earnings of export-oriented companies, including some of the mining companies now largely ignored by investors.</p>

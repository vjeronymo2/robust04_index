			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Engineers are 'well placed' for upturn BRITAIN'S engineering sector is well placed to take advantage of an upturn in the economy, according to a report published today by Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham stockbroker. It says engineering companies are more competitive than at any time in the past 20 years and are capable of performing strongly in world markets. The broker says this is acknowledged by overseas competitors, but remains largely unrecognised in the UK. Mr Tim Bennett and Mr John Dean, the stockbroker's engineering analysts, say that many engineering businesses have become more internationally oriented. They say: 'Instead of just fighting their own corner in the UK and looking nervously over their shoulder at the inroads foreign competition might make, they are out pitching for new business in international markets, realising they now have a competitive edge.' UK Engineering Directory, Albert E Sharp, 12 Newhall St, Birmingham B3 3ER. Pounds 180.</p>

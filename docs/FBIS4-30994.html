Mr. Meksi was called to the  parliament by the SP [Socialist Party] deputies.    Deputy Dokle who took the floor first presented once again  the requests and claims of his parliamentary group for the law  violations in the electoral [passage indistinct] Prime Minister  Meksi said he was called by the chairman of the SP Parliamentary  Group, Namik Dokle, to give explanations about the elections  held on May 29 in some communes. In Greshica, the door was  broken and the lights were turned off; thus, the ballot box had  been manipulated. According to the Socialist Party, there were  also tumults in the Libofsh village where persons from both  sides had been confronted. There have been SP deputies including  Namik Dokle. As soon as the president and the government were  informed midday on Sunday, they asked the attorney general and  the general director of the police to send there a control group  which asked, controlled, verified and ascertained that the  elections were being held in a normal way. Thus, what had  happened was outside the ballot boxes.    Premier Meksi emphasized that our country needs quietness  and  not destabilization. But when destabilization is provoked,  those who incite seek to multiply it. There have been elections  in 30 villages, but only in Greshica were there irregularities  in the ballot boxes and in Libofsha outside the elections.  Libofsha was a tense political arena even before the election.  At the same time, I would underline that on May 28, a day  before the elections when the electoral campaign is forbidden,  certain persons went to Libofsha and lodged slanders and insults  against the Democratic Party. "I would say that, in general,  democracy requires free and quiet elections. The ballot box  keeps the will of the people and we should learn to obey results  of the elections."</p>

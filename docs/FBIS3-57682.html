			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 27,-- Lithuania signed up for  NATO's new limited partnership plan Thursday [27 January],  becoming the first former Soviet republic to embrace the deal.    Before signing the partnership document at the NATO  headquarters, President Algirdas Brazauskas, stressed  Lithuania's plans to eventually join the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization.    "As she begins her participation in the `Partnership for  Peace' program, Lithuania has a clear goal of becoming a  fully-fledged NATO member," Brazauskas told ambassadors of the  16 NATO nations.    That aim could bring a clash with Russia, Lithuania's mighty  neighbor and former ruler.    Moscow opposes any eastward expansion of the Western  military  alliance and reacted with alarm earlier this month, when  Lithuania became the first of its former Warsaw Pact satellites  to formally apply for NATO membership.    President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav  Kostikov warned then that Lithuania's move could provoke "a  negative reaction in Russian public opinion" and play into the  hands of the country's extreme nationalists.    Brazauskas sought to allay Russian fears.    "Lithuania's position regarding NATO membership is not  directed against any neighboring or other European states," he  said in a speech at NATO headquarters.    The integration of Eastern European nations into NATO and  other Western structures would "significantly support the  strengthening and continuity of democratic processes in Russia,"  he added.    Lithuania became the second former Warsaw Pact state to  accept the "Partnership for Peace" offer made earlier in the  month at a summit of alliance leaders. Romania signed up on  Wednesday. [passage omitted]    Brazauskas echoed the determination of other leaders that  the  partnership must be a step toward membership -- not a  replacement for it.    "I imagine that this initiative does not completely satisfy  every state that is striving for closer proximity to or  membership of NATO," he said.    "It is a compromise plan."    Under the partnership proposal, the East Europeans must  share  information about defense budgets and defense forces, promise  civilian control over the military and standardize weapons  systems.    Each nation is expected to work out a specific work plan  with  the allies, tailored to its needs and capabilities.</p>

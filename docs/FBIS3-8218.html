The attacks were directed at the positions of the fighters  of  the 201st Brigade in the Bijela Ploca-(Herdovace) region with  the substantial support of tanks, mortars, guns, and  self-propelled antiaircraft artillery [praga]. The chetniks  also attempted an infantry breakthrough. However, the situation  is most difficult for the civilian population of Maglaj which is  being exposed to constant artillery activities.    A general alarm was again sounded at 0830 this morning. The  shelling of Maglaj lasted throughout yesterday and overnight --  first came aircraft bombs and then attacks from howitzers,  tanks, mortars, and Bofors guns. More than 500 shells have been  fired, killing four civilians and injuring nine.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The all-party conference of national leaders in  Karachi today adopted a resolution calling for the seizure of  all illegal arms in Sindh Province. The conference participants  condemned the politics of violence. The resolution says the  time has now come for the government and the opposition to  resolve their differences through negotiations, as their  continued confrontation is against the interests of the province  and the country. The resolution adds that since problems cannot  be settled through the use of force, political problems should  be resolved only through mutual dialogue.    The conference unanimously adopted another resolution,  expressing the hope that Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear  program unilaterally. The resolution says Pakistan has always  opposed the use of force and its nuclear program is solely for  peaceful purposes. The resolution also says the international  community can easily assess India's ambitions from its recent  statement about its nuclear program.    In yet another resolution, the conference appealed to  Islamic  countries to support the struggle of the Kashmiri people.</p>

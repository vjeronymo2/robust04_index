			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: US economy Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is a pleasant enough place for Federal Reserve governors to spend a weekend ruminating on the prospects for the US economy. Given the forces currently at work on the US economy, however, Tokyo or Paris might have been more relevant places to meet. The US has happily watched the yen appreciate all year, presumably on the theory that this will put pressure on Japanese exports and force the Japanese to reflate their economy. Yet that is to reckon without the scarring experience of the bubble economy, the caution of the new government or the shift of Japanese manufacturing into other Pacific rim economies with currencies linked to the dollar. The weakness of US exports to Europe is another reason to suppose that the Federal Reserve cannot rely on export strength to power the US recovery. The dollar has hardly gained a competitive edge against European currencies this year, and continental European demand remains very weak. Admittedly, with expectations of US growth slowing, monetary aggregates hardly suggesting a strong upturn, and the budget deal adding to tax bills, Fed governors have plenty of domestic problems to address. The rally in the Treasury bond market suggests that inflation offers no sustained threat, and the Fed may have questioned its bias towards raising interest rates at last week's Open Market Committee meeting. That leaves the stock market caught between an inflow of funds, and the fading prospect that earnings increases will be fuelled by sales growth rather than cost-cutting.</p>

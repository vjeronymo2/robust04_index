			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Dutch Bonds: Yield gap with German bunds expected to narrow DUTCH government bonds are set to outperform other D-Mark bloc markets near-term, underpinned by their supply advantage, but the yield gap between Dutch and German bonds is expected to narrow towards year-end as Dutch issuance resumes and the two countries' inflation rates begin to converge. With Thursday's sale of Fl 2.8bn of 30-year 7.5 per cent Dutch State Loans the government has all but completed its 1993 funding programme, leaving only some Fl 1.5bn to be raised through private placements and on the money market. Last week's auction of state loans was a roaring success, boosted by heavy bidding from foreign investors who snapped up about 90 per cent of the issue. There will be no more auctions until the end of the year, when the government starts front-funding next year's deficit. 'We plan to hold our traditional December issue around mid-December,' said an official at the national debt office. The 1994 borrowing requirement is set at Fl 51.5bn, barring any early redemptions to the government. This year, such early redemptions cut the funding requirement to Fl 40.7bn from a forecast Fl 45bn, the official said. The Dutch supply situation compares favourably with that of Germany, where the bund market will have to digest another four long-dated issues and three medium-dated debt issues, which are expected to total around DM50bn, before the end of the year. A further advantage over Germany is that the Dutch bond market, with maturities of up to 30 years, offers investors a significant duration pick-up over bunds, the maximum maturity of which is 10 years. 'For duration-junkies, this is the place to be,' says a trader. France also has a liquid 30-year sector but currency worries there have been putting many investors off. The past few weeks have seen widespread maturity-lengthening by international investors amid fading hopes for near-term interest rate cuts. Central banks across Europe are waiting for the Bundesbank to kick off the next round of rate cuts, but even when that does happen, the easing pace is expected to remain very cautious, underpinning longer maturities most. 'On the Dutch yield curve, the best strategy is the duration strategy,' said Mr Torsten Bohler, bond analyst at UBS. Despite last week's surge, the 30-year 7.5 per cent bond still looks quite cheap, said one trader, who pointed out that at 51 basis points, the spread between the 30-year and 10-year yield was well above its 39 basis point low earlier this year. The bond also looks attractive compared with the US long bond, offering a yield pick-up of some 42 basis points. Lastly, the Dutch 30-year is one of the few bonds in Europe's core markets that offers a positive cost of carry - a yield above money-market funding rates. Dutch three-month money currently trades around 6.28 per cent while the 30-year bond yields some 6.39 per cent. In the 10-year sector, Mr Bohler at UBS expects the Dutch yield to move as much as 20 basis points below the bund yield near-term, largely on the supply argument. Late on Friday, the yield gap was nine basis points. However, the market's outperformance may not last far into the next year as the Dutch economy, which stagnated this year, stages a faster recovery than Germany's. UBS is forecasting GDP growth of 1.5 per cent, compared with forecasts for 0.7 per cent German GDP growth. Moreover, with the Dutch guilder firmly pegged to the D-Mark, there is little scope for currency appreciation on economic outperformance. Meanwhile, the inflation gap between the two countries, which has helped boost the Dutch market, is widely expected to narrow to around 0.5 per cent next year, implying that Dutch yields will move back into line with Germany's. Dutch inflation in August was 2.0 per cent, compared with Germany's 4.2 per cent. A Dutch September inflation number clearly below 2 per cent is expected to be released this week; in Germany, the September rate was 4.0 per cent. The Dutch elections, expected in May, could also cause temporary volatility, although most observers feel that, whichever party wins, the country's commitment to running a tight fiscal policy will remain on course.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> Robert Kotian; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To  Limit Ourselves to Six Months"]    [Text] [Kotian] Journalist Marian Lesko commented on the  previous government with the maxim that it could not govern the  way it wanted and did not want to govern the way it could. How  does your government want to govern, and how will it be able to  govern in the six months allotted to it?    [Moravcik] Although the factor of the six-month term  significantly affects our operation and decisionmaking, we do  not want to limit our program to this term--i.e., we are  designing the program so that it is based on a long-term concept  and development trends we want to outline and, in the coming six  months, do something for their implementation. That is the  general approach. From this point of view, we do not want to  limit our ideas in designing the government policy to the  six-month term.    [Kotian] Could you be more specific regarding the most  important long-term trends?    [Moravcik] The economy is our number-one priority, although  development trends must also be launched in the social sphere.  In the economy, it is the fast transformation, which in turn  requires accelerated privatization. Privatization must be  executed so that it is a part of the economic concept--i.e.,  that it create conditions for the solution of economic problems.    [Kotian] A lot has been heard recently about legal and  ethical doubts, about hectic privatization measures of the  previous government. How do you intend to deal with this  problem?    [Moravcik] From the vantage point of privatization, in  general, it is a minor problem. We do not want to lose much  time on this. It must be settled as fast as possible.    [Kotian] Your political adversaries claim that the broad  coalition is held together by fear of Meciar and the interest in  privatization. How do you argue against claims that the  interests of political entities are your main concern in  privatization?    [Moravcik] That cannot be argued, but, by deeds--we must  consistently implement the basic approach of achieving  transparency in privatization--projects will be published so  that everybody can learn who privatizes what--i.e., make  privatization subject to public control.    [Kotian] What is the place of the second wave of  privatization in your concept?    [Moravcik] We are just now contemplating its extent.  However, if we wish it to have a meaning, its extent cannot be  significantly smaller than in the first wave. We want to do  everything in our power for it to be executed before or at least  soon after the elections.    [Kotian] Milan Knazko told SME that your government will not  be election-conscious but, rather, has to implement some very  unpopular measures. How do you personally deal with the  internal dilemma of not being election-conscious but, at the  same time, not fail in the elections. You certainly want you or  a similar government to continue in the aforementioned trends.    [Moravcik] Obviously, a balanced approach must be found. To  act with just the elections in mind would be in direct  contradiction to our political beliefs. It is necessary to work  for the benefit of the country--if I can phrase it so--and I  believe that we can convince the citizens of this country that  some measures are necessary even if they are unpopular. From  this point of view, I would not perceive election interests as  an effort to be popular at any cost. After all, that would not  even be convincing.    [Kotian] It may be convincing for a citizen, in the negative  sense, if you adopt unpopular measures without a convincing  justification or if you adopt solely unpopular measures.    [Moravcik] Of course, we have reckoned with that. There is  a limit in the unpopular measures, beyond which we cannot go,  not because of the elections but, rather, because we have to  consider the social acceptability. We have to move within these  limits.    [Kotian] Could you possibly indicate now some of the  measures that could make life easier for, let us say,  physicians, teachers, pensioners, businessmen...?    [Moravcik] It is difficult to talk about it now because we  have to take another look at the budget first. Even if we take  some measures concerning transport or pension indexation, or  public catering in educational and health-care institutions, we  would like the impact to differentiate between those who are at  a certain level of social minimum and those who can afford it.  In simple words, regardless of the position of the vantage  point in the political spectrum, we cannot impoverish the  country or move a large number of people below the sustenance  minimum.    [Kotian] How do you want to convincingly address the trade  unions, to whom the former prime minister laid it on with a  trowel by the adopted General Agreement?    [Moravcik] We propose to change the General Agreement, in  general, and some of its stipulations, in particular. The  biggest problem is the arduous question of the social fund, and  we must explain in actual figures whether the implementation of  such a demand would bring the desired effect. We must reflect  this problem onto its macroeconomic correlations and consider  its feedback in the social sphere.    [Kotian] The IMF supplement to the Slovak Government  Memorandum is a considerable problem. You decided to accept it,  although it will translate into restrictive measures. Can you  give us some details of this amendment as well as the measures  to moderate its impact?    [Moravcik] So far, this supplement is not really topical  because we are building on the assumption that, if we find  another way of securing the objective, an agreement with the IMF  can always be reached.    [Kotian] Do you know another way of securing the objective?    [Moravcik] For example, it is not acceptable to us that we  implement the value-added tax according to this proposal. This  means that we will have to distribute the cost of these measures  to society in a differentiating fashion, according to the social  strata. Hence, if the price of food were increased, we would  have to take care of a pay raise for certain groups of  population. Thus, the increase in the price of food would not  be so drastic.    [Kotian] Do you have in mind some sort of compensatory  allowance?    [Moravcik] It is rather a raising of pensions and income.  This society must maintain a certain culture, and this includes  security for people with lower incomes.    [Kotian] A new body emerged at the time of the coalition  talks--the Coalition Council, which is to smooth the rough edges  between the individual entities represented in the government.  Does the Coalition Council limit your powers?    [Moravcik] So far, the Coalition Council has been helping.  I am convinced that I will be able to repeat this at the end of  my term of office. We discuss the principal problems at these  talks. We come up with certain ideas that are examined here, and  thereby we are assured that our decision is correct.    [Kotian] How do you see the prospects of such a coalition  council, of such a cooperative form of government?    [Moravcik] I believe, that, in the positive sense of the  word, we have been forced to such a form of government. We  would like to continue in this fashion. We have to do our best  to achieve favorable results in the next elections, to convince  our citizens that this form of government brings them agreeable  conditions for their work.    [Kotian] What holds together such entities as the Party of  the Democratic Left and the Christian Democratic Movement so  that they are capable of governing together?    [Moravcik] I believe the political responsibility for the  fate of this country that they assumed, and I believe that, if  they assumed this responsibility, they must not gamble, they  must reach an agreement. The agreement will be a complex one,  but the experience to date has not revealed any significant  differences.    [Kotian] Does it mean that the difference between the left  and the right wings is vanishing in Slovakia, or, the farther  down or in the corner Slovakia is, the more unequivocal is the  way out?    [Moravcik] However we look at it, one thing is clear: The  time for pragmatic solutions is here. We are able to unite on  that. This society must get out of its predicament and  isolation--i.e., the society at any cost, and subsequently we  can implement right- or left-wing policies. At this time, all  entities united in a certain orientation, and it is important  that they agreed on the acceleration of the transformation.    [Kotian] You referred to pragmatic solutions and the  agreement between the left and the right wings. How do you  perceive through the prism of your words a certain tension and  strife in the center regarding the liberal or conservative  orientation?    [Moravcik] I believe it of marginal importance. The logical  disintegration of political forces and the formation of a  rational political scene is taking place in Slovakia only now.  It is a process that is marked also by numerous subjective  factors, but I firmly believe that it will eventually lead to a  rational distribution of political entities. From this point of  view, I regret that we have not managed to form a single party  with Cermakites, but, if they feel that their place is on the  right, they are likely to approach the Christian Democratic  Movement. We want to cooperate with the National Democratic  Party; at least we would like to go jointly to the elections.  The fact that we have not formed an integral entity certainly  makes us weaker, but it would not do to try forcing something  that is not internally consistent.    [Kotian] A problem of the government that failed in the 1992  elections was the media rendition of their intentions, their  objectives, their lack of convincibility. Despite having a very  short term of office, this problem also pertains to you. Do you  feel certain weaknesses of your government in the sphere of  media influence?    [Moravcik] No, to tell the truth, even if we do not push  ourselves through as markedly as Vladimir Meciar, for instance.  I believe it correct. We do not wish to follow the path we  criticize, and, furthermore, the situation is different from  what it was after the first recall of Meciar. Now, a large part  of the population has undergone adverse experiences with his  government.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Channel tunnel delayed until autumn next year THE CHANNEL tunnel, which has been beset by bitter rows over sharply rising costs and delays, is expected to open in the autumn next year, several months later than planned. Eurotunnel, the operator, yesterday blamed contractors for the delay. The opening, planned for June 15 1993, will now miss the peak season summer traffic. The company said it would not be able to provide a full service to meet peak summer-time passenger demand until mid 1994. It is the first time it has admitted that the project will not open on schedule. Eurotunnel said it would offer a restricted service from September or October next year provided 'contractors meet programmes for installation and commissioning currently under discussion'. The announcement prompt-ed an angry retort from Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French contractors building the project, which said: 'Any implication that the delayed opening of the tunnel is attributable to construction difficulties on the part of TML is wholly untrue.' Eurotunnel's share price fell 22p after the announcement but had recovered to 454p by the close, a fall of 11p. TML is claiming extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices to cover the cost of the private-sector project which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.7bn to more than Pounds 8bn - allowing for the impact of inflation and interest charges. Negotiations between TML and Eurotunnel to resolve differences over the cost and timing of the project have been taking place since October but have still to be resolved. Eurotunnel said yesterday that substantial progress had been made by contractors during the past four months on installing signalling, track, cooling systems and other fixed equipment into the twin rail tunnels. Installation delays according to contractors have been reduced to about 10 weeks compared with three to six month delays quoted by Eurotunnel last autumn. The main problem appears to be delays in providing a fleet of railway wagons and locomotives affecting shuttle services and through trains. Eurotunnel was told last week that BR and SNCF, the British and French state-owned railways, would be unable to provide a full rail service until summer 1994. Changes in the design of Eurotunnel's shuttle wagons means it will have insufficient rolling stock to meet peak demand when the tunnel opens. Eurotunnel last autumn cut by Pounds 147m its revenue forecast for the years 1993 to 1996 to take account of reduced services in the first months of operation. Last night it said it was looking at the figures to see if a further revenue reduction would be appropriate. It insisted it had sufficient funds to complete construction of the project by next year.</p>

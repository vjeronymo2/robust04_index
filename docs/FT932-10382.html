			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: It is bargain time in the wine market BRITAIN'S first National Wine Week, which begins on Monday, was conceived in October 1991 when you could still say 'Calais' to a British wine merchant without putting up his blood pressure. Now, this seven-day feast of in-store tastings, discounts and the like must seem a better idea than ever - especially for retailers trying to compete with trippers who, since January 1, have been able to return from France with almost unlimited quantities of negligibly-taxed wine. It is too early to quantify the effect on the British wine trade of the recent increases in personal duty-free allowances, but there is no doubt the system is being abused widely; witness the squad of 150 excise verification officers just set up by HM Customs and Excise. Its job is to catch people such as the man who tried to sell crates of duty-free beer in the car park of the Wine Society at Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Last year was the British wine trade's best in terms of the volume released from bond into commercial channels: 682m litres (or 909m bottles), a healthy 2.7 per cent more than in 1991 when it had looked as though the UK market, which had grown consistently since a small hiccup in 1977, finally was running out of steam. British buyers, however, have been trading down quite noticeably. The average spend per bottle is barely Pounds 3, the two most popular wines being Liebfraumilch and white Lambrusco on which no retailer can depend for profit. But if times are tough for the typical UK merchant (who is, nowadays, probably a woman working in the buying department of a supermarket), they are considerably more difficult for producers. Increasing competition as global consumption falls has put severe pressure on prices while demanding ever more expensive investment. In the short term, this is great news for consumers, but it will undoubtedly have some serious effects on supply in the medium term. Profit while ye may, therefore, from the bargains which are more evident than ever in Britain this week (even if some are available from specialists barely aware of National Wine Week's existence). Here are some of the best buys; but most chains and supermarkets are doing something, and discounts on all sorts of sparkling wine abound. Conversion: Thresher has had the clever idea of trying to turn beer drinkers on to wine. Buy any four of the brews made by its parent, Whitbread, to get 75p off a bottle of wine. Degustation: Tesco promises 'the world's biggest tasting' at which more than 10,000 bottles will be opened in its best 200 (of 401) stores. Monday is Germany, Tuesday Italy, Wednesday Iberia, Thursday France, and Friday and Saturday New World - which is a fair indication of Tesco's enthusiasms. Champenisation: Majestic and Oddbins are discounting in furious competition on champagne. Next week, for example, Majestic has Ayala at Pounds 11.99 - 13 bottles for the price of 12 selected champagnes - and a major tasting next weekend in all stores. Throughout May, Oddbins can supply Heidsieck Dry Monopole by the case at Pounds 11.54 a bottle. But its best buys are Laurent Perrier at Pounds 14.02 (if bought by the case) and Billecart-Salmon at Pounds 14.56 if you buy seven bottles (for the price of six). Best value in another sense, though, is Fluteau champagne on the wine list of the Beauchamp Place Restaurant, London SW3, for just Pounds 19.75. And Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, of London W8 and SW6, has a couple of equally delicious growers' champagnes retailing in the Pounds 16-18 range. Reduction: Safeway has made it a Wine Month, during which the exceptional Portuguese red Leziria is back to Pounds 1.99 and the chain's vibrant new Young Vatted Merlot 1992 from Bulgaria is just Pounds 2.29 until May 29. Sophistication: Farr Vintners, of London SW1 (071-828 1960, fax 3500), has the contents of three quite exceptional cellars to sell. Serious collectors are unlikely to have another chance to pick from 15 cases of well-stored 1928 clarets; full cases of 1945 first growths; DRC wines aplenty; Yquem from 30 vintages; and much, much more. Reid Wines, of Hallatrow (0761-452 645, fax 453 642), is selling a more modest but useful cellarful of mature burgundy and Barolo, and some interesting claret, at fair prices.</p>

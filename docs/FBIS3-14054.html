The official session this morning was chaired by the Kenyan  foreign minister in the presence of the foreign ministers of the  four Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development  [IGADD] countries. All three negotiating parties, the Sudanese  Government and the two rebel factions, attended the meeting.    It has been resolved that each of the three negotiating  parties should be represented in the talks by six persons. The  government delegation stated that the talks would be based on  previous agendas and start from where the Abuja talks had ended.  The united faction agrees with the government in this regard,  but the attitude of Garang's faction towards the previous agenda  is ambiguous.    [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 1900  GMT on 22 March adds: "The peace negotiations between the  government and the two rebel factions will resume in Nairobi at  1000 tomorrow with all the delegations continuing to discuss the  agenda, relief, and other humanitarian issues."

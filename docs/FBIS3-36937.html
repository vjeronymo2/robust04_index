This was stated today by Russian Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. He was addressing delegates at  the fifth congress of the Private Farms and Agricultural  Cooperatives Association [AKKOR].    The deputy prime minister gave a positive assessment of the  work in 1993 of the private farmers who have been "by their  example showing the whole of the peasantry how it is necessary  in very complex conditions to strive to achieve production  efficiency. Unfortunately, as a whole there is still not enough  of this efficiency." The deputy prime minister stated that the  government is now earnestly engaged in untying the "tight  knots." In particular he stated that "a government decision is  being prepared that will define the relationship between the  state and the agricultural producers in 1994."    On long-term problems, Aleksandr Zaveryukha suggested to  those assembled that they become earnestly engaged in setting up  peasant banks and organizing insurance companies that could help  private farmers resolve questions of credit and compensation for  losses arising from unforeseen circumstances.    The fifth congress of AKKOR is to continue its work on 10  February.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ SAID TO DOWN AIR SHOW GUEST  </P> <P> The Iraqi government invited Egypt to fly its home-built Alpha fighter bomber  to Baghdad last week for an air show, only to shoot down the Egyptian plane as  it descended to land in Iraq's capital, Administration officials disclosed  Thursday.  </P> <P> Secret intelligence reports making the rounds of U.S. government offices say  that the Egyptian jet was shot down by a shoulder-fired missile, apparently  because some Iraqi soldier failed to get word that the plane was an invited  guest.  </P> <P> The two Egyptian fliers in the Alpha jet ejected safely, according to the  reports.  </P> <P> The anti-aircraft weapon that downed the Alpha was likely a Soviet-built  missile that homes in on the heat of a plane's engines and explodes on impact,  officials said.  </P> <P> Col. Ahmed Zaki, assistant military attache at the Egyptian Embassy in  Washington, said he knew there was an international air show in Baghdad but had  no information about the reported downing. Iraqi military officials could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In an earlier case of mistaken identity or a breakdown in communications, an  Iraqi pilot flying a Mirage F-1 fighter bomber on May 17, 1987, shot two Exocet  missiles into the U.S. frigate Stark, killing 37 sailors during the Iran-Iraq  War. Iraq said the pilot mistook the ship for an Iranian vessel.  </P> <P> The Alpha was developed by French and West German aircraft firms. Egypt buys  Alpha kits from France and assembles them in a plant south of Cairo.  </P></p>

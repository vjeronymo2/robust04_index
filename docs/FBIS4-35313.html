			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian National Authority held its first  official meetings yesterday and today under the supervision of  its leader, Yasir 'Arafat, and in the presence of a number of  the most prominent of the Palestinian leaders -- at a time when  Palestinian and Israeli sources said that Israel has this  morning lifted the comprehensive security cordon that it imposed  on the Gaza Strip last Friday following the killing of two  Israeli soldiers at the entrance to the Strip.    Habib Ben Said reviews some of the topics discussed at the  Palestinian national authority's meeting in Tunis before it  assumes its duties in Gaza and Jericho:    [Ben Said] The participants continued the series of meetings  today that began last evening and that were especially devoted  to discussing the issue of distributing the duties within the  Palestinian national authority, which will assume its  responsibilities in the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in  its capacity as the Palestinian government during the  transitional period.    It was learned today that the number of portfolios in the  government has been limited to about 22 ministries. So far, 20  Palestinian figures have been appointed to the membership of the  national authority, the last of which was the appointment of  Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, the independent personality in the  PLO Executive Committee. This appointment was announced today.    The Palestinian transitional government is expected comprise  24 personalities -- as stipulated in the 4 May agreement in  Cairo between the PLO and Israel. Two seats remain vacant, and  these are generally believed to be reserved for the Palestinian  opposition if it wants to join the government.    It is worth pointing out here that Palestinian leader 'Abbas  Zaki is currently holding consultations with some Palestinian  factions in Damascus to convince them of the need to join the  government and occupy some ministerial posts in the National  Authority.    On the other hand, it has been said that the participants  have also discussed the draft charter of a new government. In  its outline, the draft affirms the necessity to adopt a  democratic and rational type of behavior, which is based on the  separation between the powers and the need to make supervisory  mechanisms available to avoid any extemporization or autocracy,  bearing in mind that the program of the draft document has been  prepared by a specialized committee over the past two days. It  controls the prerogatives of the Palestinian national authority,  its duties, and the progress of its internal work, in addition  to deciding the future program for this transitional government  until elections are held in Gaza and Jericho before the end of  this year.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraqi assets to be investigated THE Bank of England is to investigate Iraqi assets in the UK to identify any which could be creamed off into a United Nations compensation fund for those who suffered during the invasion of Kuwait, the Commons heard last night. But Foreign Office minister Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd warned that it was thought all such cash would be subject to prior claims. Under a UN security council resolution, 30 per cent of the proceeds of oil sales by Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire terms will be placed in the fund to compensate individuals, companies and countries. Iraq has so far refused to make such sales.</p>

As ministerial colleagues rallied to his defence, Mr Scott's daughter Victoria, who works for the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, accused the government of 'lying' over the bill. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have spoken to him (Mr Scott) and I hope to talk about it again.'</p>

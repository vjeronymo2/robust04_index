			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / E Anglia power plant in doubt An independent power company appears to have shelved plans to build an electricity plant in East Anglia following the decision by Offer, the industry regulator, to put a limit on prices in the electricity wholesale pool, Michael Smith writes. Independent Power Generators, a consortium involving French companies, has terminated a contract with National Grid to take power from a proposed 730MW station in Sutton Bridge, East Anglia. The company was not available for comment last night. It said recently it was deferring non-essential development at Sutton Bridge 'due to continuing downward regulatory pressure of the wholesale price of electricity and over-capacity in the UK market'. It added that the National Grid's estimates showed that the excess of generating capacity over peak demand could reach 42.6 per cent by 2000. Regional power companies estimated demand for electricity would grow by 1.3 per cent annually to the end of the decade, the company said. A year ago that estimate had been 1.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: From swine to wine - A former farmer who traded pork for port TURNING A hobby into a business can often turn a dream into a nightmare. In the case of Phil Parrish, former pig farm manager and now wine importer and wholesaler, the transition progressed rather smoothly, providing a living for him and his family. 'It's given me a kind of freedom and I enjoy the benefits of working from home, but I'm hardly ever not working,' Parrish says. 'A two-week holiday? What's that?' Parrish was earning Pounds 16,000 a year when, three years ago, the farmer he worked for abruptly announced that the pig operation Parrish managed was to close. His redundancy pay was only a few thousand pounds. 'The lucky thing was that a couple of years before that I had started buying and selling wine on a part-time basis, partly for fun but also to bring in a bit of extra income,' Parrish says. 'I decided to try and make that into a full-time business.' In the 12 months to April, Parrish, operating from his home in Driffield, north Humberside, sold Pounds 250,000 of wine, producing a pre-tax return of about 15 per cent. Parrish says all profit has been pumped back into buying stock and expanding the business, but he also takes out a yearly salary of Pounds 20,000. Turnover this year will be up 'substantially,' but the recession's impact on Parrish's principal customers - restaurants and hotels - is bringing margins down by 2 or 3 percentage points. 'We've also noticed more competition,' Parrish says. 'A lot of wine merchants are coming up from the south to get in on the trade up here. There are maybe 20 or 30 others operating in this area. The worst problems are posed by the big drinks companies, which offer to put in initial stock without a charge up front. It's like an interest-free loan.' Some 90 per cent of Parrish's business comes from 50 or so accounts. The rest is made up of direct sales to the public. Minimum sale is a case of 12 bottles. Parrish uses a bonded warehouse in Rotherham, an hour or two's drive away, and a much smaller 'overnight' warehouse in Driffield. Promising a 24-hour delivery service, Parrish uses his own mini van to get supplies to the customer. The only other workers involved in the venture are a part-time driver and Parrish's wife, Denise, who spends a day a week preparing invoices and issuing wine lists. Parrish has been interested in wine for a long time and says he has a good nose. Before he left the farm, his part-time business was turning over Pounds 60,000. The breakthrough was winning a contract to supply all the wines for a large country-house restaurant close to the cathedral city of Beverley, near Hull. 'We got one wine in there and then more until we had the whole list.' To get going, Parrish remortgaged his home for Pounds 40,000 and raised a small bank loan. Using hotel and restaurant guides and tips from friends, Parrish sends out his 20-page wine list to establishments in an area from North Yorkshire to Lincolnshire. 'I don't ring them unless they get in touch with me. Then, I will always visit them personally.' So far, Parrish says he supplies to every establishment he has visited. 'In obtaining an account, price is initially a factor. Chinese restaurants are the toughest on price margins. But we also sell on our service. That is, we supply any wine on the list within 24 hours, and that we supply good quality wine.' Parrish buys the bulk of his wine direct from vineyards. He uses books on wines and vineyards by authors such as Hugh Johnson, and says he visits all the vineyards in Europe from which he buys, and some of those in California. 'It gives you a feeling for the place and the people, and there's another story to tell customers.' Some 60 per cent of Parrish's total volume comes from France, and 25 to 30 per cent from the New World producing areas of Australia, New Zealand and California. So-called 'fine wines' - 'that's anything with quality and character' - make up about 70 per cent of turnover. The rest is booze destined to be sold as house wines. Restaurants make their biggest margins on house wine, but for Parrish they carry the tightest margins for himself. Vin de Pays might cost Parrish 50p a bottle, with duty added at about Pounds 1 a bottle. His sale price to a restaurant is perhaps Pounds 2.50, which ends up on the diner's bill at may be Pounds 8. 'Best margins for me are probably on Burgundies.' Parrish reckons he carries about Pounds 80,000 of stock. The warehouse charges him 3p a case per week for storage. Stockholding and cash flow are the company's biggest headache. 'It makes it very tight for us.' An order for 100 cases of Champagne requires a single pay-out by Parrish of perhaps Pounds 10,000. 'For every new customer we need Pounds 4,000 to Pounds 5,000 to service them. After buying the wine, the second biggest cost element is financing restaurants' wine stocks. Most will not pay on delivery. Some pay on delivery or after four weeks. For others, it might be two or three months.' Vineyards usually allow Parrish 30 or 60 days to pay. About 10 per cent of the Parrish wine list - which extends to about 300 items - is changed every year. 'One of the real pleasures of the business is getting out and meeting people. The other is offering customers a new wine and finding that they have a lot of success in selling it too.'

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / German delay on N-waste The German environment ministry yesterday said it hoped an administrative court would reach a quick decision clearing the way for a controversial shipment of nuclear waste to a storage site at Gorleben in northern Germany. The shipment has been standing for months in a railway siding at the Philippsburg power station in south Germany while the federal government and the state of Lower Saxony, where Gorleben is situated, did battle in the courts. It was to have arrived in Gorleben today but the environment ministry unexpectedly stopped the shipment late on Monday after a court near Gorleben had ruled that the fuel rods were incorrectly loaded at Philippsburg. Ms Monika Griefhahn, Lower Saxony's environment minister and the most outspoken opponent of Gorleben, doubted the shipment could be moved this year. The state government had given its approval last week under pressure from the environment ministry. The Philippsburg waste would be the first shipment to Gorleben and has been fiercely resisted by people living near the site.</p>

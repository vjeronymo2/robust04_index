			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Syndicates expected to accept probe at Lloyd's SEVERAL hundred Names in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, who were members of the loss-making Feltrim syndicates, are today expected to reject legal action in their attempt to recoup one of the biggest losses in Lloyd's history. Instead the Names are likely to agree to the establishment of an independent Lloyd's investigation into the circumstances of the losses, making use of a new facility announced last week by Lloyd's in response to mounting criticism from Names. The decision should temporarily alleviate pressure on the authorities at the troubled insurance market, but Names are insisting that the investigation be thorough and are refusing to rule out the possibility of legal action eventually, Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, said there were 'a lot of questions to be answered' about the regulation and management of the Feltrim syndicates, which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance. 'A number of glaring inadequacies have come to light,' he said. Two thousand Names on syndicates 540/542 and 847, formerly managed by the Feltrim Underwriting Agency, expect to lose more than Pounds 320m on business written in 1987, 1988 and 1989. Names with an average commitment of between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 30,000 are facing losses of between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 each. Syndicate 540's results were worst in 1989 when 547 recorded a loss equivalent to 300 per cent of its annual stamp capacity - the maximum amount of premium it is permitted to write. The Council of Lloyd's agreed on Wednesday to set up a special investigation to examine the commercial circumstances of all losses exceeding 150 per cent of a syndicate's annual stamp capacity. Mr Hook welcomed the move, which he said had been made 'in response to an initiative from the Feltrim Names'. He said any investigation would have to be 'genuinely independent'. The Names are concerned about the way members' agents at Lloyd's continued to channel Names into the Feltrim syndicates during 1988 and 1989, in spite of indications that Feltrim was badly affected by catastrophes such as the October 1987 storms and the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion.</p>

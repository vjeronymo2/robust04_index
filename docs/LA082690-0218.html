			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RENOVATION  </P> <P> Josh Schweitzer's creative design of the Hollywood photographer's studio  ("Joshing Around," by Karen Stabiner) fails to incorporate certain elements  required by building codes and safety considerations. His stairways are lovely  design elements but are not suitable for use.  </P> <P> Stairs with 18-inch risers provide challenging training for firefighters but  are a real problem when a fire occurs. And "tall, spry" individuals aren't the  only ones who might need to negotiate those stairs under ordinary  circumstances.  </P> <P> Worse, the absence of railings and balusters on the stairs presents a very  serious hazard to the owner's 4-year-old son and others. The kid is reported to  be sort of sliding down the steps; if he slides off at the top he could be dead  or paralyzed. And the owner is gambling that no adult will ever stumble on the  high, unfamiliar stairsteps and need the railing for support.  </P> <P> That's why the building codes require such components. I wonder why (or  whether) the building department permitted this design.  </P> <P> It's unfortunate that art and safety come into such conflict, but why can't  artists take practical considerations into account in designs intended for  practical use?  </P> <P> GEORGE BARAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

The  document provides for a three-month suspension of the order to  revaluate the capital assets of enterprises and organizations in  its part concerning printing-houses, TASS was told today at the  Russian Journalists' Union. The sharp rise in printing expenses  nearly provoked a one-week strike of newspapermen.    Furthermore, the draft ordinance instructs the relevant  agencies to consider the possibility of granting the mass media  the status of cultural institutions in order to reduce taxes  collected from them. The document also suggests that the  publishers of children's books and textbooks be exempted from  taxes and that socially important publications be subsidized by  the state.    The draft also calls for certain amendments to the  privatization programme for this year with a view to take a  proper account of the mass media. Some governmental agencies  are also instructed to solve other concrete problems facing the  press.    The document is expected to be considered within the next  few  days. The working group of its drafters, which was set up as a  result of the recent meeting of newspaper editors-in-chief and  heads of journalists' associations with Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, includes head of the Russian Committee for  the Press Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian Journalists'  Union Vsevolod Bogdanov, head of the Association of Publishers  and Editors-in-Chief Ivan Laptev.</p>

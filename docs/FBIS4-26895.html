			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A Taiwan street has come  into being in the poverty-stricken dabie mountains in central  China.    It is a street full of enterprises jointly funded by  compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, overseas Chinese in  foreign countries and their relatives, and other private  businesses.    The street got its name of "Taiwan Jie (Street)" because  most  of the investors in it are from Taiwan. Its construction in  Macheng city, in central China's Hubei Province, started a year  ago.    Its creation has attracted considerable attention to  Macheng,  which has a 1,000-year history.    The Dabie mountains were said to have been formed in ancient  times by a god-like soft-shelled turtle. Streets in Macheng,  located high in the Dabie mountains, are narrow and small,  having been constructed in long-ago centuries.    Over the past three years, the city has built, or rebuilt,  twelve streets, totalling 12 km. The 1.2 km Taiwan Street is  just one of the newly-constructed streets.    According to local officials, more than 380 households have  approval to build in Taiwan Street, and work has started on two  thirds of them.    Among more than 100 households who have finished their  building, more than half have started different kinds of  commercial operations in their newly-built houses.    Without costing the central government a penny, the  construction of the street has so far cost more than 20 million  yuan, most of it directly contributed by compatriots from  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and from abroad.    More than 5,000 people whose origins lie in the city still  live in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and in foreign countries.  Their relatives still living in Macheng now number 30,000.    About 1,000 compatriots from Taiwan and from foreign lands  who have Macheng origins have returned to the hometown for  visits over the past years.    Encouraged by the local government, relatives of Taiwan  compatriots have started more than 100 enterprises or businesses.    The officials said the construction of Taiwan street is  aimed  to cater for the demands to start more enterprises funded by  relatives of Taiwan compatriots, and for improving the  investment environment.    It also caters for the convenience of compatriots from  Taiwan  and other overseas Chinese during their visits to the hometown.    Houses in Taiwan architectural style, many of them  three-storeyed, line the two sides of the 24-meter-wide Taiwan  Street. Service facilities such as amusement centers, shopping  mart, hotels, restaurants and banks have also be constructed.    According to the officials, when the first phase of building  the street is finished, it will attract 45 million yuan for  construction, see the establishment of more than 400 private  businesses or shops, and the annual volume of business or output  value is expected to surpass 80 million yuan.    The local government of Macheng not only hopes that the  building of Taiwan Street will help strengthen its urban  economy, but also that the street will help to promote exchanges  in various fields across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

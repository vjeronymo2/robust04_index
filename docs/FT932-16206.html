			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Daf buy-outs at risk after plea on parts fails THE FUTURE of management buy-out attempts at Leyland Daf was plunged into further uncertainty last night after the Court of Appeal backed a component maker's assertion that it was under no obligation to keep supplying parts to the troubled UK maker of trucks and vans. Within hours of the judgment the supplier, Automotive Products, made contact with Mr Murdoch McKillop, Leyland Daf's joint administrative receiver. The brake and clutch maker, a subsiduary of the BBA group, said it was 'seeking to establish the basis on which it (AP) can make further supplies available, thus safeguarding continuity of Leyland Daf's production'. About 3,500 jobs are at risk if the buy-out initiatives collapse. The talks ended last night without an agreement. It remained unclear whether AP was offering an olive branch, or simply seeking to defuse mounting criticism of its hardline approach. Three Appeal Court judges upheld last week's High Court ruling that AP was justified in refusing to supply Leyland Daf with more brake and clutch parts because Pounds 750,000 of payments had not been made for jparts delivered before the receivership. The receivers, Mr McKillop and Mr John Talbot, both of Arthur Andersen, had argued in court that AP's refusal to continue supplies breached European law by abusing the company's dominant position in the market. But Lord Justice Dillon said that in refusing to continue supplies, AP was exercising the normal rights of traders who had not been paid. 'It is a regular commercial practice that buyers of goods are expected to pay for them. I can find nothing to warrant the conclusion that the aim of preserving competition under the Treaty of Rome overrides the obligation to pay for goods purchased.' The receivers had offered to set aside funds to cover the amount owed to AP pending resolution of the dispute, but it is understood that AP's lawyers rejected the offer. The receivers say that other suppliers, recognising the importance of continuity of supply if Leyland Daf is to survive as a customer, have accepted undertakings that valid claims will be honoured. The receivers' objection to settling AP's claim is that other suppliers might adopt the same line, in spite of their current willingness to accept the undertakings. Leyland Daf's truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, and van plant at Birmingham continued in production yesterday. But unless the crisis is resolved, both are likely to run out of crucial parts next week.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS  </P> <P> Mohammed Tarbush refers to the newly formed Israeli government as "extremist"  ("A Palestinian Season of Gloom," Commentary, July 1). It is interesting to  note that in its first three weeks of existence, Israel's "extremist"  government has extended an invitation to Syrian President Hafez Assad to visit  Israel.  </P> <P> In addition, it has offered the Iranians Israeli expertise in assisting the  earthquake victims. It has also released 416 Arab prisoners from Israeli jails  as a gesture of goodwill. And, furthermore, it has pledged that it would not  resettle Soviet Jewish immigrants beyond the Green Line, i.e., the pre-1967  borders.  </P> <P> I would submit to Tarbush that if the PLO were similarly "extremist," there  would be a good chance for a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.  </P> <P> GUY ZIV  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Midland rejects lending criticism SIR PETER WALTERS, chairman of Midland Bank, warned Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday that 'unfounded criticism' of banks over their small-business lending might impair their ability to fund companies. It was the first formal meeting of a series planned this week between bank chairmen and Mr Lamont since the chancellor said he wanted to meet banks to ensure they were passing on the full amount of base rate cuts. Midland said Sir Peter had told Mr Lamont that the banks had the capacity to finance business expansion when an economic recovery started, but that criticism would damage their ability to do so. The bank said Sir Peter had told Mr Lamont that its margins on lending to 500,000 small-business customers had narrowed over the past year and were now below 3 percentage points above base rate. The meeting with Sir Peter will be followed by meetings with Mr Andrew Buxton, chief executive of Barclays Bank, and Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank. The Bank of England has completed its survey of banks' small-business lending margins based on the eight largest banks and has submitted the results to the Treasury. The result might be announced after Mr Lamont's meetings.</p>

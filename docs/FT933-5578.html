			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Government programme boosts Serco to Pounds 4.35m SERCO, the facilities and project management company, said the growing momentum of the government's programme of putting services out to contract would help to maintain its record of profits growth. Pre-tax profits increased 28 per cent to Pounds 4.35m in the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 82.3m, up 27 per cent. The shares, which have enjoyed a strong run recently, rose a further 5p to Pounds 10.90p. Mr George Gray, chairman, said the government's market testing programme had afforded excellent business opportunities in the first six months of the year and would lead to an increasing number of bid opportunities. Serco said its profits increase was due to substantial organic growth in businesses both owned by and associated with the company, together with a strong six-months contribution from International Aeradio Limited, the civil aviation specialist acquired from BT for Pounds 12.3m in April 1992. The civil aviation services market continued to develop well, with new contracts including consultancy work in central and eastern Europe. The company is now operating the Scatsta air terminal in Shetland for BP Exploration's Sullom Voe terminal. In July Serco paid Pounds 3.5m for BM Scotland, part of the the Property Services Agency, the government body responsible for property management. The company said this deal brought a further 278 contracts with existing government customers, which considerably strengthened its core business. Mr Richard White, managing director, said the successful rationalisation and integration of IAL boded well for the future of BM Scotland, which would enhance Serco's position in the Scottish market. The engineering services side, relating to the provision of automatic test systems, had also been boosted by the award of a contract, worth Pounds 40m over five years, to tests the avionics of the Royal Navy's Merlin EH101 helicopter. On the international side, the group won a share of the management contract for Diego Garcia, the US naval base in the Indian Ocean. Serco was awarded 20 per cent of the contract, worth Dollars 160m (Pounds 108m) over seven years. Mr Gray said: 'The outlook for the remainder of 1993 remains good, based on firm business and the securing of new contracts both with current and new customers. The group's cashflow remains strong.' The interim dividend goes up 18 per cent to 5.3p (4.5p), payable from earnings per share ahead 29 per cent to 22.5p (17.4p).</p>

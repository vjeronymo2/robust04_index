			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Banking on lower rates With the London market up nearly 200 points over the last week, there is no disguising the sea change in perceptions prompted by Britain's withdrawal from the ERM. One has to wonder, however, how great will be the change in policy stance once the immediate shock is over. If the ERM survives tomorrow's Maastricht vote in France, Britain will hardly be back inside. That seems certain after yesterday's Anglo-German slanging match. But Mr Major is adamant that he still regards tackling inflation as a priority. All the more reason, then, to expect him to proceed with caution in cutting base rates till a more coherent policy is back in place. The beguiling notion is that, having bitten the devaluation bullet, the government is free to set interest rates as low as needed to revive demand. Weak money supply and credit growth suggests there is no inflationary pressure in the pipeline. But it would only take a small acceleration of UK price rises to erode the devaluation advantage when continental inflation is low and falling. The very speed with which equities have risen during the last three days suggests the British inflationary psychology was suppressed rather than eradicated by the recession. Price pressures could build up again quickly as hard-pressed companies avail themselves of every opportunity to rebuild margins. One difference from the non-inflationary depreciation of the early 1980s is that then we had a fiscal squeeze. Curiously, the public spending round seems all but forgotten now. The government still needs some way of signalling it means business on inflation. Political pressure for another cut in base rates is surely strong. If there is a response, it could be grudging. The equity market is in danger of discounting too much too soon.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 515(b)(2) of the Act requires that the operation restore the land affected to a condition capable of supporting the uses which it was capable of supporting prior to any mining and section 508(a)(2)(A) requires the reclamation plan to include a statement on the condition of the land to be covered by the permit prior to any mining, including the uses existing at the time of the application and, if the land has a history of previous mining, the uses which preceded any mining. Accordingly, final &sect;780.23(a)(1) will retain the five-year limit on the historical land use description of former &sect;779.22(a)(1) and will include for previously mined areas the land use reporting provisions of former &sect;779.22(b)(5) which are required to implement sections 508(a)(2)(A) and 515(b)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Final &sect;780.23(a)(2) requires that the applicant provide a narrative of the land capability and productivity, which analyzes the land use description in conjunction with other environmental resource information. Final &sect;780.23(a)(2) is identical to former &sect;779.22(a)(2). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(a)(2)(i) implements section 508(a)(2)(B) of the Act and &sect;780.23(a)(2)(ii) implements section 508(a)(2)(C) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Final section 780.23(b) requires that the applicant provide a statement on the utility and capacity of the reclaimed land to support a variety of alternative uses. Final &sect;780.23(b) is identical to former &sect;780.23(a). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(b) implements section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Final &sect;780.23(b)(1) requires that the applicant discuss how the proposed postmining land use will be achieved. Final &sect;780.23(b)(1) is identical to former &sect;780.23(a)(1). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(b)(1) implements sections 508(a)(4) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Final &sect;780.23(b)(2) requires that the applicant include a detailed description of proposed postmining land uses that are different from the premining land uses. Final &sect;780.23(b)(2) is identical to former section 780.23(a)(3). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(b)(2) implements sections 508(a)(2)(A) and 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Final &sect;780.23(b)(3) requires that the applicant describe the consideration which has been given to making all of the proposed surface mining activities consistent with surface owner plans and applicable State and local land use plans and programs. These provisions are identical to those of former &sect;780.23(a)(4) and the first sentence of proposed &sect;780.23(c) and have been redesignated as &sect;780.23(b)(3) to enhance the organizational clarity of the final rule. Section 780.23(b)(3) implements section 508(a)(8) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Final &sect;780.23(c) requires that the applicant describe comments by the legal or equitable owner of record of the surface of the proposed permit area and the State and local government agencies which would have to initiate, implement, approve, or authorize the proposed use of the land following reclamation. Final &sect;780.23(c) is identical to former &sect;780.23(b). Section 780.23(c) implements section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment was received alleging the impracticality of such a requirement and the lack of flexibility which it affords the operator in obtaining comments. However, OSM is retaining this requirement as it implements specific statutory prescriptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Deletion of Land Use Information Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Listed below is an outline of the informational requirements that were deleted from former rules during the formulation of final 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Land use information). This rule is identical to proposed 30 CFR 780.23 except as indicated below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. This rulemaking deletes section 30 CFR 779.22(b). This section required that if specific information about mining activities at previously mined areas is available, such information must be included in the permit application. As will be discussed below, if the information required under this section is even available, it is either provided elsewhere by the applicant in his permit application or is available from former program permitting records and is, therefore, more accessible to the regulatory authority than to the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

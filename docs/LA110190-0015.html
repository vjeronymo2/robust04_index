			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CIVIL RIGHTS BILL  </P> <P> I am very upset and offended by the veto of the 1990 Civil Rights Act by  President Bush.  </P> <P> I will never understand how delaying such an important issue for minorities and  women is in their interest.  </P> <P> He stated he feared hiring quotas when it is clear that the bill didn't demand  any. What is the truth?  </P> <P> I believe the truth lies in Louisiana, after the racist voting there caused  great political concerns. Bush just wimped out and sold the minorities and  women down the river. Instead of showing the David Dukes of this country that  the White House could not be intimidated, his veto has given support to their  cause.  </P> <P> I had forgiven Bush for the Willie Horton political ads. But now I'm outraged  at his veto.  </P> <P> President Bush, read my lips: Your veto, as far as I'm concerned, is just as  racist as your Horton ads.  </P> <P> GORDON E. MARBLE  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN OPENS BID TO MANDATE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR WORKERS  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown acknowledged Wednesday that he faces long odds in  the fight to require all California employers to provide health benefits to  their workers. But he had some advice for anyone who doubts that he can do it:  </P> <P> "Never, never, never bet against me," he said.  </P> <P> With that, Brown began his effort to coax and cajole about half a dozen  bitterly divided special-interest groups into a consensus on the best way to  provide medical coverage to the more than 5 million Californians who are  without it.  </P> <P> Brown (D-San Francisco) said he will introduce as his own a proposal drafted by  two top appointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian but disowned by the  governor. Then, Brown said, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) will bang  heads in public and in private for several months until a plan emerges that the  business community can accept and the governor will sign.  </P> <P> Brown and Margolin, at a Capitol news conference, said they were not embracing  the administration proposal, which was drawn up by Deukmejian's top appointees  on health and business issues. But the two lawmakers said the proposal provides  a foundation they can build upon.  </P> <P> "It deserves to be the starting point for our legislative debate," Margolin  said. "It's a debate that has to occur this year, and hopefully be completed  this year. The impact on the state of California of allowing this problem to  continue is just too dramatic and too devastating to ignore any longer."  </P> <P> At issue is how best to provide broadly based health insurance. While the  elderly have the federal Medicare program and the very poor are covered by the  state Medi-Cal plan, an estimated 4 million workers and dependents have no  coverage through their jobs and cannot afford to buy insurance on their own.  Others not covered by insurance include retired people not yet qualified for  Medicare and the unemployed.  </P> <P> The proposal developed by the administration would require every California  employer to offer a minimum package of health insurance benefits to every  employee. Employers would have to pay at least 75% of premiums for their  workers and 50% for their employees' families.  </P> <P> The state would subsidize the costs for low-wage employees and low-profit  businesses, in part by allowing them to obtain insurance through the Medi-Cal  program, which now is limited to the poor. The authors of the $2-billion plan  said it could be funded without new taxes.  </P> <P> Deukmejian refused to endorse the plan earlier this month because it was not  the product of a consensus among employers, labor, doctors, insurers and  consumer groups. He also said he would reject any proposal that placed too  heavy a burden on small businesses.  </P> <P> As a result, Margolin said his first priority will be addressing the concerns  of small-business owners. But he called on business representatives to end the  "posturing" he said he witnessed during the meetings of an administration task  force that studied the issue earlier this year.  </P> <P> "It's not enough to say what you don't like," Margolin said. "We're going to  ask people to say what they do like and put forth their own proposals."  </P> <P> Martyn Hopper, director of the California office of the National Federation of  Independent Businesses, said his membership might accept a mandate if insurance  premiums could be brought to between $40 and $60 per employee a month. But he  said that could not be achieved without reforms of the legal system and medical  cost-containment that he fears will be defeated by powerful lobbies  representing doctors and lawyers.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that, after all the negotiations, the only thing that is going  to be left intact is the mandate," Hopper said in an interview. "The  small-business owner is going to be left holding the bag."  </P></p>

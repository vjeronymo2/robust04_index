			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Revamped authorities 'will deter potential councillors' MANAGERS, the self-employed and others with business experience will be deterred from becoming councillors if plans to reform local authorities go ahead, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body, says today. It says in a report that the move to replace the two levels of local government which exist in most of England and Wales with single-tier authorities will reduce the number of councillors. This will inevitably increase the workload of those who remain, making local government too time-consuming for many potential candidates and undermining the government's aim of attracting more able and experienced outsiders on to councils. The report also predicts that reducing the number of councillors will heighten partisanship in local government and give the political parties a tighter grip on town-hall politics. This points to the demise of the independent councillor, who is most likely to succeed in smaller councils. Research carried out for the report shows that local authorities are already experimenting with streamlining council business. The methods include small executive boards of councillors acting as a sort of cabinet. This has often not been balanced, however, by a worthwhile role for 'backbench' and opposition-party councillors. Among the options being considered are select committees to scrutinise the executive, and area-based management committees with ward councillors taking more decisions.

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MOZARTEAN PLAYERS CONCLUDE DOHENY SEASON  </P> <P> The current season of Doheny Mansion soirees ended on Friday with a delectable  program by the Mozartean Players: pianist Steven Lubin, violinist Stanley  Ritchie and cellist Myron Lutzke, as highly accomplished practitioners of  18th-Century style on instruments of the time.  </P> <P> Together, they are all that could be desired of a chamber ensemble: balanced  and cohesive in sound, temperament and interpretive outlook, and technically  secure, notwithstanding some dicey moments on Friday at the outset of Mozart's  seraphic Trio in B-flat, K. 502, when Lubin, reportedly suffering painful back  spasms, gave every indication of not being able to make it through the evening.  </P> <P> The pianist had, however, sufficiently recovered by Mozart's finale to make a  substantial contribution to the pleasures of a program that if delivered by,  say, the modern-instrument Beaux Arts Trio, would have been regarded as  consisting entirely of warm-up pieces. All three works deserve to be honored  rather than condescended to, as the players amply proved.  </P> <P> In addition to Mozart, the group offered Haydn's Trio in E-flat, No. 29, with  its outrageously bumptious alla tedesca finale, and Beethoven's witty and, in  this context, powerful, Trio in E-flat, Opus 1, No. 1.  </P> <P> Optimum spirit and stylishness characterized the Mozarteans' interpretations  that exhibited a good deal more (and decidedly welcome) string vibrato than we  usually get from antiquarian performers.

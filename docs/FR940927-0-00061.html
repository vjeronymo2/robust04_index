			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a) does not include the specific date provided in section 408(a) of the SMCRA. The apparent deficiency in the Utah plan would render Utah's plan less stringent than section 408(a) of SMCRA, but OSM notes that Utah has proposed to address this deficiency in a separate amendment dated April 14, 1994 (administration record No. UT&hyph;914). In order to address this additional proposal prior to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer decision on proposed UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

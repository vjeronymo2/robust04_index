			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: German textile producer files for protection NINO, one of Germany's largest textile companies, has filed for protection from creditors. The Nordhorn-based company said that business conditions had become so bad over December and January that it had no alternative but to apply for a Vergleich -  the German equivalent of Chapter 11 proceedings. It is proposing to put in place a settlement whereby creditors receive 40 per cent of what they are owed. Under the proposals, creditors would write off loans totalling between DM110m (Dollars 68.1m) and DM120m. Deutsche Bank, the company's biggest creditor and a large shareholder, supports the proposals. This would reduce the company's interest costs by about DM10m a year, thereby enhancing the chances that Nino could preserve its independence and enhance its chances of forging a strategic alliance with a partner, the company said. Nino plans a further reduction in wage costs. In December its 2,400 employees had agreed to wage cuts in tandem with an agreement from banks to forego credits, but these measures did not prevent what the company termed a liquidity squeeze as business conditions deteriorated. The application for debt composition proceedings follows several difficult years for the company, which made operating losses of DM17.4m in the year ended March, 1992 after losses of DM28m in 1990-91. Turnover last year was DM419.7m against DM410.7m. Nino has ben hit by the combination of poor conditions in textile markets and heavy debts. It had struggled over recent years to reduce its dependence on low-margin woollen products in favour of higher value-added products. The German textile industry has suffered from the general downturn in economic conditions and has been buffeted by cheap imports. In the first eight months of last year, German textile production fell 8 per cent with production of clothing materials tumbling 12 per cent in the first six months.</p>

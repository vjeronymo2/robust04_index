			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'PUMPKINHEAD': SO MANY WRITERS, SO LITTLE EFFECT  </P> <P> The extensive writing credits for the horror film "Pumpkinhead" (citywide) read  like a confusing textbook case of Hollywood ampersands and arbitrated  punctuation: Screenplay by Mark Patrick Carducci with Gary Gerani, based on a  story by Carducci and Stan Winston &amp; Richard C. Weinman, inspired by a poem  (!!!) by Ed Justin.  </P> <P> With no fewer than five writers involved, it's almost a cinch that the  carefully crafted result of so many skilled hands at work will be juicy  dialogue -- such as "Don't go out there!" "Molly's out there!" and "God is the  only thing that can stop what's out there!"  </P> <P> What's out there is not the Great Pumpkin, alas, but a 12-foot-tall demon that  hisses and snickers before dispatching its teen-age victims. The creature in  question gets its moniker from the "pumpkin patch/graveyard" in which its  remains lie buried -- that is, when it isn't being called forth and resurrected  by the local Southern bumpkins, who occasionally dispatch Pumpkinhead on  missions of vengeance with the help of a witch.  </P> <P> This loathsome evil spirit's head does not resemble any indigenous backwoods  fruit, but its insect-cum-anthropoid form is suspiciously similar to that of  the title villain of "Alien," albeit less slimy and more wrinkled. (Picture  Sigourney Weaver being terrorized by a monster wearing Dustin Hoffman's old-age  makeup from "Little Big Man" and you'll have the idea.)  </P> <P> The unpleasantness is set in motion when a pack of city kids visit the country  to do some dirt-biking, and the most obnoxious of the boys, drunk, accidentally  strikes and kills the young son of a local fruit-stand owner. (If nothing else,  the film is an effective "Don't Drink and Motocross" public-service  commercial.) The teen-agers flee the accident scene but soon their remote cabin  is besieged by a rifle-resistant Pumpkinhead, turned loose by the distraught  dad.  </P> <P> Eventually the picture turns into a morality tale about how revenge, once  tasted, is not so sweet, as the father (played by Lance Henriksen, the helpful  android of "Aliens") comes to regret the carnage he's set in motion. Even he  can't undo the spell, though, and soon realizes that to do battle with the  demon, he must literally do battle with himself. It's an interesting idea --  though not nearly as interesting as it was 33 years ago in "Forbidden Planet,"  which had Walter Pidgeon engaged in much more compelling combat with his own  id.  </P> <P> Stan Winston steps in as director (and co-scenarist) here after many years  leading one of Hollywood's top special makeup effects units. Ironically,  Winston shows a surer directorial touch with the early, more human scenes  (especially those between Henriksen and son) than he does later with the spooks  and scares, which are never even faintly frightening. He doesn't win any more  points for having his creature followed by artsy mood lighting wherever it goes  in the supposedly black night.  </P> <P> The one major departure "Pumpkinhead" (MPAA-rated R) offers from the  supernatural-mass-murder-in-the-woods genre, for which some gratitude may be in  order, is that its young actors don't engage in the usual illicit sex  immediately before being punished with a gruesome slaughter. But neither do  they read, uh, poetry -- not even the alluded-to "Pumpkinhead, The Poem." All  those writers and not even one pro-literacy plug?  </P></p>

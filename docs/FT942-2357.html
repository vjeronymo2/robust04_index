			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: US evangelists put case at London forum You can already send electronic mail messages to the White House. Indeed, some of the senior Clinton administration officials responsible for trying to create a US information superhighway will communicate no other way. But from September the White House will even start sending e-mail messages back - unless of course the correspondent wants something a little more old fashioned. After all you can't frame an electronic message from the US president and hang it on the wall. 'Those who want a letter from the President can have that,' explains David Lytel. of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy. But those who just want an answer to a question will get e-mail. Lytel was one of a group of high-powered US superhighway specialists in London last week for a forum organised by the Programme on Information and Communication Technologies, based at Brunel University. In a video conference from Washington, the shape of the information dream was spelled out by Michael Nelson, a principal adviser to the Clinton administration on the information superhighway. He forecasts that almost certainly by 2010, and probably by 2005, nearly everyone in the US will be linked to a national information infrastructure which will give Americans easy cost-effective access to any medium - voice, data, images or video. 'From health care to education it will improve every aspect of our lives,' said Nelson, who faced considerable scepticism from many UK specialists. These suspect future services on an information superhighway may, in fact, be delivered by a wide range of different technologies. The US government estimates the creation of an information network linking every home will cost around Dollars 100bn - although some forecasts go as high as Dollars 400bn. Most of this investment could occur naturally and gradually as cable and television companies upgrade their networks and install more fiber optics. The burden is to be borne almost entirely by business, although the US government is already providing Dollars 26m a year to help boost new applications - a sum that is now rising to Dollars 100m. An additional push could also come from the US, by making sure all government information is available electronically and priced at the cost of dissemination, rather than the cost of acquisition. Some of the American visionaries who want to see a broadband, high-capacity connection into every home do seem also to be placing an each-way bet on the Internet, the international electronic data network that already has some 20m subscribers and is said to be growing at the rate of 1m new users a month. 'We love the Internet and we consider it a brilliant success,' said Lytel, who believes it is at least a model of what a national information infrastructure could achieve. At the end of the London Forum a great deal of connecting still needed to be done between the almost evangelical American search for a global superhighway and British distrust for ideas raised and rejected in the early 1980s, when the then information technology minister Kenneth Baker tried to promote visions of 'the wired city' of the future. As Prof Nicholas Garnham, director of the Centre for Communication and Information Studies at the University of Westminster, put it: 'Chasing the concept of a information superhighway is simply chasing a will o' the wisp. Garnham added that he found it a bizarre notion that American politicians were placing such emphasis on a superhighway, rather than on issues such as food and housing. Martin Elton, another British professor, although now at New York University, suggested the information superhighway was a political slogan and as long as it remained undefined it could remain all things to all people. 'Once, if ever, it is defined it would be likely to create losers as well as winners. Some interesting battles can be expected then.'</p>

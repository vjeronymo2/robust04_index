			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CASTLE &amp; COOKE WILL NOT SELL DOLE AFTER ALL  </P> <P> In a surprise announcement, officials at Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said Thursday  that they will not sell Dole Food Co. after all, capping a contentious 19  months of on-again, off-again negotiations to sell or spin off the produce  giant.  </P> <P> Reasons ranged from the deteriorating market for acquisitions and financing to  Dole's increasingly strong performance.  </P> <P> "Although several major international food companies expressed interest in  acquiring Dole, in the current economic climate the Board of Directors did not  believe the interested buyers were prepared to pay a price that fully reflected  the company's potential," Castle &amp; Cooke Chairman David H. Murdock said in  a written statement.  </P> <P> One major West Coast fund manager argued that Murdock will sell Dole  eventually. "This is not the end of the story," this money manager said,  declining to allow his name to be used. "The interest that Murdock saw in Dole  (from potential buyers) indicates that something's got to happen down the  road," the money manager said.  </P> <P> Dole spokeswoman Carol J. Klein declined to identify possible bidders or  comment on the potential for a future sale. Analysts said Chiquita Brands  International of Cincinnati had offered about $2.16 billion for Dole. Other  interested companies named were Procter &amp; Gamble of Cincinnati and Sumitomo  of Japan.  </P> <P> The Chiquita bid was "a low-ball price" because the company is valued at $2.5  billion to $3 billion, said Randy Havre, president of J. B. Havre Securities, a  Honolulu brokerage.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Castle &amp; Cooke is the parent company of Dole Food and  Oceanic Properties Inc. of Honolulu. Its stock closed at $33.625 on the New  York Stock Exchange Thursday, down $0.375 from Wednesday's trading. The  announcement was made after the market closed.  </P> <P> "You will see a selloff on the (Castle &amp; Cooke) stock," Havre predicted  Thursday, "because of the people in there for speculative reasons."  </P> <P> Jeffrey Greenblatt, partner at investment firm Baker, Nye Investments in New  York, estimated that Castle &amp; Cooke is worth $46 to $48 a share if the food  and real estate units are fairly valued. Because the stock has been trading  around $33.625 -- rather than closer to the company's potential value -- Wall  Street's disappointment isn't likely to be so great, he said.  </P> <P> He believes that the stock will fall back to the high $20 range, which would  become "an attractive level" for investors who wanted to buy for Castle's  long-term earnings potential. The stock traded as low as $26.25 in October,  when it last appeared that Castle was having trouble peddling Dole.  </P> <P> Several money managers who own the stock applauded Murdock's decision to take  Dole off the market rather than sell at a cheap price, even if the stock price  falls temporarily. "It's a business you should only sell when you can get the  price it deserves," said one money manager, requesting anonymity.  </P> <P> One probable obstacle to getting that good price is the potential sale of  competitor Del Monte by troubled British conglomerate Polly Peck. Potential  buyers of Dole may figure that they can get a much better deal for Del Monte.  </P> <P> Castle &amp; Cooke announced in May, 1989, that it would spin off Dole to  create separate corporate identities for its food and real estate subsidiaries  in an effort to better finance both segments' growth.  </P> <P> But tight credit and slow government approval put a roadblock in Castle &amp;  Cooke's progress, and in May, 1990, the company announced that the spinoff was  in trouble. Two months later, Castle &amp; Cooke said that it had been  contacted by "several major companies" interested in buying Dole.  </P> <P> And Thursday, the company shifted gears again and took the "For Sale" down. The  proposed spin off is also on indefinite hold, Klein said. Castle &amp; Cooke  also said Thursday that that it will pay a regular quarterly dividend of 10  cents a share -- its first dividend since April, 1982.  </P> <P> Dole's revenue was $2.55 billion in 1989, up from $2.3 billion in 1988. Dole is  the dominant worldwide producer and distributor of fresh produce, the world's  largest pineapple producer and No. 2 in bananas and citrus.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has  announced the creation of a Guatemalan-Mexican binational trade  committee. During the second day of his visit to Mexico,  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio held a working  meeting with members of the Mexican Businessmen's Council for  International Affairs, CEMAI. He told Mexican and Guatemalan  businessmen that the big challenges facing Latin America today  are to fight poverty, to increase production, and to eliminate  the banners of subversion, because there are those who use  poverty and injustice as banners to destabilize.    The Guatemalan president announced the creation of a  binational committee headed by the Mexican trade secretary and  Guatemalan trade minister so that access to both markets will be  facilitated at the government level. Later, Ramiro de Leon  Carpio met for 30 minutes with Mr. Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,  president of the National Human Rights Commission. At the end  of the meeting the Guatemalan president said that the task of a  human rights defender is difficult in any country, but that it  is even more complicated when there are movements, such as the  one earlier this year in the State of Chiapas.    [Begin de Leon recording] I have said so very frankly and  very sincerely, as I am accustomed to speaking. I envy you. I  envy you, because I would have liked it if the internal armed  conflict in Guatemala could have been resolved as quickly as  this confrontation was solved here. [end recording]    Later, the Guatemalan president made a private visit to the  San Angel Televisa Studios. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  ended his official visit by meeting in the afternoon with a  Guatemalan delegation in Mexico.</p>

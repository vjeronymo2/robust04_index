			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PACOIMA GROUP NOTCHES ANOTHER VICTORY OVER LIQUOR STORES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles zoning official on Friday rejected a Pacoima gas station's  request to sell beer and wine, another victory for residents fighting to reduce  liquor sales in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> More than 30 people urged Zoning Administrator Jon Perica to deny the  application for the Arco gas station at 13570 Van Nuys Boulevard. Residents say  that stretch of the thoroughfare has too many liquor stores and bars.  </P> <P> They were joined by representatives of Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and  Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, along with a Los Angeles police  officer.  </P> <P> In rejecting owner Sion Sasoones' application, Perica cited police reports that  the area has a high number of drunk-driving arrests. He agreed with residents  that the neighborhood is saturated with liquor businesses -- eight stores and  four bars in a two-block area.  </P> <P> Sasoones' representative said that because of the community opposition, he will  advise his client not to appeal the decision.  </P> <P> The hearing at the Van Nuys Woman's Club showed the growing effectiveness of a  residents group in reducing the concentration of liquor stores and bars in  Pacoima. Residents blame the stores and bars for crime, drunk driving and  loitering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Refused  </P> <P> On May 30, the Los Angeles City Council refused an appeal by another Pacoima  gas station owner to sell liquor. The same day, a city zoning board imposed  strict operating restrictions on three liquor stores.  </P> <P> "We're starting to get good at this," said Fred Taylor of the Pacoima  Coordinating Council. "It's time people start looking at what this community is  saying."  </P> <P> Acknowledging the community opposition, Sasoones had offered to sell only  nonrefrigerated beer and wine and to stop liquor sales at 10 p.m. But Perica  said the area's problems are too serious to permit new sales.  </P> <P> Perica had denied a liquor permit for Sasoones 18 months ago.  </P> <P> Al Pratt, Sasoones' representative, said he understood the community's  frustration. But he argued that his client would suffer economically because of  the residents' opposition to all liquor sales.  </P> <P> "That's the mentality right now," Pratt said. "I applaud the efforts of the  groups that have to live with the turmoil, but each case should be evaluated on  an individual basis. He runs a good business. Why not give him a license and  pull other licenses that are being abused?"  </P> <P> Perica praised community leaders for a well-organized presentation. Bernardi  said later that residents support crackdowns on existing merchants in addition  to banning new requests to sell liquor.  </P> <P> "The whole community is up in arms," Bernardi said. "Getting a new liquor  license in that area is going to be pretty tough. If someone does get a liquor  license, there will be some very severe limitations on what kind of business  they can do."  </P> <P> Taylor and other residents said owners of formerly notorious liquor stores in  the area are now cooperating with residents by setting up security patrols,  cracking down on loitering and painting over gang graffiti.  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / BP dividend increase barely matches inflation BRITISH Petroleum, one of the UK's top blue-chip companies, decided to hold its final dividend yesterday, leaving shareholders with a dividend increase for the whole year which barely matched the rate of inflation. Mr Robert Horton, the chairman, blamed the move on BP's poor fourth-quarter result which saw profits plunge to Pounds 72m from Pounds 456m on a replacement cost basis. He described the result as 'extremely disappointing', and added to the gloom by predicting that the next six months would be no better than the last. Investors had been hoping that BP - which has not raised its quarterly dividend since the first quarter - would boost its final payout to give them an increase in real terms in line with its recent policy. But yesterday's final dividend of 4.2p makes a full-year total of 16.8p. This is an increase of 4.7 per cent against inflation last year of 4.5 per cent. The stock market reacted with disappointment, marking BP shares down by 16p to 268p, though they later recovered to close at 274p. BP took the opportunity to restate its dividend policy yesterday. This is to offer real growth 'over a run of years' based on an operating strategy designed to enlarge the corporation in real terms. But BP also said: 'You can't pretend that difficult years aren't difficult. Given that our quarterly declaration of dividends is a very flexible signalling process, now seems an appropriate moment to pause for breath and take stock of the general economic environment.' BP's announcement followed weeks of rumours of tensions within the company as it grappled with the effects of recession, weak oil prices and a higher level of debt than its main competitors. Mr Horton said yesterday he wanted to 'knock firmly on the head' any suggestion there was a board split over the dividend decision. There was certainly debate, he said, but not a division. While BP was clearly suffering from the effects of recession, it had taken firm steps to adjust to the weaker oil price, around Dollars 18 for North Sea crude, down from Dollars 24 last year. All BP's businesses had been tested against Dollars 18 oil, he said, and had proved robust. But he warned that in the longer run the oil price would have to rise significantly to create the incentive for the oil industry to invest in new production. In a comment clearly aimed at the OPEC meeting taking place in Geneva, he predicted a worldwide shortfall of 20m barrels a day by the end of the decade at current price levels. BP's replacement cost profit for the whole year was Pounds 1.035bn, down 14 per cent from Pounds 1.2bn. Lex, Page 14 Details, Page 16 Markets, Page 34</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UN delay for Bonn and Tokyo A United Nations General Assembly committee yesterday agreed the Security Council should be enlarged, but reached no decision on how to do it. As a result, Germany and Japan, which both want a permanent seat on the 15-member body, are unlikely to achieve the goal for several years. Japan had hoped for a preliminary decision before 1995, the 50th anniversary of the UN, but a spokesman for secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali said he doubted the controversy could be resolved by next year. A senior German envoy said Bonn was not worried about the committee's report as long as discussions continued and the 'momentum was not lost'. He said Germany would like to see some concrete proposals within the next year, but had always realised that ratification of any proposal would be a drawn-out process.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Buthelezi hints at pullout CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, yesterday cast doubt over the future participation of the mainly Zulu Inkatha party in constitutional talks. Speaking to the board of directors of the Afrikaans publishing house Perskor, he said Inkatha would not return to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional negotiating forum, 'as things stand now'. Chief Buthelezi did not himself take part in Codesa, in protest against the exclusion from the talks of the Zulu king. Inkatha, however, was represented. Although the Inkatha party is seen more as a regional power in Kwazulu/Natal than a national political player, any constitutional talks that proceeded without them would be fatally flawed. Voicing clear disquiet that bilateral negotiations between the government and the African National Congress (ANC) threaten to marginalise Inkatha, Chief Buthelezi criticised President F W de Klerk, saying: 'I do not quite know how to read Mr de Klerk at the moment. . . He gives evidence of following appeasement politics towards the ANC in order to please the international community.' The Inkatha leader's comments are clearly a warning to the government that his party will not play ball if it feels the ANC and government are hijacking the negotiations process behind closed doors. He described possible bilateral talks between the ANC and government as a 'threat to democracy'. Chief Buthelezi said Codesa was not fully representative and called for a more broadly based negotiations process in which not only political parties  -as was the case with Codesa - are represented. Codesa's activities have been suspended for the past two months because of the constitutional impasse between the government and the ANC. These parties appear close to resuming talks, though there is general consensus that Codesa structures will have to be amended to function more efficiently.</p>

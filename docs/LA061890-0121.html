			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: WILL REGGIE JACKSON PUT ON THE PINSTRIPES AGAIN?  </P> <P> WHAT I wonder about today is the rumor that George Steinbrenner is going to  bring back none other than baseball ace Reggie Jackson to manage the Yankees  next season. Well, that's what Reggie-ites are whispering on both coasts.  </P> <P> NBC'S LATE-NIGHT show, "Later With Bob Costas," has the CBS titan Dan Rather on  for two nights -- Tuesday and Wednesday -- and the anchorman rates his  competitor by saying: "Costas -- he's a hell of an interviewer!"  </P> <P> BEING BOTH a hick and an incorrigible fan, I've never entered those hallowed  gates of New York's "21" without seeing somebody special inside. The other  night, the frisson of thrill came from looking up from the table I was sharing  with Shirley "20/20" Clurman and her writer husband, Richard, and seeing Frank  Sinatra standing there in black-tied glory. He had just come from his Radio  City Music Hall concert and left a big table with his wife, Barbara, tycoon  John Kluge, pal Judy Green, and that Hollywood glamour couple, Jilly and Tom  Selleck, to come say hello.  </P> <P> Wearing the Presidential Medal insignia in his lapel, Sinatra looked fabulous.  In fact, he seemed to be more fit than I've seen dear Francis Albert in ages.  Those of us who thrilled to his music in the '40s and followed his saga through  the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, always know he is a very special talent and  still the biggest star of the '90s.  </P> <P> THE TOP-SECRET filming of spring-summer is taking place now on a hermetically  sealed set at Pinewood Studios, outside London. The Universal movie is a  contemporary English romantic comedy about the aristocracy, and director David  S. Ward has quite a cast of dandies and eccentrics working for him -- Peter  O'Toole, the British phenomenon who has progressed from being merely brilliant  while drinking to being even more brilliant while sober . . . "Roseanne's" now  less-hefty husband, John Goodman . . . and the fabled actor John Hurt, who has  joined the "King Ralph I" cast in the role of the villain, Lord Percival  Graves. . . . Walt Disney has signed the black British funnyman Lenny Henry to  a major two-picture deal and (speaking of mega-stars), they hope to put him  right into the big leagues with Eddie Murphy. . . . Producers Don Saxon and  Robert Blume are working on a Broadway musical about the TV uncle of us all,  Milton Berle, and Uncle Miltie is their consultant. (But I thought they already  made a musical about Milton, titled "Top Banana.")  </P></p>

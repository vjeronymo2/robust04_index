			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> TOP DRUNK-NABBERS HONORED BY MADD  </P> <P> Officers Karl Schuler and Mike Cohen remember nights when the back seat of  their patrol car was full of folks -- all drunk-driving suspects.  </P> <P> In all, Cohen and Schuler arrested 430 people on suspicion of drunk driving  while working as partners on a three-month assignment to Costa Mesa's Drunk  Driving Enforcement Team, a record for law enforcement teams in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Think about it," said Schuler, a 14-year veteran on the force. "We're just two  guys in one patrol car. And when you make that many arrests, you spend a lot of  time in the station booking people.  </P> <P> "There must be an uncountable number who get away. There were nights when we  would be on our way back to the station with more than one drunk driver in the  back seat of the patrol car and we would see another one. One time we had as  many as four in the car at once," Schuler said. "We arrested one guy twice:  once during the beginning of our watch in April and again near the end of our  assignment in June. He remembered us."  </P> <P> Cohen said that several drivers they arrested were apprehended again by the  next team of Costa Mesa police officers assigned to the special patrol.  </P> <P> "People aren't getting the message somehow. We could go right out there again  and arrest just as many, probably more. But still I'm glad to have brought in  as many as we did. It saved lives," he said.  </P> <P> The pair were honored along with other Orange County law enforcement officers  Friday night at an awards banquet in Irvine sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk  Driving. Awards were given to officers nominated by their departments for their  efforts to curb drunk driving.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa has the highest drunk-driving apprehension rate in the county this  year.  </P> <P> Six other officers from the department were honored at the banquet, including  partners Marty Carver and Scott May, who have made more than 1,000  drunk-driving arrests in the past two years.  </P> <P> Schuler said the special teams have helped the department fine-tune the arrest  procedure. Fellow officers on regular patrol also stop drunk-driving suspects  and then call in the enforcement team to handle the sobriety test and booking  procedure.  </P> <P> "It was a total team effort with everybody's time utilized effectively. Even  the clerical staff helps out by typing reports we dictate instead of writing  them up ourselves."  </P> <P> Schuler credits the streamlined paper work system designed by Police Chief  David Snowden for helping make the arrests stick.  </P> <P> "The drunk-driving arrest form is so simple that even a layman could fill it  out right the first time. It keeps us from making paper work errors or  neglecting to take down important evidence." The department has a 95%  conviction rate, Schuler said.  </P> <P> "I have only had to appear in court twice so far, and both defendants were  convicted," he said. JANICE L. JONES  </P></p>

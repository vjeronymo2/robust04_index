			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sandoz shows first-half improvement SANDOZ, the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, has reported a 14 per cent rise in revenues to SFr7.9bn (Dollars 6.07bn) and 'positive growth' in core earnings in the first half. The growth in revenue was again flattered by the weakness of the Swiss franc. In local currency terms, growth was only 8 per cent. The pharmaceutical division, accounting for 45 per cent of sales, saw a 16 per cent rise in revenues to SFr3.5bn, thanks to a strong performance in the US. Sales of chemicals, mainly dyes, rose 10 per cent to SFr1.3bn. Although distributors had high stocks at the beginning of the season, agricultural chemical sales were up a 'satisfactory' 6 per cent to SFr803m. Half of the 28 per cent surge in sales of nutritional products to SFr937m was attributed to internal growth and half to acquisitions last year.</p>

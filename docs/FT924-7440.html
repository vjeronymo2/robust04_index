			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Delegates hopeful on preservation of ozone layer DELEGATES to international talks on damage to the earth's ozone layer, starting in Copenhagen today, are confident they will be able to speed the phasing out of chemicals that damage the layer. The fourth meeting of parties to the 1987 Montreal Protocol comes just days after a UN report warned that thinning of the ozone layer of the atmosphere, which threatens to increase human skin cancer and damage crop yields, had been more severe this winter than scientists had expected. The Montreal Protocol, which agreed to phase out man-made chemicals used in aerosols, refrigeration and cleaning, has been one of the environmental successes of the past decade. Its proposals have won strong international support, partly because of scientific confidence of the link between ozone depletion and these chemicals and partly because of the availability of substitutes. Representatives of 70 countries, who are beginning 10 days of talks, are expected to back the phasing out of production of four chemicals by 1996 instead of the original deadline of 2000: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, halons and a form of trichloroethane. EC countries have already agreed to tighter deadlines of ceasing production by 1997. The proposals have the support of the US, whose car industry is one of the largest single users of CFCs for air conditioning. Mr William Reilly, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said the total cost of eliminating CFCs in the US would be Dollars 36bn, and the additional cost of moving up the phase-out date from 2000 to 1995 would be Dollars 2bn. However, it is unclear whether the conference will back additional 'intermediate targets' of cutting production of the chemicals by between 50 and 85 per cent, compared with their pre-protocol levels, by 1994. The meeting will also attempt to phase out HCFCs and freeze production of methyl bromide, two chemicals whose threat to the ozone layer has become clearer since the 1987 agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- Locomotive engineers went  on strike Thursday morning, paralyzing railroads across the  country.    Reacting to a riot police raid on the engineers' sit-in  protests earlier in the morning, Chonkihyop, a private  "unregistered" union of locomotive engineers, declared a general  strike immediately after the raid, four days earlier than  originally scheduled.    During the raid, the police, mobilizing over 6,000 riot  troopers, took away 613 engineers staging sit-in demonstrations  at 14 sites in nine cities for later detention.    The strike reduced railroad transportation, both passengers  and cargo, to 11.2 percent of the normal level, the Korean  National Railroad said. On the Seoul-Pusan line, the usual 147  train runs a day fell to only 28.    The police sought arrest warrants for seven leaders of  Chonkihyop, including Vice Chairman Pak Sang-su.    The Seoul Subway Workers Union threatened to join locomotive  engineers in the strike at 4:00 AM Friday if collective  bargaining on Thursday fails, while Chonnodae (the National  Council of Trade Union Representatives), another dissident  unregistered labor organization, is moving toward striking along  with Chonkihyop.    Transportation Minister O Myong, saying the police raid was  unavoidable to prevent the threatened railroad and subway  strikes next Monday, appealed to the striking engineers to  return to their duties.    Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok called an  emergency  economic ministers' meeting to discuss handling the railroad  strike and the imminent Seoul subway strike.    Economic losses from the railroad and subway strikes are  estimated at 2,950 million won (some 3.6 million U.S. dollars) a  day.</p>

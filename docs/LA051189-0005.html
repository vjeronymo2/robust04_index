			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE IMAGES  </P> <P> Americans don't care so much about what something is, as long as what it is  called presents a positive image.  </P> <P> Thus "Chinese gooseberries" became Kiwi fruit when introduced into the United  States.  </P> <P> The janitor became a "sanitation engineer."  </P> <P> A variety of salesmen became "consultants."  </P> <P> Rebel guerrillas became "freedom fighters."  </P> <P> And, most recently, we began reducing the rhetoric about tax increases by  calling them "revenue enhancements."  </P> <P> Hence, on the theory that almost any unyielding problem can be solved by  describing it in positive terms. I suggest the following examples:  </P> <P> The homeless -- "outdoorsmen."  </P> <P> A beggar -- "funds solicitor."  </P> <P> Inside trader -- "knowledgeable investor."  </P> <P> A massive layoff -- "rigid expense control program."  </P> <P> Living below poverty level -- "living life according to its essential  priorities."  </P> <P> AK-47 -- "Sporting rifle."  </P> <P> Traffic gridlock -- "Highway speed control."  </P> <P> Busting up a company -- "restructuring."  </P> <P> These took a few minutes to think up. Undoubtedly everyone who reads this will  be able to develop his or her own list without too much effort.  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

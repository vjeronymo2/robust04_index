			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;P recovery gathers pace P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services company, saw pre-tax profits double on flat revenues in the six months to May 31 1993, as it continued to recover from the effects of the debilitating price war in the personal computer business. Mr David Southworth, managing director, said the improvement confirmed the strategic decision to withdraw from the distribution of low cost, high volume, products to concentrate on high value added services, including video conferencing and multimedia. Profits before tax were Pounds 2m (Pounds 1m) from turnover of Pounds 121.8m (Pounds 119.3m). Turnover on continuing operations after disposal of the high volume business was Pounds 104.8m (Pounds 91.6m), while operating profit on those businesses was ahead 60 per cent at Pounds 2.4m. Fully diluted earnings per share were 2.1p (1p) and an interim dividend of 0.8p (0.7p) is declared. Mr Southworth said that there was 'quiet satisfaction' that the group, one of the UK's largest personal computer distributors, was well on course for recovery. He said the level of corporate investment was high although small businesses were spending money on information technology only sluggishly. Plans to invest were still being delayed, moreover, by the need to make decisions over future technological developments. Corporates were undecided whether to invest in Intel's new Pentium chip technology or to opt for Risc technologies from other suppliers.</p>

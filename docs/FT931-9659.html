			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / People: Orderly succession at Shell John Jennings, who has been with the Royal Dutch/Shell group for over 30 years, will take over the chairmanship of the British arm, Shell Transport and Trading, when Sir Peter Holmes retires at the end of June. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group is the world's second biggest oil company and its management succession tends to be orderly and dictated by a retirement age of 60. Sir Peter, who has been chairman since 1985, was 60 last September and it had been expected that he would hand over the chair to the next most senior of the three British group managing directors. Jennings, 55, has been a group managing director since July 1987 and has come up on the exploration side of the group. Having graduated in geology from Birmingham University in 1958, he was awarded a Shell research studentship enabling him to obtain his PhD in geology from Edinburgh. He spent his early career exploring for oil overseas. In 1979 he was appointed managing director of Shell UK exploration and production and in 1985 was made exploration and production co-ordinator for the Shell group based in The Hague. Sir Peter Holmes, like his predecessor Sir Peter Baxendell, will remain on the board after he retires but his role as chairman of the joint committee of the service companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group will be taken by Cor Herkstroter, president of Royal Dutch Petroleum. Jennings will become vice chairman of the committee but given that he is of a similar age to Herkstroter, the most senior position in the group is likely to continue to be dominated by the Dutch side. Traditionally, the post has rotated between a British and Dutch chairman. But the differences in ages has meant that the Dutch have tended to hold the job longer than their British colleagues. Sir Peter Holmes, for example, was close to retirement when he became chairman of that committee last June. ***** STOREHOUSE acted quickly yesterday to plug the gaps while it searches for a new chief executive after David Dworkin's decision to leave for Carter Hawley Hale in the US. Graham Rider, group finance director, was appointed acting managing director of the BhS store chain in addition to his existing responsibilities. Ann Iverson, the former colleague whom Dworkin brought from the US to help him at BhS, and then promoted to chief executive at Mothercare, was appointed to the Storehouse board. ***** Alan Goodhill yesterday resigned from his position at Morgan Stanley International in London. Goodhill, 44, had been head of European equities for the past three years, and had worked for the firm since 1982. A Morgan Stanley official says resignation came as 'a surprise', adding that Goodhill planned to 'enjoy some time with his family'. Goodhill himself was not available for comment, having already departed from Morgan Stanley's Docklands headquarters by mid-afternoon in line with the firm's policy. ***** FENNER, the Hull-based power transmission, industrial conveyer belts and fluid power group, yesterday announced the appointment with immediate effect of Julian Bigden as group managing director. Bigden, 48, replaces Tom Brown, who has resigned. The move was unexpected, but Peter Barker, Fenner's chairman, said: 'It's pretty tough out there, and I think Tom took the view that he would like to pursue other interests.' The new md, who remains president of the US company, has been with Fenner for about 20 years, and over the past 10 years has successfully transformed Fenner's US operations into a number of profitable and growing businesses under the umbrella of Fenner Inc.</p>

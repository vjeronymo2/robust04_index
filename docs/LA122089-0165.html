			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'MAGIC' DANDRUFF REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Q. When I was in England last winter I had such terrible dandruff I went to see  a dermatologist. He prescribed a shampoo that cleared my scalp up like magic.  </P> <P> Now the problem has returned. My doctor says I have seborrheic dermatitis, but  he didn't know what I was talking about when I mentioned the English shampoo.  The stuff he offered isn't nearly as good.  </P> <P> Please tell me what they use in Europe and how I can get some more.  </P> <P> A. We can't be sure what your English doctor prescribed, but it might well have  been Nizoral (ketoconazole) shampoo. Although this anti-fungal medicine is  available in the United States both as a cream and as tablets, it has not yet  been approved as a shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis or severe dandruff.  </P> <P> There is growing evidence this condition is caused by a yeast infection of the  scalp, which may explain why Nizoral shampoo is so effective. It is available  in Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Singapore, South Africa and the  United Kingdom.  </P> <P> Unless you plan to travel abroad, you will have to wait for the Janssen  pharmaceutical company to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration to market its unique shampoo in the United States.  </P> <P> Q. When will the FDA allow tryptophan to be sold again? I used it successfully  for insomnia and am upset I can't buy it now.  </P> <P> A. There are now more than 700 cases of EMS (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome)  reported in conjunction with tryptophan. This potentially lethal blood and  muscle disorder has everyone confused.  </P> <P> Although millions of people have used tryptophan safely for years, the reports  of fever, muscle aches and high blood counts have forced the feds to pull this  amino acid off the market. Until they get to the bottom of the mystery, no one  should take tryptophan.  </P> <P> Q. I have had asthma for 60 years, and I try to stay on top of new drugs and  therapies for my breathing problem. Is there any newsletter that would keep me  up to date on the latest trends in asthma treatment?  </P> <P> A. We have just come across "Air Currents," a new asthma newsletter. It offers  practical information and lists resources. For a free copy write to Air  Currents, Dept. P; 301 East 57th St., New York, NY 10022.  </P></p>

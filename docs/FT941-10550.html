			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Major pressed on BAe chief's pay Mr John Major, the prime minister, was fiercely attacked by Labour MPs in the Commons yesterday when he refused to comment on the Pounds 10m Mr John Cahill is expected to gain from a two-year stint as chairman of British Aerospace. Ms Lynne Jones, Labour MP for Birmingham Selly Oak, challenged the prime minister to condemn such a massive payment, reported to comprise share options estimated to be worth Pounds 9m and a Pounds 1.5m severance package.</p>

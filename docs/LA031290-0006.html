			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MWD MAY ORDER PLANS FOR WATER CUTBACKS;  </P> <P> DROUGHT: CITIES IN THE EASTERN COUNTY MAY BE FORCED TO FOLLOW THE CITY OF  VENTURA'S LEAD IN CONTINGENCY PLANNING. THE WATER DISTRICT IS ASSESSING  RAINFALL LEVELS.  </P> <P> Cutbacks in the supply of state water to the major cities of eastern Ventura  County -- including Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley -- may be considered as early  as next month because of the state's continuing drought, according to a  regional water official.  </P> <P> While most of the eastern county has been virtually unaffected by the drought  until now, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern  California said that could change in April after the state officially assesses  rainfall levels of the last year.  </P> <P> "At this moment, we are not planning any cutbacks," spokesman Jay Malinowski  said. "But that could change at the end of the month."  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District, which receives most of its water from the  state water project, supplies the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which in  turn supplies water to Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and  Oxnard.  </P> <P> Although the regional water district has not announced any cutbacks, Malinowski  said cities in the county could be asked as early as this week to begin drawing  up water-reduction ordinances that could be implemented.  </P> <P> Malinowski said the issue has arisen because the end of March marks the end of  the so-called "rain year," the period in which the state's annual rainfall is  officially assessed.  </P> <P> If, as expected, the state Department of Water Resources, which operates the  state water project, determines that not enough rain has fallen this year to  meet the demands of its customers, cutbacks may be required, Malinowski said.  </P> <P> Malinowski said he could not estimate the amount of cutback expected, saying  only that he does not expect it to be as large as 20%.  </P> <P> Directors of the board of the Metropolitan Water District will vote Tuesday on  a resolution that would ask all cities and government agencies in Southern  California that use water provided by the district to pass water-reduction  ordinances that could be immediately implemented with word from Metropolitan,  Malinowski said.  </P> <P> "We want these ordinances on the books so they can be called into play  immediately," he said.  </P> <P> Kurt O. Reithmayr, principal engineer for the city of Thousand Oaks and  director on the Calleguas Municipal Water board, said Calleguas has already  begun to consider such a standby ordinance. But he said he was surprised to  learn that cutbacks from Metropolitan may be imminent.  </P> <P> "Until now, Met has supplied all the water we've needed," Reithmayr said.  "We're sitting fine now, but if Met cuts us back, we will have to pass it  along.  </P> <P> "Demand is constantly going up and supply is getting worse," he said. "There  will certainly be a crunch and I think it's going to come very, very quickly."  </P> <P> The disclosure that eastern areas of the county may soon be faced with water  cutbacks follows months of debate over cutbacks and rationing in some cities in  the county's westernmost region, which are not linked to the state water  system.  </P> <P> In the most drastic water conservation measure considered in the county, the  Ventura City Council is expected to formally approve a strict new water  rationing plan tonight on all of the city's residential and business water  customers. That measure has already received preliminary approval.  </P> <P> Although the Ventura ordinance includes stiff penalties for exceeding the water  rations, Ventura officials said this week they hope their plan will inspire  cooperation instead of resentment.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which is modeled after one in place in the unincorporated area  of Santa Barbara County known as Goleta, cuts water allocations to industrial  and commercial users by 15% to 20%.  </P> <P> The ordinance assigns quotas by household. Allocations for houses start at 294  gallons per day, based on four-person family. Allocations for apartment  dwellers begin at 196 gallons per day, based on a three-person household.  </P> <P> The Goleta Water District imposed a similar rationing plan on May 1, 1989,  after the operators of Lake Cachuma told the district that its allocation of  water would be reduced by 20%.  </P> <P> Larry Farwell, conservation coordinator at Goleta, said the restrictions  imposed so far in Goleta amount to about a 15% cutback. He added, however, that  residents have cut back even more than that, reducing their usage by about 40%  and contributing to an overall 28% reduction for all homes and businesses in  the area.  </P> <P> At a time when further cutbacks are expected from Lake Cachuma, Farwell said  that puts the district in good shape now.  </P> <P> Of the 1,600 appeals for extra water allocations since the program started,  Farwell said, only 70 have been denied.  </P> <P> The rationing in Goleta, however, has caused some problems for residents.  </P> <P> David Moore was one of the 70 residents turned down in a request for extra  water after claiming that the duplex he owns should be viewed as two separate  houses instead of multiple-dwelling units.  </P> <P> He and his grown son and small daughter live in half of the duplex he owns,  which he said has three bedrooms and two baths on each side. He rents out the  second side. Each side receives an allocation of about 58 gallons per person,  the Goleta allowance for multiple housing units.  </P> <P> "We have lawns, we have laundry," he said. "But they didn't want to hear it at  all. A duplex is a multiple unit and that was it."  </P> <P> Throughout the Goleta area, lawns are starting to brown.  </P> <P> Many Goleta residents are using the techniques that the district has suggested  in a public education campaign.  </P> <P> "We have a bucket in our shower for when we're waiting for the water to get  warm," said 9-year-old Justin Ramirez, the son of Jill and Tony Ramirez. "We  take the water out and throw it on the plants."  </P> <P> Similar techniques will be suggested as part of a public education campaign in  Ventura, which will begin with a brochure mailing on March 23, Jones said.  </P> <P> The Ventura water shortage originates at Lake Casitas, which is nearing the  level at which it cannot sustain a prolonged drought, Jones said.  </P> <P> The Casitas Municipal Water District, which supplies most of the water used by  the city of Ventura, and a small portion of that used by the city of Ojai, will  soon hold public hearings on an ordinance that would cut the amount of water  its customers receive.  </P> <P> John Johnson, general manager for Casitas, said he believes the Ojai Valley has  time to move more slowly into a water rationing program than the city of  Ventura.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Johnson is recommending that the Casitas Board of Directors  declare a water shortage emergency when it holds a public hearing Wednesday  night, call for an immediate 20% voluntary cutback on all customer demands and  begin a 45-day moratorium on new service connections.  </P> <P> Johnson said he is proposing a six-stage program for water conservation  throughout the district. To give the public time to discuss the plan, he said  he will suggest to the Casitas board that it delay adoption of the full program  until another public hearing April 11.  </P></p>

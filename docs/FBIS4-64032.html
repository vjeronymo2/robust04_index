			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by Oleg Padenko] </F>   [Text] [Padenko] In the old days, when returning from  assignments to the correspondent's office in Vladivostok, we  would bring back souvenirs such as exotic shells, ornaments, or  pictures. Nowadays we bring back mortar fragments like this  from the scenes of explosions. Although just this type of  souvenir -- an unexploded mortar shell -- nigh on turned the  hair of the owner of this kitchen garden in Novonezhino white,  while this old woman, Praskovya, who by some miracle avoided  being buried alive in her own home, will now, like many others,  have to live in another village.    [First unidentified speaker] The storage of ammunition in  our country just takes the cake. They store matches more  carefully around here than they do ammunition.    [Second unidentified speaker] The munitions dumps were  overfilled with a huge quantity of ammunition brought in from  the Baltic region over the last few months, which should have  been destroyed over there somewhere. When the first rumblings  were heard, I said to myself that I'd bet anything that the  entire 53d depot was going up in smoke.    [Padenko] The old man was right -- 1,600 tonnes, 800  railcars of lethal weapons exploded, which is equivalent to a  nuclear bomb. The tremors resounded across Ussuriysk Bay and  were felt in Vladivostok, houses in several villages burned  down, and a railroad was destroyed. The memorable munitions  explosion of two years ago -- you are watching footages of that  disaster here -- was nothing compared to this. Bombs and  aviation missiles are still going off at will all over the place  for miles around. The whole area has been staked out like a  minefield. Unbelievably, but fortunately...    [Unidentified speaker] ...there have been no fatalities.  Although, taking account of everything, there have been  something like 23 casualties.    [Padenko] But for the mountains and the speedy evacuation,  things could have been a lot worse. What is needed now is help,  as the damage runs into tens of billions. But there is no  money. Which is probably also the reason why the clearly naive  sailors went to the depots and through criminal ignorance  started off a small local war. You know, at present the Pacific  Fleet is more than 30-percent undermanned. Many of the recent  draftees are quite simply useless. And the amount of finance  allocated to maintain one of the world's most powerful fleets is  laughable -- in May alone just 12 percent of the requirement was  forthcoming. But at the same time I must stress, to  counterbalance the accusations leveled, that combat readiness  has actually increased. Mutual relations have improved, and the  fleet's future is looking brighter. Which is why everybody was  shocked by the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral  Gurinov. Officers' assemblies were held in the fleet, and  appeals to the Russian president to repeal the dismissal were  adopted.    [Rear Admiral A.A. Belousov] This is the opinion of officers  and instructors at the Pacific Fleet Higher Naval Training  School named for Admiral Makarov. It is the view of many  Pacific Fleet commanders. And it is the view of many admirals.    [Captain First Rank A.I. Gruzdev] If Admiral Gurinov's  dismissal from the post of fleet commander is upheld, then the  Pacific Fleet personnel will see this as a slap in the face.    [Padenko] Harsh words, but true. Meanwhile, Vice Admiral  Khmelnov has been appointed acting commander of the Pacific  Fleet.</p>

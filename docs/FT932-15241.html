			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Domesday in a big brown envelope - Cereal and beef producers wanting set-aside payments have their paperwork cut out LARGE BROWN envelopes marked MAFF and weighing a total of some 20 tonnes thudded through British farmers' letter boxes last week. Many of the cereal and beef farmers to whom these packages were addressed will have spent much of their Easter holiday poring over the contents. For they contained the dramatically dubbed 'Domesday' forms, otherwise known as 'The Integrated Administration and Control System', IACS for short. They are the direct result of the reform last May of the Common Agricultural Policy. If farmers do not complete them correctly those who grow cereals and produce beef will not be eligible for arable area payments in compensation for setting aside 15 per cent of their cereal land or for headage payments on controlled numbers of cattle. Each form has 19 columns of questions which farmers must answer, giving every detail about every field under their control - its Ordnance Survey sheet number, its national grid reference, its size (in hectares, not acres) to two decimal places, the crop it is growing, the variety of the seed, its estimated yield, etc etc etc. Each part field must be recorded on a separate line which, in practice, because of split cropping perhaps, or the fact that the whole field may not appear on just one map, means that some fields run to five or six lines. Copies of the maps themselves must be included with the forms when they are returned. Rather more than 20 tonnes of paper will shortly be heading back to Maff, I suspect. Before a farmer attempts to fill in the IACS forms he is advised to read and fully understand the 79-page book of instructions which accompanied them. For if there is a delay in returning the forms, or a mistake is made, the penalties are harsh. For instance, if the forms, correct in every detail, are returned to Maff later than the May 15 deadline the farmer concerned will have his aid reduced by 1 per cent for each day by which the return is delayed. If this extends beyond 20 days he will lose the whole of his entitlement. There are similar penalties for accidental inaccuracy and threats of criminal prosecution for those who make fraudulent claims. It is unlikely there will be much public sympathy for an industry about to receive close to Pounds 1bn of public money merely because its participants are required to fill in some forms. But to understand farmers' hostility to the massive bureaucracy it should be remembered that most farmers did not want set-aside in the first place and never thought that it would work; that they would far rather be growing crops or producing meat from their land than allowing weeds to regenerate on 15 per cent of it; and that while these forms have taken hundreds of experts 10 months to write, the farmers who have to complete them have barely five weeks to gather together all the necessary facts and evidence and return them. To the layman, that may sound more than adequate time. But 67 people are leaving the land each week, leaving a growing number of farmers to do all the work on their holdings themselves. And this at a time of year that involves being on a tractor from dawn to dusk or perhaps on duty in the lambing shed for 20 or more hours a day. It would not be so bad if the related services were on the ball and helpful. As it is I know from personal experience that the local Ordnance Survey map office does not open until 10.30 am (weekdays only), by which time there is invariably a queue of irate farmers banging on the door. For next Friday is effectively the last day for placing orders for maps with any hope of getting them in time for May 15. In desperation many farmers are seeking assistance with the forms from land agents, their agricultural merchants or consultants who have advertised such a service. On the other side, so to speak, Maff has employed 500 extra staff to check the forms, inspect and measure fields and try to identify fraud and. Maff also intends using aerial photographs and satellite images to double check farmers' returns. And Pounds 25m has been allocated for policing the scheme. Inevitably UK farmers have expressed suspicions that within the European Comnunity they may be the victims of enthusiastic British bureaucracy, while the farmers of other member states may be getting away with much less. This, apparently, cannot be fully substantiated. It is reported that some countries, notably Portugal and Spain, have used the form as an excuse to ask extra questions on which they required answers on matters unconnected with CAP reform. Ireland has not yet sent out its forms and Greece produced such a complicated draft that farmers' organisations have so far refused to agree to its distribution. Germany issued its forms a month earlier than the UK - although farmers spanning state borders have to complete two versions - while our nearest neighbours across the North Sea appear to have come closest to reason. Denmark's form runs to eight pages, Belgium's to six and Holland's to only four. But British farmers have some justification for feeling they are being asked to carry a bigger bureaucratic burden than the rest. In the Community as a whole, 34 per cent of the arable land area escapes set-aside regulations and therefore these forms, because of small farm exemptions. Moreover in Greece 88 per cent of the arable land is not involved; in Luxembourg the figure is 77 per cent and in Italy 71 per cent. Other Mediterranean member states and those with poor farming structure qualify for rather lower exemptions while even Holland has 36 per cent of its area outside the scheme; Germany 27 per cent and France 18 per cent. In the UK, however, small farm exemptions represent only 4 per cent of the arable area. That is the reason why almost any farmer you may have seen over Easter will have been even more grumpy than usual.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Interior Ministry has handed a report to  President Martti Ahtisaari on the guarding of the frontier along  Sweden and Norway. The issue of frontier surveillance was  raised during Ahtisaari's state visit to Sweden. Sweden thinks  that in the last few years Finland has militarized the  surveillance of the western border. The Frontier Guard thinks,  however, that the opposite is the case because Finland has  reduced the number of frontier guards on the western border in  the last few years.</p>

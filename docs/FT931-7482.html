			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Insurance watchdog urges check on salesmen THE INSURANCE Ombudsman yesterday called for new checks on insurance salesmen after reporting a 41 per cent increase in the number of life insurance cases he handled last year. His comments come amid heated debate about standards of consumer protection in the life insurance industry. Mr Julian Farrand, who was presenting his annual report at a news conference yesterday, said salesmen should be required to sign a form when selling a life policy, which would give details of how much commission they would receive and why they recommended the policy. He said it was 'disconcerting' so many factfinds - forms filled in by salesmen or advisers giving clients' financial circumstances - were not fully completed: 'It suggests that in the push to produce a sale, important requirements and needs may be overlooked and an unsuitable product selected by the salesman.' Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, called on the government to ensure proper protection for life insurance consumers: 'Self regulation has failed to serve the consumer effectively. The industry must now be opened up to proper scrutiny and more effective competition.' Overall, the number of cases handled by the ombudsman, who deals with both general and life insurance, increased by 29 per cent last year. The 1992 total of 5,576 cases represents a doubling of the workload since 1990 when new claims were 2,640. Life insurance cases now account for over one third of the Insurance Ombudsman's workload and are the most rapidly growing area. In 65 per cent of all cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, said Mr Farrand. He also criticised insurers for not doing enough to protect themselves against fraudulent claims. 'They make a commercial decision to pay out, rather than challenge the insured and suffer a difficult and costly lawsuit.' Trust at a premium, Page 7</p>

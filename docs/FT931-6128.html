			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Cable TV plan by US companies COX CABLE Communications and Southwestern Bell, two US telecom companies, yesterday unveiled a preliminary agreement to buy and operate cable television and telephone systems in the UK. Under the terms of the joint venture, due to be finalised in early April, Cox Cable, based in Atlanta, will take an initial 25 per cent stake in Southwestern Bell's eight UK cable television and telephony franchises covering 1.25m homes in the north-west and Midlands. Both declined to give financial details. Industry analysts believe the joint venture will see Cox investing about Dollars 300m (Pounds 211.2m) in Southwestern's UK cable operations. The deal is further confirmation of strong north American interest in the developing UK cable telecommunications sector. Mr James Robbins, president of Cox Cable, said the joint venture was inspired by a shared belief that the UK 'is the freest competitive telecommunications marketplace in the world today.' Mr Michael Turner, president of Southwestern Bell International Holdings, said the joint venture this year will spend in the region of Pounds 48m, laying cable to about 160,000 homes in its current UK franchises. The latest official statistics from the Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for all commercial television, show that 440,162 homes were connected to modern broadband cable networks by January this year, up from 268,812 in January 1992. The UK has 58 cable operating franchises. According to Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the UK's Cable Television Association, cable television will grow by at least 60 per cent this year with 300,000 new subscribers. Several other US cable operators are understood to be considering investing in UK cable, including Times Mirror, Century Communications, Cablevision Industries and Continental Cablevision. In mid-February Southwestern Bell, based in Texas, agreed to buy two cable television systems in Washington DC for Dollars 650m. That deal has yet to be approved by the US Justice department and the Federal Communications Commission. It also has cable interests in Israel.</p>

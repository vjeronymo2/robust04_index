Ochoa Antich told the media that the meeting, which was to  be  held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), was postponed at the  request of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in view  of the difficult situation Mexico is experiencing due to the  uprising in Chiapas.    The foreign minister indicated that given that in the next  few days there will be a number of important regional  commitments, such as the inauguration of the new president of  Ecuador [as received], the signing was postponed for after 2  February, when Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera takes  office. Ochoa Antich also said the presidents are studying the  possibility of holding their meeting in another city.    The G-3 trade treaty is a tripartite agreement for the  expansion of the trade flow among Colombia, Mexico, and  Venezuela. It provides for the complete elimination of tariffs  within 10 years. The agreement that will be signed by the  presidents establishes regulations for access to markets,  regulations on origin of products, technical norms, intellectual  property regulations, and regulations for the exchange of  transportation, telecommunications, financial, and professional  services. It is expected that this agreement, which at the  moment of its signing contemplates an asymmetrical lifting of  tariffs giving 28 percent preference to Mexico and 12 percent to  Colombia and Venezuela, will go into effect in July, after it is  approved by the countries' parliaments.    Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela form a market of 145 million  people, with $50 billion in total exports and $60 billion in  imports. The GDP of the three countries is approximately $373  billion.</p>

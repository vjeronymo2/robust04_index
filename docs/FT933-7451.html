			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / RiverBus closes with 60 job losses THE OPERATORS of London's RiverBus yesterday decided to close the service after a 15-month struggle since the financial collapse of its principal underwriter Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer. After five years of operation on the Thames between Chelsea, the City, Docklands and Greenwich, the last service ran last night. All 60 staff are to be made redundant. The RiverBus partnership said it had decided at a meeting yesterday that there was no possibility of being able to raise further funds from any sources to pay for future operation. It said it had no outstanding debts. It said RiverBus would pass into the hands of liquidators, who would try to sell it. The number of passengers was growing - 750,000 used the fleet of 10 high-speed ferries last year - but there would never be enough to break even, the partnership said. A long-term future would only have been assured by an injection of public cash. The government's sole contribution had been Pounds 500,000 from the Department of Environment four years ago. It said: 'Public transport in London does not make a profit. We had huge capital overheads, a fleet of boats, crew. The loss to us is nowhere near as much as the loss to London.' RiverBus was launched in June 1988 after 1,700 investors raised Pounds 4.5m to start it under the Business Expansion Scheme. But it did not attract commuters in the numbers it hoped for and had to be rescued in February 1989 by a group of property developers from Docklands and Chelsea, including O&amp;Y, Rosehaugh Stanhope and Chelsea Harbour, which put up Pounds 2.5m. The government contributed Pounds 500,000. The Port of London Authority said it would approach pleasure boat operators licensed to use its piers about setting up RiverBus-type passenger services.</p>

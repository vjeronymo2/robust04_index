			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>   [Text] We believed that two events that occurred in the  space of about a month, but apparently of minor importance, have  put at stake the views advocated by Afonso Dhlakama, and  supported by Aldo Ajello and some Western countries, regarding  the question of the future armed forces personnel.    First situation. A South African traditional chief  accompanied by ranch farmers from that country deliberately  crossed the border into our country, allegedly searching for  cattle stolen by Mozambicans. A number of people told DOMINGO  that it was not the first time that the incident has taken  place. South African farmers often enter Mozambique in search  of cattle allegedly stolen. This is extremely worrisome, since  it is a gross violation of the Mozambican border. More than  that, it is a violation of our country's sovereignty. There is  no proof that in fact Mozambicans have stolen South African  cattle, at least the traditional chief did not give any  evidence. But even if there was proof, the issue should not be  solved by South Africans crossing the border to come and "fetch"  what is alleged to have been stolen from them. To have a  country as a neighbor, is not like having a family as neighbors.  There are appropriate channels for dealing with state matters.    Second Situation. Allegedly to halt the exodus of  Mozambicans to that country, and to block the flow of smugglers  of assorted goods, South African soldiers deliberately made a  unilateral decision: They dropped leaflets over the Mozambican  territory threatening to electrify the border. Once more, this  is a very worrisome situation. Probably there is to be an  exodus of Mozambicans into South Africa. We say probably  because we have no figures to confirm it. Likewise, there could  probably be a flow of smugglers. But since one is dealing with  a border issue, there are procedures to be followed. The South  African authorities -- military, political, or others -- cannot  make unilateral decisions. The measures to be taken should be  discussed by the two states, according to international norms.    Returning to the early issue. Mozambique has a vast border  area with a number of countries: South Africa, Swaziland,  Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania. One cannot completely  rule out the assumption that in future yet another of these  states will take similar measures or even more serious ones. It  will be recalled that the "Young Pioneers" issue has not yet  been resolved. Among other issues...    To say that 7,500 men are enough to defend Mozambique, is  something one cannot understand in the least. It is difficult  to understand the basis for such a proposal. The same can be  said if the number is doubled. A total of 15,000 men is not  enough to defend a third of the Mozambican territory. Even the  30,000 men that have been mentioned only serve to make the  Mozambican state fragile and very vulnerable.    The fact that Mozambique is poor, or the poorest in the  world  cannot by any means mean that the country should not have the  minimum capacity to defend itself.    If one is willing to help the country then one should not  make the country fragile and without capacity to defend itself.</p>

He noted that Haavisto's visit had been postponed at the  request of the Russian side and the request was properly agreed  with the leadership of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  "This postponement is purely technical and has no political  overtones. It is simply a matter of foreign minister Andrey  Kozyrev's `timetable'," Karasin said.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Texaco refinery blaze cuts 10% of UK capacity A fire was still blazing at Texaco's Milford Haven oil refinery in west Wales last night following an explosion that will cut 10 per cent of the UK's refining capacity for an indefinite period. The company said last night that it was too soon to assess the extent of the damage or estimate how long it would take to restore production. However, industry experts said that even prolonged closure would have minimal impact on prices. The blast, which occured at 1.30pm, broke windows in the town of Milford Haven two miles away and was followed by a fierce blaze that took 150 firefighters several hours to bring under control. By early evening the fire was being allowed to burn itself out, and fire crews were expected to remain at the scene throughout the night. Dyfed Fire Brigade reported a leak of inflammable butane gas but a Texaco spokesman, Mr Phil Thompson said he had no information about a leak. Shortly after 10pm, Dyfed's Chief Fire Officer, Mr Ronnie King, leading the operation, said crews had been pulled back after a violent flare-up of an oil product still left in the area. There were no fatalities or serious injuries, but 26 Texaco workers were treated for minor cuts and grazes. The incident was classified as category 3, the most serious, but the company said there was minimal risk of pollution because of the refinery's anti-spill systems. Carmarthen Fire Brigade said the fire caused further explosions. 'There were two explosions originally which caused severe damage to three sections of the plant and the explosions continued,' said a spokesman. It was unclear whether the blast was related to an earlier fire in some scaffolding planks near a crude distillation column which was caused by lightning. 'That fire was extinguished very quickly but it put out some instrumentation and the refinery was put on to tick-over mode,' said Texaco. The neighbouring Gulf and Elf refineries also had small fires after a thunderstorm on Saturday night but suffered no serious damage. The main explosion, which was heard ten miles away, is thought to have occurred in one of the process units near the centre of the refinery and although the subsequent fire spread it remained well away from the storage tanks. The 550 acre site, opened in 1964, is Texaco's only refinery in the UK, with capacity for 180,000 barrels of crude a day. Half is taken up by petrol - about 3.5m gallons a day. It is the UK's second biggest refinery after BP's Grangemouth plant and earlier this year celebrated 1m hours of operations without an incident.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Market's role still baffles: The following is a digest of Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British Association The market is only part of a well-functioning economic system; and many surrounding policies, practices and habits of mind are required to obtain good value from the market system. Yet a functioning market core is still indispensable. Matthew Parris, in one of his excellent tongue-in-cheek columns in The Times, has reminded us that most people do not accept the market system. Parris writes of an aunt of his who believes that there is such a thing as a fair price or wage that can be determined by contemplation rather than the state of the market. 'To my aunt - who votes Conservative, takes the Daily Telegraph and regards socialism as the work of the devil - a fair price is what will secure a reasonable profit after paying employees a decent wage.' It is not that most people are egalitarians. Many people can understand the incentive role of pay and profits. They also accept - if anything, too readily - the hierarchies and financial differentials of modern life. But the elementary demonstration of the role of relative prices in allocating resources and reducing queues has little meaning, even for the educated public. As Parris says: 'Our morality does not mesh with our economic system; but because we need both they cohabit in an awkward marriage based on silence.' The area where popular morality clashes most with market requirements is in the labour market. Examples include minimum pay levels enforced by legislation or collective agreements - or other kinds of costs imposed on employers by measures of a 'European social charter' kind. Such policies are supported by the popular belief that it is wrong to encourage anything that smacks of undercutting by workers bidding for a job, or by employers trying to obtain workers on the cheap. How reasonable is this anti-undercutting mentality? The one near-certainty to hold on to is that, if the loosening of minimum pay laws or their equivalents increases total employment, then the income of the whole community is higher. There are unfortunately likely to be low-income losers. Even if newly taken-on workers are no worse off, their entry is likely to shake out the wages structure and worsen the pay of the less well-paid already in work. Thus a reasonable condition for eliminating minimum wages is that those priced into work should not receive less than they now receive on social security. This can be done with the aid of a top-up like the present UK family benefit, provided it can be extended to families without children and to single people, and the conditions for drawing it made less restrictive. The more difficult people to compensate are those now in work earning above, but not too much above, the social security minimum. Some softening of the blow would be desirable. A basic or minimum income with a high cut-off rate, or implicit marginal tax rate, is the most likely bet. This could be achieved by adjusting existing social security payments and need not involve a vast new scheme. The more selective social security becomes, the more generous governments can be with top-up payments. There is a still more difficult hornets' nest, which I can only stir and not really tackle. This is the high unemployment in OECD countries and particularly in Europe that prevails over the average of business cycles and even in boom periods. For it is now possible that quite a big fall in average real pay would be required to price into work enough people to satisfy even a modest definition of full employment. It is possible that more than 100 per cent of the national income increase would accrue to owners of capital and land. Some extra tax on capital or income from capital could surely be justified to cushion the shock, although not so much as to kill the labour-using investment required. I make the suggestion, not as a cure-all but to indicate the impasse which we have reached as a result of the collision between popular attitudes towards just rewards, and the requirements of high employment. What is needed is more critical scrutiny of widely accepted moral beliefs and the moral implications of widely advocated economic policies. The idea of technocratic value-free economics has had its day. * June 1993 issue, American Economic Association, 2014 Broadway, Suite 205, Nashville, Tn 37203.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Public Relations Centers of Russian Federal </F> Counterintelligence Service and Ministry of Internal Affairs:  "There Is No `War of Monsters'"]    [Text] Certain mass media have recently been disseminating  -- as a rule, with references to unofficial sources -- various  kinds of information about an alleged exposure of a criminal  group of high-ranking Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  staffers, which, according to the conclusions of these mass  media, attests to some confrontation between the FCS [Federal  Counterintelligence Service] (KGB) and the MVD.    In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the  Russian FCS and MVD officially declare that, following a  transfer of a large amount of currency, the FCS detained an  internal service major, a former employee of the Moscow Oblast  Administration Internal Affairs Main Administration Punishment  Execution Administration (dismissed in April 1994), and a major  of justice, a senior investigator of the Russian MVD  Investigative Committee. These persons have now been arrested  and charged under Article 88 (violation of regulations on  currency operations), Article 170 (abuse of official position),  and Article 174, Part 1 (giving a bribe) of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code. An attorney's office staffer has also  been arrested on a charge of committing a crime covered by  Article 174, Part 1 of the Criminal Code. The criminal case  which has been instituted has been forwarded for investigation  to the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. All  three were charged 6 May. No leading employee of the Russian  MVD is involved in this case.    The Russian FCS and MVD deem it necessary to draw attention  to the fact that operational-investigative measures and  investigative actions relating to this case are being carried  out in cooperation with the MVD. This is the usual practice in  such instances. The position of the Russian FCS and MVD  leadership with regard to cases of corruption and official and  other crimes committed by staffers of organs subordinate to them  is well known and boils down to their resolute eradication.  Questions of the reliability and purity of personnel and of  their own security are topical for the whole law-enforcement  system. For counterintelligence and internal affairs organs  participation in exposing and stopping corruption -- not only in  law-enforcement organs but also in other state structures --  constitutes the fulfillment of their immediate duties and  functions of ensuring national security defined by current  legislation. Coordination of the efforts of law-enforcement  organs and special services and direct interaction and close  cooperation between internal affairs and counterintelligence  organs are a very important condition and an obligatory and  natural element of successful operational-investigative work,  particularly in the struggle against the most dangerous crimes.  MVD and FCS staffers have recently carried out a number of  successful joint operations which have ended the activities of  many dangerous criminal groupings which were engaged in the  illegal dissemination of drugs, weapons, and contraband  antiques. Positive results have been obtained as a result of  carrying out the comprehensive "Putina," "Tral," and "Arsenal"  operations.    In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the  Russian FCS and MVD believe that the dissemination of  fabrications about a confrontation or "war of monsters" between  the FCS and the MVD should be regarded as a provocation harmful  to the common cause of combatting crime and corruption and  ensuring the security of the individual, society, and the state.</p>

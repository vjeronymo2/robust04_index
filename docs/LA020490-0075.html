			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SPEECHIFIER IN HER OWN WRITE;  </P> <P> WHAT I SAW AT THE REVOLUTION A POLITICAL LIFE IN THE REAGAN ERA BY PEGGY NOONAN  (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95; 346 PP.; 0-394-56495-2)  </P> <P> Even among conservatives, Peggy Noonan, the celebrated Reagan speech writer,  continues to draw mixed reactions. Was she a sinner or a savior? Opinions  differ.  </P> <P> When excerpts from this memoir appeared last October in the New York Times  Magazine, the ensuing publicity earned the author an immediate censure in  National Review -- possibly Reagan's most loyal supporter in all of journalism.  As the magazine's anonymous editorial writer put it: "There is a stern moral  here for present and future Presidents . . . when you hire a speech writer of  this moral character, lock up the silverware and keep your hand on your  wallet." Reading "What I Saw at the Revolution" will give you a pretty clear  idea of what it is that makes Noonan such an ambivalent figure. And not just  for conservatives, either.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, first, that political speech writers are supposed to do their  jobs quietly and without notice. After all, when a speech writer takes credit  for his efforts, the man he works for necessarily loses some degree of  credibility. This is bad form.  </P> <P> During her two years in the Reagan White House, and a later stint as a  free-lancer for President Bush, Noonan found her way around that old-fashioned  ethical code. She was, for example, the first working speech writer to score a  celebrity profile in Esquire magazine -- under the headline, "Who Puts the  Words in the President's Mouth?" And now the follow-up: a full-blown  celebrity-style memoir taking credit for most every noteworthy ink mark to  emerge from her word processor -- from speeches for Reagan marking the  Challenger disaster and the anniversary of D-Day to such phrases for Bush as  "kinder, gentler," "read my lips" and "a thousand points of light."  </P> <P> "What I Saw at the Revolution" tells you a lot of things you probably never  wondered about Noonan: about her vintage '60s childhood on Long Island, her  failed marriage to a distinguished gentleman with an eye patch. Unfortunately,  she never quite explains how a speech writer like herself managed to become an  inside-the-beltway star nearly on the order of big-name insiders like Michael  Deaver and Donald Regan.  </P> <P> Her former White House colleagues will tell you (or anyway they told me when I  was researching a story on the subject a few months ago) that Noonan courted  the press, regularly lunched with reporters, on occasion gave off-the-record  advance notice that she had written a speech a day before the speech was  actually given. How else to explain those mysterious leaks to the press that  have, in Noonan's account, repeatedly linked her name with some of the most  successful presidential utterances of the last few years?  </P> <P> Noonan's reluctance to be completely candid is probably the most irritating  thing about this book. There's always something you feel she's neglected to  tell you. Like why it was she became such a reviled figure around the West  Wing, harassed at her every step, she says, by Nancy Reagan, Maureen Reagan,  Don Regan, Don Regan's aides (whom she tells us she called "the mice," an  epithet that -- surprise! -- found its way into Newsweek) plus fellow speech  writers, members of the National Security Council, and others?  </P> <P> What's likely is that her colleagues found her, as will her readers, a somewhat  difficult personality. There are really at least two Peggy Noonans at odds  here. One is a kind of shivering jelly of resentments and insecurities,  alternately decrying the "movement" conservatives in the Administration  ("creepy little men with creepy little beards"), railing against the  foreign-policy Establishment's legion of "Mr. Harvardheads," etc. The other is  Peggy Noonan the self-styled policy-maker. This one suffers from what, in  others, she calls "the attitude." A person with "the attitude" sees the  politician he works for as a mere front man for the more intelligent members of  his staff. Or, as Noonan puts it, "A speech writer is obviously not free to  invent out of whole cloth, but -- by articulating the policy he invents it ."  This is a little high-handed.  </P> <P> Happily, though, an angry, arrogant writer also can be a terrifically  entertaining one. In fact, if you're not the type to get too worked up over the  hard-packed details of White House policy-making (in which Noonan clearly was  not involved), then this may be the Reagan memoir you'll want to read.  </P> <P> What separates Noonan from competing White House memoirists -- Donald Regan,  Michael Deaver, Nancy Reagan, Larry Speakes -- is that she indicts her enemies  not on the usual charges of venality and ineptitude but above all, for their  failures of taste.  </P> <P> These arise principally in what's called the "staffing" process, about which  Noonan has a great deal to say. All speeches submitted to the President, we're  told, must first pass through staffing, during which as many as 50 tone-deaf  policy hacks are encouraged to edit the work of professional speechwriters.  This creates innumerable frustrations. Like bad writers everywhere, White House  bureaucrats adore cliches (one "pudgy, young NSC mover" ordered Noonan to  change the last words in the Challenger speech from "touch the face of God" to  "reach out and touch someone -- touch the face of God," plus cheesy rhetorical  tricks of all kinds (Deaver couldn't resist alliteration, and favored the  letter p, as in 'prepared for peace,' 'pride and purpose,' etc.").  </P> <P> In time, the President's poll-takers began offering advice too. One of them,  Dick Wirthlin, deputized groups of citizens (called "focus groups") to listen  to the President recite his State of the Union speech, and, while they  listened, to press a button if they heard a phrase they liked. Wirthlin then  instructed the President's speech writers to take the most popular phrases and  make sure to include them in subsequent speeches.  </P> <P> In other words, what brings out the nastiest, and the best, in Noonan is  language-abuse -- in particular, language-abuse on the part of federal  bureaucrats. The two Reagan Administrations are supposed to have worked a  revolution in government. Certainly, though, they left the values and parlance  of bureaucracy intact.  </P> <P> Thus Noonan observes of National Security Adviser Robert C. (Bud) McFarlane: "I  had a hunch McFarlane decided long ago, as young people sometimes do, that  intelligent people speak in an incomprehensible manner. He adopted the style.  In time, he was no more capable of a simple public utterance than of a private  one, so that when dining with his wife, he presumably would not say, 'Pass the  butter' but rather 'The stationary oleaginous object which is now not within my  grasp or the grasp of others within this administration would be desirable,  though not necessary, within my sphere and on my muffin.' " Likewise  McFarlane's colleague, Oliver North, who we're told said things like "And don't  forget this (memo) is in accord conversation Casey-North approximately fifteen  hundred this date ."  </P> <P> In one respect, Noonan seems to be asking us to consider whether the Reagan  revolution ever really happened. It was one of the great promises of Ronald  Reagan's presidency that it would clear out the culture of Washington  bureaucracy -- of which the language of Bud McFarlane and Oliver North has been  a principal underpinning. Viewed from this perspective, the revolution failed.  Noonan's peculiarities aside, her book is a lively portrait of that failure.  </P></p>

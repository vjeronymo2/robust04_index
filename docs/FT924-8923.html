			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The European Market: East European countries 'should join Efta before EC' - CEECs should look on the free trade association as a half-way house, a study says HUNGARY, Czechoslovakia and Poland, the three central European countries with bilateral European Community association agreements, went away from their London EC summit meeting last month without any agreed timetable for their full entry into the EC club. Next in line for entry remain the already prosperous and secure European Free Trade Association countries, whose entry will boost net contributions to EC coffers. All three have pencilled in the turn of the century for full entry. But a new academic study argues that a combination of EC farming interests and the poorest current EC members will veto enlargement to the east for at least two decades. It suggests that the Central and East European Countries (CEECs) should drop their EC fixation and opt for membership of Efta as a constructive interim half-way house. Efta membership 'would counter the economic and political marginalisation implicit in the bilateral trade deals' that Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland (the Visegrad 3 countries) have signed with the EC. It would also help enterprises in Efta countries 'to develop business ties in a market with enormous growth potential', argues Mr Richard Baldwin professor of economics at the Institut Universitaire des Hautes Etudes Internationales, Geneva, in an occasional paper to be published by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research. Both old and new members of an enlarged Efta would find their bargaining position with the EC improved, including those Efta members like Finland and Austria which hope to join the EC within the next five to 10 years. But until now the CEECs, including Romania and Bulgaria which are currently negotiating Visegrad 3-style association agreements, have been 'afflicted with tunnel vision' which makes them see EC membership as the only option worth considering. 'The inescapable reality', however, is that the 100m CEEC citizens (of whom 64m are in the Visegrad 3) are poorer and more agricultural than the 3.5m in Ireland. On average the CEECs are twice as dependent on agriculture as the EC and the high and potentially growing level of farm output 'poses many problems for the Common Agricultural Policy'. This makes an eastern EC enlargement simply too costly for EC taxpayers and farmers until the CEEC's get richer or present EC members more generous, he argues. Joining Efta, however, would hasten the CEEC's entry into the Community. It would help them to get richer faster and give them a track record in European integration just as Efta membership in the 1960's helped the UK overcome European doubts about its 'European-ness'. While Efta membership would not provide automatic free access to the EC via the European Economic Area (EEA) 'it is probably the shortest route to the EEA which should be the CEEC's next step towards EC membership', Mr Baldwin adds. Joining Efta should be seen as a proven stepping stone to EC membership, given the fact that four of the seven applications already accepted by the EC have been from former Efta countries. However, the Efta countries' intention to abandon Efta for the EC before the end of the decade, the CEEC's will have to take the political initiative in seeking Efta membership. The most effective approach would be an appeal to self-interest. Efta members, particularly Austria and Switzerland, already do a higher proportion of their trade with CEEC countries than most EC countries, while CEEC trade over the last three years has been expanding much faster than sales in other markets. In 1991 the CEEC5 (Visegrad 3 plus Romania and Bulgaria) took 1.6 per cent of total EC exports but trade grew in double digits compared to the flat 0.1 per cent overall rise in EC exports last year. Although the volume of Efta-CEEC5 trade is only 25 per cent of EC trade with the area, the five countries took 2.7 per cent of Efta exports, nearly double the EC average, while the volume of two trade with Efta rose 70 per cent between 1989-91. The CEEC5 were particularly important for Austria with 8 per cent of its total exports going to these markets. On a final, historical note, Mr Baldwin compares actual trade volumes with League of Nations trade statistics of 1928 to show how CEEC5 trade with western Europe would have to expand by 500 per cent to reach the pre-war levels, before trade was distorted by war and the Soviet takeover of eastern Europe. 'It is not preposterous' to suggest that these pre-war patterns will re-establish themselves, he writes. It is a tantalising prospect, and provides a badly needed note of hope and optimism for a region which until now has been seen by the EC more as a big problem than a great opportunity.</p>

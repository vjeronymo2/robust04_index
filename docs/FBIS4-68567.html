			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.M. Dzhabrailov: "Monopolism: Barriers in the </F> Way to the Market. Problems and Solutions"]    [Text] Historically it so happens that on its way to the  market the economy of Azerbaijan has to destroy a  supermonopolized structure and provide conditions for the  formation of a competitive environment. It is impossible to  create a market economy in the absence of demonopolization, just  as it is impossible to create competition without privatizing  state property.    This problem is frequently brought up in the mass media,  which consider naive and primitive patterns for fighting  monopolism. Scenarios are proposed which frequently identify  monopolism with monopolies, and the latter--with the dominant  position of companies in the market. Various forms of monopolism  are frequently mixed up, while techniques for fighting them are  borrowed either from the "workaday" world or from college  textbooks on economic theories.    The urgency of developing the effective means for combating  monopolism can hardly be overestimated, because this is now  problem No. 1. It is virtually impossible to embark on  privatization, solve any structural problems, or fight inflation  to counter a slump in production unless we are able to develop  an economic strategy that could successfully counter monopolism  and destroy the economic basis for its recurrence.    Not a single state of the world has been able to avoid a  fall  in the living standard of the people, a slump in production,  inflation, unemployment, and so on in the process of making a  transition to the market. The difference is that some states  effect demonopolization in the economy by resolute methods  within one year (for example, the Czech Republic) or stop  hyperinflation within two or three months (Greece, Austria,  Yugoslavia), whereas others unsuccessfully try to solve these  problems over decades (most Latin American countries). This is  why the issue should not be just how to develop the concept of  an antimonopoly policy and a program for demonopolizing the  economy (on paper) but also how to take the greatest possible  advantage of opportunities to implement them.    It may be conjectured that it is virtually impossible to  perform financial stabilization and implement anti-inflationary,  fiscal, and foreign economic policy without restricting [as  published] the interconnection with the antimonopoly policy. In  anticipation of objections from my unseen opponents, I would  like to refer to the experience of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,  and Turkmenistan. For example, Ye. Gaydar's program of financial  stabilization failed solely because they tried to solve this  serious problem exclusively by monetary methods. It is  impossible to solve this problem through the sphere of  distribution, without serious changes in the economic structure,  in the environment in which objective conditions exist in the  economy for the expanded reproduction of inflationary phenomena.  This elementary truth appears to have been forgotten by us.  Moreover, we can be accused of Marxism and antireformism.  However, we would like to remind propagandists and agitators of  various hues who have a notion of economic theory at the  "street" level that the Marxist theory of money, capital, added  value, profit, reproduction, and crises has not yet been refuted  by anyone. The wish is to solve all problems in a hurry without  destroying the economic mode that has been created over decades.  This thought was borne out yet again by a sharp deterioration of  the economic situation in Russia at the end of 1993 and the  beginning of 1994, following the monetarist experiment of the  Russia's Choice type.  <H5>  Results </H5>   The crisis in the economy is growing. There are no rays of  stabilization in the economy. The following data for the first  quarter of 1994 compared to the corresponding period of 1993  testify to this:    --output of the net material product fell by 25.5 percent;    --the defaulted debt of enterprises increased by a factor of  13;    --gross capital investment was off by 41 percent;    --housing construction diminished by 55 percent;    --retail sales fell by 46 percent;    --the index of prices and rates for goods and services went  up by a factor of 11.3;    --the monetary income of the population increased by a  factor  of 4.5.    The coefficient of the lead of the growth of prices compared  to the growth of monetary income came to 2.5. The purchasing  power of the population diminished by the same amount. We should  add to this the monthly level of inflation--30 percent, and an  abrupt reduction in employment. According to our data,  unemployment in the republic now comes to about 0.9 million.  This amounts to 35 percent of the economically active  population. No wonder that under the circumstances, the 1994  state budget was drafted with a deficit of 47 billion manats.  Therefore, budgetary expenditures exceed revenues by 30 percent.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Problems: Reality and Projections </H5>   A reduction in the monetary income of the population in real  terms has brought about a contraction of effective demand. The  capacity of the market for consumer goods fell by a factor of  2.5 to three. Delays in the payment of wages, retirement  benefits, and allowances by two to three months should have  apparently stabilized the growth of prices and the level of  inflation. In reality everything is the other way around: the  rate of inflation and prices increase month after month.    A fall in investment by a factor of more than two and a  13-fold increase in defaulted debt have brought many enterprises  to the brink of bankruptcy; consequently, the recession in  production has deepened and employment declined.    In reality, the slump in production does not come to 25-26  percent, as reported by official statistics, but is considerably  greater. The government and the National Bank are trying to  prevent reductions in output by higher state expenditures and  credit outlays. However, these measures are not successful  because they depreciate the manat and distort monetary  circulation still more.    The slump in production will deepen unless extraordinary  measures are taken promptly. This poses the danger of an  economic cataclysm.    It seems that the government has opted for an erroneous  tactic. Two versions of a solution are possible in this  instance. The first is to restore centralized management of the  economy. The second is to develop a program for priority  measures for carrying out market reform with an active system  for social protection of the population. In this case, programs  for the demonopolization of the economy should become a priority.  <H5>  Types of Monopolism in the Economy </H5>   There are differences between monopoly practices, a  monopoly,  and the dominant economic agent. If we recognize as dominant the  position of an economic agent (joint-stock company, limited  liability company, and so on) which is based on the superiority  of its economic potential and which makes it possible for the  agent to decisively influence the competition and thus hamper  access to the market to other participants in the market, an  economic agent whose market share exceeds 35 percent is  considered dominant. Correspondingly, there may not be more than  two to three dominant economic agents in the market.    An economic agent which absolutely dominates the market is  recognized to be a monopoly. As a rule, its share exceeds 51  percent.    There may be one monopoly in the market. However, there may  be several monopolists in the market for homogeneous goods. This  is a so-called "collective monopoly" whereby several economic  agents are bound by an agreement among themselves. Monopolism,  or monopoly practices (activities, behavior), should be  distinguished from a monopoly and a dominant economic agent.  Both monopoly and nonmonopoly economic agents, state central and  regional organs of power, or departmental organs of government  whose actions are aimed at preventing, restricting, or  eliminating competition to the detriment of consumer interests  may engage in monopoly practices. Therefore, the following types  of monopolism shall be distinguished:    --state monopolism (that of the organs of power);    --departmental monopolism (that of the organs of  government);    --regional monopolism (that of the organs of local power);    --monopolism of economic agents.    The following are derivative from the above four types of  monopolism:    --financial and credit monopolism;    --natural monopolism;    --patent and license monopolism;    --monopolism arising out of horizontal and vertical  agreements between players in the market.    Therefore, monopolism is associated with activities aimed at  restricting or eliminating competition and harm the interests of  consumers. In Azerbaijan state and departmental monopolism, the  monopolism of economic agents, as well as natural and  financial-credit monopolism shine through most vividly.  <H5>  Abuses by Market Agents as a Form of Manifestation of </H5> Monopolism    It is necessary to note that there are monopolists and  monopolists. Theoretically, two kinds of monopolists may exist.  Some can ensure their dominant position through a difficult but  honest competitive struggle. As a rule, they engage in fair  competition without restricting it and without harming the  interests of consumers in any way. Other monopolists take  advantage of their dominant position in the market to raise  market prices, with the quality of the product deteriorating,  and use illegal means for counteracting competition. Abuses in  the market may be manifested in the following forms:    --market share manipulation, raises or, on the contrary,  reductions in it with a view to causing a shortage;    --price manipulation, with the price being raised or reduced  with a view to increasing consumer demand and taking advantage  of it for one's own interest;    --product quality manipulation, which pursues the objective  of reducing the cost of production;    --the use of methods of a noneconomic nature with a view to  erecting barriers in the market and suppressing existing or  potential competitors.    Virtually all forms of the manifestation of monopolism are  registered in the economy of Azerbaijan. The growth of prices  following their liberalization was largely "due" not only to  inflation but also monopolism in the economy. The situation is  exacerbated by the absence of a competitive environment in  markets for particular products, as well as the absence of all  effective methods of antimonopoly regulation, and an economic  mechanism for counteracting the abuses of monopolies and  dominant market agents. It has now been more than one year since  the parliament passed the Law "On Antimonopoly Activities," but  it is still inoperative because of the lack of a mechanism for  its implementation.    Meanwhile, the situation in the market has been  deteriorating  continuously. The gap between the growth of prices and the  monetary income of the population has been growing. Customer  demand has been restricted to the necessities, goods with a low  elasticity of demand, and the physical subsistence minimum.    Who is responsible for this? Six out of 17 ministries of the  republic and five state committees out of 22 are economic  ministries and state committees. However, this is of no use. A  state program for transition to a market economy has not been  approved to this day; implementation arrangements for most of  the laws adopted by the parliament in 1992-1993 are absent.  Banking and tax legislation is imperfect....    Data from the bulletin of the State Committee for  Statistics of Azerbaijan for the first quarter of 1994 and data  from the CIS Statistical Committee have been used in this  item.</p>

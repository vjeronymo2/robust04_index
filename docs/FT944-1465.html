			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Trust must be won in Ulster On the eve of talks today with Mr John Bruton, the newly-appointed Irish prime minister, Mr Major said the Northern Ireland framework document under discussion between London and Dublin would not undercut the rights of Ulster's unionist community. He emphasised that the discovery at the weekend of an unexploded semtex bomb in Enniskillen showed the importance of the IRA decommissioning its armoury before Sinn Fein was brought into round-table political talks on the future of the province. 'What the planting of this device shows precisely is why it is so important to deal with the problems of weapons and explosives.' Referring to yesterday's bilateral contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Major commented: 'We have always made clear that there can be no question of political representatives of paramilitary organisations entering the political process until they have a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods  - and have demonstrated that commitment to exclusively peaceful methods.' The prime minister would not specify how Britain would react to the decommissioning of the IRA weapons stockpile. But he expressed hopes that continued peace would bring further gradual moves in security and policing operations in Northern Ireland. 'Both the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary would like to move to wholly civilian policing . . . that is going to take some time but it is a clear objective.' In a response to suggestions from Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bruton's predecessor, that Britain had conceded the creation of a new cross-border institution with executive powers, Mr Major said: 'There is no question of joint authority, which is what worries the people of Northern Ireland.' Mr Major stressed that, once completed, the framework document would be a basis for discussion among the Northern Ireland parties, not a blueprint for a new political settlement imposed by the British and Irish governments. Any new arrangements would require the consent of the people and would be submitted eventually to a referendum. 'If we have learnt anything about the Northern Ireland problem over recent years it is that you have to carry the people of Northern Ireland with you,' Mr Major said. 'We must earn and keep their trust and they must be clear that there is nothing going on that would unsettle either main tradition . . . So those people who are thinking: 'Gosh, there is some murky work at the crossroads' are wholly wrong.' Mr Major expected today's meeting with Mr Bruton to be an informal discussion. He said it was too early to say whether the document would be completed in January. 'We will move ahead as speedily as we can. There are still some difficult issues to be determined. I think they are determinable but it will take a little while.'</p>

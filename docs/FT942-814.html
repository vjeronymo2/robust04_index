			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Lisbon offer to bridge protestors: Commuters angry over rise in tolls Portugal's centre-right government made concessions to militant commuters yesterday amid a growing campaign of civil disobedience in protest against a 50 per cent rise in the toll for crossing the April 25 suspension bridge over the Tagus river in Lisbon. The protests, which continued for the eighth consecutive day yesterday, are fuelling a controversy over the award of a Es180bn (Pounds 707m) contract to build a second bridge in Lisbon to a consortium led by Trafalgar House of Britain. Riot police intervened on Friday to lift an 11-hour blockade mounted by angry lorry drivers across the only bridge linking Lisbon with southern Portugal. Many commuters continued the revolt yesterday by refusing to pay the toll, honking their horns and paying in large notes or with bags of small coins. The government sought to defuse the campaign last night when Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, public works minister, announced a 'substantial discount' for frequent users of the bridge, which is crossed by more than 110,000 vehicles a day. He also decided to waive the toll altogether during July and August, a traditional holiday-period concession normally made for only one month. The opposition Socialist Party (PS) called on the minister to answer questions in parliament on the toll increase and the award of the contract for the new bridge. The government said the rise in the toll for a two-way crossing to Esc150 for cars and Esc720 for lorries was needed to help finance the building of the second bridge and a Esc112bn railway crossing under the existing bridge. The civil disobedience campaign against the government has refuelled a public row between Trafalgar House and the French company Bouygues whose consortium lost a bid to build the second bridge. Bouygues claimed yesterday that its offer involved a lower toll price for the second bridge. 'We proposed the cheapest toll possible because we realised it could be a very political issue,' a senior Bouygues manager said yesterday. The company is still hoping that the government will rescind its decision. Mr Ferreira do Amaral has told Bouygues the decision to award the contract to Trafalgar House group was based entirely on recommendations of independent experts who studied the two groups' proposals for six months. Mr Joao Morais Leitao, lawyer for the Trafalgar House consortium, said: 'The fact that the Bouygues group has decided not to present a claim against the award in my mind clearly shows that they do not have grounds for making such a claim.' He said negotiations on the technical aspects of the new bridge were the first to be completed and were closed by both bidders in January.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish at 0200 GMT on 9 March broadcasts its 60-minute  "Democracy 94" program, which features a live or recorded  interview with Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa  Egoro Movement, MPE, by Hugo Enrique Famania.    The program begins with a short biographical account of  Blades' professional, academic, and personal history and is  followed by the interview.    Famania says Blades has proposed a democratization of the  economic process and asks him to explain the term. Blades  replies: "We must create conditions that will allow a true  distribution of economic opportunities." He says this goal will  be accomplished "in two phases; employment and investment,"  and notes the need to "disperse investment" to the countryside.    Famania then asks Blades if he plans to change the entire  government system, which has traditionally been centralized.  Blades says "it is not a matter of changing a system but an  attitude." "We must design a national strategy leading to a  national economic development plan, which is what we define as  democratizing the economic process. All provinces must be  included in this plan."    Regarding investments, Blades says that "the reason for the  current paralysis is simple: We have not defined our national  economic objectives. The government and the private sector are  not working together, and the people are waiting to see what  happens. In reality, no serious steps have been taken to repair  the national infrastructure or to encourage investment. No  effort has been made to expedite procedures to facilitate  investment. No effort has been made to reach a concerted  agreement among various sectors -- labor, business, and  government -- as the Mexican Government did in a very  intelligent move that culminated on 3 October 1993 with a pact  for stability and employment. We have done absolutely nothing  to give the country direction. Investment will not come to  Panama unless we offer investors certain conditions."    Famania states: "You have spoken about investments and the  formula for investment and employment. To what type of  investment are you referring; state, private, or foreign?"  Blades responds: "All types," adding that investments in Panama  "are based on foreign credits, and all our revenues are used for  public expenses, a situation that should not continue." Further  on he adds: "Credits should be used for specific objectives that  will not only create new jobs but will eventually pay the debt."    Blades continues: "Our basic problem -- and what has made it  impossible to renegotiate our debt under favorable terms -- is  that we are seen as a country that improvises. There is an  uncertainty that undermines confidence in us, and for that we  are paying a high price." He then stresses that if the country  were to present to the international financial institutions "a  specific program with all our projects, I am sure they would  agree to grant us anything from a moratorium on debt payments to  an increase in credits."    Asked how he would renegotiate the debt differently from the  current administration, Blades says: "We must define our  economic objectives; for example, Panama as an international  tourist center, a maritime center, a telecommunications center,  a financial center, and an export center. We must develop rural  areas. We must create conditions for exports to bring foreign  exchange to the country." He adds: "We must take immediate  steps to help the agricultural and industrial sectors define  their markets."    Asked if the country is ready for a commercial opening,  Blades answers: "No, not yet. We are not prepared for a  commercial opening. I think that would be crazy" because "it  would hurt our industries and our small and midsize enterprises."    On the subject of privatization, Blades says: "I do not  agree that privatizing assets has a strategic value for the  nation because those assets belong to the country." He  specifically mentions electricity, water, and telephone  services, clarifying that "some areas in those services could be  privatized." He notes that there could be some mixed  enterprises.    Blades then elaborates on MPE proposals to reform the Labor  Code to encourage investment. He says that "the labor and  business sectors should sit down and study points of contention,  discuss them, and arrive at a decision" to eliminate any  perception that could discourage investment. He again uses  Mexico as an example, saying that "the three sectors had to sit  down and finally sign a pact of stability, competitiveness, and  employment in October 1993. We should do the same thing in  Panama."    Regarding the use of price controls on staples to reduce  poverty, Blades says: "We must look for a solution to and  directly attack the problems of hunger and poverty in Panama."    Famania turns to other topics, asking Blades which option he  prefers to deal with problems in the health sector:  coordination, integration, or open coordination with the  private sector. Blades replies: "We must look for a formula  among the various groups involved through a concerted effort and  without excluding anyone." He adds: "We all want efficient and  continuous health services for everyone at a national level."    Blades also reiterates his proposal that the government pay  its debt to the Social Security Fund, noting that "this is one  of the most serious problems affecting the Social Security  Fund." "We must also consider the possibility of privatizing  some services."    Famania says some analysts believe that one of the main  obstacles to establishing effective public security and police  forces is a fear of militarism. Blades, however, has proposed  supporting the National Police with funding and logistical  support to fight crime and drug trafficking. Famania asks:  "Aren't you afraid of militarism?" Blades answers: "I am not  afraid of militarism in that sense. Obviously we need an  efficient police service with motivated, well equipped, and well  paid policemen who are respected by everyone." "We must  realize that we all have to protect the democratic system. I do  not see why we should be afraid of an efficient, well trained  police force." Asked "to what extent the country could be  militarized in the defense of national sovereignty and the  Panama Canal," Blades replies that "a special team or force  could be created." He explains that one way to obtain the funds  needed to raise policemen's salaries would be from the  confiscated properties of criminals, which would also be a way  to prevent corruption and bribery. He adds: "I sincerely  believe that we will not return to the military past. The  country will not allow that. We must have confidence in the  police and support them."    Blades is then asked for his views on the future of U.S.  military bases. Famania notes that the MPE's position has been  that the military bases should not remain in Panama. He asks  Blades what his plans are for the Panamanian employees and what  he proposes as a replacement for that parallel economy. Blades  says: "It is my personal opinion that the current system that  benefits those employees should not be altered." Regarding the  military bases, he says: "We believe we can use the areas now  occupied by those military bases in such a way that the benefit  from economic development will greatly exceed the economic  benefits and employment the properties generate today." As for  use of the reverted properties, Blades says there are many  proposals, including transferring public offices and using some  areas for housing projects, all of which will require careful  study.    Commenting on the Interoceanic Region Authority, Blades  says:  "I think it is a little dangerous for an institution to  determine the guidelines for that sector because there could be  a conflict with the executive branch on the use of those areas.  I think this situation should be corrected."    Asked what kind of relations Panama or a government headed  by  the MPE would have with Fidel Castro, Blades replies: "I think  we should maintain relations with all governments. In Cuba's  case, we must facilitate an internal democratic transition. I  see no problem whatsoever in maintaining diplomatic relations  with Cuba or China."</p>

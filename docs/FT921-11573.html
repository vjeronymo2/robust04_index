			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Congress to receive bank bill soon THE Bush administration plans to submit new banking reform legislation to Congress in the next few days, but faces a lukewarm reception - even from members who supported its efforts to pass a banking bill last year. The new bill will include measures to allow banks to open branches outside their home states, enter the securities business (from which they are excluded by the Glass-Steagall Act), and be bought by commercial companies. The administration is backing its push for legislation by new projections suggesting that bank reform could save the US taxpayer more than Dollars 16bn over the next six years, through strengthening the banking industry and reducing the number of failed banks needing to be bailed out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The projections strike a new note of pessimism over the outlook for the FDIC's bank insurance fund. Without reform, the administration is budgeting for the fund's deficit to soar from Dollars 2bn this year to a peak of Dollars 39bn in 1996. Reform could limit this peak deficit to Dollars 28bn in 1995, administration officials said, just inside the Dollars 30bn borrowing limit Congress fixed last year for the FDIC. 'It's unclear whether the banking industry could bear the full cost of borrowing beyond Dollars 30bn; it's certainly clear that taxpayer exposure would increase,' a senior administration official warned. He said reforms, especially inter-state branching, would help banks to raise capital, so enabling more border-line banks to survive and raising the value of the failed banks the FDIC has had to take over and sell. In Congress, however, even the supporters of banking reform believe it will be near-impossible to pass legislation this year, so soon after an abortive attempt last year and so close to the presidential and congressional elections in November.</p>

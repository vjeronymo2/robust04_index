			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The building of a canal  has started in Pizhou City in east China's Jiangsu Province, for  discharging floodwaters from the Yihe, Shuhe and Sihe Rivers,  all tributaries of the Huaihe River.    The three rivers flow over an area of 78,000 sq [square] km  in southern Shandong Province and northern Jiangsu Province, a  region which is a major supplier of grain and coal in east China.    Government sources said the completion of the project will  raise the canal's flood-discharge capacity to 5,500 cu m [cubic  meters] per second.    The project, part of the national program to control  flooding  on the Huaihe River, will cost more than one billion yuan, which  will be financed by Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces, said the  sources.    Meanwhile, another flood control project was also started in  Guoyang County, Anhui Province, on the Baohuihe River, another  tributary of the Huaihe River with a drainage area of 2,930 sq  km.    The project will involve the dredging of the river channel  and the building of locks, bridges and pumping stations on the  river, which, local sources said, will enable the area to resist  severe floods.    The project is supported by a national agricultural  development fund.</p>

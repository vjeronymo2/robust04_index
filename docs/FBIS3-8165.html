Ivo Sanader, Croatian deputy minister of foreign  affairs, has spoken to our reporter Sandra Posum Djurin. This  is how Deputy Minister Sanader views the transitional  committee's work:    [Begin Sanader recording] I would describe our work so far  as  good. We are making progress. For the time being there are no  major problems. There is a fair deal of adjusting positions.  It is perhaps interesting to mention that at the moment we are  working on the first item, the first set of issues, namely the  constitution of the future federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  between Croats and Bosniak Muslims. I believe that today or  tomorrow, perhaps tomorrow, we may finalize a draft constitution.    Afterward, the preliminary confederation agreement follows  between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. This is  then followed by a military agreement on military organization  within the federation.    The fourth item includes transitional measures for speeding  up the founding of the federation and the confederation;  wherever it is possible, this will include state organization as  well.    These are the three sets of issues that remain to be  resolved  once we have finished working on the federation constitution.  You know that for our part we have decided -- these have always  been our propositions -- that the Muslims and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should seek reconciliation, that an end  should be put to all their conflicts.    We find continuity in our policy along these lines. The fact  that the world's greatest democratic power has become heavily  involved in these talks testifies in practical terms to the fact  that we have always followed the right and correct path. Now  this transitional committee of ours is tasked with a very  difficult and responsible duty, I would even say an historic  task, of outlining what Minister Granic, Prime Minister  Silajdzic, and President of Herceg-Bosna Zubak signed in  Washington in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher in such a way as to make both sides satisfied, first  in the federation, and to find a mutual interest in the future  confederation.

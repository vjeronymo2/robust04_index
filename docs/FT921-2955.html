			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Assured EC access urged for banana producers BANANA EXPORTERS in small African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries should be assured a minimum quota in the European market and tariff protection against cheaper, large-scale producers, says a report published yesterday by a coalition of lobbyists for the developing world. In addition, tariffs levied on large-scale producers should be earmarked to fund a system of price support for ACP suppliers, along with assistance on diversification, the International Coalition for Development Action said in its report. The European Community should monitor the cartel activities of the three multinationals that dominate banana production among large-scale producers. The report comes in the wake of fresh British government assurances that treaty promises made to Caribbean banana exporters will be honoured when the European Commission decides next week how to create a single market in bananas. Mr John Gummer, the UK farm minister, assured the House of Commons in a parliamentary answer last Friday that Britain intended to stand by its obligations under the Lome convention (a trade agreement with developing former European colonies), and would support any EC decision that conformed with these commitments. The 'Eurobanana' has generated immense controversy, since the creation of the single market makes it possible for 'dollar banana' producers, mainly in central America, to undercut traditional suppliers. These are mainly former French and British colonies, which have protected access to particular European markets, and high prices - both assured by development commitments made under the Lome convention. The EC is the world's biggest importer of bananas, purchasing 3.2m tonnes in 1990. Small ACP countries like Jamaica and the Windward Islands supply 18 per cent of the market, while former French colonies and small EC producers like the Canary Islands supply a further 26 per cent. Dollar bananas account for the remaining 56 per cent. Dispute inside the EC arises from rules being set by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would require all farm products to be subject to import tariffs. These would then be reduced during the next six years. The community has not set a tariff for the so-called 'dollar bananas'. Instead, it limits their entry by means of quotas. The European Commission - like the Council of Ministers (of the 12)  - is divided between those who want a temporary exemption from the Gatt rules, and those who want to set a very high tariff on dollar bananas. Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica in the Windward Islands in the Caribbean - where 70 per cent of export earnings come from bananas - spoke for many Caribbean suppliers when she predicted during a recent visit to Brussels and London that tariffication would 'never by itself be able to protect our banana industry: it would mean the end of the industry in our part of the world. 'If we lost the industry completely, we would lose the country,' she warned: 'It would be the beginning of despair.' She may have been comforted by Mr Gummer's assurance last week that he 'has pressed the importance of a settlement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in conformity with our continuing commitment to the Windward Islands and Jamaica.' These assurances did not rule out the possibility of tariffs, however. It is still possible that compromise will be found in a longer period of tariff protection than six years, and substantial funds to aid diversification into other products. There have been informal signals from the Gatt that a compromise that was technically outside Gatt rules would not jeopardise the Uruguay Round proposals. Bananas and the European Single Market.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO - Japan on Thursday [23 June]  welcomed an agreement between the United States and North Korea  to hold high-level talks in Geneva early next month to defuse  the standoff over North Korea's alleged push for nuclear weapons.    ``We welcome the move toward U.S.-North Korea talks,'' Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a regular news  conference.    The top government spokesman also urged Pyongyang to allay  international concerns over its nuclear program through action  and pledged that japan will continue efforts to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue in close concert with the U.S. and  South Korea.    Specifically, Kumagai said North Korea should formally  return  to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), comply with  international nuclear safeguards requirements, and implement a  joint declaration with South Korea for a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula.    ``It is important to persuade North Korea in various ways,''  Kumagai said.    In March last year, North Korea said it was pulling out of  the NPT but suspended the decision later.    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced wednesday that the  U.S.  and North Korea will hold high-level talks in Geneva early next  month following Pyongyang's assurances that it will freeze its  nuclear program while the talks are in progress.    Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said japan cautiously  welcomed the U.S. Government's confirmation of North Korea  pledge to freeze its nuclear program, as well as Washington's  intention to resume diplomatic talks with Pyongyang.    The sources said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  conveyed Washington's decision to hold a third round of  high-level talks with Pyongyang in a telephone call earlier in  the day to Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa.    They said the U.S. Took note of Japan's desire to see steps  taken to uncover the history of operation of North Korea's  nuclear reactor to ensure no plutonium has been diverted for a  covert nuclear weapons development program.    U.S. officials were quoted as saying the issue may be on the  agenda of the third round of talks.    But the sources said the Japanese Government is not  optimistic about what may well turn out to a mere replay of  events, in which North Korea proceeds at its own pace, putting  off a resolution of the issue.    They said that if North Korea is not more forthcoming at the  talks, the course of events will inevitably lead back to  consideration of economic sanctions to force Pyongyang into  compliance with the will of the international community.    Clinton said Wednesday that during the period of the talks  the U.S. will suspend efforts to pursue a sanctions resolution  in the U.N. Security Council.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): Moving into the limelight - European Wireless Messaging / A far cry from tone bleepers, European wireless messaging offers a multiplicity of new business and personal communications applications Imagine the nightmare office scenario: you are alone and it's late - but you need to send documents, several pages in length, to colleagues who may be next door, in another town or even in another country. They need your missive, instantaneously, wherever they may be. You cannot send them facsimile messages - you do not know exactly where they are; they might have a cellular telephone, but you cannot phone them because the details they require are complex, specific or not readily communicable by word of mouth. What you have, and what they need, is mission-critical information. What would you do? Panic? Delegate? Resign? Situations like this, you realise, were not covered at business school. The pager? Indeed so: having endured the ignominy of time, living in the shadow of cellular telephony, the trusty war-horse of mobile telecommunications has kept up with the times and has been transformed into a high-speed, high-capacity, frequency-agile 'wireless messaging' device. A far cry from tone bleepers, European wireless messaging is moving into the international limelight as a serious contender for a global wireless messaging standard, offering a multiplicity of innovative business and personal communications applications. The European Radio Message System (Ermes), an EC-championed second generation digital radio-paging standard, is a model for international co-operation in telecommunications. Conceived in 1987, Ermes uses 16 radio channels between 169.4-169.8 MHz, and can hop about each available frequency band to transmit vital information at speeds up to 6,250 kilobits per second to pocket mobile messaging devices. As a broadcast-based service, Ermes' inherent strength lies in its ability to move large amounts of information from point-to-point, point to multi-point, and also multi-point to multi-point. Thus, any number of value-added service providers can offer tailored information broadcast products to end-users over any Ermes networks. As cross-border mobile and fixed telecoms traffic increases year on year, business systems and applications that cut through national boundaries, and can 'roam,' are now fundamental pre-requisites. While 31 European radio paging network operators are currently signatories to the Ermes 'Memorandum of Understanding' (MoU), interest is growing outside its European origins. Paging operators across the Asia-Pacific region are set to sign up to the standard. 'Interest from the Asia-Pacific region is very important' says Mr Per Berntsen, chairman of the Ermes MoU group, 'because we are talking about very large volumes.' Ermes operators also see the future in satellite distribution. Not only of value-added services that will be available to national and international subscribers, but also in enabling Ermes networks to be rolled-out across countries utilising satellite up-links and down-links between message switching centres and their base stations. This, effectively, reduces operator infrastructure costs by eliminating a large proportion of the networks' requirement for private leased-line circuits - hard-wired or microwave links - whilst at the same time, increasing the potential volume of base stations to serve the coverage areas. Additionally, with minimal or no paging bureaux personnel message-handling interlocution, network operators will be able to pass on cost-savings from lower overheads to cheaper messaging and terminal unit costs. The key factor with new mobile communications technologies now coming on-stream is that they will be targeted at new user segments, not solely those who are already well-catered for; Ermes, and generic wireless messaging, will have a much broader user appeal as operators and value-added service providers launch global products. Mr Berntsen concurs with this view - 'there will be those who don't have GSM, or cellular telephones, who would rather have a pager because of the type of work they do or on the grounds of the cost-effectiveness. Remember that mobile telephone services have always had a traffic cost - paging does not. No connection charge, no monthly rental - the calling part pays. It's a question of segmentation of markets.' Successful new messaging applications will be those that are modest, but not radical variants on current practices. For example, the PC running Windows applications software will be a familiar front-end for many business and personal computer users. The prospect of accessing a pan-European, indeed global network, through a communications software package will be about as daunting as loading and printing a document file. Further feature-rich benefits of international wireless messaging will include the ability to connect a cable from the pager to desktop or notebook PCs, and let the PC store incoming wireless messages direct to the hard disk. This could ensure critical messages are not wiped inadvertently from the device's volatile random access memory. You could, therefore, leave your pager behind and not miss messages, news or share prices. Even the pan-European digital cellular systems, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications and its sister technology, DCS1800, would have trouble performing the tasks required in the nightmare scenario, outlined above. GSM and DCS1800 both offer a short-message service (SMS), but have a limit of 166 characters (about 20 words) per message. Compare this with Ermes' 9,000 characters per message and you start to see the limitations and possibilities. Wireless electronic-mail could also be a possibility, but this option too requires colleagues to be available, carrying their portable PCs fitted with radio modems, being within range of either a cellular network or a dedicated packet mobile data network - and powered up. Message retrieval services would not be appropriate in the nightmare scenario; certainly, they would want the information - but when? The next day? 'Text messaging and personal wireless information services will be very important in the future,' Mr Berntsen believes. 'They will become a natural part of most people's working environment. I think they will need a pager - even if they have a mobile telephone. Ermes has the potential for giving such services to most markets, he adds. 'We will see more creative ways of making information services that will also have a great appeal to the public.' Ermes also has capabilities to acknowledge receipt of transmitted information, though this is not seen by the Mr Berntsen as a particular enhancement that will be in demand at this stage, while it is not being ruled out for the future. With digital cellular promising voice, data and fax services, mobile data promising wireless email and remote dial-up data services and download functionality, wireless messaging can offer alphanumeric document transfer and real-time broadcast information services at minimal costs. Clearly, the convergence process of historically disparate mobile communications technologies is well under way.</p>

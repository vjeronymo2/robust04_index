			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: John Foster losses widen to Pounds 5.1m John Foster &amp; Son, the worsted and mohair cloth manufacturer, reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 5.1m for the year to February 28. After having warned of losses in March, the company said the second half results were in line with expectations. Foster, based in Black Dyke Mills, Bradford, added that the advantage gained from the pound's devaluation had been offset by the fall in the lira. Italy is its main competitor. In the present year sales were not encouraging. Although action was being taken it was likely that there would be a further loss in the present year. Turnover was Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 22.7m). There were exceptional debits of Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 1.02m credits) for reorganisation costs. Losses per share were 45.4p (3.5p) and the final dividend is passed. Last year there was a single payment of 0.5p.</p>

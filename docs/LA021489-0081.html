			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NLRB TELLS SEAHAWKS TO COMPENSATE EX-PLAYER  </P> <P> Former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Sam McCullum was illegally discharged by  the Seahawks before the strike-marred 1982 season, the National Labor Relations  Board ruled Monday.  </P> <P> McCullum, then the Seahawks' player representative, must be given back pay,  with interest, from the time of his release and a job "substantially  equivalent" to the job he lost, the NLRB ruled in a 2-1 decision.  </P> <P> The Seahawks, who did not have immediate comment, can appeal the ruling to the  U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> McCullum was a starting wide receiver when he was cut by Jack Patera, then the  team's coach.  </P> <P> "I'm ecstatic," McCullum told the Seattle Times. "It's been a long time."  </P> <P> McCullum said he had no idea how much back pay he is owed by the Seahawks, and  the board did not estimate it. McCullum, 36, is now director of sports  marketing for Ace Novelty Co. of Seattle. He formerly served as director of the  Washington State Traffic Safety Commission.  </P> <P> Mike Blatt, speaking for the Seahawks, said he doubted the team would be  required to rehire McCullum.  </P> <P> "I interpret that as referring to pension benefits, severance pay and insurance  benefits," Blatt said.  </P></p>

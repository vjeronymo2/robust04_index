			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOWING GROWTH PUTS ECONOMY NEAR RECESSION  </P> <P> The nation's economy tottered to the brink of recession last quarter, growing  at an annual rate of only 1.2%, following a revised 1.7% pace during the first  three months of the year, the Commerce Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> But analysts said that the economy's actual performance may be even bleaker  than the overall figures indicate.  </P> <P> A breakdown of Friday's gross national product statistics showed declines in  virtually every major sector: Spending by individuals and business shrank at an  annual rate of 2.2%, net exports plunged sharply, business investment fell at a  6.1% annual rate and home building plummeted.  </P> <P> Only an unexpectedly large buildup of unsold inventories on auto lots, in  warehouses and on retail shelves kept the nation's total output from declining  between March and June. And analysts say a large accumulation of unsold goods  often is a prelude to a recession.  </P> <P> "These numbers make the economy weaker than even some of us bears have been  saying," said Irwin L. Kellner, economist for Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New  York. "Inventories are up and sales are down, and there's no sign of things  getting better out there."  </P> <P> Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., agreed. "All the important  factors declined, and the inventory swing is the only thing that produced a  positive statistic," he said. "Without the inventories, the economy in this  quarter really would be in recession."  </P> <P> Some analysts suggested that the grim figures on Friday might push the  independent Federal Reserve Board closer toward a relaxation of money and  credit policies. The Fed has been under pressure from the White House to push  interest rates down but so far has demurred.  </P> <P> At the same time, the GNP price index -- the broadest measure of inflation --  eased during the quarter, showing inflation slowing to an annual rate of 4.1%  during the period, down from a 6.1% pace during the first three months of the  year.  </P> <P> Friday's new figures do not yet show the economy in a recession. Before any  slowdown can qualify for that label, output must decline for two consecutive  quarters. So far, the economy is continuing to grow, although the pace is  somewhat slower than previously was believed.  </P> <P> But revised computations showed the economy grew more slowly during the first  three months of this year than the department initially reported -- at a 1.7%  annual rate, rather than a 1.9% pace.  </P> <P> And revised figures showed the growth rate in late 1989 actually was 0.3%, not  the 1.1% rate that had been published in the previous report.  </P> <P> The department made public also an annual revision showing that the economy has  grown at annual rates of less than 2% in each of the last five quarters --  which it said constituted the longest string of very slow growth on record.  </P> <P> Sinai noted that the string of slow-growth quarters, since March, 1989, is  unprecedented since World War II. Since the first quarter of 1989, the economy  has grown, quarterly, at annual rates of 1.6%, 1.7%, 0.3%, 1.7% and 1.2%.  </P> <P> Even so, Giulio Martini, economist for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. of New  York, took issue with the suggestion that the economy may be on the brink of a  recession.  </P> <P> Martini argued in a telephone interview that, because inventories have been  growing below the long-term trend for several quarters now, the second-quarter  increase merely constitutes "a correction."  </P> <P> Excluding agriculture, he noted, business inventories fell at annual rates of  $29.9 billion at the end of last year and in the first quarter of 1990, and  they declined $7.8 billion in all of 1989 and $2.2 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> In 1987, the last year of strong growth before the stock market crash in the  fourth quarter of that year, inventories rose by $20.7 billion -- all after  adjustment for inflation.  </P> <P> Martini suggested that some of the numbers in Friday's report on consumer  spending seemed unlikely to be an accurate reflection of reality.  </P> <P> The report, an estimate of growth based in many cases on only two months'  statistics, suggests that spending on food declined steadily in real terms over  the last year, even though the nation's population increased.  </P></p>

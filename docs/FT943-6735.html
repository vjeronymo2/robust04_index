			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Fall in Japanese consumer prices Consumer prices in Japan fell last month for the first time since March 1987, but few expect the trend to continue. The 0.2 per cent year-on-year drop, announced yesterday by the government's Management and Co-ordination Agency, compares with a 0.6 per cent rise in June. The decrease largely reflects cheaper vegetable prices; this season's harvest brought prices down again after last year's heavy rain led to crop failures. However, July prices were also down by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent from this June, supplying evidence that manufacturers of consumer durables have been cutting prices in an attempt to stimulate demand. This shone through more strongly in the agency's preliminary estimate of prices prevailing in Tokyo for August. The index for the capital fell 0.2 per cent compared with the same month of 1993. Household electrical products were down 2.6 per cent and clothing and textile goods 3.6 per cent. Tokyo prices would have fallen further this month were it not, perversely, for a rise in the retail cost of fresh fruit brought about by this summer's heatwave. The sun, combined with water shortages, has affected some crops. Month-on-month, consumer prices in the capital were up 0.4 per cent from July. Excluding fresh produce, prices were up by a year-on-year 0.7 per cent in the capital this month and 0.8 per cent nationwide in July. But these figures were inflated by an increase in utility charges, and analysts are not expecting a strong movement in inflation for the autumn - as the economy goes through what still appears likely to be a patchy revival. Car production fell 10.6 per cent last month from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said yesterday. Some makers such as Mazda stepped up output in anticipation of demand for newly launched models. Industry officials are suggesting that August vehicle sales will turn in their best performance for four years.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRAIN IS BUILDING IN THE ENGINE DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S PROSPERITY -- ITS  UNIVERSITY SYSTEM  </P> <P> As we drive our state's infamous freeways, in every direction we can clearly  see the evidence of growth. Orange and lemon groves have become housing  subdivisions. Deserts have been turned into trendy shopping malls. There's  drive-up window service for everything from breakfast to banking on land that  held only shrubs and bushes just months before. The entire state is fairly  bursting at the seams with people from all over the world flocking here for a  share in the golden dream.  </P> <P> California's higher-education system is not immune to the effects of this  phenomenal growth. However, in spite of indisputable evidence of the rise in  the demand for a college education, there are those who are suggesting that new  campuses are not required to adequately educate these future students, and that  higher-education leaders are merely trying to seize an opportunity to expand  their own territory. Nothing could be further from the truth.  </P> <P> Unlike other areas of the country, California is not seeing a drop in college  enrollment, primarily because of increasing numbers of eligible high-school  students wanting a college education and high in-migration from other states  and nations.  </P> <P> California State University currently serves more than 355,000 students on 19  campuses. By the year 2000 our enrollment is expected to increase by 100,000  students. To try to accommodate this enrollment boom, the state university  system is planning a 20th campus in northern San Diego County and is expanding  facilities in Ventura and Contra Costa counties. These projections of increased  enrollment are not limited to Cal State. The University of California,  anticipating a jump of 63,000, has projected a need for three new campuses. The  community colleges expect to enroll about 200,000 students over the next 16  years.  </P> <P> The California Postsecondary Education Commission requires extensive  justification for any new campus. Twenty factors must be thoroughly analyzed,  including capacity on existing campuses and in other parts of the system,  expansion of existing facilities and current and projected demographics.  </P> <P> Educators always start with the premise that growth can be accommodated at  existing facilities, and they conclude that a new campus is necessary only when  the data point to no other viable option. Neither Cal State nor UC has built a  campus since 1965.  </P> <P> Over the past three years, for example, California State University enrollment  has increased by 30,000 students, and every means possible has been utilized to  serve them. The system operates seven off-campus centers or satellite campuses  to meet demand in areas where another campus would not be warranted. The most  overcrowded campuses may close enrollment to freshmen and sophomores, thus  encouraging them to use their excellent community colleges. In rural areas  extensive use is made of satellite communication to televise classes to  students in sparsely populated and less accessible areas. Educators are acutely  aware of their public trust, and will not betray it to build unnecessary  university campuses.  </P> <P> This state's citizens realized long ago that their economic prosperity and  social well-being depended on an educated citizenry. California's major  industries -- like high technology, banking, agriculture and aerospace -- all  rely on a highly skilled, literate work force. And it's the state's  higher-education system that helps fuel this gigantic enterprise. If  Californians are to continue to be served by an outstanding higher-education  system, they must acknowledge the devastating effect of the Gann limit. Passed  by the voters in 1979, it puts a cap on state spending and severely restricts  our ability to provide the structures and equipment necessary to educate  students for tomorrow.  </P> <P> Education is an investment, and when it grows everybody profits. Our local  communities, the nation and the world benefit from scientific research  conducted by university professors. California State University alone educates  70% of the state's teachers, more than 50% of the engineers, about 65% of the  graduates in agriculture and 40% of those in fine and applied arts; we are the  leading source of new employees for California businesses.  </P> <P> Growth is a California fact of life, and the university system is a vital part  of that life. As the state's educational leaders, we would be irresponsible to  bury our heads in the sand and hope that these students will go away. They will  not, nor do we want them to. We want the support of the people of this state so  that they can in the future as in the past be the beneficiaries of the world's  most successful system of higher education.  </P></p>

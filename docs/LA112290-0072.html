			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTRY COLLECTORS ESPY MISSION OAK FURNITURE;  </P> <P> LIFESTYLE: ANTIQUE FURNITURE FROM AMERICA'S TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY ARTS AND CRAFTS  MOVEMENT IS THE 'NEW' COUNTRY COLLECTIBLE.  </P> <P> No-frills mission oak furniture, expensive green pottery and hand-hammered  copper lamps -- symbols of America's Arts and Crafts Movement from the turn of  the century -- share an honesty of design and workmanship that appeals to  today's country collector.  </P> <P> According to Country Home magazine, no longer does Arts and Crafts furniture  languish dusty and unnoticed in the back of junk stores and antique shops.  </P> <P> It seems fitting, now that Americans have entered the last years of the  century, that interest has again turned to the most popular furnishings of the  first decade of the 1900s. With its no-nonsense rectilinear designs, the  mission oak furniture of the Arts and Crafts Movement is now revered as the  first glimpse of modernism in America. Some art historians see the American  Arts and Crafts Movement as the most successful attempt at creating a truly  national aesthetic in the arts.  </P> <P> The current trendiness of Arts and Crafts is surprising when one considers  mission furniture's uncompromising simplicity, its dark stains and heavy woods.  </P> <P> The furniture was made to be integrated with linens, rugs and lighting to  create an atmosphere that energizes rather than enervates.  </P> <P> The best evidence of the renewed popularity of Arts and Crafts is the  astonishing rise in prices in recent years. A factory-made Gustav Stickley  bow-arm Morris chair that sold for a little more than $500 in 1980 will bring  more than $5,000 in New York galleries this year.  </P> <P> Although best known as a school of design, the Art and Crafts Movement was  actually a far-reaching philosophical movement that embraced even such social  issues as education and labor reform.  </P> <P> The philosophical groundwork was laid in the middle of the 19th Century with  the writings of Englishmen John Ruskin, William Morris and others. Morris,  considered the father of the Arts and Crafts Movement, not only rallied against  cheaply made and poorly designed products, but created his own designs and set  up a workshop that produced a wide range of handcrafted objects. He wanted to  create art that would be a part of everyday life.  </P> <P> In America, the Arts and Crafts Movement began with an emphasis on  craftsmanship, but here philosophy was quickly transformed into fashion.  Established in 1895, Elbert Hubbard's Roycroft Shops began as a crafts guild  based directly on Morris' model. Hubbard first produced hand-printed books but  expanded to leather work, copper wares, furniture and textiles.  </P> <P> Similar to Hubbard, Gustav Stickley cleverly advertised his Craftsman Shops  furniture and popularized the Arts and Crafts aesthetic through his magazine,  the Craftsman. Although they never acknowledged one another, Stickley and  Hubbard were most responsible for making Arts and Crafts the country's most  fashionable style of home decorating.  </P> <P> Stickley's furniture was blatantly copied by dozens of other manufacturers,  including the several companies operated by his four brothers. Still, his  furniture epitomizes the mission oak look and is widely considered the best of  the style with respect to both design and construction.  </P> <P> For many years, the designs of two of Gustav's brothers, Leopold and John  George, were considered mere imitations of craftsman furniture. Recently,  however, the brothers have been widely credited with designs and construction  details that are in some ways superior. Their company, L. &amp; J.G. Stickley,  introduced the highly regarded prairie settle and tall case clock in 1910, a  time when craftsmen offered little that was innovative.  </P> <P> Not all Arts and Crafts furniture had the mission look, however. Frank Lloyd  Wright's fame as an architect generally eclipses the fact that his furniture  fits snugly in the Arts and Crafts framework; he even designed what he called a  mission chair.  </P> <P> If the many companies imitating Gustav Stickley's designs contributed to his  bankruptcy in 1916 (changing fashion also had a lot to do with that), they also  produced much of the furniture that can be a relative bargain for the Arts and  Crafts collector.  </P> <P> Because of the simplicity of mission designs, only slight variations make the  difference between an important piece and one that is far less valuable.  </P> <P> One easy indication of a design likely to be valuable is the presence of an  arch. Whether an arched toe board on a bookcase or sideboard, an arched apron  on a footstool or chair, or arched arms on a chair, the presence of that subtle  break from straight lines usually adds a refreshing dimension to a mission  design. Generally speaking, wider stretchers are better than narrow ones, and  more slats are better than fewer.  </P> <P> Construction also indicates value. The best pieces of mission furniture are  pegged rather than nailed. They may have exposed mortice-and-tenon joints,  chamfered boards or butterfly splines.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Upjohn succession speculation UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced a series of organisational changes which provoked speculation about who would take charge of the company following the recent death of its chairman and chief executive, Mr Theodore Cooper. While the company made a number of appointments at the vice-president level, it did not name a chief executive or chairman. Mr Ley Smith, president and chief operating officer, presided over Upjohn's annual shareholders meeting. Mr Smith was named acting chief executive in April. He will continue in that office until the board appoints a successor to Mr Cooper. Mr Arvind Desai, a senior analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said there was some intermediate uncertainty 'about who the chief executive will be and whether there will be a separation of the functions of chairman and chief executive'. Mr Smith said Upjohn would strive to have 1994 earnings at the same level as profits in 1993.</p>

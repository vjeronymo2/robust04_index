			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: Grieg, Mozart and Szymanowski - London concerts Grieg was born 150 years ago last Tuesday, on which day the Royal Philharmonic devoted a concert to him in the Royal Festival Hall. Not the right place, really: apart from the Piano Concerto there is precious little concert-size Grieg for orchestra. Beyond the Concerto, to which the pianist Geir Henning Braaten and the conductor Per Dreier gave the unhurried, appreciative attention due a national monument, this concert represented Grieg's best virtues dimly. First we had the dreadfully faded 'Homage March', then the 'Norwegian Bridal Procession' - as orchestrated by Delius: a world premiere, this] - which was alright. Next, the young soprano Anne-Margrethe Eikaas, in demure national costume, sang six orchestrated songs. Her voice is true and pretty, though not large, and she delivered every song with the same bright innocence, unsullied by the least nuance. After the interval we heard an orchestral version of 'Bell-ringing', which counts as mildly experimental but is not interesting for any other reason. Finally, the four Symphonic Dances - the adjective is ill-earned - of Grieg's op. 64 proved amiable, lightweight and repetitive: far less ambitious than, say, Dvorak in this undemanding genre. Dreier and the RPO dealt affectionately with them. Sponsored by the Royal Norwegian Embassy and DYNO On the face of it, the Philharmonia's Festival Hall programme last Friday looked curiously marginal: early, lightweight Mozart, and Szymanowski's grave Stabat Mater of 1926. With Claus Peter Flor conducting, it drew a creditable full house nonetheless. No doubt the appearance of the Labeque sisters in Mozart's three-piano concerto K242, with Bruno-Leonardo Gelber as the third pair of hands, exerted a considerable pull; but Szymanowski - even when as sober as here - wields an appeal that is gaining new credit. In Mozart, the three pianists were scrupulously charming. Though K. 242 is a piece of little density, they suggested a many-levelled structure by picking out small inner parts. The concerto sounded deceptively rich and rewarding; the effect would have been greater still, had not the Adagio sounded so laid-back and lax. Before that, Flor and his quartet of solo voices - Sylvia Greenberg and Linda Finnie, Thomas Randle and Anthony Michaels-Moore - had done light, dancing justice to young Mozart's Missa Brevis in D, K. 194. This little Mass presupposes some unwritten plainchant at the beginnings of successive sections, and a male section of the Philharmonia Chorus undertook that. Cool and chaste, it jostled against Mozart's sprightly Rococo inventions. The elegiac Szymanowski was more consistent. Flor calibrated its melancholy sounds to a theatrical nicety, and Mss. Greenberg and Finnie duetted with heartbreaking sweetness. It was not quite the right work, however, to close a concert that boasted such lively preliminaries. After the Stabat Mater had risen to stern utterance in the middle, the subsidence into familiarly sweet, all-purpose harmonies at the end sounded like a cop-out. Sponsor: National Power</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Books: Fantasies for the young at heart - Michael Glover on some children's books which are just clamouring for attention The sight of 1,000 children's books clamouring for our attention in a medium size bookshop is almost as maddening and confusing as the sight of 1,000 children clamouring for our attention in that same bookshop. So call them all to order and group them strictly in lines - with the youngest first, of course. The most pictorially ravishing picture book is undoubtedly The Children of Lir by Sheila MacGill-Callaghan (Ragged Bears, Pounds 8.99), a story loosely based on an Irish legend that may have been one of Shakespeare's sources for King Lear. When Lir's wife, Aiofe, witnesses the affection the king shows his children, she changes them all into swans and the conditions that need to be fulfilled if they are to regain their human forms seem beyond the reach of mere human ingenuity. The book's Russian illustrator, Gennnady Spirin, has an exuberant touch  - his dolphins leap out of the waves at us, and his birds beat their wings in a baroque frenzy. All this marvellous colourwork helps us to forgive the book's author for a diction that leans too heavily at times on archaic locutions. Other outstanding picture books for the under-sixes this autumn include Too Tired by Ann Turnbull (Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 8.99; illustrated by the excellent Ella Chichester Clark), in which the slothful behaviour of two sloths makes Noah's job of filling the Ark with two of everything before it gets too late almost impossibly difficult; The Beast with a Thousand Teeth by the elderly Python Terry Jones (Pavilion, Pounds 6.00; illustrated by Michael Foreman), in which too many cakes topped by pink icing destroy a heartless beast's hopes of using his magnificent teeth to gobble up an entire community; and The Snow Angel by Angela McAllister and award-winning illustrator Claire Fletcher (Bodley Head, Pounds 8.99). Elsa lies down in the snow and makes the shape of an angel with her outstretched arms. The impression (like her own fantasy of turning into a snow angel) does not go away. Finding a new theme for an anthology of children's poetry is always extremely difficult - pets have been flogged to death; witches are looking increasingly threadbare. One anthologist who always seems to have the capacity to spring a pleasant surprise is Anne Harvey. He Said, She Said, They Said (Blackie, Pounds 9.99) is a collection of poems written in the form of conversations - from Auden's marvellous ballad 'Oh, What is that Sound?' to the traditional 'Oh] Soldier, soldier, won't You Marry Me?' Like novels written in the first person, poems spoken in individual voices arguing, teasing, complaining or merely enquiring, have a special capacity to surprise and delight. The unexpected interjection heightens the dramatic effect at every twist and turn. Another new anthology worth recommending is Funny Bunch (Viking, Pounds 8.99), a collection of comic poems edited by the excellent children's poet Kit Wright. Wright has done his homework as an anthologist. He does not plunder the best of his material from other people's anthologies - the oldest trick of the anthologist's trade. Of the new novels of children of six to eight, Akimbo and the Crocodile Man (Methuen, Pounds 6.99) by the prolific Alexander McCall Smith is the third in a sequence of novels about a young African boy who goes on safaris. The moments of excitement are worked for; there is no gratuitous sensationalising. Jenny Nimmo's The Stone Mouse (Walker, Pounds 6.99) is a short, taut novel told from an unusual perspective - that of a stone mouse who has to tolerate the tiresome attentions of holiday visitors to his seaside home. Anne Merrick has taken for the subject matter of her first novel for older children the difficult and challenging problem of a child who has lost its memory and is trying to reconstruct, step by painful step, a new reality for itself. This could have been merely a worthy book; in fact, Someone Came Knocking (Spindlewood, Pounds 9.95) is an extremely powerful and engrossing one from start to finish. Susan Price, who won the Carnegie Medal in 1987 for The Ghost Drum, is very good at retelling traditional fairy stories, giving them new setting and unexpected meanings. Her latest book, Head and Tales (Faber, Pounds 9.99) mines a similar vein. Lynnet the storyteller, an old man in the grip of a fever, makes a macabre request: that his head should be cut off, wrapped in rags and delivered by his own children to their grandmother's distant home. It seems a near impossible task until the head opens its mouth and starts to spin some grisly yarns of its own. Finally, a collection of stories for children that is likely to appeal as much to parents as to their sophisticated young. The Oxford Book of Children's Stories (Oxford, Pounds 17 .95), edited by the excellent children's novelist Jan Mark, is a collection of some of the best short stories written for children over the past 250 years, beginning with Sarah Fielding's 'Story of Celia and Chloe' of 1749; passing through contributions by such writers as George MacDonald, Louisa May Alcott, Jean Ingelor and Christina Rossetti; and concluding with work by some of the editor's own contemporaries - James Berry, Anne Fine (winner of this year's Carnegie Medal for The Flour Babies) and Phillipa Pearce. What insights the collection gives into the historical development of writing for children] - the most interesting of all being the fact that the ingredients for a successful children's story have remained remarkably constant down the years. Everything changes, everything remains the same.</p>

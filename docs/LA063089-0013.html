			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IN THE SMOKE AND FLAMES, THEIR FLAGS STILL FLEW  </P> <P> Two American flags survived the major brush fire that was dying down Thursday  after it swept through the Elizabeth Lake and Green Valley areas Wednesday and  forced the evacuation of at least 1,500 residents.  </P> <P> One flag belonged to Velma Majors. Along with porcelain figures handmade by her  mother, it was among the few possessions she retrieved from the rubble of the  house the Majors family rented on San Francisquito Canyon Road south of  Elizabeth Lake, an isolated mountain community of 2,500.  </P> <P> About half a mile away, Don and Mary Simpson also had a story to tell about a  flag. But it had a happier ending, one more than a bit reminiscent of the "Star  Spangled Banner."  </P> <P> </P> <P> One House Burned  </P> <P> The Majors' home was the only house to burn in the fire -- a surprise to  residents who surveyed charred hillsides and ruined lawns Thursday and said  they had expected much worse. At its height Wednesday afternoon, the blaze sent  up a fast-moving column of smoke and flames that blotted out the sun over  Elizabeth Lake and had people predicting wholesale loss of property.  </P> <P> An effective response by firefighters and some help from the winds, which  diminished Wednesday after reaching 45 miles an hour, prevented more damage,  residents and officials said.  </P> <P> Majors said she and her family moved to the rented home four years ago from  Redondo Beach as part of a growing number of transplanted residents to the area  who endure long commuting trips to Los Angeles because they cherish the  seclusion and beauty of the mountains.  </P> <P> "We moved to get away from the hustle-bustle," Majors said. Of the fire, she  said, "It comes with the territory. Just like earthquakes come with Southern  California."  </P> <P> Firefighters tried to save the Majors' home, officials said. But they were  forced to back off by the intensity of the fire, which was fed by overhanging  trees and heavy brush around the property.  </P> <P> Helped by relatives and interrupted periodically by reporters and camera crews,  Velma Majors sifted through what was left of her home. She pointed to a hill  where the family recently held an outdoor wedding ceremony for her son and  daughter-in-law in full Renaissance costume.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pictures Saved  </P> <P> "No more Renaissance weddings, I guess," she said. "I just wish I had been able  to grab some of the pictures of the house."  </P> <P> On Wednesday afternoon, Majors said, she saw the orange glow of the fire in her  picture window, then heard sheriff's deputies directing evacuations over their  patrol car loudspeakers. The family bundled up her infant grandson and headed  for safety ahead of the smoke.  </P> <P> Arrayed on the blackened ground in front of Majors on Thursday were porcelain  Nativity figures -- Madonna, infant Jesus, angels -- made by her mother. Majors  said she was surprised that they were unscathed. She rubbed soot off them. "She  does the most beautiful work," Majors said, her head down.  </P> <P> Among the other possessions Majors and her family found unscathed was their  flag. But the gloomy mood did not prevent the family from cracking jokes about  their evident patriotism amid a national furor over flag-burning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hasty Departure  </P> <P> Like the Majors family, Don Simpson said he and his wife, Mary, wasted no time  Wednesday as the blaze advanced on their home on the southeastern edge of  Elizabeth Lake. They grabbed a family photo album, piled into their car and  fled to an open area along with neighbors.  </P> <P> "One fella was pulling out in his antique car he wanted to save," Don Simpson  said. "Other folks were rounding up their animals and their children."  </P> <P> The Simpsons also expected the worst.  </P> <P> "I couldn't figure out how it could still be standing," Mary Simpson said  Thursday of the family home. Helicopters rumbled overhead toward the scene of  lingering fires. The Simpsons have lived in Elizabeth Lake since 1966. Although  the immediate community had not experienced a major fire since the 1950s, the  Simpsons said they have seen the devastation left by fires in nearby areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Rubble  </P> <P> When they returned home Wednesday evening, however, there was no smoldering  rubble. The garden and most of the greenery on the 5-acre property had burned.  Flames had damaged a shed by a water storage tank and come to within 10 feet  from the house. But the house was intact.  </P> <P> "The Fire Department saved my house, that's for sure," Mary Simpson said.  </P> <P> Simpson said he had not given up hope. He flies an American flag on a tall pole  in front of his property. And from the open area where he and his wife sought  refuge, he thought he could occasionally catch glimpses of the flag through  breaks in the smoke.  </P> <P> "Once in a while I could see it," he said. "Then, there was a clearing period  and I thought I could see the roof of the house. And then I thought it's  probably going to make it."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Part I, Page 3  </P></p>

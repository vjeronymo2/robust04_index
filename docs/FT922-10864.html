			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Teams on both sides line up - The Battle for Midland BATTLE LINES began to take shape yesterday as the phony war over Midland Bank at last broke out into the open, with the two combatants each weighing in with advisers who have not previously represented them on a substantial acquisition. Hongkong's attack is being led by Mr William ('Willie') Purves, the bank's chairman since 1986. Mr Purves towers over the Hongkong Bank: nothing of importance happens without his personal approval. He and Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland, conceived the combination at an IMF meeting in 1987. The Hongkong Bank team is split between London and Hong Kong, though much more of the day-to-day running of the bid is expected to move to London should Lloyd's offer clear the regulatory hurdles. Around Mr Purves are gathered Mr John Grey, executive deputy chairman, and Mr Chalmers Carr, the bank's legal counsel. In the team is also Mr Simon Burrows, a financial planner who has been responsible for the bank's detailed study of Midland. An all-out battle for control of Midland is also expected to see Mr Bernard Asher, the London-based Hongkong Bank director who chairs its investment banking operations of Wardley and James Capel, pitched into the ring. Hongkong Bank's need for a senior figure in the UK to fight the bid is all the more pressing given its status as an outsider as far as the UK establishment is concerned. Mr Purves himself has called on government officials to make the bank's case, but on a trip to London last week did not call on Mr Michael Hesseltine, whose decision could be crucial in deciding whether the rival bids are to be referred. Schroders, Hongkong's advisers, were called on board by Mr Purves, whose personal contacts with Mr Win Bischoff, the merchant bank's chairman, date back to the time when Mr Bischoff himself worked in Hong Kong. Schroders' team running the bid, led by Mr Derek Netherton and Ms Alison Carnwath, suffers the disadvantage of dealing with a client based on the other side of the world - another factor which could see more control of the bid passing to London if Lloyds proceeds. Lloyds has also called in new advisers, Baring Brothers, to help with its bid. It relied on its in-house advisers, Lloyds Merchant Bank, during its failed bid for Standard Chartered in the mid-1980s and its successful bid for Abbey Life, the insurance group. Mr David Horne, chairman of LMB, is now working alongside Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers, and Mr Charles Irby, a Baring director, on the bid. As with Hongkong Bank, Lloyds' bid is also directed very much from the office of its chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman. Neither side has set up formal war cabinets to fight their corners - though should the battle escalate into all-out war such a move seems likely.</p>

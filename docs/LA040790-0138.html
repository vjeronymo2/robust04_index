			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> BAIL DOUBLED FOR SUSPECT IN RAPE  </P> <P> A former Beverly Hills police officer who is accused of raping an 11-year-old  Irvine girl planned to flee the area and change his identity, the prosecutor  testified Friday.  </P> <P> Judge Christopher W. Strople doubled bail to $500,000 in Municipal Court.  </P> <P> The judge also continued the defendant's arraignment to April 20.  </P> <P> Steven Rush McCoy, 36, of Irvine was arrested March 26. On that day, a man  masqueraded as a deliveryman with a box, persuading the victim to open the door  in an apartment near UC Irvine and then raping her at knifepoint, police said.  </P> <P> After the assault, "He told the child if she called the police he would come  back and kill her," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne Symons said.  </P> <P> McCoy proclaimed his innocence in a jailhouse interview.  </P> <P> But police, serving a search warrant at McCoy's apartment on the day of the  arrest, found notes in the defendant's handwriting which indicated he intended  to disappear and fake a new identity elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We found notes that said things like: 'Move to Las Vegas. Get a new birth  certificate. Get a Ph.D.,' " Symons said. "If he is able to post bail, there is  a likelihood that he will flee."  </P> <P> But defense attorney Jan Heger said the notes may have belonged to someone  else. Heger argued Friday that bail was already high enough. MICHAEL ASHCRAFT  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Hedstrom: "Sweden Wants Zero Payment in </F> First Year"]    [Text] Brussels -- The government wants Sweden to make a  zero payment to the EU [European Union] in the first year of  Swedish membership. This is the size of the Swedish demand for  a rebate upon accession that the government will soon be putting  forward.    This was said by Finance Minister Anne Wibble, who visited  Brussels yesterday after a tour of the EU capitals where she  pleaded Sweden's case for a decreased membership contribution to  the EU in the initial years of membership.    "A factor that we stressed and that was listened to with  interest is that in no year does Sweden intend to be a burden on  the EU's budget," Anne Wibble said.    "We will always be a net contributor even though to begin  with our contribution is small or even zero."    According to Wibble, Sweden's regular membership  contribution  to the EU will end up "somewhere under 20 billion kronor" a  year. Both sides' experts are sitting and making their  calculations and their figures "are in the process of  converging," the finance minister said.    But Sweden wants a phasing-in rebate, which means that only  after a number of years will Sweden's membership contribution  reach the full amount. The justification for this includes the  arguments that other countries have been granted this and that  Sweden has problems with its state finances.    According to a state report on the effects of EU membership,  the flow of money back to Sweden from the EU could be 5 to 9  billion kronor in agricultural support and around 2 million from  the structural fund. Thus a Swedish zero payment would  correspond to an initial rebate of around 50 percent.    But Anne Wibble is aware that in the final phase of  negotiations a Swedish rebate demand could be played off against  other demands close to Sweden's heart -- such as regional  support for northern Sweden.    "This is exactly how discussions will go in the final phase.  Obviously the whole picture is of significance in the final  phase.    "Regional policy is of great political importance. My  feelings about regional policy are very strong.    "But it is important to achieve a good solution on both  issues. We could not swap regional support for the budget  rebate."    In the past, European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel has  said several times that the Swedish negotiators want to see what  they will get back from the EU before Sweden produces an  official negotiating stance on the budget.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel V. Ramos on his arrival from a </F> three-day official visit to the SRV at Ninoy Aquino  International Airport -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog]    [Text] Mr. Vice President; former president and Mrs.  Diosdado Macapagal; Speaker Protempore of the House of  Representatives Raul Daza; and the distinguished members of the  Senate and of the House of Representatives; your Excellency,  Archbishop Morene; the dean of the diplomatic corp.; your  excellencies of the diplomatic corp.; particularly the charge of  the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Mr. (Hoa Phuc Chinh);  co-workers in government, beloved countrymen: It's  good to be back home. At the close of our three-day journey  across the South China Sea to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,  it is gratifying to come home with our report of mission  accomplished. And I thank you for your good wishes for a  successful visit, and your prayers for our safe journey home.    When this administration came to office in June 1992, I set  as one of our key priorities the restructuring and reorientation  of our foreign relations in keeping with the changes that have  taken place in our country and in the world. And central to  this new thrust was the emphasis on our relations with our  neighbors in Southeast Asia -- both the members and the  non-members of the Association of Southeast Nations or ASEAN.  My journey to Vietnam continues this effort in a new way, since  this is my first visit to a Southeast Asian state that is not a  member of ASEAN. For reasons of geography, history, and shared  interest and concerns, Vietnam today is particularly crucial to  the building of a viable structure for regional security,  stability, and peace in our part of the world, a goal which  intimately involves the progress and prosperity of all of the 10  nations of Southeast Asia.    In the discussions and exchanges that took place during our  visit, Vietnam's leaders and the Philippine delegation addressed  bilateral, regional, and global issues and concerns, and these  have resulted in significant agreements, new initiatives, and  fresh understanding between our governments. Like our own  leadership, Vietnam's top leaders -- President Le Duc Anh, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet, and Party General Secretary Do Muoi --  attached great importance to regional stability.    They seen it the breathing spell after two generations of  bloody conflict with which to set their own economy on the road  to self-sustaining growth. [sentence as heard] In this regard,  the Vietnamese leaders expressed their government's readiness  and intent to participate fully in the meeting of the  forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum in Bangkok -- a unique regional  mechanism for dealing with security issues.    We discussed ways to reduce tensions in East Asia, including  the need to rid the entire region of nuclear arms and the threat  of nuclear warfare. The conflicting claims to areas of the  South China Sea are of acute concern to both our countries. We  explored and exchanged ideas about new avenues for cooperation  among the claimant states and the other countries of Southeast  Asia, cooperative endeavors that can help to reduce tensions and  build confidence in the area.    On our part, I proposed that the countries involved jointly  undertake a study of the possible demilitarization of the area,  and of freezing all destabilizing activities in that area. I  also proposed that the resources in the South China Sea Islands  be considered as the common heritage of all the nations and  people on its periphery. At the very least, the Vietnamese  leaders and I agreed that the status quo with respect to the  question of sovereignty and the status quo in regard to the  strength of the military garrisons be frozen for the moment.    We also agreed on the desirability of cooperative ventures  in  such matters as marine scientific research; air and sea borne  rescue; environmental protection; and, the installation of  navigational aids. These ventures would not only be beneficial  in themselves, but also would help to build confidence and trust  among the countries of the region. As another  confidence-building measure, both sides saw merit in an exchange  of visits among commanders and units stationed in the islands  and atolls of the South China Sea.    We shared the conviction that if the countries concerned  fully explore these, as well as other friendly approaches, we  can transform the South China Sea from waters of contention to  an area of cooperation.    I reaffirmed the Philippines' support for Vietnam's early  entry into ASEAN as a full member, and our readiness to help in  easing the way to Vietnam's membership.    My visit illuminated the vast potential for economic  cooperation between our two countries, and served as an occasion  for the expansion of trade and other forms of economic  interaction between us.    Vietnam and the Philippines stand at similar, though not  identical, points in their quest for modernization. Both  countries see their development as anchored on their ties to  other countries and the global economy. And both are today in  the midst of restructuring and reform on a very intensive basis.    Our delegation briefed the Vietnamese leaders on our  Philippines 2000 Program, which, among other things seeks to  open our economy to free market forces, and improve our global  competitiveness.    In turn, Vietnam's leaders explained to us the workings of  Doi Moi, which is their own economic renovation and adjustment  program, and which has brought Vietnam high growth rates during  the past three years.    We agreed on specific measures to fulfill the great  potential  of our economic relationship. Our trade ministers signed a  trade protocol that pinpoints the products that can be  profitably traded between our two countries. For a similar  purpose, we opened an office of the Philippine International  Trading Company, or PITC in Ho Chi Minh City.    Several joint venture agreements were signed between several  top businessmen in our delegation and Vietnamese enterprises --  undertakings that will in themselves benefit both economies  while opening the way to expanded economic activities with  multiplied effects to us both. It is estimated that such  business agreements could increase our bilateral trade by at  least $150 million in the near future.    To promote the tourism industry, which both countries  consider as extremely important to their development programs  and people-to-people exchanges, our foreign ministers signed a  tourism agreement and a cultural agreement which provide the  framework for intensive cooperation in these areas.    The Vietnamese leaders expressed Vietnam's interest in  receiving training from the Philippines in a wide range of  disciplines -- from banking and management, to economics and  accounting; from aquaculture and agricultural research, to the  English language. We shall explore ways in which to translate  into reality our willingness to cooperate with Vietnam in this  regard.    The improved economic situation in Vietnam has considerably  brightened the prospects for the orderly repatriation of some  3,100 Vietnamese asylum seekers still remaining in the  Philippines who have been denied resettlement in third countries.    The Vietnamese leaders assured us of their utmost  cooperation  in encouraging the return of their people to Vietnam and  reintegrating them harmoniously into Vietnamese society.    We also agreed to strengthen the relationship between our  two  Armed Forces through the exchange of visits between senior  defense officials and military officers; study tours by defense  and military students; and, the opening of slots in the  Philippine Military Academy to Vietnamese cadets.    Finally, and as bottom line, we established a joint  commission to deal comprehensively with the whole range of our  relationship, and to nurture its steady expansion for mutual  benefit and support.    In both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, we met with the Filipino  expatriates working in Vietnam as professionals and technicians,  and who are helping to build that country. I brought them  greetings from our beloved Philippines and urged them to learn  as much as they can from that great country that is their  temporary home. Our country can be proud of all of them.    Ladies and gentlemen, in assessing the significance of this  visit in the light of our national concerns and our national  interest, we must look beyond its immediate economic benefits.  Although we can confidently foresee such benefits in the near  future.    We must also see this visit as the building of an enduring  bridge to the Vietnamese people, thus contributing to the  edifice of stability, peace, and prosperity that both our  nations and our neighbors in ASEAN are helping to construct in  Southeast Asia.    Both the Philippines and Vietnam have known the last of  colonialism and the struggle against imperialism and foreign  occupation. This fact of our national lives has strengthened  our historic kinship, and makes the act of cooperation with each  other a natural undertaking for both.    Moreover, as countries striving for development and  modernization, we have much to learn from each other.    The exchange of knowledge and experience that we have begun  with this visit and the close cooperation that we have pledged  to promote between Vietnam and the Philippines promise to bring  incalculable benefits to both our people and beyond our  bilateral partnership.    The forging of strong bonds between us will surely enhance  the stability and progress of our Asia Pacific Region. This  certainly is the Philippines' intention and the perceived  intention of Vietnam and her leaders.    In the final analysis, this is the lasting significance of  our visit to Vietnam -- the agreements that we have forged are  in every way important for raising the level of our political  and economic collaboration. But even more significant are the  understandings that we have received as partners in making our  way in the world, and in reinforcing peace and stability in our  region.    We return today to our beloved Philippines confident that we  have significantly advanced the interest of our nation and  contributed to the welfare of our region.    We thank the good Lord for keeping the Philippines united  and  secure, and in the spirit of the Lenten Season, we continue to  pray for our people's welfare and progress.    Thank you to all of you. Long live the  Philippines.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: EAST BLOC WELCOMES VISITORS WITH EMPTY ARMS;  </P> <P> TOURISM: THE RUSH IS ON TO VISIT EASTERN EUROPE FROM ALL POINTS WEST. HOTELS,  AIRLINES AND CAR-RENTAL COMPANIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND. FOR A  WHILE AT LEAST, DON'T EXPECT HASSLE-FREE HOLIDAYS.  </P> <P> If you like rapidly evolving positive statistics, then you already love Eastern  Europe. It seems that when it comes to travel and tourism figures, nearly  everyone speaks in superlatives.  </P> <P> Boom, explosion and flood are words often used to report on the thousands of  tourists flocking to Eastern Europe. To be sure, the numbers are impressive:  During the first four months of this year, 4.18 million visitors from  hard-currency areas (mostly Western Europe and North America) had traveled to  Hungary, up a staggering 70% from the same period in 1989.  </P> <P> Revenues on Pam Am flights to Eastern Europe were 15 times higher in 1989 than  in the previous six years. Hotel space in Warsaw and Berlin is jammed. Even  charter airlines have gotten into the act.  </P> <P> Recently, American Trans Air commenced service to Riga, Latvia, from New York.  On the ground, some countries seem to be moving faster than others. Perhaps the  fastest is Hungary. By Sept. 1, three new hotels will open in Budapest, adding  900 much-needed rooms to the city.  </P> <P> In Bulgaria, a country generally ignored by Western tourists, officials have  announced hopes to build 30 "Western-style" properties in the next five years.  Government authorities are actively negotiating with Sheraton (which already  manages one Bulgarian property in Sofia), Hyatt, Hilton International and  Marriott.  </P> <P> In Czechoslovakia, 53 of the country's newest and biggest hotels have announced  that they can now be booked directly from the West, instead of via the official  Cedok government service. The hotels can also be reserved in advance with U.S.  dollars, instead of with the Czech koruna.  </P> <P> In the air, former Communist regimes are moving quickly to become truly  competitive with the West: They are ordering U.S.-made planes and upgrading  service.  </P> <P> Malev, the Hungarian airline, has plans to replace its entire fleet of 21  Soviet-built jets with U.S. airplanes. LOT, the Polish airline, is now using  some Boeing equipment. (None of the airlines has started a frequent flier  program . . . yet.)  </P> <P> Now that the Communist world has embraced capitalism, it seems that every  airline, hotel group, rental-car company and tour operator wants to return the  gesture.  </P> <P> Already, many airlines, including U.S. carriers, have either applied for new  routes to Eastern Europe or have increased service there.  </P> <P> Hotel companies have announced new construction or management contracts to run  existing hotels. For example, Sheraton, Hyatt, Marriott, Ramada and Pullman  hotels have announced plans to build new hotels in such cities as Warsaw,  Belgrade and Moscow.  </P> <P> And tour operators are now offering tours to previously inaccessible  destinations, or places that had been severely limited to tourists.  </P> <P> The barriers have indeed come down. But what will travelers find behind the  doors?  </P> <P> As euphoria begins to settle into the reality of continuing economic despair  for most of these countries, there are a few things you should know before  booking your trip East.  </P> <P> Since tourism is so dependent on service, the development of Eastern European  tourism starts with two strikes against it.  </P> <P> "People were downright giddy with joy," says one hotelier in Germany. "But the  problem comes with their expectations."  </P> <P> Before the Berlin Wall came crashing down, many U.S. travel concerns -- hotels,  tour operators and airlines -- were already operating in countries such as  Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Still, a number of corporations were complaining about the difficulties of  doing business in the Eastern Bloc. Officials of InterContinental Hotels met  privately to discuss pulling out of some Eastern European cities.  </P> <P> "It was getting impossible to maintain our style of service there," reports one  general manager who attended the high-level meetings. "We couldn't get supplies  that our international guests had come to expect, and worse, we couldn't get  such basic services as water, natural gas and electricity on a consistent  basis."  </P> <P> Just when InterContinental was getting ready to pull the plug on some of its  hotels, the Berlin Wall came down and, suddenly, the rush was on for Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> In some cases, even when light appeared at the end of the tunnel, it seemed the  tunnel kept getting longer. For example, the Soviets opened a luxury hotel in  Moscow (the Savoy, formerly the Berlin Hotel) as a joint venture with a Finnish  company.  </P> <P> The newly renovated hotel boasted room service, a bar with cable TV and  Moscow's first approved casino (restricted to holders of a foreign passport or  Western credit card). That's the good news.  </P> <P> Now, try to get a room there. The hotel is booked -- for the next five years  solid -- by Finnair for its clients.  </P> <P> Another continuing problem with traveling to Eastern Europe is in the area of  rental cars and the hassle of fuel compatibility. As a number of tourists  discovered recently, it is virtually impossible (with the exception of Hungary)  to find unleaded gas in Eastern Bloc countries.  </P> <P> But almost every car rented in Western Europe takes unleaded fuel only. As a  result, a number of unsuspecting travelers rented cars in France and West  Germany, only to run out of gas in Eastern Europe. They had to abandon their  cars there. Not surprisingly, retrieving the cars was a costly experience both  for the companies and the renters.  </P> <P> Thus, at least for the time being, if you plan on renting a car for a trip  through Eastern Europe, it might be a better idea to wait until you get there.  For example, Budget Rent-A-Car has offices in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland  and Yugoslavia, and the company guarantees its rates in U.S. dollars.  </P> <P> Europcar (the National Car Rental affiliate in Europe) has opened offices in  East Berlin and Leipzig. You can also find Europcar outlets in Yugoslavia,  Poland, Hungary and Romania.  </P> <P> But before you rush over to Eastern Europe, you need to face some facts:  </P> <P>  -- Hotel space is tight. Polish officials estimate that Warsaw will need 3,000  more hotel beds every night from now through the end of September. Prague has a  similar problem.  </P> <P>  -- Even if you can get a room, expect to pay for it. Already, the East Germans  have raised hotel room rates as much as 50% over 1989. And don't expect all the  usual amenities. First, most Eastern European hotel rooms are not  well-designed. Don't always expect hot water or consistent electrical current.  And, sometimes, don't even expect soap.  </P> <P>  -- Think ahead. Bring an extra roll of toilet paper, your own washcloth and  extra soap. If, like me, you get spoiled and frequently use hotel-supplied  shampoo when traveling, don't be surprised if those kinds of products are not  in your bathroom when you arrive.  </P> <P>  -- Finally, don't go anywhere in Eastern Europe without a confirmed  reservation . . . in writing.  </P></p>

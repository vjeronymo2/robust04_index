			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Insurers warn of coastal property risk PROPERTY owners in some coastal areas could find it more difficult to obtain insurance following the landslip near the Holbeck Hall Hotel at Scarborough at the weekend, insurers claimed yesterday. A spokesman for Cigna, the US company which insures Holbeck Hall, said: 'This will definitely make it harder for some people to get insurance. A slip of this magnitude is bound to make people think.' Sections of the four-star North Yorkshire hotel toppled into Scarborough's South Bay after the landslip, leaving the building - in insurance jargon - 'a constructive total loss'. Holbeck Hall was insured for Pounds 3m and Cigna, which as lead insurer covers 60 per cent of the risk, stands to pay Pounds 1.8m (before collecting on its own reinsurances). Cigna said it would be looking closely at its other exposures in clifftop areas over the next few weeks and expected other insurers to be doing the same. The company stressed, however, that it is not active in the UK homeowner market, simply insuring commercial properties. Cigna said it had insured Holbeck Hall for the last four years, but when it last carried out a survey the property was 300 yards from the sea and was not regarded as a particularly serious risk and carried no extra premium. 'It hadn't rung the alarm bells it should have done. It was a property we were happy to have on the books,' said Cigna, which renewed the hotel's annual policy in November last year. 'You wouldn't expect something of that magnitude to happen,' according to the company. Cigna has two investigators on the scene in Scarborough. At present insurers apply no special rules for covering clifftop properties, tending to treat them in much the same way as those which might be vulnerable to subsidence damage. Cover would be dependent on a survey and an engineer's report, with rating varying according to the degree of risk.</p>

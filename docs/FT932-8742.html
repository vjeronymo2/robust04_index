			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Chinese put money where their Mao is: Traders quick to cash in on 100th anniversary of the leader's birth IN THIS 100th anniversary year of his birth Mao Zedong might turn in his grave at such displays of raw commercialism. Mao badges, buttons, little red books, portraits, busts, memorial coins, stamps, kitsch cigarette lighters and dozens of other trinkets of China's revolutionary past are being sold in a dusty Shanghai park by traders seemingly more interested in the capitalist road than they are in the glorious history of the revolution. Old Mr Lin, a peasant farmer from Jiangsu province, reckons he has accumulated 8,000 Mao items, dozens of which he drags, cascading from sacks, satchels and the deep pockets of his patched jacket. 'Of course, Mao would be very happy seeing me selling his badges; he believed that we should make revolution first, and then get down to business,' said Mr Lin with a commercial glint in his eye, lifting up his pullover to display a selection of badges pinned to a grubby vest. The brisk trade in Mao memorabilia in Shanghai and at dozens of other locations throughout China probably also represents yearning for the past among older-generation Chinese who are having enormous difficulty coming to terms with what they regard as a 'money-grubbing' present. Mao, for all his enormous faults, for all the heartbreak and misery his vainglorious theories about perpetual class struggle brought to millions, still represents a degree of certainty in a world that is undergoing revolutionary change. Thus, one old man in the Shanghai market said that whatever mistakes Mao might have committed in his later life he should be revered for flattening China's 'three big mountains': feudalism, colonialism and imperialism. Mao as a talisman is also undergoing something of resurgence among young Chinese: those who were perhaps too young to be directly exposed to the madness of the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, when life was turned upside down, often tragically, for millions of families. Mao portraits, like an enigmatic oriental St Christopher, dangle from the rear-view mirrors of thousands of vehicles throughout China. Somehow, in death, the 'great helmsman' has become the patron saint of Chinese drivers; and superstitious stories abound of cars displaying his portrait avoiding accident in a country where 100,000 people died on the roads last year. In this anniversary year of the birth of a man whose legacy to China is extremely complicated - official judgment holds that he was 70 per cent 'good' and 30 per cent 'bad' - the authorities seem undecided about how to mark the occasion. This is partly, one suspects, because the leadership understands that Mao would not approve the course they have adopted, which is to embrace capitalism in all but name. Indeed, drawing undue attention to Mao and his thoughts might highlight the contrast between past certainty, however austere, and present uncertainty. A deeply flawed Mao remains, nevertheless, an important symbol of Communist party legitimacy at a time of rapid change and weakening ideology when his heirs clearly wish to preserve a link, however tenuous, with a revolutionary past. Preparations are going ahead to mark anniversary this December 26, albeit on a fairly modest scale at this stage. Much activity centres on Shaoshan village near Hunan's capital, Changsha, where Mao was born, the son of a relatively well-to-do peasant and grain merchant. At Shaoshan, set in green and pleasant hills, additional memorials - as if there were not enough already - are being erected. A Mao library is under construction along with a new building housing Mao relics. Elsewhere in China, artists, writers and film makers are also doing their bit to mark the anniversary. An album of calligraphic works is to be published to note the occasion, and three feature films and five TV dramas are in production. At the Mao mausoleum on Tiananmen Square, where Mao has lain in state for most of the time since his death in 1976, no special arrangements have yet been initiated to mark the anniversary, although a small flurry occurred in the Chinese press recently when a Marxist scholar complained to the China Youth Daily that Mao's tomb was being defiled by undue commercial activity in its precincts, such as the sale of tourist items. Mr Liu Mingyuan of the People's University wrote that the 'practice of doing business inside Chairman Mao's mausoleum is unconscionable'. Mao's corpse in this anniversary year has not been immune from scare stories. China was recently obliged to deny rumours that the embalmed body was rotting away in its glass sarcophagus. Back at the Shanghai Cultural Revolution relics market it is doubtful that concerns about the state of Mao's corpse, or the well-being of the Communist party, were much in mind as traders haggled and bargained. Old Mr Lin certainly exhibited no ideological qualms: 'This business I'm doing now', he said, dragging more Mao kitschery from the recesses of his satchels, 'is a celebration of his anniversary.'</p>

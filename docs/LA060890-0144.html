			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME CENSUS WORKERS HINT JOB ACTION  </P> <P> A decision by the U.S. Census Bureau to exclude clerks and other office workers  from a $1.50-an-hour pay raise given field workers prompted scattered  grumbling, and threats of sickouts and work slowdowns Thursday among census  employees in Orange County.  </P> <P> If such labor problems materialized, they could slow the pace of the count,  which is already lagging behind the national average in some areas of the  county. "I just feel very strongly that this is not very fair," said Peggy  Barry, a clerk in the Census Bureau's Fullerton office. "We're not going to get  one more red cent, and we're working our tails off."  </P> <P> Census officials in Washington said they decided to raise salaries for  enumerators in selected areas of the country, including Southern California,  because of concerns that the count was being slowed by attrition and other  problems.  </P> <P> At the Irvine district office, for example, nearly one of every two field  enumerators quit soon after they began work, forcing census officials to  scramble to train new employees. The enumerators go out into the community to  count households that have not responded to the census questionnaire that was  mailed out in late March.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the salaries of enumerators rose from $7.50  to $9 an hour this week. They also gained a $1.50 bonus for every household  they visit.  </P> <P> As word of the salary boost spread, some census office workers reacted by  complaining to their managers, according to Michael Weiler, assistant regional  census manager for operations in Southern California. Census office workers in  San Bernardino walked out on Wednesday but were back on the job Thursday, he  said.  </P> <P> In Orange County, several office workers talked briefly of conducting sickouts  or work slowdowns. But officials at the county's four census offices said there  have been no indications that any sort of labor action has been undertaken by  the workers, who are hired on a temporary basis for jobs that last from a few  weeks to several months.  </P> <P> One employee in the Irvine district office said more than a dozen computer  key-punch operators were planning to transfer to jobs as field enumerators to  reap the new pay raise. The employee, who asked that his name not be used,  suggested that the district's efforts would be undermined by the transfers as  officials hurried to train new workers and fill the slots.  </P> <P> But local officials said they expected few problems to crop up because of the  pay issue. William Bellamy, district director in Irvine, said he talked with  key-punch operators, clerks and other office personnel about the reasoning  behind the salary increase for enumerators.  </P> <P> "There were a few that still requested to be enumerators, but quite a few that  withdrew their requests," he said. "I see no indication of any problems. Quite  frankly, I would be talking to them right quick if I thought that any problems  were occurring."  </P> <P> Bellamy and several other local census officials said, however, that they felt  the salary hike seemed unfair to the estimated several hundred office workers  who didn't get it.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that there was nothing comparable for the office staff," said  Joe Montes, manager of the Fullerton census office. "I would expect that we're  going to get some grumbling.  </P></p>

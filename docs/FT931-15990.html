			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Power makes full provision against Trocadero POWER CORPORATION, the Irish property group, last night made a 'full provision' against its Trocadero and Island Site properties, after its subsidiaries owning the sites were put into receivership. The company added that its own bankers 'continue to be supportive'. It brought forward the announcement of its interim results for the period to September 30, which revealed retained losses of IPounds 75.1m (Pounds 78.8m), compared with profits of IPounds 1.66m, after an extraordinary provision of IPounds 55.7m relating to its investment in the properties. There was a write down of IPounds 23.7m against revaluation reserves also relating to them. The pre-tax loss was IPounds 19.4m (profits IPounds 5.1m) after an exceptional write down relating to other properties of IPounds 17m. Losses per share were 16.68p (earnings 3.42p) and the interim dividend has been passed, against 2p. Shareholders' funds fell from IPounds 234.4m to IPounds 135.6m over the six months. KPMG Peat Marwick was appointed as administrative receiver to five companies owned by Power, known collectively as the Power Trocadero group, which own the Trocadero leisure, cinema and office complex in Piccadilly, central London, and the adjacent Island Site. The five companies have borrowings totalling Pounds 225m. The development of the Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint venture between Power Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed property and leisure group. In March last year Power Corporation bought the Brent Walker stake. The terms of the deal put a value on the properties of about Pounds 300m, but property values have fallen since then. Brent Walker is still a significant tenant in the Trocadero. Power Corporation had intended to complete the development and find another partner to buy the Brent Walker half share. Borrowings relating to the Power Trocadero group were 'non-recourse' to Power. Rents from the properties were running at about Pounds 8m a year, insufficient to service debts. An application to turn 70,000 sq ft of unlet offices into leisure space was turned down late last year. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that there had been negotiations on a new longer term banking arrangement for the Power Trocadero companies but agreement could not be reached after the failure to get the planning permission. Sanwa Bank, the lead bank to the syndicate which lent to the Power Trocadero group, called in the receiver. Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the 15 months to March 1992 fell and because of what was then termed 'temporarily high' gearing as a result of buying the Brent Walker interest. Mr Power said the six months to September 30 had been difficult for property and no sales were made during the period. He added that reducing gearing, which after the removal of the Power Trocadero companies and the write downs was still about 145 per cent, remained a priority. The receivers said that the Power Trocadero companies would be run on a going concern basis and orderly disposals of assets sought.</p>

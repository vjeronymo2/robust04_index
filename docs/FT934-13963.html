			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors warns off Samsung KIA MOTORS, South Korea's second-largest car producer, yesterday vowed to fight a possible takeover bid by the Samsung group. Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, has suddenly emerged as Kia's second largest corporate shareholder after purchasing large blocks of stock since June. 'The 9.6 per cent Samsung stake in Kia Motors is a threat to stable management. I urge Samsung to reduce its stake to the level of early June,' said Mr Han Seung-jun, president of Kia Motors. Samsung's interest in June was 5.8 per cent. He added that Kia employees, who form the company's largest shareholder block with 11.4 per cent, may try to buy more stock to resist Samsung. Samsung has expressed an interest in becoming a vehicle manufacturer but claims the stock purchase by its insurance subsidiary was purely a financial investment. 'I don't think the massive buying by a life insurer of our company connotes a normal investment practice as an institutional investor. I can't rule out the possibility that Samsung intends a hostile takeover of Kia Motors by increasing its stake,' Mr Han said. Under current Korean law, Samsung cannot purchase more than 10 per cent of Kia shares on the stock exchange. But legislation pending in the National Assembly would abolish the 10 per cent shareholding limit for institutional investors next year, paving the way for corporate raids.</p>

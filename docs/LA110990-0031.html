			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE PICKS DOWNTOWN SITE FOR NEW CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> Palmdale officials decided Thursday that the $60-million Civic Center complex  they hope to build should be located in the same area as the present City Hall  to reclaim the decrepit downtown area and expand facilities to serve a  fast-growing population.  </P> <P> By a 5-0 vote, the Palmdale City Council accepted a consultant's recommendation  that a new Civic Center should be developed in the downtown area, not on either  of two proposed westside sites that are now vacant.  </P> <P> The council also gave the go-ahead for city officials and consultants to  develop more detailed plans for the downtown site at the southeast corner of  Palmdale Boulevard and Sierra Highway.  </P> <P> But how the city would raise the needed money, and how soon, remained major  questions.  </P> <P> Given the reduction in the city's income from dwindling development fees, the  project may take many years, warned City Administrator Robert Toone.  </P> <P> A city consultant last month recommended that the city proceed with the Civic  Center project in three phases. The first, which city officials hope to  complete by 1994, would consist of a 125,000-square-foot City Hall and an  11,000-square-foot county fire station.  </P> <P> The report by the ROMA Design Group of San Francisco said those projects and  related work, including the demolition of six houses, would cost nearly $30  million. Actual costs are expected to be higher, though, since all the  estimates are at 1990 prices.  </P> <P> The second phase would be a new 63,000-square-foot city library and related  parking area, costing about $14 million. The $16-million third phase would  consist of a town square area, a 66,000-square-foot recreation center and the  start of a downtown park. No timetable was set for either phase.  </P> <P> City officials said they need the new facilities to cope with a city population  that has grown from 12,277 to 65,357 in the past decade, and is expected to  double again to about 125,000 by the year 2000. Palmdale's current City Hall,  library and related facilities were built in the 1970s.  </P> <P> The city's municipal work force, which expanded from about 182 to 270 employees  in the past four years, has already outgrown the current city buildings.  Earlier this year the city bought a nearby school building for office space and  set up several portable buildings on nearby land.  </P> <P> The new Civic Center project, in addition to displacing the houses and some  businesses, would require the demolition of the old county fire station and the  city's planning annex. But the current City Hall, library and Cultural Center  could be kept and used for other purposes.  </P> <P> City officials and consultants said the main reason for locating the planned  Civic Center on the same downtown site is to try to revitalize the decrepit  area, which is plagued by vacant lots, a run-down shopping center and old strip  commercial buildings.  </P> <P> "A Civic Center at this location has an excellent potential to create a real  Town Center for Palmdale -- both as a physical landmark, a gathering place for  the community, and a new mixed-use center of activity," said the consultants in  their report to the city.  </P> <P> The city owns about 11 of the 25 acres needed in the area bounded by Palmdale  Boulevard, Sierra Highway, 10th Street East and a line north of Avenue R.  Buying the remaining 14 acres is expected to cost about $8 million of the  $60-million total.  </P> <P> Thursday night's decision eliminated two alternative sites for the civic  center, which would have cost more, the consultants said. The Trakell Corp.,  developer of the auto mall now being built in Palmdale, had offered a nearby  site of 20 to 24 acres on 10th Street West for $9 million to $10 million.  Another private owner had offered a 25-acre site on Palmdale Boulevard at 5th  Street West for about $14 million.  </P></p>

The meeting voted on and adopted the "Hunan Provincial  Regulations on Enterprise Patents" and a series of draft  documents and name lists for the forthcoming second session of  the eighth provincial people's congress.    In accordance with proposals made by provincial Governor  Chen  Bangzhu, the meeting decided to remove Liu Huifang from the  office of director of the provincial textile industry department  and adopted other relevant personnel appointments and removals.    Yesterday's meeting was chaired by Liu Fusheng, chairman of  the provincial people's congress standing committee, and  attended by Dong Zhiwen, Shen Ruiting, Yu Haichao, Liu Yue, Zhu  Dongyang, Wu Yunchang, Zhao Peiyi, and Pan Jizhi, vice chairmen  of the provincial people's congress standing committee.    Wang Keying, provincial government executive vice governor;  Zhang Shuhai, provincial people's procuratorate chief  procurator; and other provincial leaders also attended the  meeting as non-voting delegates.    Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin attended  the  meeting at which he met with all of the members of the  provincial people's congress standing committee and delivered an  important speech in which he emphatically called on all comrades  concerned to acquire an in-depth understanding of the important  role played by the people's congress system in the country's  political life and urged people's congresses at all levels in  Hunan to fully understand the historical mission of local state  power organs in the new situation and actively carry out work by  seizing the initiative. At present, he stated, it is imperative  to concentrate on the following three work aspects: 1) To step  up local legislative work by focusing on economic legislation  with an eye on building a socialist market economic structure;  2) to strengthen supervision over law enforcement and government  work; 3) to build more competent people's congress organs and  raise people's congress work to a new level.    Secretary Wang Maolin maintained that in order to strengthen  supervision over law enforcement and government work, it is all  the more necessary to perfect the existing supervision  mechanism, clearly define key areas for supervision, and  intensify supervision work at all levels. Moreover, it is also  necessary to strengthen and improve CPC leadership over people's  congress work.</p>

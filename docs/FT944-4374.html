			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge to take Dollars 135m charge in quarter Phelps Dodge Corporation, one of the world's largest copper producers, said it would take a one-time pre-tax charge to fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 135m to reserve funds for environmental clean-ups and for losses related to closing unspecified operations. The charge, which on an after-tax basis will amount to about Dollars 87m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, was unexpected on Wall Street, where securities analysts had forecast the company's fourth-quarter earnings at about Dollars 1.34 a share. Phelps Dodge's share price closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 56 7/8 in New York. Of the total charge, Dollars 100m will go to environmental reserves. Including this amount, Phelps Dodge will have a year-end reserve for environmental matters of about Dollars 164m. The remaining Dollars 35m pre-tax charge will cover losses associated with shutting down unspecified operations before the year end. Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman, said: 'The operations being closed or sold are peripheral to our business and their disposition should not have any adverse effect on the company's future earnings.' He said the portion of the charge related to environmental matters represents the company's 'reasonable estimates for future environmental obligations'.</p>

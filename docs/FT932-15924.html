			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's anniversary ONE YEAR has passed since Mr John Major famously won the general election of April 9th 1992. It has not been a happy twelve months. The prime minister has lost authority. The Conservatives have split over the Maastricht treaty. Britain has endured a demoralising winter. Now, however, economic recovery is on the way and the Maastricht treaty may soon be ratified. The government has an opportunity to set its own agenda, rather than be driven by events. The prime minister has not been an innocent spectator. Over Europe, he has played a dreadful hand as well as might be expected. This is hardly true over the economy. Mr Major was chancellor of the exchequer when sterling was put into the ERM. His record as prime minister includes misjudgement of the recession; a huge deterioration of the public finances; vainglory about sterling's strength before September 16; the government's row with the Bundesbank over sterling's exit from the ERM; the subsequent failure to change the economic team; and a refusal to draw radical lessons from the debacle. On polling day last year the Financial Times ruminated about the 'dangers of perpetuating in power a weakened and uncertain Conservative party', a party whose manifesto, we said, was 'a job lot of ideas with little sense of drive or direction'. A year later the government's programme is as fragmented as ever. However, our view last April that the risks of a change to Labour was justified 'by a fine margin' has hardly been vindicated by that party's performance in opposition. No wonder the country feels gloomy. Lost authority In the next year, the two great areas of responsibility facing Mr Major are, as ever, Europe and the economy. On the first, his hope is to reunite his party around an agenda that promotes both enlargement of the community and decentralisation of its management. Other EC member states may be sufficiently chastened to pay him more attention than they did a year or two ago. On the economy, what is needed for sustained recovery is to use the gain in competitiveness from devaluation as a platform for long-term export-led growth. The most important precondition will be continued wage constraint. The government needs to articulate a long-term view of wages that goes well beyond the rough justice of its ceiling on public sector pay. It should, for example, announce a direct link between changes in interest rates and trends in wage settlements. Mr Major will also need to give strong support to Michael Portillo's radical review of public spending, which is an essential component of his effort to bring the public finances under control. He may well have to consider further tax increases as well. Any deflationary effects can and, if necessary, should be offset by lower short-term rates of interest. Bolder instincts An even more fundamental point is that throughout the UK political system, power is too centralised. This is bad in itself, but worse when it is also poorly exercised. The power of the Treasury is no longer commensurate with its reputation; the case for an independent Bank of England needs to be answered; and more open discussion of major policy options is needed. Advisory panels at the Treasury and on energy policy are a small step in the right direction, but British government still works on the assumption that the man in Whitehall knows best. It is no less important to think through the consequences for accountability and transparency as quangoes take over more governmental functions, particularly at the local level. On questions of governance, Mr Major has a taste for radical language - for example, proclaiming himself an apostle of open government, but his instincts are conservative; he needs to be bolder. In some other policy areas, education and training is the obvious example, he has inherited an avalanche of change, which needs to be more coherently presented and more effectively delivered. It is unrealistic perhaps to call for a fresh 'vision', but the UK does need a government with policies designed to last for years rather than months. In spite of his small majority, that is the least the prime minister must achieve.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A pathway through Europe  -In a Nutshell Confused by the wealth of health and safety legislation to come out of Brussels? Puzzled by the acronyms used to describe European Commission programmes to foster technology transfer or exports? A guide to the workings of the EC and the single market is provided by European Pathways, a booklet produced by the Bedfordshire County Council's economic development unit. Sections are devoted to the European framework of standards, testing and certification, to environmental policy and to British government and private-sector organisations which can help with exporting.

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OKLA. UNDECIDED ON CAGER'S ARREST  </P> <P> University of Oklahoma athletic officials said they have not yet decided what  action to take after basketball player Mookie Blaylock's arrest early Sunday  for alleged public intoxication. "We're in the process of determining the facts  and at this point we have not been able to do that," Athletic Director Donnie  Duncan said Sunday. "I think we'll be able to reach a decision sometime in the  morning (today)." Mike Prusinski, a spokesman for the basketball team, said  university offices were closed today because of a winter snowstorm that hit the  state. He was not sure how that would affect efforts to make a decision.  </P> <P> Blaylock, a starting guard on the No. 4 Oklahoma basketball team, was arrested  shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday and booked into Cleveland County Jail on a  municipal public drunkenness complaint, Police Sgt. Olan Nystrom said. He said  a convenience store employee called police to the store because Blaylock was  arguing with a female companion. Blaylock, 21, was released on bond and is  expected to appear next week in municipal court.  </P></p>

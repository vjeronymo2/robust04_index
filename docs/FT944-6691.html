			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / French talks on primary contest A joint group from France's ruling Gaullist RPR and Union for French Democracy (UDF) coalition parties is due later today to report on the feasibility of holding primary elections to select a single conservative candidate to contest next year's presidential elections, amid signs of falling public support for such a US-style innovation. According to a Sofres opinion poll, 65 per cent of French believe that the traditional first round vote, to be held next year on April 23, is sufficient to select the final two contestants - usually one from the right and one from the left - for the second-round vote on May 7. Proponents of primaries, notably Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, have argued that the fortnight between the two rounds is not long enough to heal the deep divisions within the right. But, seeing primaries mainly as a device to corral conservatives into backing prime minister Edouard Balladur from the outset, two of the prime minister's opponents, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who leads the UDF, and Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president who is backing Mr Jacques Chirac as the RPR candidate, have come out strongly against special early primaries.</p>

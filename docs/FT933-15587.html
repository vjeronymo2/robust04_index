			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Politicians on all sides court enduring Perot WASHINGTON politicians wish that they could close their eyes and make him disappear, but Mr Ross Perot shows no signs of obliging. Instead, both parties have set their best minds to work on devising strategies of enlisting support from the mercurial Texas billionaire and his rebellious supporters. Several Republican members of Congress have joined United We Stand, the supposedly non-political Perot organisation, and others are jostling for space on the same public platform with him. Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, the newly elected Republican senator for Texas, won Mr Perot's endorsement during her campaign - carefully disguised so as not to imperil the tax-free status of United We Stand - and some senior Republican leaders believe that Mr Perot could run for and win their party's presidential primaries in 1996. In a study of Perot voters published yesterday, the Democratic Leadership Council, which stands to the right of the Democratic political spectrum, argues that President Bill Clinton must find ways to win support beyond the 43 per cent of the electorate that voted for him last year. 'To expand his base, the president must go hunting where the ducks are. That means targeting the nearly 20m voters who backed Ross Perot in last year's election,' said Mr Al From, DLC president. The DLC study, conducted by the Greenberg Research polling organisation, warned that politicians and pundits have misunderstood Perot voters, who are often assumed to be principally concerned about the federal budget deficit, which was the subject of many of Mr Perot's advertising seminars last year and which lay at the heart of his campaign message. Mr Stanley Greenberg, the pollster, notes that three quarters of last year's Perot voters do not mention the deficit first or second among their greatest worries, instead listing the economy, healthcare and jobs as their primary concerns. 'What the deficit represents to Perot voters is a massive act of irresponsibility on the part of the leadership of this country,' Mr Greenberg says. Another recent poll conducted for Time/CNN showed that, given a choice between cutting the budget deficit and stimulating the economy, 58 per cent of Perot voters favoured the latter. The DLC argues that the message of these polls is that Mr Clinton needs to concentrate on centrist, 'New Democrat' policies to revive the economy, reinvent government, spend government money with discipline and avoid capture by the Washington establishment. Mr Greenberg's soundings show, however, that the Perot factor is here to stay. Perot voters have not aligned with either of the two traditional parties since the election. In a three-way race against Mr Clinton and a Republican candidate such as Senator Bob Dole or Mr Jack Kemp, three-quarters of last year's Perot voters would once again vote for Mr Perot, once again allowing Mr Clinton to win with fewer than 50 per cent of the votes. Should the Texas populist join the Republicans, the 1996 election would tighten to a heat, with 47 per cent for Mr Perot and 46 per cent for Mr Clinton. While Mr Greenberg cautions that this result is artificial, he says it shows the durability of Mr Perot's appeal: 72 per cent of Perot voters who describe themselves as Democratic-leaning would, nevertheless, join the Texan on a voyage to the Republicans.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Packer stake in Fairfax 'welcome' Mr Conrad Black said yesterday that Mr Kerry Packer was 'a welcome shareholder' in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which Mr Black has a 15 per cent stake, held through The Telegraph. Last week Mr Packer doubled his stake in Fairfax to 10 per cent, raising speculation of a takeover battle between the two. Mr Black said that he was 'optimistic' that he would get government approval next week to increase his interest in Fairfax to 25 per cent. He said Mr Packer's move was in line with what he had told Mr Black he would do beforehand, and 'there is nothing sinister in it at all. We see him as an ally'.</p>

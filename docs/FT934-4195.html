			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / After 45 years, the band still plays on: Echoes from another era Recall, or imagine, 1948. The year of the Berlin airlift. Mao Zedong was sweeping through China. There was a great fog in Britain. A notice was pinned to the railings of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth of Prince Charles. And Albert Yeoh joined a band. Albert has been tickling the ivories at the venerable old Eastern and Oriental Hotel in Penang, Malaysia, ever since. Only a very rare night off. Never missed a Christmas or New Year. Albert and his band are probably the most enduring musical group east of Suez. Albert is now a slim and trim 65-year-old, without a grey hair on his head. 'We pride ourselves on our repertoire. We can play virtually every tune there is,' he says. 'The girls can sing in various languages - from Finnish to Korean, Polish to Malay.' The 'girls' are Albert's wife, Nancy, and her old school friend, Daisy Chua. They have been with the band at the Eastern and Oriental - known as 'the E&amp;O' to generations of Asia travellers - for more than 20 years. In their sequined dresses, they look like a million dollars. They harmonise their way through My Wild Irish Rose and follow it with When Irish Eyes are Smiling. Nancy and Daisy would have the hands clapping and the tears flowing in many a lounge bar back home. A group of Japanese businessmen asks for some obscure favourite from Hokkaido. No problem. Nancy whispers her way faultlessly through the song. Then, with infinite grace, she persuades two of the Japanese on to the stage. They croon, rather unsteadily, with her. The audience - some diners and a larger crowd of well-behaved drinkers - love it. Listen carefully and you can still hear the echoes of another age at the E&amp;O. Rubber planters in town for a bit of light relief, laughing uproariously at jokes, slapping sun-tanned thighs and becoming a trifle squiffy. Colonial officers with their sternly-brushed hair and crumpled white suits, their canes tapping along the tiled floor. The front of the hotel faces Georgetown, old Penang town. The back looks on to the Straits of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. When the E&amp;O opened in the 1880s, it boasted the longest sea front of any hotel in the world - 842ft of it. Kipling, Maugham and Coward, sensible travellers that they were, all 'put up' at the E&amp;O at one time or another. 'We used to play all night in the old days,' says Albert. 'There would be St George's night, St Patrick's - all of them. We'd play the Dashing White Sergeant, reels and jigs. And people were always dressed in their best. Back then, the E&amp;O was the only place to be.' It is not much different at Christmas and New Year these days. While there are few sartorial rules, people still turn up in their dickie bows and feather boas. The doors of the old ballroom are flung open and the overhead fans whirr into action. 'Now, the other hotels in Penang bring in big artists from overseas,' says Nancy. 'But we have our faithful audience who like our music and style.' Nancy and Daisy glide effortlessly through a medley which ranges from the swaying palms of Harry Belafonte to Maurice Chevalier's little girls and little boys and ends bobbing in a rickshaw through the World of Suzie Wong. The Sarkies brothers, Martin, Tigran and Arshak, built the E&amp;O. Handsome devils, with moustaches that could gauge wind directions, they were Armenian Jews who travelled east in the middle of the last century. They built up a formidable hotel empire which included the Strand Palace in Rangoon, the Raffles in Singapore and the E&amp;O. The second world war, with Japanese troops filing through the three great hotels, dealt a fatal blow to the Sarkies although Arshak - who is remembered for dancing round with a glass of whisky soda balanced on his bald head at the 1924 St George's day ball - had by then fallen on hard times. 'Arshak Sarkies,' says a Who's Who of the time, 'has taken a keen interest in racing.' Too keen, it seems. All the Sarkies' money was frittered away on the horses. Nowadays, the Strand Palace is looking very down at heel. At the other extreme, the Raffles has been turned into an expensive modern parody of its original self. Only the E&amp;O evokes the original Sarkies' spirit, fustiness and all. Albert, Nancy and Daisy are having a little break and chatting with the audience. All seem to be old friends. Brother Augustus, a blind half-Portuguese, half-Chinese priest, comes in. The circle is widened. 'Now Brother Augustus,' says Nancy 'You must give us a song.' Brother Augustus obliges. Albert tickles his piano. Nancy and Daisy lead the applause. The atmosphere is as fresh as it was when Albert played his first night at the E&amp;O, more than over 45 years ago.</p>

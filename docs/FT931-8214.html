			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Australian government-union deal Australia's Labor government announced a wages deal with the unions yesterday that is designed to create 500,000 jobs over three years, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. It was dismissed, however, by Mr John Hewson, leader of the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition, and challenger in next month's federal election. 'They have had six accords so far, and all that has done is create 1m unemployed,' he said. The accord is intended to speed up the decentralisation of Australia's wage bargaining system by ensuring that most negotiations are based on productivity at plant level.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities boil over as account closes SPECULATION that the turmoil in ERM currencies will swiftly lead to interest rate cuts throughout the EC continued to drive UK shares ahead yesterday before the equity market boiled over at mid-session as the end of the trading account brought out the profit-takers. Although the FT-SE Index was only 8.9 points up at 2,926.5 at the close, after showing a gain of 21.9 earlier, there was no relaxation of the nervous tensions of the previous session. It was a day of rumours, counter-rumours and denials, mostly from currency traders, and London equity dealers went home asking themselves whether the French franc - 'or the ERM' - would survive the weekend. In the gilt-edged market, long dates added about  1/2 a point, with the shorts up about  5/32 . The Bank of England announced the issue of a further Pounds 1.3bn of existing bonds. After opening quietly, shares moved strongly ahead on widespread demand from home and abroad, stimulated by rumours, soon denied, that the Bundesbank was holding a 'special meeting to cut German rates'. The drive forward again came from stock index futures where the September contract reached a 20-point premium to trade above the existing peak of the underling cash market. However, the Footsie topped out yesterday at 2,939.5, still 17.8 below the closing peak of March 8. The second half of the session saw both futures and share prices come back smartly. Last night, the Footsie showed a gain of around 3.3 per cent over the two-week equity account, accounted for entirely by this week's advance of 98.8 points as currency developments were translated into expectations of interest rate cuts. The excitement also fuelled gains in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, up 33.5 to a new peak of 3,306.5 yesterday. The Mid 250 has risen by 103.6 points this week, making a gain of 2.8 per cent over the trading account. Seaq volume, swollen by profit-taking, jumped to 763.4m shares from 692m on Thursday when retail or customer worth rose to Pounds 1.7bn. Some dealers sounded warning bells when the market turned off so quickly yesterday. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett commented that the interest rate cut apparently already factored into the market was 'essential' if the Footsie was to reach his 3,000 target for this year.</p>

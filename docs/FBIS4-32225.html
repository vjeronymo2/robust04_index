			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ozren Jorganovic, Zoran Gurgurevic, and Predrag </F> Curkovic from the Ozren, Teslic, and Vlasic battlefields]    [Excerpt] [Jorganovic] Muslims have been launching fierce  attacks with strong artillery support, targeting Serb positions  in Lokve on the southern part of the Vozuca front, and Jugovac  and Glavica on the eastern part of the same front. However,  Vozuca's legendary defenders have successfully stopped the  attacks from the direction of Banovici, forcing the Islamic  forces to withdraw.    [Grgurevic] Muslims are also constantly attacking along the  Teslic front and shelling the town center of Teslic and  residential areas in the suburbs. Major material damage has  been caused by the shelling. Muslim forces have been regrouping  from the direction of Gracanica and Tuzla on the Trebava part of  the front, east of Doboj. Military experts expect a fresh attack  from this direction. [passage omitted]</p>

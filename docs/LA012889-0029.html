			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. BERMAN INTRODUCES BILL TO OUTLAW SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS  </P> <P> Aiming to prevent a recurrence of incidents like the Stockton schoolyard  shooting, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) introduced legislation Friday  to outlaw the possession of semiautomatic firearms.  </P> <P> The measure would cover weapons like the AK-47 assault rifle used to kill five  children and wound 30 other people in the Stockton attack Jan. 17, as well as  banning all semiautomatic pistols and shotguns.  </P> <P> Berman's bill is much more rigorous than a measure proposed Tuesday by Sen.  Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), which would ban the importation or sale of new  semiautomatic assault weapons like the AK-47.  </P> <P> Berman, in a press statement announcing his proposal, criticized the Metzenbaum  bill as inadequate because it would leave "thousands upon thousands of these  weapons available for criminal use."  </P> <P> The Stockton slayings have focused increased attention on gun control  legislation in this session of Congress.  </P> <P> The National Rifle Assn., which plans to mount a strong lobbying campaign  against the measures, called Berman's plan a "stupid piece of legislation." The  NRA contends that such measures punish only law-abiding gun owners and that  semiautomatic weapons have legitimate uses in hunting.  </P></p>

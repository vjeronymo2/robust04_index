			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ii. A credit union using the average daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $400 minimum average daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account as long as the member maintained a daily balance of $500 for at least half of the days in the period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. A credit union using either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to calculate dividends that requires: (A) a $500 daily balance; or (B) a $400 average daily balance to pay dividends on the account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Paying on full balance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions must pay dividends on the full balance in the account that meets the required minimum balance. For example, if $300 is the minimum daily balance required to earn dividends, and a member deposits $500, the credit union must pay the stated dividend rate on the full $500 and not just on the $200. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Negative balances prohibited.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The daily or average daily balance on which dividends will be paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met. (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit unions from using negative balances in calculating the dividends figure for the annual percentage yield earned.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Club accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions offering club accounts (such as a ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club accounts) cannot impose a minimum balance requirement for dividends based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the credit union cannot set a $500 minimum balance and then pay only if the member makes all 50 payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum balances not affecting dividends.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum balance requirements not involving the payment of dividends_such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Compounding and Crediting Policies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions choosing to compound dividends may compound or credit dividends annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Withdrawals prior to crediting date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If members withdraw funds (without closing the account), prior to a scheduled crediting date, credit unions may delay paying the accrued dividends on the withdrawn amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying dividends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Closed accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Subject to state or other law, a credit union may choose not to pay accrued dividends if members close an account prior to the date accrued dividends are credited, as long as the credit union has disclosed that fact. If accrued dividends are paid, accrued dividends must be paid on funds up until the account is closed or the account is deemed closed. For example, if an account is closed on a Tuesday, accrued dividends on the funds through Monday would be paid. Whether (and the conditions under which) credit unions are permitted to deem an account closed by a member is determined by state or other law, if any. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until certain time periods are extinguished. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Art. III, &sect;3 (members have at least 6 months to replenish membership share before membership can terminate and the account is deemed closed). Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Date Dividends Begin to Accrue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Relation to Regulation CC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine, for example, when a deposit is considered made for purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid on funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Ledger and collected balances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions may calculate dividends by using a ``ledger'' balance or ``collected'' balance method, as long as the crediting requirements of the EFAA are met (12 CFR 229.14). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Withdrawal or principal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions must accrue dividends on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a check is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the credit union must accrue dividends on those funds through Monday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.8_Advertising <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All advertisements are subject to the rule against misleading or inaccurate advertisements, even though the disclosure applicable to various media differ. The word ``profit'' may be used when referring to dividend-bearing share accounts, as it reflects the nature of dividends. The word ``profit'' may not be used when referring to interest-bearing deposit accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Indoor signs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual percentage yield. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. For a term share account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised annual percentage yield. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> ``Free'' or ``no cost'' accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as ``free'' or ``no cost,'' maintenance and activity fees include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: A fine madness at t'mill - Lucia van der Post describes how a part of Scotland's heritage was rescued 'YOU MUST be mad,' said Annabel Stapleton when husband David told her of his latest notion - he had discovered that Hunters of Brora, an old-established Scottish mill, was in receivership and he was proposing to rescue it. You can see her point of view. They lived in Cumbria, north-west England; the mill was in Brora, a remote corner of eastern Sutherland about halfway between Inverness and John o' Groats. Besides which, he was not in need of employment. In Hong Kong, he had launched - and guided to great success - WI Carr Overseas, a stockbroking company. In the 1970s he had bought Pinneys, a small smoked-fish business, for about Pounds 20,000 and turned it into a multi-million pound concern which he sold to Hillsdown Holdings in the '80s. In Cumbria, he was running a small partnership looking after the wealth of private individuals as well as helping to tend Annabel's family's loss-making estate. David Stapleton could be said to have done his bit in life. But, as he puts it: Hunters of Brora was special. It is the last fully-integrated woollen mill in the Highlands. If it goes, a whole tradition and way of life goes with it as well as the the livelihoods of most of the village. 'To anybody in the hunting, fishing and shooting world, Hunters' tweeds and cloths are legendary. Old man Hunter, who started it in 1901, used to buy something like 80 per cent of the Shetland wool crop which he spun into yarn and then sold back to the crofters who, in the long, dark days of winter, turned the yarn into jumpers and the like. The tweeds and cloths are known throughout the world and used by people as different as Daks-Simpson, Burberrys, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Junko Shimada in Japan. 'I discovered it was in receivership by chance when I went there to buy some of our estate tweed. I couldn't resist the temptation to try to save it. I put together a consortium of five shareholders, all with different interests and abilities, and, after a lot of horse-trading and appeals to the Highlands &amp; Islands Development Board, the Highland Regional Council and anybody else with a 'soft-touch' cheque-book, we eventually bought everything for Pounds 89,000. It was a bargain and meant we could put almost all the money we had raised (about Pounds 900,000) into developing the business. ' Hunters' strength is its range of colours. It is a designers' paradise. Piled high in the sheds are some 1,600 colours, often up to seven colours in a single yarn, and an historic archive of literally hundreds of different designs and patterns. 'Above all,' as Stapleton puts it, 'we have a story and a history and people respond to that. But Brora is a little village nearer to Reykjavik than London. Few people come to it. We had to take Brora to the people.' So, they started a mail-order catalogue and, at the same time, improved their little shop in Brora, widening the product range to add things like Fair Isle and cashmere jumpers, rugs, country jackets, scarves and gloves as well as the yarn and tweed the business used to sell. Profits from the shop and mail-order side went up five times - from Pounds 42,000 in 1990 to Pounds 217,000 in 1991. More expansion is going to come from a range of furnishing fabrics and floor coverings which they have asked Annie Stewart of Anta (see story below) to develop for them. The mood of the day is with them; in interior design circles, tartans, plaids and the Scottish look are all the rage - besides which, the sturdy floor coverings at between Pounds 19 and Pounds 25 a metre are a bargain in today's world. At the moment, Hunters also is looking for agents in every county to sell things like the country jackets, the rugs and the furnishing fabrics from their own homes. And it has just had the largest order in the mill's history: 7 1/2 miles (12 km) of plaid fabrics for curtains, floor and wall coverings for the new Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh. Everyone is excited about that. 'We've got through our first year,' says Stapleton. 'We have broken even. If we can get Pounds 3m worth of sales - which the mill used to do easily between 1980 and 1988 - then we have a viable business on our hands. But if this mill closes, there is hardly a family in Brora that won't be affected. 'People say to me, are we going to do another Pinneys? We are not. This company will never be for sale. We are going to cherish it and make it work.' The mail-order catalogue is available free from Hunters of Brora, Brora, Sutherland KW9 6NA, Scotland (tel: 0408-621-366). Cashmere jumpers (in six colours, V-necked, round-necked and cardigans) are all Pounds 99. Tartan rugs, 5 ft by 6 ft in the Big Seven tartans and muted colours, are all Pounds 39 each. Country jackets are Pounds 325 each. Shooting or country stockings are Pounds 29.50 a pair. Estate tweeds (Hunters weaves well over 100 different estate tweeds already) can be made to special order; the minimum order is 60 metres. Samples can be sent of the four different flat-weave plaid floor coverings (36, 48 and 60 ins wide at Pounds 19, Pounds 21 and Pounds 25 a metre respectively) as well as the range of furnishing fabrics.</p>

The atrocities committed in former Yugoslavia are likely to be  discussed at length during this six-week session. The 53  participating countries will also consider the human rights  situation in Burma, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A priority  concern will also be the right to development and women's rights.    The Commission began by electing its new president, Pieter  van Wulfften Palthe, a Dutch diplomat and lawyer. Ibrahim Fall,  director of the human rights center, denounced the enduring  violations of human rights. He nevertherless welcomed some  progress that has been made in the fight against these  shortcomings, and he mentioned in particular the appointment in  the near future of a United Nations high commissioner for human  rights.  <H5>  Progress As Well </H5>   The decision to create such a post was taken at the World  Conference in Vienna in August 1993. The high commissioner will  be Ecuadorean Ambassador to the UN Jose Ayala Lasso, whose  appointment is to be officially announced within the next few  days by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.    Over these last twelve months, a number of complex  situations  have been resolved, declared Mr. Fall. This should lead to  substantial improvements in human rights. The agreements  between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the political  developments in South Africa, and the founding of a court of  justice to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia are  all examples of this progress.    Mr. Fall also considered that the appointment of a special  rapporteur on women's questions will help guarantee women's  rights. He also stressed the importance of the right to  development and regretted the insufficient attention so far paid  to social, economic, and cultural rights.  <H5>  Lack of Money </H5>   According to Gerhard Baum, former German interior minister,  Western countries are going to press for the condemnation of  China. China has always succeeded in preventing any resolution  regarding itself from being adopted. Mr. Baum called for more  financial resources for the human rights center. He felt it was  unable to acquit itself of its tasks with the resources that are  currently at its disposal.    On the Commission's agenda are Tuesday's visit by PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat, together with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. On  Wednesday, the former Federal Council member Rene Felber will  submit his report on the human rights situation in the Israeli  occupied territories. Shim'on Peres, Israeli foreign minister,  will be addressing the Commission on 10 February.</p>

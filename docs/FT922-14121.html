			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Powell pledge on US troops for Europe GENERAL Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday pledged a continuing US military commitment to Europe but told Europeans they would have to make it clear they wanted US troops to remain, writes David White. US congressional support for the forces also depended on allies' willingness to take a 'more equitable' share of the defence burden and back US operations outside the Nato area, he warned. Speaking at the annual Alastair Buchan Memorial Lecture at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, he said: 'We are definitely here to stay.' Despite a debate in the US on the size of its forces in Europe - due to be halved to 150,000  - there was no disagreement on the need for a 'forward presence'.</p>

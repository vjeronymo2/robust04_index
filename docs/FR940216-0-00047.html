			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Provisions for the Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In lieu of the renewable oxygenate proposal, EPA investigated a number of options aimed at making the program more workable by reducing the fuel tracking, recordkeeping, and enforcement burden associated with the proposal. While such options tended to make the program more workable from the standpoint of the refining and fuel distribution processes, they also tended to either reduce the assurance that the environmental benefits of the program would be achieved in all areas covered by the RFG program, or to place additional restrictions on the flexibility contained in the proposal for blending ethanol into gasoline. Given this and the other concerns with the proposal (cost, lack of energy benefits, significant environmental loss, etc.), EPA did not believe these options to be appropriate or justifiable either under the provisions of section 211(k) of the Act. The reader is referred to the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for a detailed discussion of the renewable oxygenate program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters suggested alternative provisions (1.0 psi RVP waiver for ethanol blends, inclusion of ozone reactivity in the standard setting process, mandates for refiners to provide clear gasoline blendstock for downstream blending with ethanol, etc.) to the proposed renewable oxygenate program to allow ethanol to play a larger role in the reformulated gasoline program. It was argued that without such provisions ethanol would be excluded from the market entirely in direct conflict with the intent of Congress in the CAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA, however, does not agree that ethanol is excluded from competing in the reformulated gasoline marketplace under the provisions of the April 16, 1992 proposal. In fact, as under the recently implemented wintertime oxygenated fuels program, ethanol is expected to significantly increase its market share under the reformulated gasoline program, especially in Midwestern areas where ethanol enjoys State tax incentives and relatively low distribution costs. In addition, not only is ethanol expected to compete as an alcohol, but it also may compete with methanol as an ether feedstock in the future. As a result, EPA believes that the treatment of ethanol blends under the April 16, 1992 proposal is entirely consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 211(k) of the CAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alternative provisions (1.0 psi RVP waiver for ethanol blends, inclusion of ozone reactivity in the standard setting process, mandates for refiners to provide clear gasoline blendstock for downstream blending with ethanol, etc.) suggested by various commenters to further enhance the competitiveness of ethanol in the reformulated gasoline program are not appropriate. These provisions are both outside of EPA's legal authority under the CAA, and indefensible from an environmental and scientific standpoint. The 1.0 psi waiver for example, could easily forfeit all VOC emission reductions otherwise achieved by the reformulated gasoline program. A move away from the mass based standards of the Act to reactivity based standards is not only unsupportable on the basis of the available scientific information, but even if EPA were able to do so, it would be unlikely to provide any significant advantage for ethanol blends. As discussed in section I of the RIA, the recent urban airshed modeling studies claiming that ethanol blends with a 1.0 psi waiver do not increase ozone relative to an MTBE blended reformulated gasoline are frought with invalid assumptions and inconsistencies and are not applicable to the reformulated gasoline situation. As a result, they provide no credible scientific support for special provisions for ethanol in the context of the reformulated gasoline program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the lack of justification for the renewable oxygenate provisions of the February 26, 1993 proposal, the options considered for simplifying that proposal, and other alternative provisions recommended by commenters, EPA is, thus, basing the oxygenate-related provisions of the final rule on the provisions as proposed in the April 16, 1992 proposal. Despite this decision, EPA still believes ethanol will be able to compete favorably in the reformulated gasoline market either as a direct additive or as an ether feedstock as discussed above. As such, EPA believes that the nationwide production of ethanol will increase as a result of this rulemaking with corresponding benefits to our Nation's agricultural sector. However, the increase may not be as large as it otherwise would have been had an incentive program been promulgated for ethanol. The reader is referred to section I. of the RIA for additional description of the comments and information which led up to this decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

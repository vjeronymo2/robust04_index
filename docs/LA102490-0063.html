			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IGWEBUIKE LINKED TO DRUG CASE;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: VIKING KICKER REPORTEDLY IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ALLEGED  INVOLVEMENT WITH HEROIN SMUGGLING.  </P> <P> Minnesota Viking kicker Donald Igwebuike is being investigated in connection  with drug-smuggling allegations, ABC News reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> ABC reported that the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa, Fla., has "irrefutable  evidence" linking Igwebuike to an attempt to smuggle heroin into the United  States from his native Nigeria.  </P> <P> His name surfaced about two weeks ago when a Nigerian was arrested by customs  agents at the Orlando, Fla., Airport, ABC said. The Nigerian, a school teacher,  had 31 small bags of heroin in his stomach, authorities said.  </P> <P> The ABC report quoted law enforcement officials as saying that Igwebuike bought  the alleged drug courier's ticket and participated in phone conversations that  indicated he was aware of the deal.  </P> <P> Igwebuike worked out with the Vikings at their Eden Prairie practice facility  Tuesday. ABC said he confirmed that he was the subject of an investigation, but  wouldn't answer specific questions. Igwebuike told the reporter to talk to his  attorney.  </P> <P> In a statement released by the Vikings, Igwebuike's attorney, Larry E. Reed,  said he had listened to a recording of a telephone conversation between his  client and the Nigerian teacher.  </P> <P> "It was in the Nigerian language. I had it translated and there was no mention  of drugs on the tape. I saw all the documents. I saw all the evidence and there  is nothing to connect Donald to the case," Reed said. Reed did not respond to  messages to call the Associated Press for further comment.  </P> <P> U.S. Customs officials obtained a search warrant Tuesday for Igwebuike's  apartment in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, ABC said. Igwebuike, 29,  spent five years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the Vikings signed him  this season.  </P> <P> "We have not been contacted by federal authorities. We have talked with Donald  Igwebuike and his attorney about the matter. We have contacted the National  Football League and they are looking into the allegations," the Vikings said in  a prepared statement Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> The Vikings said any decisions on Igwebuike's playing status would be made by  the NFL.  </P></p>

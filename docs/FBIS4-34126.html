			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- It was officially reported  today that less than one year after self-employment was  authorized, more than 48,000 Havana residents are self-employed  in the 135 activities that Cuban authorities approved, while  4,000 requests have been denied.    The Labor Directorate of the city of Havana stated several  of  the categories included in Decree Law 141 approved in September  1993 are currently frozen in the capital.    The directorate stated the rejections registered until the  end of May were basically issued because the requests did not  fulfill the requirements established by the Provincial  Administration Council, which is in charge of this activity, and  due to the bad social conduct of those making the requests.    Driver for hire, preparer of light foods, gatherer-seller of  agricultural products, and video operator are among the  positions for which no new permits are being granted, although  those who initially obtained licenses maintain permits to offer  those services.    The license for producer-sellers of flowers was withdrawn.    According to the explanations by Provincial Labor Director  Manuel Fernandez, in all cases the decision was made in order to  preserve the state's interests and avoid harming the national  economy.</p>

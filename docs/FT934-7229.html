			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline easier Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham fell sharply after US brokerage Wertheim Schroder published a critical piece of research on the company which contained a 'strong sell' recommendation. Analyst Dr Jonathan Gelles said: 'I think the main concern we have is a judgment that the consensus forecasts for the portfolio of new products are unachievable. We are particularly concerned about the company's anti-arthritic drug, Relafen.' Dr Gelles cut his pre-tax forecast for 1994 by about Pounds 90m to Pounds 1,110m and slashed his earnings per share estimate by 5 per cent to 26.9p. He believes SmithKline 'A' shares could fall to 330p. The 'A' shares fell 22 at worst but marketmakers said another US house, Alex Brown, had issued a buy note and the stock recovered to close 9 lower at 402p on good turnover of 6.4m shares. The weakness affected other leading pharmaceuticals sector stocks. Glaxo fell 8 to 643p and Wellcome shed 16 to 633. Hanson avoided the weakness within the market, closing marginally firmer at 281p. TSB dropped to 214p, depressed by one marketmaker cutting what was viewed around the market as a bad book in the stock, but later stabilised to close 4 1/2 off at 215p on heavy turnover of 215p after another broking house moved in to pick up what is said was cheap stock. Some big switching out of HSBC 75p stock into the HSBC Dollars 10 stock saw the 75p's close 5 higher at 738p on 5.7m and the HKDollars 10's settle 6 firmer at 749p on 3.2m. The market was said to have been dismayed with new business figures released by Prudential whose shares fell 6 to 332p A fresh bout of straight selling pressure and switching operations, triggered by last week's disappointing third quarter figures left General Accident a further 10 off at 661p. Commercial Union were on the buy side of the switch but nevertheless closed 8 off at 597p after turnover of 1.6m. News that British Gas would make an important market announcement at 12.30pm yesterday triggered a nervous 45 minutes for dealers in the company's shares. In the event the news, detailing the sale of Gas's 85 per cent stake in Consumers Gas of Toronto and other interests in Alberta, for around Pounds 615m, prompted signs of relief around the City's trading desks but no real action in the shares. They settled a further 3 1/2 off at 321 1/2 p after unremarkable turnover of 7.9m shares. The fall in the stock was attributed, according to energy specialist, to a follow-through of selling after Gas's disappointing figures released on Thursday. The Canadian sale was described by one analyst as 'a strategic u-turn.' Container group Tiphook rose 19 to 63p after announcing that it had agreed outline terms for the cash sale of its core container division to Transamerica Corp. The proposed purchase price is Pounds 830m less associated debt, which will not exceed Pounds 119m to be assumed by Transamerica. Plans for new ownership rules are expected to be unveiled soon, which could lead to a bout of takeovers among ITV network broadcasters. The department of Heritage disappointed those who had hoped for an announcement yesterday on media ownership rules. However Anglia Television rose 8 to 429p, LWT (Holdings) 4 to 503p, and Central Independent Television 27 to 2085p. Carlton Communications improved 5 to 760p. The flotation of Gartmore, the investment management group and one of the leading fund managers in the UK, proved a disappointment. The shares, offered and placed at 168p, slipped back in early trading but later rallied to close at 170p on 11m shares. Ross Group, importer and manufacturer of electrical and electronic products, slumped 6 to 16p after announcing that trading conditions last month were worse than expected. Office furniture distributor Black Arrow fell 8 to 31p after announcing interim profits of only Pounds 346,000 down from Pounds 1.55m last time and a halved dividend of 0.5p.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN, 29, CHARGED IN DEATHS OF 2 WOMEN  </P> <P> A man was charged Friday with murdering his ex-girlfriend and her sister and  attempting to murder another man during a shooting rampage Wednesday in  Sepulveda.  </P> <P> Dean Roger McGrath, 29, could face the death penalty because the early morning  attack involved multiple victims, one of several special circumstances that  warrant a death sentence, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> His arraignment on two charges of first-degree murder and on one charge of  attempted murder, scheduled for Friday, was delayed to July 20 in San Fernando  Municipal Court.  </P> <P> McGrath was arrested about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday in a North Hollywood house where  he was known to have stayed, Detective Michael Brandt said. About 12 hours  earlier, McGrath allegedly fired a shotgun at sisters Marleene Evelyn Taylor,  32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30, inside the small, two-bedroom house where  they lived with Taylor's two sons. The boys, ages 2 and 4, were not hurt.  </P> <P> McGrath also allegedly shot Anthony Deluca, 28, as he ran from the house  calling for help. Deluca is recovering at an undisclosed hospital in the Valley  and is expected to testify against McGrath at a preliminary hearing, Brandt  said.  </P> <P> Police had not determined the relationships between McGrath and the victims,  but said the motive stemmed from a domestic dispute.  </P></p>

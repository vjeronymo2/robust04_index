			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO LEADERS SHOULD DECIDE WHO HAS CLAIM TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: BEER AND CIGARETTE MAKERS GIVE BIG BUCKS TO GROUPS THAT SHILL FOR THEM.  THE COMMUNITY WILL PAY A COST LATER.  </P> <P> The next time you attend a Cinco de Mayo ceremony, or practically any other  public Latino celebration, don't be surprised if you think you've stumbled onto  a beer convention. You're likely to see as many banners promoting Bud, Miller  Lite, Corona and who knows what other brew as you are to see the Mexican or  Puerto Rican flag.  </P> <P> Those banners symbolize how Latino organizations have allowed themselves to be  used by major beer and tobacco companies in exchange for corporate donations.  Earlier this month, a controversial new report on the negative effects this  alliance of convenience may have in the Latino community -- where alcohol abuse  has long been a neglected problem -- revived the debate over whether groups  like the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Council of  La Raza should take money from companies like Coors and Phillip Morris. But  don't expect things to change any time soon.  </P> <P> Among the charges made in "Marketing Disease to Hispanics" a 100-page report  published by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, is  that increased advertising in Spanish by cigarette companies may contribute to  an increase in lung cancer among Latinas. The report also restates the many  grim statistics that illustrate how prevalent alcohol abuse is among Latino  males.  </P> <P> The authors of the report would prefer that Latino groups stop accepting  financial aid from brewery and tobacco companies, but they acknowledge it won't  be easy. They estimate Latino groups get at least $1 million a year, and  probably more, from alcohol and tobacco companies.  </P> <P> Like other self-help organizations that once looked to the government for  support, Latino groups now have to get money wherever they can find it. For  that, we can thank the Reagan Administration's penny-pinching on social  programs, a policy President Bush seems unlikely to change any time soon. So  the ties between Latino groups and liquor and tobacco companies are likely to  grow stronger.  </P> <P> But if it's naive to expect Latino groups to give up money they get from  Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris and the like, that still doesn't mean they should  surrender themselves to their corporate benefactors. And some of the activities  documented in the report do seem to reflect an almost ingenuous attitude on the  part of Latino leaders.  </P> <P> For example, is it really necessary for leaders of important national  organizations like the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to be photographed  holding cans and bottles of Miller beer? That may get them more donations from  Philip Morris, Miller's parent company, but it doesn't enhance the serious and  (dare I add) sober image Latino business leaders should be trying to project.  </P> <P> Then there was the agreement that several Latino organizations negotiated with  Coors a few years ago that linked company donations to increased consumption of  its beer by Latinos. Many people criticized that pact when it was signed,  although it seems to have worked for both sides. Latinos continue to imbibe  Coors, and the company continues to donate about $500,000 a year to Latino  causes. But with the growth in Latino population and buying power, their  consumption of Coors would probably have gone up anyway. So why did otherwise  respected Latino leaders have to become shills by seeming to declare Coors the  "official" Latino beer?  </P> <P> Again, given the financial realities, this new report is not likely to get any  Latino group to change its policy on outside donations. But maybe it will prod  large national organizations like LULAC, the La Raza council and the GI Forum  to put more money into programs designed to deal with Latino health issues --  not just old problems like alcohol abuse, but frightening new ones like AIDS.  </P> <P> As of now, only one major Latino organization deals strictly with health  issues, the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services  Organizations. Although it it has accepted small grants from tobacco and liquor  companies in the past, its officers recently decided that they will no longer  do so. One good way to make up the predictable budget shortfall would be for  every Latino group that does accept money from a beer or cigarette company to  set aside some funds for the health coalition.  </P> <P> And if that's asking too much, here's a more modest proposal for Latino  leaders: stop pimping booze and smokes. The leadership positions they hold --  not to mention their own dignity -- demands at least that much of them.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / The Guiness affair sinks from high drama to a low whimper: Ward's acquittal marks the end of a scandal that has already passed into folklore WITH THE acquittal of Mr Thomas Ward yesterday in the third Guinness trial the curtain has finally fallen on the City's most celebrated financial scandal of recent years. Some pieces of unfinished business remain - most notably publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair. The report - reputed to be a distinctly hard-hitting document - is expected to be released soon and could still have the potential to inflict both embarrassment and damage in some quarters. However, the story of corporate corruption that excited unprecedented public interest and traumatised the City has become a piece of history. The end of the Guinness affair looked as though it would be reached with more of a whimper than a bang. The delay in bringing Mr Ward to trial - mainly because of his fight against extradition from the US - meant the legal proceedings already had a feel of being long past their sell-by date. When it began, the trial seemed a dull affair compared with the theatrical spectacle of the first Guinness trial, which ended with the high-profile jailing of Mr Ernest Saunders and others. The determination of the judge to ensure there was no risk of the trial becoming a Blue Arrow-style disaster, where the scale and complexity of the trial led to an unprecedented legal debacle, the case was confined to the very barest of essentials. The charge against Mr Ward was a fairly straightforward one: of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, almost a 'smash-and-grab job' committed after the bid. Now that the third Guinness trial has resulted in acquittal, the final outcome - four convictions from seven attempted prosecutions - has to be seen as a very mixed success for the Serious Fraud Office for whom the Guinness affair was its first big task. Yet the Guinness saga will continue to be a critical reference point in debates on policing the City, the nature of so-called 'victimless crime' and the problems of corporate governance. For many practitioners the lessons from the Guinness have long since been learnt. A City lawyer said: 'People have learnt share support is wrong, that rules are there to be kept and that reputation is no protection against prosecution. But to most people the Guinness saga ended when Mr Ernest Saunders went to jail. It remains a warning against gung-ho behaviour, but people have long since moved on.' The first trial, ending with the convictions of all four defendants, was unquestionably a great success for the SFO and seemed to be a demonstration of how large fraud trials could be brought. But the success was to be tarnished. Charges against Mr David Mayhew of Casenoves had to be withdrawn. The second trial collapsed when Mr Roger Seelig suffered a nervous breakdown. Lord Spens, his co-defendant, eventually won an acquittal. Those failures focused minds again on the many problems of long, complex and costly fraud trials and provided plenty of material to feed the current debates on the management of such proceedings. The judge in the first two trials, Mr Justice Henry, was moved to make radical suggestions for reform, many of which have been officially sanctioned in a consultative paper by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The judge in the Ward trial will make his feelings known today. The word Guinness may remain in business folklore as a by-word for corporate corruption, but the company itself has long since put the affair behind it. Sweeping management changes have restored Guinness's reputation and it has built on the Distillers takeover to transform itself from a medium-ranked brewer and ragtail retailer into the most profitable drinks company in the world. When Sir Norman (now Lord) Macfarlane, one of the four non-executive directors which the City forced on Mr Saunders in 1986, took over as chairman, he brought in Sir Anthony Tennant from Grand Metropolitan as chief executive. While Lord Macfarlane dealt with the ramifications of the DTI inquiry, Mr Tennant developed the business, selling off peripheral operations to concentrate on brewing and spirits. About six months after his appointment, Mr Tennant invited Mr Tony Greener, former managing director of Dunhill and one of the new non-executive directors, to help him restructure Distillers. They rationalised distribution, increased direct control of marketing, formed alliances such as that with LVMH, the French luxury goods group, pushed up prices and margins, and supported the brands with intensive advertising to restore their premium image. The new management - not a senior manager survives from the Saunders era - restored Guinness's reputation for straight dealing and revitalised its performance. With the benefits of the Distillers restructuring, pre-tax profits between 1987 and 1991 soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m; earnings per share grew from 14.7p to 33.6p; and dividends rose from 4.6p to 10.8p. Although the global recession took its toll last year, the group has consolidated its long-term growth prospects with a series of acquisitions, including Asbach of Germany, Bundaberg in Australia, and Pampero in Venezuela. When Mr Tennant retired last year, it was an entirely different company from the demoralised and scandal-torn one he had inherited from Mr Saunders.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hamble pie NM Rothschild yesterday pinned the blame for the Aerostructures Hamble debacle on the engineering company's management. Cock-ups by the management there certainly were and those responsible should not profit from the sorry affair. But the matter cannot be left at that. Given that the roots of the company's problems go back to before the company was floated in June, there is also a question of whether there were warning signs its advisers should have spotted. Mr Andy Barr, Aerostructures' chief executive, may have retired on ill-health grounds. But he has still received Pounds 1.7m from selling shares in the float. The honourable response would be to offer to buy back shares from new investors at the price for which they were originally sold. His son Mr Brian Barr, the company's manufacturing director at the time, has been shifted to a new role. Since Aerostructures' problems were in its factory, he can have no long-term future with the company. He too should use the Pounds 580,000 he received from the float to buy back shares. Rothschild and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Aerostructures' accountant, deny negligence. And it would certainly be hard for shareholders to know whether there was any without a much more detailed post mortem. But Rothschild, Coopers and other advisers still have an interest in assuaging investors' anger and so should consider paying back the Pounds 1.2m fees they earned from sponsoring the float. There can certainly be no case for Coopers continuing to receive fees for investigating what went wrong. If investors are to be charged for the post mortem, it should at least be conducted by a new team of advisers.</p>

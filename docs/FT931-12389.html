			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Aircraft makers fight recession: Cutbacks and falling defence spending are transforming a depressed industry / Analysis of worldwide reactions of suppliers and manufacturers to the downturn FOR the past 12 months, Boeing has been discussing possible production cuts with its huge range of suppliers and subcontractors. For them, this week's news that Boeing will cut annual output by 40 per cent did not come as a surprise. That did not make it any more pleasant. Boeing's cuts came after similar decisions by its two smaller competitors, McDonnell Douglas and the European Airbus consortium. The industry believes it is coming to the bottom of its worst cyclical downturn since the second world war. But, unlike in previous cycles, there are no signs of a rapid recovery. Excess capacity - put by some analysts at around 10 per cent - and too many aircraft programmes are dragging down profitability. The big engine manufacturers have been hardest hit by the production cuts. All three - Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and General Electric of the US - are committed to costly long-term development programmes for new engines to power the next generation of wide-body aircraft. Usually, it takes an engine maker about five years longer to see a payback from a new project than it does an airframe manufacturer. For US parts manufacturers, the cuts in airliner production come on top of the sharp decline in the US defence equipment budget. Companies suffering range from manufacturers of airframe fasteners, such as Hi-Shear Industries, to makers of sophisticated avionics systems, such as Honeywell, the controls group. For an example of the impact of the cuts, look at Northrop, the Los Angeles based defence contractor best-known for manufacturing the B-2 bomber. It makes the fuselage, doors and other small parts for the Boeing 747 and will be hit by Boeing's decision to cut 747 production from five aircraft a month to three next year. Analysts believe Northrop's revenues on each jumbo jet total Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) to Dollars 15m, which means the company could lose Dollars 240m to Dollars 360m a year in sales from the cutback. That is not large relative to Northrop's total group sales of some Dollars 5.7bn, but the company has been trying to establish a much larger presence in the commercial aircraft market to offset declining defence industry sales. Despite the slowdown, and the likely cuts in jobs that it involves, Northrop says it remains optimistic about the industry's long-term growth. Overseas, other suppliers hit by the cutbacks say the same. Smiths Industries of the UK puts avionics worth about Dollars 500,000 into each Boeing 737, so the cut in production from the recent peak of 21 monthly to 10 will have a significant impact. However, the UK company said 60 per cent of its avionics goes into the defence sector which, despite cuts, was looking robust - particularly in the US. TI Group, the specialist engineering group, says it factored in the present downturn in demand when it took over the struggling aerospace engineer Dowty in 1991 with a hostile bid. Dowty supplies undercarriages and activation system to both Boeing and Airbus, and TI said it was confident that the sector's long-term growth trend would be resumed. Lucas Industries makes engine management and activation systems for Boeing and power generators for Airbus. The Birmingham-based group said the latest cuts would have a negligible effect, because it had already been taking a very cautious view of demand. It was the collapse in Lucas's aerospace profits last year which has made the motor and aircraft components group appear vulnerable to a takeover. The company most often cited as predator is BTR, the industrial conglomerate which took over Hawker Siddeley at the end of 1991, after the UK group's aerospace and other engineering businesses had all been hit hard by recession. In Japan, where the aerospace industry is small by international standards, a string of companies which have become closely linked to Boeing in the past few years will be affected. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which has about 30 per cent of the Japanese aerospace industry's output, supplies parts for the rear body of the Boeing 767 and inboard flaps for the 747. Shipments of both will drop from five to three a month from July, according to MHI. But it will not have much of an impact on MHI as a whole. Aircraft account for about a fifth of MHI's annual sales of Y20,500bn. (Pounds 109bn) Less than 5 per cent of the company's sales go to Boeing, so at most its overall sales will fall by about 1 per cent. Kawasaki Heavy Industry, which supplies the forward fuselage and body panels for the 767 as well as components for the 737 and 747, said the cuts would have a big impact on its aerospace business. Toray, the chemical company, which this summer will start producing carbon fibre for Boeing from a US plant it is building, said it was well prepared for the cuts. Toray has also diversified. Aerospace now accounts for just 30 per cent of its carbon fibre sales, 50 per cent of sales goes to sporting goods such as tennis rackets and golf clubs. For all the suppliers, the current downturn is helping bring about a shift in the relationship with their customers. 'Within the next decade,' said Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice president of planning and international development, 'we will probably see a change in both the composition of the airframe manufacturers and the types of relationships they have with suppliers.' The slump has forced aerospace prime contractors to cut back on suppliers. 'Until recently, in many cases we had two or more suppliers providing the same component,' explained Mr Clarkson. 'The fact is, dual sourcing is very expensive, and we have had to find ways to be more and more competitive.' Alliances of every sort are proliferating. In France, Aerospatiale and Thomson CSF have merged their avionics operations into a joint venture. And in the UK, Dowty has been taken over by TI, Lucas is seen as a possible takeover target, and Smiths Industries has been discussing collaboration with Rockwell Collins of the US. There are already only three large airframe makers and three engine makers; in time, there is likely to be room for only three suppliers in each prime component sector.</p>

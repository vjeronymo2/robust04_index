			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (6): Cover can be expensive or not available - The UK's approach to export credit insurance seems pretty incoherent For the exporter, winning an order is often just a first step towards making the sale. In addition it is often necessary to arrange financing and, in an uncertain world, export credit insurance. Export credit insurance provides the means for companies to reduce and manage the risk inherent in exporting - a vital service in a nation such as Britain. As Mr Keith Johnson, export finance manager at Siemens Plessey Systems and chairman of the British Exporters Association, points out, 'We are still one of the biggest exporters per capita in the world.' Nevertheless, many of the UK's regular exporters - they number about 40,000, complain that while there have been some improvements, insurance cover is still too expensive or unavailable for some markets. More pointedly, Mr Johnson claims that British exporters often lose out against their continental counterparts because the UK lacks a coherent government-backed export policy. As a result, he says, British support for exports is haphazard. It often compares unfavourably with that available to the competition, where the export financing as well as the credit insurance is often provided by state- controlled entities. 'We need a full political commitment to support and sustain exports, and that is the fundamental problem,' says Mr Campbell Dunford, chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce's export committee This deficiency is particularly critical in the market for medium and long term credit insurance which, throughout the European Union, is provided by government agencies. In the UK, the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) provided insurance to cover about Pounds 4bn of 'long and large' exports last year - usually for big sales such as shipping or aerospace contracts, or large projects when payment is expected over a two-year period or longer. ECGD premium rates have been reduced several times over the past two years, while cover has been increased. In December the UK chancellor announced a reduction in ECGD premium rates in a limited number of markets, including Argentina, India, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey, and a Pounds 200m increase in export credit insurance cover for capital exports in 1996-97. But while Mr Dunford says these moves were a step in the right direction and reflect 'a gathering awareness' of the importance of exports, he also points out that premium rates for many markets are still uncompetitive. 'We are not asking for anything special,' adds Mr Johnson, 'just a sense of realism.' Meanwhile UK exporters have discovered common ground with their continental counterparts when it comes to EU proposals for the harmonisation of export credit insurance regimes contained in the so-called Tuffrau report. In January a delegation led by Mr Johnson, representing exporters from Germany, Holland, Spain, France and the UK, met Commission officials to express their concern over harmonisation plans. These, Mr Johnson said, reflected, 'introspective activity by EU officials,' largely for the convenience of treasuries across Europe which are trying to reduce their support for exporters. Following the meeting, EU exporters are optimistic about their chances of forcing amendments to the harmonisation plans - although Commission officials have warned that it will be difficult to change the minds of national governments at this late stage. One of the main issues is over the level of cover available from member country export credit agencies. Under the EU proposals, the level of cover provided by the agencies to banks for buyer and supplier credits would be harmonised at 85 per cent of the contract value. However. the EU exporters argue that this would place them at a serious disadvantage against the US and other competing OECD countries which provide 100 per cent cover. Instead, the exporters argue that the EU should harmonise upwards to 100 per cent, thereby matching international competition. 'Harmonisation must occur at the highest common denominator to ensure that Europe is competitive against the Americans, Japanese, Canadians and, in the future, countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, China and Malaysia,' says Mr Johnson. The British Exporters Association has prepared a matrix listing exporters' concerns over harmonisation issues, including divergence of premium rates, quality of cover and unequal treatment of risk analysis by credit agencies. British exporters are also worried about the cost and provision of short term cover - which represents about 85 per cent of all export credit insurance. In the UK the ECGD's short term insurance services were privatised in December 1991, as a result of which two main competing private sector insurance providers have emerged. The UK market is now mainly divided between the Dutch-owned NCM Credit Insurance, which bought the ECGD's Cardiff-based short-term business and has about 80 per cent of the UK export credit insurance market providing about Pounds 15bn of cover annually, and Trade Indemnity (TI), a relative newcomer to the export market. TI is the largest UK domestic credit insurance supplier, but it has also moved into the export market where it provides about Pounds 4bn of cover a year. There is 'healthy competition' between the two organisations, says Mr James Ball of Dewe Rogerson Europe, who represents NCM. Generally, the insurers cover exporters against losses up to 90 per cent of the value of invoices where a customer defaults, and up to 95 per cent if the customer is willing to pay but the country defaults (as Nigeria did in 1983). Exporters agree that the quality of service since privatisation has improved considerably. Nevertheless, privatisation has meant that the UK, alone in the EU, does not supply state reinsurance support for short term export credit. The government has extended 'transitional' cover until the end of 1997, but the lack of permanence has caused uncertainty. Exporters also argue that the transitional reinsurance arrangements are not flexible enough - which means that, in some notable instances, cover has been unavailable for export orders won in the wake of ministerial export-boosting trips overseas. 'There needs to be a much faster mechanism for responding to the needs of the marketplace,' says Mr Dunford. 'The Treasury expects a 4 per cent increase in exports year on year, but has made no provision for achieving this,' complains the outspoken Mr Johnson. 'They think it will come from the tooth fairy.' Indeed, although NCM and TI do provide substantial short term export credit insurance, many exporters believe that UK exports to emerging markets such as China would be substantially higher if the supply and cost of credit insurance became easier, and if a more co-ordinated approach was adopted by Government.</p>

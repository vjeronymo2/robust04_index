			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: MEPs back bigger EU Sir, Your headline, 'MEPs fail in their attempt to block enlargement vote' (May 3), is grossly misleading given that the overwhelming majority of MEPs were attempting to do precisely the opposite. In spite of some misgivings about the failure to adapt the institutional framework of the European Union to cater for 16 member states, which will result in some MEPs abstaining or voting against enlargement, it was already clear on Monday that most MEPs support the accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden. We will live to fight another day for the necessary institutional reforms, notably in the 1996 Maastricht treaty revision. Gary Titley, rapporteur of the EP foreign affairs committee, 97-113 rue Belliard, 104 Brussels, Belgium</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest expulsion of the non-Serb population  from Banja Luka and other Krajina municipalities is yet another  illustration of the brutality and the insanity of the policy of  violence conducted by war criminal Karadzic and his followers.  This is contained in a statement issued today by the Serbian  Citizens' Council. At their assembly held on 27 March of this  year, citizens of Serbian nationality and Serbian ethnic origin  again sent a clear message to the international community,  explaining that the theory of the impossibility of coexistence  in fact conceals the aggressor's aspirations to occupy territory  and expel Bosniak Muslims from their homes.    For this reason we demand from all those responsible  international subjects that can influence the course of solving  the bloody Bosnia-Herzegovina drama to prevent further  expulsions of Muslims and Croats from their homes, and to create  the conditions for a speedy return of refugees and displaced  people. This, in our view, is the precondition for peace in  this region, reads the statement by the Serbian Citizens'  Council.</p>

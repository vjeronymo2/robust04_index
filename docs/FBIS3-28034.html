It fully reveals the wild ambition of the U.S. to expand its  sphere of domination in the Asia-Pacific region, says the paper.    The Korean people bitterly denounce the U.S. scheme to start  the broadcasting and demand its immediate cancellation, the news  analyst says, and goes on:    The United States is making a gross mistake. It seems to  have profited by its false propaganda offensive in  disintegrating the socialist countries in East Europe and  bringing them back to capitalism. But such propaganda cannot  work on Korean-style socialism in which the leader, the party  and the masses are united in one mind.    The Korean people who are closely united behind the  illustrious leader are not shaken by any war provocation  manoeuvres, threat, blackmail and pressure nor by any yellow  wind.    The United States must stop its foolish acts to corrupt and  degenerate the Korean people and other people of Asia by base  false propaganda and act with discretion.</p>

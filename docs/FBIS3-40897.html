			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Moscow, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk has been invited to join a summit meeting  between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian leader Boris  Yeltsin after Moscow and Kiev reached an agreement in principle  on the future of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, the Kremlin  announced Monday.    Yeltsin's press service said the Russian leader had invited  Kravchuk to Friday's summit after reaching an "agreement in  principle on certain important issues of shared interest,  including nuclear weapons."    A presidential spokesman declined to elaborate on the  agreement, but Clinton has previously said that he would only  meet with Kravchuk after an accord had been finalized on the  dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal.    Yeltsin's spokesman would only say that discussions were  under way concerning several documents that the three leaders  would be signing during their meeting in Moscow. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Law firms' growth beats economy Solicitors' turnover grew faster than the economy as a whole during the recession, the Law Society said yesterday. In total, the turnover of law firms increased 25 per cent between 1989-90 and 1992-93 while the monetary value of GDP rose 22 per cent. In the 1992-93 financial year, however, turnover failed to keep pace with inflation. Total turnover of solicitors' firms in England and Wales was Pounds 6.42bn, an increase of only 3.3 per cent on the previous year. The society said conveyancing, the traditional barometer of the profession, has shown some increase in volume this year but the recovery in the early part of the year has not been maintained.</p>

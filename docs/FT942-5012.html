			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Small firms not lacking advantage in Europe Sir, Mr Gerald Frankel and Mr Ben Coleman are quite wrong to put forward their view that only the largest companies can afford to commit resources to ensuring that new European standards are not to their disadvantage (Letters, June 1). Industry organisations and trade associations have a key role in the negotiation of CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) standards. Industries which have organised to meet this challenge through associations do so at very modest cost to individual members. The existence of the European standards system is a matter of fact. Inadequate representation or poor performance in a standards negotiation can lead to products being standardised out of existence. On the other hand, a successful standards negotiation can offer a significantly greater market to a product which meets the new standard. Virtually all players, large and small, in the UK galvanising sector give solid support to their industry organisation, finance it at a realistic level and look to it to deliver full value in European standards negotiations. Mr Frankel and Mr Coleman would do well to encourage the same approach elsewhere. In this way UK business meets the challenge of business from other EU states with equal strength.

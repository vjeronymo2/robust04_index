			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Our Foreign Debts Are At The Red Level"] </F>   [Text] Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and  Development Supervision Saleh Affif finally reminded "us" that  the country's rate of foreign debts should be controlled.    The reason -- as was repeatedly and continuously commented  by  this daily -- was that the foreign debts accumulated by the  Indonesian Government and the private sector have reached nearly  $100 billion.    In fact, the overall current amount of foreign debt, as what  is termed as outstanding debt [preceding two words in English],  is around $90 billion. A psychological effect will be felt the  moment Indonesia's foreign debts hit the $100 billion mark, that  is, the donor countries would be hesitant and would reconsider  extending any attractive loans to the debtor countries [two  preceding words in English].    Thus, it was clear that ever since the implementation of the  first Long-Term Development Program, the debate on the foreign  debt issue has proved to be futile. The foreign loans had  supplemented the development programs.    This daily has since had a "correct" conviction with regard  to the government's New Order policy, which is to continuously  acquire foreign loans for development programs. Therefore, this  daily could should not be branded as being "anti-development".    However, development is part of the developing nations'  physical struggle in their effort to ensure the existence and  perpetuation of their political life, economy, and culture after  the colonialists were ushered out.    If this daily had proposed from the beginning that national  development was undertaken based on a principle of  "self-reliance" and not through being dependent on any nation or  international body, then such a proposal would have been made  out of concern and love for the people and the country.    When Indonesia's "new" loan stood at around $21.76 billion  in  1983, most people in developing nations feared that their  foreign debts would spiral drastically within the next decade.    In accordance with the World Bank's monetary list, the  1984-85 "World Debt Table" [preceding three words in English]  projected the increase of foreign debt incurred by the  developing nations as "serious" and running up to billions of  dollars in 1983. The developing nations referred to are as  follows:    India with foreign debts totaling $24.429 billion; Indonesia  with $21.768 billion; South Korea with $23.07 billion;  Argentina with $24.592 billion; Brazil with $58.068 billion;  and Mexico with $66.731 billion.    It is not only this daily but almost every other Indonesian  newspaper expressed its concern that if the developing  countries' foreign debts were left unchecked, then those  countries with the most serious foreign debt problems would be  ensnared in what is termed a debt trap [preceding two words in  English].    Why then the cause for concern? At that time, rhetoric such  as "the foreign loans will not impose any burden on the people"  and many other statements was heard from Professor Wijoyo  Nitisastro, who held that foreign loans were a form of  assistance, considering them important for Indonesia's  successful implementation of national development programs and  so on.    The majority of the people believed that the foreign debts  would finally be "easily" settled through income derived from  petroleum exports.    In fact, such a consideration never even materialized. The  petroleum prices in international markets plummetted to $13 per  barrel and the country's foreign debts spiraled upward, thus  causing the financial reserves from petroleum sources into a  more serious situation.    In this daily's 28 March 1994 editorial titled "The G-15  Summit Should Solve The Foreign Debt Crisis," it was clear that  the developing nations' foreign debts had doubled and tripled  compared with the amount incurred during the previous decade and  a "debt crisis" was imminent. In such a situation, the  developing nations' income derived from their exports would be  absolutely insufficient to even repay the principal borrowed,  let alone the interest.    Also, last year when Indonesia's foreign loans reached $78  billion (as stated in THE STRAIITS TIMES 2 July 1993), the head  of CGI (Consultative Group for Indonesia) [preceding expansion  in English] Guatama Kaji, stated that with Indonesia's six  percent growth rate, there was no pressing need for the country  to acquire a $5.11 billion loan.    In 1992, Indonesia's foreign loans approved by the World  Bank  totaled about $4.9 billion. At that time, the dollar  appreciated sharply against the yen. This would increase  Indonesia's foreign debts -- without even receiving any yen.    It was very clear that the policy employed by economists  from  the Berkeley Group with regard to the acquisition of foreign  loans during the First Long-Term Development Program was one of  a "hasty" nature, thus reflecting an inability to contain the  numerous financial leakages. Indonesia would not have been  cornered into, as what is termed as, a debt trap if ever a  glimmer of patriotism ever existed within the hearts of this  group of people.    The country's financial situation has worsened, but do not  let the people bear the "consequences."</p>

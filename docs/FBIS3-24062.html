			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Text of press conference given on 14 Feb by Yuriy </F> Vasilyevich Neyelov, newly appointed acting chief of  administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, recorded by  V. Grachev]    [Text] On 14 Feb the editorial office received the  edict of the RF president on the appointment of Yu. Neyelov as  acting chief of administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous  Okrug. The very same day Yuriy Vasilyevich decided it was  necessary to give a press conference for the journalists of  oblast newspapers.    The new top leader of the okrug announced that he prefers to  give preemptive answers to inevitable questions related to his  new appointment himself. And he spoke with journalists fairly  openly without giving an answer to one question: For what  specific transgressions was the former chief of administration  of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, Lev Bayandin, dismissed from  the post. "You have to ask those who prepared the edict about  that," Yu. Neyelov said diplomatically.    Yuriy Vasilyevich announced that he has in fact already  begun  to perform his new duties. Today he met with a large delegation  from RAO [Russian Joint Stock Company] Gazprom, headed by its  manager R. E. Vyakhirev. Yesterday was quite productive. Among  other things, the question of the bad situation which has taken  shape in Salekhard was closed. There, as our newspaper already  reported, residential buildings froze up (read the details in  the next issue of TP [TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA]), and there are other  problems related to poor preparation for the winter. Gazprom is  allocating money to clean up the consequences of this situation  as soon as possible and prevent more problems. There were talks  about resolving the problem of lack of payments too, among  others on Ukraine's large debt to Novyy Urengoy for gas  delivered. A plan has been arrived at--Ukraine settles accounts  in goods, the goods are sold, and the money goes to pay off the  debt to the gas workers in wages.    The new chief of the okrug administration explained why  under  the edict he is "only" the acting chief. It turns out that "at  the top" this procedure has been established--all the recent  appointments to governors' posts have followed this same scheme,  and he is no exception.    Yu. Neyelov also reported that he will run as a candidate  for  deputy to the Council of the Federation in one of the election  districts in Yamal which remain vacant.    In answering the question to what degree the new  appointments  correspond to his personal plans, Yuriy Vasilyevich said that he  had already been offered this post twice before and refused. He  was persuaded the third time. The situation in the okrug now is  bad, but he is a native of Yamal, he grew up here, his  grandfather, grandmother, and father are buried here, and his  mother lives here even now. He himself was born here. "I am  returning to the home of my birth," said Yu. Neyelov.    Will the new chief of the okrug administration fulfill his  former duties as deputy chief of the oblast administration as  well? That was a very tricky question which was asked. The  answer: If that is even suggested, I will not accept it. I know  that talks are in progress on this subject with a very clear  ulterior motive, said Yuriy Vasilyevich. I am returning to the  home of my birth in order to reinforce its independence even  more, but as part of a unified Tyumen Oblast.    The chief of administration was also asked how he intends to  build his relations with the all-powerful RAO Gazprom, which has  more power in the okrug than the authorities themselves. A year  ago this theory would have perhaps been accurate, answered Yu.  Neyelov. But now Gazprom is not so very powerful and has no  money, but then there are many problems. He shared his  interpretation of the paths of development of Yamal, the basis  of which is bolstering legislative support for the economy of  the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug. Ninety percent of Russia's  natural gas is produced here, and the state does not have the  right to refuse to try to solve Yamal problems, subcontracting  them out only to joint stock structures. Consequently, a  powerful corporation to develop the okrug economy on a mixed  basis must be created: with the participation of the state, RAO  Gazprom, petroleum associations, and the like. But this must in  principle be a state corporation existing around 14-15 percent  on deductions for oil and gas, as is customary throughout the  world.    And, secondly, we need a state corporation of regional  development which works for the needs of the indigenous peoples  in the North. The situation in the tundra today is bad, the old  system for supporting the indigenous peoples has been destroyed,  and a new one has not yet taken shape--and it is now essentially  a question of people's survival. After all, Russia signed an  international convention on small aboriginal peoples, and hence  they have the right to property and land and the right to  dividends for using them. Chaotic, one-time injections of  capital are not the point and do not solve the problem. Yu.  Neyelov stated that he considers the solution to this problem to  be his primary job.    To do this the structure of administration will be changed  and scientists will be hired; this will also be reflected in the  okrug's budget policy.    At the same time, however, Yuriy Vasilyevich noted that he  is  against the development of ancestral lands. As practice has  shown, this results only in conflicts, which are at times  bloody, among various groups of the population; other ways to  solve the problem must be found.    The phrase "superfluous people must be removed from the  North" has now become fashionable. What do you think of that?  the new chief of the okrug administration was asked. According  to all analyses, the okrug is overpopulated by about 20 percent,  he answered. But people certainly cannot be "removed." People,  especially those who have given the North many years of their  lives and frequently their health, can and must be moved. They  must be moved to places which are more accommodating to life, of  course, and it must be done so that their lives are normal. RAO  Gazprom, among other things, has such a program.    The new chief of administration is against moving the okrug  capital from its historical site, Salekhard, to one of the new  cities of gas or oil workers. But he is for bringing treaties  with Ukraine, Belarus, and the republics on reinforcing the  status of the migrant population in the okrug to a logical  conclusion. The question of dual citizenship, for those who want  it, and the questions of pensions, housing, and the like must be  finally resolved. "We will improve all this only to the benefit  of people's normal life," Yu. Neyelov stated.    The very same day the new chief of administration of  Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug flew to Salekhard. And yesterday  he took part in the big meeting of RAO Gazprom in Novyy  Urengoy--here, as everyone knows, the very same events which  occurred in Nadym recently are brewing. Yuriy Neyelov did not  return at the best time for the home of his birth. All the more  reason we wish him success, good fortune, and good sense in his  new and responsible post.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Private sketches of Jack the Dripper's troubled psyche  -Marina Vazey considers an exhibition of Jackson Pollock's collected 'psychoanalytic' drawings or, at the least, both significant and controversial - artist of interest to the general public as well as the scholar? Is every drawing, every piece of evidence of help to us all in tracking the paths of genius and talent? Moreover, should private notes and doodles be publicly presented? The secret drawers of the studio turned out? The confidential files posthumously exposed? These are increasingly pertinent questions for biographers - and art historians. Such speculation is inevitable in the face of the array of drawings undertaken in the cause and course of psychotherapy by Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), the first mythical character of American art, which have been on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A complete and handsome catalogue, Jackson Pollock: 'Psychoanalytic' Drawings by Professor Claudo Cernuschi (Duke University Press) has also been published. By his mid-30s, Pollock was probably the best known, or notorious, contemporary painter in America, nicknamed Jack the Dripper, for his innovative technique of pouring - even throwing - paint on to unstretched canvas laid out on the studio floor. A member of the first generation of abstract expressionists, the first American Ism to achieve international recognition, he had been the subject of a picture story in Life - an apotheosis indeed - calmly entitled 'Is he America's Greatest Living Painter?', had represented America at the Venice Biennale, in a group show now seen by some commentators as a conscious bid for cultural clout in the early days of the Cold War, and had been the subject of a classic film by Hans Namuth. By 1958, under the inspired guidance of Bryan Robertson, Pollock's first big retrospective was seen in Britain at the Whitechapel, and for the past four decades Pollocks have been eagerly sought by all major museums: his 'Blue Poles', the most costly contemporary painting of its time when purchased by the National Gallery of Australia, was a cause celebre down under, and graced an Australian postage stamp. Pollock's noisy life, the subject of several biographies, continues to command interest, while his art gains in stature, as admired in Europe - unusually equally so in France and Germany - as it is in America. His reputation as an artist seems relatively secure. So the question is, do we need to see these drawings? For the public, do they cast helpful light on his character, working methods, and illuminate his art? The conquering hero came to New York as a student aged 15; born in Wyoming, he had spent his childhood in California and Arizona.  He was a profoundly neurotic and disturbed personality, as well as prodigiously prolific and active; and in the course of his life had several sustained periods of psychotherapy and analysis as well as in-hospital treatment, primarily for alcoholism. In the course of his first period of therapy, with Dr Henderson, who had himself been analysed by Carl Gustav Jung, his analyst suggested that the artist bring in his drawings as a means of expressing himself - Pollock found conversation difficult - in the therapeutic situation. Nearly 25 years after Pollock's death, Dr Henderson retrieved the drawings from his files, exhibited them as a group, and put them on the market. Pollock's widow, the painter Lee Krasner, went to court to prevent their sale; in her view their public appearance violated the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship. But in 1977 Krasner lost the case, and the drawings have been in various collections since. So large a group has not been exhibited together for more than 20 years, although they were first published as a group in 1970, and are well documented in the Pollock catalogue raisonne published in 1978. The present exhibition and publication plays down to the point of invisibility the Jungian interpretation of the drawings, and simply states that the drawings are not the product of neurosis but the result of Pollock's normal artistic practice. Thus there are quotation marks in the title for the adjective 'psychoanalytic'. Well, yes and no: Pollock studies seem all too often to reel from one oversimplification to another. These drawings were not done for therapy, they were part of Pollock's normal working practice, but they were used in therapy. Pollock's communication was visual not verbal, and he was intensely eager and receptive to a variety of visual influences, from Amer-Indian art, heavily reliant on abstract symbols, the Mexican muralists, notably Orozco, and, especially, Picasso and the surrealists. These drawings do impress because of their elaborate linear structure, their reliance on a beguiling and fascinating mixture of the representational and the abstract, with eyes - say - or equine forms appearing from out of a ferocious tangle of lines, stylised animal heads, stray limbs and animal bodies, some of which appear as relatively straightforward Picassoid variations. Anger and terror certainly are ingredients in a rather heady emotional mix. However, San Francisco owns a Pollock masterpiece, Guardians of the Secret, a group of totemic figures emerging from a web of paint. To witness what Pollock could do at the height of his powers in a full scale painting puts the drawings into perspective as exercises, taking - in Paul Klee's phrase - a line for a walk. After all, Jung based his study of symbols on art over the millennia; Jungian symbols and archetypes are configurations used over many cultures and periods. Pollock, as Picasso, drew upon this universal seed-bed. What is characteristic of modernism in all its guises is the wealth of visual material available to all as never before, simply in fact of technical reasons: the abundance of museums, media and our ability to travel. These drawings are in fact simply a curiosity, piquant because they show Pollock experimenting with an increasingly elaborate visual vocabulary, playing with an increasing elaboration of form. But they were not created to be put on public view, or to enter the public arena; they were private works, and relatively slight. It is the circumstance of their creation, not their actual presence, that provokes and teases. They are perhaps working drawings of the psyche, but few are related directly to his major paintings as we know them. Pollock's own statement, 'The source of my painting is the unconscious' obscures as much as it illuminates, and these 'psychoanalytic' drawings cast but fitful light on the creative process in general, and Pollock in particular.</p>

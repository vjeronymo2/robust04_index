			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / People: An architectural mission to the public Rory Coonan, head of the newly-created architectural unit of the Arts Council, claims his mission is to look after the general public's interest in architecture. 'Architecture is not just for architects,' intones Coonan, who, appropriately enough, is not trained in the profession himself. With Pounds 600,000 to dispense in grants over the initial three-year period coming from the new National Heritage Department, the former visual arts officer at the Arts Council will be trying to match that penny for penny with private funding - Japanese and Scandinavian developers and construction firms with an interest in the UK are apparently a more realistic target than recession-bound British firms. Coonan, 38, who is running a very tight ship - with just one assistant  - explains how he wishes 'to get away from the sterile debate between heritage and modernism and concentrate on broader questions and not just buildings' appearance'. Coonan seems very struck on the French idea of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal in Paris which shows displays of current developments and encourages input from the general public. 'Canary Wharf might have benefited from a much more open debate with lay people instead of these ex cathedra views (trying to create) Manhattan in the East End,' he ventures. His new unit has a national conference on planning and architectural centres on the agenda for next February. Other plans include studies on public sector procurement - with the civil service agencies' Next Steps programme targeted to see what sorts of criteria (other than price) are used in finding buildings. While his show is 'aided and abetted' by Lord Palumbo, Arts Council chairman and aggressive proponent of modern buildings, 'our interests in architecture are not coterminous with his. We are not wedded to a particular style'. But with avowed modernist and British Library architect Colin St John Wilson chairing the advisory panel, it will be very much a case of the proof of the pudding . . . ***** After the odd false start, DOWTY has finally got a new finance director. This August, Christopher Bunker was to have joined from Westland, but he backed off in a hurry the day the offer from TI went final. Reg Moore, the previous incumbent who had wanted to retire by March this year, is now going from Dowty, but is not putting his feet up entirely. He is to help smooth the ownership transition and will be taking up a 'consulting role to the TI Group'. The new man for Dowty is 43-year-old David Harding, deputy finance director of TI since August 1991, who assumes the job in addition to his TI responsibilities. While shareholders did not get to know him during the bid, the City did, as he performed a lot of the detailed analysis of Dowty. He has been at TI since 1980, and was director of corporate development before moving to the finance side. ***** Duncan Ross, chairman and chief executive of Southern Electric, is to retire in May 1993. As have several of the 12 regional electricity companies privatised two years ago, Southern will now split the role of chairman and chief executive. The new (part-time) chairman will be Geoffrey Wilson, 62, (above) chairman of Delta, the electrical engineering company. Wilson, a chartered accountant, is also a non-executive director of companies including Blue Circle Industries and Johnson Matthey. Henry Casley, 54, managing director of Southern Electric since 1990 and formerly deputy chairman, will become the new chief executive. Anthony Stoughton-Harris, an existing non-executive director, is to deputy chairman from June 1993.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Slimma likely to raise Pounds 5m in new year float Slimma, the women's clothing manufacturer specialising in outsize garments, will seek a flotation in the new year. Although no details have been settled, it is likely Slimma will aim to raise about Pounds 5m in a placing of new shares, sponsored and brokered by Henry Cooke Lumsden. As the management - led by Mr Stephen Thwaite, and Yorkshire Bank Development Capital, Slimma's venture capital backer - intend to retain a majority of the enlarged capital, the group will probably be valued at about Pounds 12m. Mr Thwaite led a management team which bought out two divisions of Tootal, part of the Coats Viyella group, in October 1991 for Pounds 3.3m. Since then Slimma has expanded from one plant in Leek, Staffordshire. It has taken another factory in the same town and additional plants in Sandbach, Cheshire and Cannock, Staffordshire. In two years its payroll has risen from 370 to 525 people. If the placing is successful, Slimma will use the funds to broaden its clothing range from skirts and trousers partly to protect itself from other groups which are moving into the under-exploited outsize clothing market. The funds would also clear residual bank debt taken on at the time of the buy-out. Gearing is about 50 per cent. Slimma's accounts for the year to last September are expected to show pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1m on turnover of up to Pounds 16m.</p>

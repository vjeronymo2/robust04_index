			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland disclosed that he would run for a sixth term as  leader of the 14.1-million-member federation at its convention this November.  In recent weeks, there had been rumors he would step down. But at a press  briefing at the federation's Washington headquarters, Kirkland stated  categorically that he would run again. Kirkland, 66, was first elected  president in 1979. It is unlikely that Kirkland will face any significant  opposition. During the meeting with reporters, Kirkland, a member of the  deficit-fighting National Economic Commission, said the prospects of a unified  report are doubtful. He said the panel was hobbled by a lack of commitment from  President Bush and, to a lesser degree, from congressional leaders that the  panel's work would be seriously considered.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: Making tracks in the freight industry Access to electronic trading systems - not for dealing in shares, but for such purposes as electronic mail, bulletin boards, and electronic data interchange (EDI) - is increasingly important for many business sectors. For the hundreds of players in Europe's fast changing freight industry, however, it is becoming a question of survival. Tackling the problem without the technical or financial resources to make the right decisions on an integrated electronic trading system can be a nightmare for smaller companies, and is no easy task either for their bigger counterparts. Over the past year the British International Freight Association has stolen a march over its European rivals with the launch of BIFAnet, an electronic trading service developed jointly with General Electric Information Services (GEIS), a division of General Electric of the US. The freight industry is a classic example of a sector where electronic trading can produce more efficient links between shippers, forwarders, carriers, traders and consignees. 'We're focusing in on an enormous paper chain,' says Geoff Brickell, UK sales development manager at GEIS. BIFAnet is a unique development for a trade association in the international trade and transportation sector, according to Jim White, BIFA director- general. 'The future of freight intermediaries will depend on having control of information that relates to the supply system. If they don't they may end up being cut out of the loop altogether.' Freight forwarders have to communicate with all members of the supply chain, and are moving information around for every shipment. But with half of the 900 members employing 10 people or less, they were looking to the association for a modern electronic solution. With software designed by the association, BIFAnet uses the EDI, E-mail and bulletin board services provided via the GEIS global network to provide an integrated electronic trading service. 'It's a stepping stone to paperless trading,' says White. 'If members had no computer technology before, they now have access to the world's largest EDI network for less than Pounds 2,000 for the hardware and software.' BIFAnet was launched last November, but began to get going in May and June. About 60 members are now signed up, and White hopes to reach a target of 100 by the end of the year. The launch was timely, ahead of the Single European Market reforms which could put further pressure on smaller players in the freight industry. There has been keen interest in the system from other European freight trade associations, says White. GEIS, which sees its mission as providing value-added services to enable electronic commerce to function, identified the transportation sector as a new worldwide opportunity three years ago, says Brickell. But GEIS is also keeping a close eye on other high-volume sectors where relationships are becoming more complex as manufacturing patterns change, or where companies are altering their distribution methods in line with the Single Market. The network of component manufacturers, distributors, contract manufacturers and customers in the electronics industry is a case in point. The industry, rather aptly, is finally coming round in a big way to electronic trading, says Brickell. And as more companies in such sectors start trading electronically, users may feel less need for the 'belt-and-braces' approach now prevalent in much of industry. Each EDI transaction may in itself be highly efficient, but is usually accompanied by between three and eight associated communications - phone calls, faxes and queries - which may not strictly be necessary.</p>

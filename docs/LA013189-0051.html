			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER POLISH DISSIDENT PRIEST IS FOUND DEAD  </P> <P> A radical pro-Solidarity priest in the northeastern Polish city of Bialystok  was found dead Monday, the second dissident priest to die in Poland in the last  10 days, church officials said.  </P> <P> They said that Father Stanislaw Suchowolec, 30, was apparently asphyxiated by a  fire in his apartment. Neighbors alarmed by the smoke smashed their way into  the apartment in his parish house and found him and his pet dog dead on the  floor beside his bed.  </P> <P> Suchowolec acted as a chaplain for the banned Solidarity movement in the  Bialystok region.  </P> <P> Church officials said state authorities had raised his activities as a sore  point at talks aimed at improving relations between them.  </P> <P> Suchowolec also said a monthly patriotic "Mass for the Homeland" in Bialystok  attended by anti-Communists and Solidarity supporters and supplied information  to Solidarity's national Intervention Commission, a human rights watchdog  group.  </P> <P> Father Stefan Niedzielak, a 74-year-old Warsaw priest who made his church a  shrine for Poles killed in the Soviet Union, was found dead in his apartment on  Jan. 21. A lawyer said he was apparently killed by a karate blow.  </P> <P> Father Cezary Potocki, a senior Bialystok church official, said the nature and  cause of the fire that killed Suchowolec were not immediately clear but police  were investigating.  </P> <P> Church officials said that both Niedzielak and Suchowolec were on a list of  more than 150 priests considered extremists by Poland's Communist authorities.  Both received anonymous threats and Suchowolec at times traveled with  bodyguards.  </P> <P> After Niedzielak's funeral on Thursday, demonstrators marched to the tomb of  Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity priest kidnaped and murdered by security  police in 1984, shouting, "Stop killing our priests!"  </P> <P> Warsaw police have issued contradictory statements about Niedzielak's death,  declining to confirm it was murder.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Hopes rise for restart of talks on colony's future HOPES were raised last night that China would finally agree to talks with Britain about Hong Kong's political development when the colonial government issued a statement suggesting that an announcement of renewed dialogue was expected shortly. A government spokesman said that Governor Chris Patten's executive council, his top advisory body, held a special session last night at which it was decided not to gazette a bill containing Mr Patten's proposals for a broadening of democracy in Hong Kong. He did not say when the bill would be published. On Wednesday in the legislative council, the colony's law-making body, Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, intimated that China would have to signal its agreement to talks for the government to postpone the publication of its legislation beyond the end of February. Last night, the spokesman said the government would make a statement 'explaining the position on this issue within the next few days.' It is understood the government expects this announcement will concern a return to the talks with China. Britain had planned to announce the start of talks last Wednesday, but Beijing failed to give the go-ahead. It is understood that Britain received a communication from the Chinese government suggesting it was nearing the end of deliberations which, for the past week, have left an announcement in abeyance. The UK's position has been that it was willing to talk to China about the arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections without pre-conditions. China has said it would be prepared to talk on the basis of past accords and understandings, while maintaining opposition to Mr Patten's plans.</p>

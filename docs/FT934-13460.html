			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tenneco earnings more than doubled at Dollars 116m TENNECO, the diversified US industrial company, more than doubled third-quarter operating earnings, helped by a sharp turnround at its farm and construction equipment division and improvements in its natural gas pipeline operations. Income from continuing operations advanced to Dollars 116m, or 64 cents a share, compared with Dollars 46m, or 28 cents, in the third quarter of 1992. Revenues were little changed from last year, at Dollars 3.2bn. Tenneco's heavy equipment manufacturing division, Case Corporation, reversed last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 68m to report a Dollars 10m profit in this year's quarter. Sales fell to Dollars 841m, from Dollars 848m in 1992. Case, which has undergone substantial restructuring in the past two years, will increase output in the current three months for the first time in seven quarters. A 30 per cent production increase will put Case's production for all of 1993 at the same level as 1992. Mr Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chairman, said that new pricing strategies, aggressive inventory management and quality control would continue Case's operating improvement into 1994. Tenneco Gas earned Dollars 94m in the quarter, up from Dollars 58m last year, while operating income at Tenneco's chemicals division, Albright &amp; Wilson, rose to Dollars 20m, from Dollars 15m. The natural gas division's results were aided by a favourable rate decision that added Dollars 34m to operating income in the third quarter. However, the automotive parts and packaging divisions showed only marginal income improvements, while revenues and operating income declined at the Newport News shipbuilding division. For the nine months, Tenneco's operating income rose to Dollars 852m, from Dollars 680m last time. Income from continuing operations rose to Dollars 301m, or Dollars 1.75 a share, from Dollars 131m, or 82 cents a share, last year. The company said that efficiency improvements had added about Dollars 170m to operating income since January, compared with Dollars 215m for all of 1992.</p>

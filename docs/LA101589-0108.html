			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> ROCKETS WON'T FIRE WITHOUT OLAJUWON  </P> <P> Happy-go-lucky Ray Patterson probably will be his usual happy-go-lucky self  Thursday. The Rockets' president will go to the office, greet all employees and  visitors enthusiastically, and in his private moments he will sit and smile ...  while his franchise continues to go down in flames.  </P> <P> Patterson was in a strange, upbeat mood last week when he learned Akeem  Olajuwon, his all-interplanetary center, would be unable to play in preseason  games. That seems to be a weird reason to celebrate and declare, as Patterson  did, "I'm so enthusiastic, I can't control it."  </P> <P> Patterson claimed to be happy because he had been worried Olajuwon would not be  ready to play when the regular season begins Nov. 3. Before last week, however,  Patterson never expressed concern. Obviously he and the Rockets had been  covering up the seriousness of the thrombophlebitis that forced Olajuwon to be  hospitalized for eight days in early July. Olajuwon, in fact, had been telling  close friends he did not expect to play until December.  </P> <P> But now the doctors say he will play, yet Patterson's ecstasy seems premature  and unrealistic. Olajuwon still is on blood thinners to prevent clotting in his  left calf and cannot risk contact because something as simple as a Charles  Barkley knee to the calf might cause hemorrhaging.  </P> <P> Olajuwon is allowed to participate in conditioning drills, yet there is little  doubt that when the season begins he will not be in game shape. And despite  Patterson's blind optimism: If Akeem has been slowed during the off-season  because of the leg problem, what will happen during the rigors of the 82-game  regular season? Does anyone in Houston really believe Akeem will make it  through the season unscathed?  </P> <P> The Rockets appear to be in a close-your-eyes, keep-your-fingers-crossed and  hope-for-the-best mode, but it would be rather ignorant to ignore the bleak  possibility of Olajuwon missing significant time. The Rockets weren't going to  be a great team with a healthy Olajuwon. Without him at full strength, their  chances of winning the lottery are better than their chances of winning a  title.  </P> <P> The NBA and top amateur basketball officials are expected to announce Thursday  in Colorado Springs that the NBA will join USA Basketball, the new name for the  governing body of amateur basketball in the country. What will not be announced  is that there is at least one major area of agreement between the pros and  amateurs. It is a certainty the coach of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics will be a  current or former NBA coach. The days of a Bob Knight or John Thompson getting  the job have ended.  </P> <P> But it will be a while before NBA players play for the U.S. national team.  Despite public utterings to the contrary, those familiar with negotiations have  said NBA players will not participate in international events until the 1992  Olympics. There has been speculation they might play in the 1990 Goodwill Games  in Seattle or in the 1990 World Championships in Argentina. The NBA wants to  make a grand entrance into international play, so why play in the World  Championships, which are an insignificant event in this country?  </P> <P> The World Championships, however, are important everywhere else. And national  teams in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were assured their NBA players could  return to play for their country. So the Soviet and Yugoslav NBA players  probably will participate in the 1990 World Championships, which means it is  unlikely a team of U.S. collegiate players will win. If Danny Ferry and Brian  Shaw have not signed with NBA teams, however, they would not be under NBA  jurisdiction and could be on the U.S. team. That would make the World  Championships interesting.  </P> <P> More evidence that Bill Musselman is firmly in control of the Timberwolves. The  Lakers have offered two No. 1 picks and center Mark McNamara for Rick Mahorn.  That's correct. Two No. 1 picks. The Timberwolves have rejected the deal,  saying it was a collective management decision. But General Manager Billy  McKinney is a respected basketball man and it is unlikely he would not take two  No. 1 picks -- no matter how late in the first round those picks will be -- for  a player with a bad back who is not going to win one game for an expansion  team. That decision smells of a coach who cannot judge talent and a rookie  owner, Bob Stein. With Musselman making talent decisions, the Timberwolves'  long-range prospects are dismal.  </P> <P> Rockets guard Lewis Lloyd missed practice time last week because of a bruised  foot. Seems Lew was doing a serious number on the dance floor when he felt  pain. Turns out there was a dime in his shoe, and while doing some sort of  funky hop, Lew awkwardly came down on his foot. "I kept wondering if anybody  put it in there intentionally," said Lloyd, who apparently is going to keep  closer watch.  </P> <P> And Spurs forward Terry Cummings has taken such a liking to Yugoslav forward  Zarko Paspalj that Cummings is writing and recording a song about Paspalj.  Can't wait to hear that classic. And neither can Lloyd, who probably will not  be impressed by the lyrics, but perhaps he will find the beat simply  irresistible.  </P></p>

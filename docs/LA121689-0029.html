			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KTLA PROFILE OF THE FOSTER CARE CRISIS  </P> <P> Do we really care about our children? Tune in Sunday to KTLA's stunning  dissection of the foster care crisis in Southern California before you answer.  </P> <P> "What Are We Doing to Our Children?," hosted by Susan Dey ("L.A. Law") at 8  p.m. on Channel 5, offers a stunning indictment of a grossly unwieldy  bureaucratic system that often victimizes victims, joining the abuse cycle.  </P> <P> Viewers go with police officers in investigations of child abuse. A 7-month-old  infant with apparent cigarette burns is brought to the hospital, but there's  "not enough hard evidence" to take the child into protective custody.  </P> <P> Older children are heard from, many of whom have trouble with the law after  disorienting stays in 20, 30 or even 70 foster homes. They wonder why they were  removed from their home, when the rest of the family, even the abuser, was  free. They feel punished and worthless.  </P> <P> Multiply them by thousands of troubled children. A recent congressional report  says there are 500,000 children in "out-of-home placement," a figure expected  to increase "dramatically" in the next five years.  </P> <P> "Who's going to adopt these children?" asks one angry official. "Are there long  lines of people waiting to adopt (them)?"  </P> <P> "We are creating a generation . . . who are going to turn on all of us, because  life and human beings don't have any meaning to them," predicts Helen Kleinberg  of the Children's Services Commission.  </P> <P> Blame is laid on lack of funding and unsuitable use of existing funds. A few  therapeutic programs seem to be making a difference, but they can accommodate  only a fraction of those in need.  </P> <P> It's not just the system that needs changing, says this explicit  Moses/Buckhantz production. We must question the attitudes that feed that  system. One challenging conclusion: "Our society does not value children."  LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

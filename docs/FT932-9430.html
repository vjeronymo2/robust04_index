			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (7): The mayor's monument - Nimes, 'a vital, vibrant city - not a museum' JEAN BOSQUET is not unaccustomed to the frills and formality of opening ceremonies, having presided over dozens in his dual role as chairman of Cacharel, the French fashion company, and mayor of Nimes. But the opening earlier this month of the Carre d'Art, the FFr400m museum and library designed by Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, was a special event even for Mr Bosquet. The Carre d'Art, which stands opposite the Maison Carree, an exquisite Roman temple, is the most ambitious of all the architectural schemes initiated by Mr Bosquet in his decade as mayor. When Mr Bosquet was elected, Nimes was a firm fixture on the Mediterranean tourist trail, thanks to its Roman amphitheatre, the Maison Carree and its labyrinthine 18th century centre, but it was also a sleepy city with a dwindling population. The new mayor decided to put his city, and himself, on the map by making the most of the new urban planning powers devolved down to regional government by the socialists' decentralisation strategy. Just as President Francois Mitterrand embarked upon his grands projets, the monumental modern architectural schemes in Paris, so Mr Bosquet launched his own petits projets in Nimes. Jean Nouvel, the futuristic French architect behind the L'Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris, was commissioned to build the ship-shaped Nemausus public housing project. Vittorio Gregotti designed the Costieres sports stadium. Philippe Starck, the funky Paris designer, dreamed up a new city insignia and a bus stop. But the most spectacular scheme of all is the Carre d'Art. It is Sir Norman's first commission in France and one of his few buildings in an urban, rather than a rural, context. He conceived it as a contemporary counterpart to the Maison Carree. The Carre d'Art is a thoroughly modern monument in glass and steel, modelled on the columns of the original temple. Inside the Carre d'Art is Nimes' 20th century art collection, which includes works by Picasso, Richard Long, Julian Schnabel and Marcel Duchamp. It also doubles as a library, thus fulfilling the same role for Nimes as the Centre Georges Pompidou for Paris. There are other petits projets still in the pipeline, notably the construction of the new university (to accommodate 4,000 students) beside the 17th century Fort Vauban. But the emphasis of Mr Bosquet's policy is now moving towards a long-term urban planning initiative intended to redefine the entire city, by reinforcing its boundaries and fusing the ancient and modern aspects of its architecture. 'It's a question of coherence,' says Mr Joseph Juvin, head of Nimes Agence d'Urbanisme. 'We want Nimes to be a vital, vibrant city, not a museum.' This linchpin of this policy is the creation of a grand axe, a central axis cutting through the city from the Jardins de la Fontaine in its ancient centre to the tiny villages on its fringes. The architect is the same as for the centrepiece of Mr Bosquet's petits projets - Sir Norman Foster.</p>

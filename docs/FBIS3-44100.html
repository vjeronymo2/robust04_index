			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Clear ANC Economic Policy Required -- "As the outflow of  capital increases alarmingly, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals  calls on the ANC [African National Congress] to help staunch the  flow," notes a page 20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 25 January. "What is required, he says, is a final  and clear statement on the organisation's economic policies.  Many of South Africa's older citizens would also like the ANC's  comment on disturbing speculation that a new government will  scrap a major tax concession on retirement annuities. Stals is  right: uncertainty is contributing to the flood, and the ANC  should speak loud and clear before it is too late."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Policy Contribution to Balance of Payments Exaggerated  --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 January in a page 8  editorial notes that Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals "blamed  uncertainty over the ANC's economic policy for most of the  R[rand]10bn [billion] outflow" in the second half of 1993.  According to Stals the "pre-election ANC ambiguity could worsen  the haemorrhage on the capital account of the balance of  payments. But Stals is probably exaggerating the contribution  of ANC economic policy -- or lack of it -- to balance of  payments problems." "Most foreign banks do not want to make  commitments beyond April," but the reason for that "probably has  more to do with political stability than with ANC economic  policy." So the ANC will be careful about responding to Stals's  call for a clearer ANC economic policy, "as it balances the risk  of losing votes with the knowledge that no major turnaround in  the balance of payments can be expected until after the  election. It should nevertheless place more emphasis on its  commitment to financial discipline."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   S. Africa Able To Influence Events in Lesotho -- South  African Foreign Minister Pik Botha's "smugness over what is  happening in Lesotho is discomforting," declares a page 8  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 25 January.  "South Africa was involved in the various military governments  that have affected that kingdom's fortunes. There is no doubt  that South Africa is able to influence events in Lesotho in  various ways. It can close the border gates and, at best, can  send in armed forces to help Mokhehle. There is no need for  Botha to be so smarmy about the misfortunes currently befalling  this unhappy country."    Furore Over 'Communists' on ANC Election List -- A second  editorial on the same page says the "furore over the number of  SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC's  parliamentary list is amusing but shows the hard ball that will  be played in events running up to the elections." In the  election fight the ANC's opponents will "deliberately forget or  ignore the fact that the link with the SACP goes back many  years. There will be an attempt to use the communist bogeyman  to scare white voters from the organisation. And while all this  is quite silly, it will be the way in which the elections are to  be fought."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Zulu Leaders Must Reconsider Boycott Strategy --  Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 January says in a page 8 editorial:  "When King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi began to beat the ethnic drums last year over the  so-called elimination of the Zulus, BEELD warned that fires were  being fanned which could be difficult to douse." "The stayaway  action which was planned as a show of strength to coincide with  the king's meeting with the state president was purportedly not  arranged by Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, but that is  purely academic. The IFP leader, who has always strongly  opposed any stayaways and consumer boycotts by the ANC and its  allies on account of the economic disruption caused, this time  gloated over the Zulu nationalists' actions. The fires which  have been fanned for the past months flared dangerously on the  Reef in the form of vehicle hijackings, intimidation, arson,  violence, and even loss of life. These actions by the followers  of the two leaders will not promote their cause or win them new  friends in the black community or even among moderate whites.  The politically 'neutral' Zulu monarch has now been dumped  knee-deep in the political arena -- a step he might regret.  There is an urgent need for the two leaders to think seriously  about their boycott strategy. It is based on incorrect facts  and misconceptions and is being spurred on by misplaced  political ambitions."    Dialogue Needed on ANC Reconstruction Plan -- A second  editorial on page 8 points out: "There is no doubt that the  ANC's plan for economic and social reconstruction has  fundamental shortcomings. The question is, what must be done to  ensure a better and more workable plan?" BEELD concludes: "We  firmly believe there is a growing number of white South Africans  who accept the realities of their fatherland, and understand  that they will be asked to make sacrifices. But then the  demands made on them must be realistic and fair, and above all  must not be perceived as punishment. If the ANC takes note of  that, the basis will be laid for a sober debate on an explosive  issue."    `Limited Violence' Not Easily Controlled -- General Constand  Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner National Front, AVF, speaks  of 'limited violence' to achieve the Afrikaner homeland. He  might believe he can keep it limited, but I am not so certain,"  argues Willie Kuhn in his "Political BEELD" column on page 10 of  the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January. "One example  suffices: It appears that there is an onslaught on members and  property of the ANC in the Orange Free State. One cannot be  sure who is responsible, but it would be surprising if it were  not the right wing. Let's assume this pattern continues. Does  Gen. Viljoen believe there will be no reaction? We will then be  back in the eighties; violence begets violence."    Mandela Outbursts Against De Klerk `Inopportune' --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January in a page 10  editorial criticizes Mandela's "two-facedness". "Mr. Mandela  accuses President de Klerk of orchestrating violence in the  townships with the aim of stopping the ANC from winning the  April elections." BEELD questions why Mandela resorts to this  when he and De Klerk are presently engaged in talks to try and  find a solution to the violence in black townships. "Or does he  want to wreck this peace plan for the townships?" One can  understand that the ANC, co-responsible for "the bloody  political battle in black townships," is eager to win the  election, but then one at least expects a future state president  to be more careful when talking about the present head of state.  His unproven allegations are not promoting the political climate  and feeds the general idea that "what he says today contradicts  what he says the following day." This will affect his  credibility.    "The first welcome fruits of joint control over the security  forces are being reaped," notes a second editorial on the same  page. "The ANC's announcement that a campaign is to be launched  in unrest areas on the East Rand to 'educate' residents to  accept the police and Defense Force and to stop attacks on them,  is a direct result of the extensive democratization process  currently underway in the country." "The sooner other  organizations copy this example, the quicker the quality of life  will improve for all South Africans." The ANC should, however,  refrain from creating the perception that the security forces  are an extension of any particular political grouping, for this  will only exacerbate existing problems. "Ultimately, it is the  community in general that must make the security forces feel  welcome."</p>

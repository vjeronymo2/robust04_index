			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BARRIER DIVIDES MEETING ON MIGRANT SAFETY;  </P> <P> FATALITIES: OPINION IS SPLIT ON WHETHER A 10-FOOT HIGH FREEWAY-MEDIAN BARRIER  WOULD REDUCE THE CARNAGE OF ALIENS.  </P> <P> Immigrant advocates and enforcement officials seeking ways to reduce accidents  involving undocumented pedestrians on San Diego-area freeways clashed Thursday  over a proposal to erect 10-foot-high barriers along parts of Interstate 5.  </P> <P> While representatives of the U.S. Border Patrol and the California Highway  Patrol strongly endorsed the barrier concept, immigrant representatives from  San Diego and Orange County voiced fears that such a step could result in more  injuries by trapping exhausted and frightened immigrants in the median strips  of hazardous expressways.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to save one life," Lee Steelman, a member of the  Human Resources Committee of the city of San Clemente, said during an  informational meeting in Oceanside sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace  (D-Chula Vista.) "I just see panic."  </P> <P> Meantime, the California Department of Transportation, which is contemplating  the construction of freeway barriers, disclosed that it had decided to halve  the number of traffic lanes from 8 to 4 on the approximately 3-mile strip of  I-5 near the U.S.-Mexico border where most of the accidents occur.  </P> <P> The hope, Caltrans officials said, is that fewer lanes and consequently  slower-moving traffic will reduce the frequency of pedestrian injuries in the  targeted area, along I-5 between the international boundary and the off-ramps  leading to California Highway 905.  </P> <P> Studies have shown that the reduction in lanes -- the northbound and southbound  roadways each would be cut from 4 to 2 lanes -- should not significantly hamper  the flow of traffic, said Stuart Harvey, deputy district director for the  Caltrans district office in San Diego. The move is "not irreversible," Harvey  added, explaining that the other lanes could be restored if traffic tie-ups did  develop. The change is planned for sometime early next year, Harvey said.  </P> <P> "We're breaking new ground here . . . in dealing with an extraordinarily  unusual problem," Harvey said.  </P> <P> Thursday's meeting was the latest in a series of sessions designed to devise  solutions to the bloody problem, which has seen San Diego-area freeways emerge  in recent years as death traps for scores of undocumented immigrants en route  north from the border. Since January 1987, according to the California Highway  Patrol, 101 immigrant pedestrians have been killed and an additional 110  injured after being struck by vehicles on area expressways. The problem is  unique to San Diego, one of the world's busiest migratory corridors.  </P> <P> Two major trouble spots have emerged: The 3-mile strip of I-5 just north of the  border, and, 70 miles to the north, an 8-mile section of I-5 in Camp Pendleton.  The border-area freeway presents a barrier to undocumented immigrants who have  just crossed from Tijuana, and the more northern section is regularly crossed  on foot by immigrants attempting to evade detection at the Border Patrol  checkpoint at San Onofre.  </P> <P> In recent years, authorities attempting to reduce the carnage have taken a  number of steps, including increasing freeway lighting; thinning roadside brush  that provides cover for border-jumpers; posting warning signs advising  motorists of the danger; and the airing of public service spots on television  and radio publicizing the threat. The number of deaths has mounted anyway.  </P> <P> This year, the Border Patrol has attempted to devise strategies to keep  migrants off the freeways, and the California Highway Patrol has increased  officer presence near the checkpoint in an effort to reduce motorists' speed.  </P> <P> Authorities have voiced the hope that the cumulative strategies are having some  impact. No immigrant pedestrians have been killed on the freeways in two  months, officials say, although several have been injured.  </P> <P> Gustavo De la Vina, chief Border Patrol agent, said agents are now spotting  about 100 people along the median of I-5 in the border area on a typical  Saturday, down from almost 500 a month ago. He credited patrols deployed to  force immigrants away from roadways.  </P> <P> Next year, Caltrans plans to erect changeable message signs along I-5 in the  border area. The signs will be used to warn motorists that pedestrians might be  on the road.  </P> <P> Meantime, other strategies are under consideration, including the controversial  proposal to build 10-feet-high metal barriers in the freeway medians in the two  principal danger zones. Caltrans says it will make a decision on whether to  proceed with construction of the barriers sometime early next year, possibly  after holding public hearings on the issue.  </P> <P> Supporters say such unscalable barriers would discourage immigrants from  embarking on the hazardous dash across the expressways.  </P> <P> "There's no question that something like this would help," said Capt. Ron  Phulps of the California Highway Patrol, in comments echoed by De la Vina of  the Border Patrol.  </P> <P> But immigrant advocates say immigrants would probably just walk around the  barriers -- or, worse, become trapped and panicked in the median areas.  </P></p>

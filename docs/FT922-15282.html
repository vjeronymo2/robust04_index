			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Minimum wage can safeguard skills Sir, During the last century, when faced with children going to school instead of working long hours in their factories, the Spinning Masters forecast loss of work and business going abroad. We had the same dire warnings about the minimum wage from today's textile employers ('Election 1992' March 30). We are a relatively small textile company with modest factories in Leeds, High Wycombe and South Wales. Nobody working in this company is paid less than Pounds 3.40 per hour because, in normal times, to keep our skilled staff and attract new good calibre people into the company, we have to pay more than the proposed minimum wage. We will succeed in the single European market only by being quicker and more effective than the competition, and to achieve this a better trained and more skilled workforce is essential. If the minimum wage acts as an impetus to improve the skills, versatility and training of the workforce this will be welcomed by the industry generally. It would be helpful if this could be introduced in a way which gives firms time to upgrade their manufacturing processes but Labour's incentives to better training and more investment will help. A minimum wage has operated in the US for over 30 years and your correspondent Edward Balls ('Higher minimum wage, more hamburger') doesn't think that it has done them much harm. I wonder if the real worry is not the effect of the minimum wage on controlling costs by eroding the easy 'hire and fire' regime we have in this country.

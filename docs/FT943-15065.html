			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Budget deficit falling in Australia The Australian government yesterday reported a preliminary budget deficit for 1993-94 of ADollars 13.7bn (Pounds 6.5bn), close to the ADollars 13.6bn revised forecast made in May but ADollars 2.3bn lower than the original forecast in the budget statement of August last year. The result will boost the Labor government's hopes of being on course to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97. At 3.2 per cent of GDP, the 1993-94 deficit is down from the 3.6 per cent of GDP recorded in the previous year. For the financial year which began this month, the government is banking on the recent surge of economic growth to reduce the deficit to 2.5 per cent of GDP, at ADollars 11.7bn. During the three months to March, the latest quarter for which figures are available, Australia's economy grew at 5 per cent on an annualised basis, exceeding both the markets' and the government's expectations. The 1993-94 budget deficit was held down by delays in implementing some of the government's job creation programmes and an unexpectedly low take-up of jobs subsidies. Outlays were ADollars 360m lower than the May forecast. Revenue was ADollars 440m lower than the May estimate because of lower personal and corporate tax collection. The strong economic growth during the March quarter has triggered fears of a rise in interest rates. Speculation intensified earlier this month with the publication of data showing a widening in the current account deficit and a strong growth in building approvals in May. Some banks have raised their fixed rates for home loans. Markets are awaiting Friday's figures on building activity during the March 1994 quarter to gauge how much inflationary pressure exists.</p>

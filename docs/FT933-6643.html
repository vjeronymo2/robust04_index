			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Hemingway HEMINGWAY Properties yesterday announced increased pre-tax losses for the half year to end-June, mainly due to a number of recurring items. Losses amounted to Pounds 581,000 (Pounds 332,000). Among the exceptional costs were compensation payments to two former directors amounting to Pounds 110,000. During June and July a number of transactions were completed, including the Pounds 30.2m acquisition of a properties portfolio, a Pounds 21.9m placing and open offer and the Pounds 21.8m cash disposal of Dorset House. These transactions, the company said, would not have an impact until the second half. In addition, prior to the period end, the company disposed of two office properties for an aggregate Pounds 3.3m. Net turnover increased from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 4.58m. Losses per share were 1.07p (0.61p). The directors plan to seek shareholders' approval for a reduction in the share capital to cancel the accumulated deficit on the profit and loss account to December 31 1993.</p>

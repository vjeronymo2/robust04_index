			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: Femme fatale of the 18th century art world - The life and work of the beguiling Angelica Kauffman Why was Angelica Kauffman one of the most celebrated artists in late 18th century Britain? The current reappraisal of her work at Brighton Museum and Art Gallery (until January 3), shows that her success resulted not so much from her skill as a painter than from her choice of subjects. Did the fact that she was an attractive young woman help? Maybe, but there was more to her than that. The Swiss-born painter settled in London with her artist-father in 1766 after spending seven years studying and copying the old masters and classical antiquities in Italy, and making a name for herself with a handful of polished Grand Tour portraits. Like the much more talented Artemisia Gentileschi who came to Britain a century before, she was a far rarer bird than the average female painter. For she was a history painter, and as such commanded the utmost respect from her peers. Her beauty and talent certainly beguiled the art establishment. There appears to have been an engagement to Nathaniel Dance in Italy, a marriage proposal from Sir Joshua Reynolds, and impassioned advances from her fellow ex-patriate Heinrich Fuseli. She was admired by Goethe and Winckelmann, even seduced by the Revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat - all of which makes her something of an 18th century Alma Mahler. Like Artemesia, she received considerable acclaim for her representations of history and literature's female heroines, though there are none of the former's vulnerable Biblical Susannas and decapitating Judiths. Angelica preferred Penelope, the devoted wife and mother who waits patiently for Ulysses' return, or Andromache and Armida who endeavour to prevent their menfolk from going to war. There are affecting tearful reunions, grieving mothers and saccharine allegories of love. Male painters also chose moralising and sentimental themes from classical history and contemporary literature, but the poignancy of having such tender moments expressed by a woman's hand would have been irresistible. No doubt it was subject-matter and style rather more than sentiment that appealed to Sir Joshua. His heartfelt wish was to promote a national school of history painting and 'improve' public taste with scenes of heroism, patriotism and familial piety. Little wonder that Angelica Kauffman was warmly welcomed to Britain and invited in 1768 to be a founder member of the Royal Academy of Arts, an institution which in its early days showed no prejudice against women or foreigners. Brighton's second exhibition gallery is devoted to such academic histories - but what arid puffs of pomposity they are. They fail completely - rather as the fashionable conceptual-minimalist art fails today - to move or even to engage any but the most fanatical. Far from inspiring, they are unconvincing, formulaic and bloodless. It is perhaps unfortunate for Angelica Kauffman that Neo-Classicism now seems one of the least alluring episodes in the history of art. Only the great Jacques-Louis David could rise above the prevailing tide of sterile academicism to create cool but never unfeeling tragedies in paint. The British public, excepting a handful of academicians, critics and the odd patron like John Parker of Saltram Park, cared far more for her portraits and decorative works. At their best, the former have considerable charm. The famed beauty Lady Elizabeth Foster, later Duchess of Devonshire, with a vista across the Bay of Naples and Ischia stretching behind her, is one such treat; the unidentified classically draped lady with a statue of Minerva is a more typical English pudding. The exhibition selectors have presented this woman painter primarily as a painter of women. Her portraits of men are far more sympathetic. Why hide her direct and intimate portrait of Garrick, say, turning to look at us over the back of a rustic chair? The only single male portrait here, of her friend Joshua Reynolds in Van Dyck costume, straining as if to catch inspiration from the bust of his hero Michelangelo placed by his side, is a work of real quality and affection. The final section of the show treats Angelica Kauffman's considerable and long-lasting influence on interior decoration and the decorative arts, which was made possible by the numerous prints made after her paintings and designs. Prints line the walls. Vitrines house Derby, Vienna and Paris porcelain, enamel plaques, Wedgwood medallions, tea trays and textiles all decorated a la Kauffman. Coutts &amp; Co, for instance, lend a delightful late 18th century commode decorated with her scenes illustrating Homer's Odyssey. An essay in the informative book accompanying the show, Angelica Kauffman: A Continental Artist in Georgian England, edited by Wendy Wassyng Roworth (Reaktion Books Ltd, Pounds 9.95) finally lays to rest the myth that almost every pretty Arcadian fancy set into an Adam interior is her work. There are only two documented instances of her personal involvement; one is her painting of four roundels in the vestibule of Burlington House, the present home of the Royal Academy. This is hardly surprising, since she remained in England for a mere 15 years, before the lure of the classical South proved too great.</p>

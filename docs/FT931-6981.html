			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Reshaped Dunkeld in black DUNKELD Group, the clothing manufacturer which recently completed a financial restructuring, turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.45m for the year to November 30. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 17.5m last time and was struck on turnover almost halved from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 19.7m. However, last year's profits were restated to conform with the FRS 3 accounting standard and included some Pounds 10m of restructuring costs. At the operating level, profits amounted to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 4.43m losses), of which continuing operations contributed Pounds 1.53m from turnover of Pounds 17m. The reconstructed group now has two trading divisions, shirts and swimwear, both of which traded profitably in 1992. Earnings per share came out at 3.16p (29.21p losses).</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Right-winger Lord Ridley dies aged 64 Conservative peer Lord Ridley, one of his party's most controversial and acerbic members, died yesterday at his home near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He was 64. The staunch right-winger, who acknowledged 'I smoke hard,' had been ill for some months. Sickness did not prevent his going to the House of Lords last month to make a last denunciation of the Maastricht Treaty which he bitterly opposed. Obituary, Page 4</p>

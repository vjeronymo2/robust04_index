			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh by station </F> correspondent Thanh Hai on her visits to Algeria, Mali, Guinea,  and Guinea Bissau, and her meeting with French President  Francois Mitterrand; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Summary] Requested by Thanh Hai to outline the general  purpose of the trip, its overall results as well as particular  achievements in each of the country she visited, Nguyen Thi Binh  said that "while we are carrying out the multi-faceted and  multilateral policy, we should not forget our old friends. The  primary goal of my trip was to consolidate and promote  traditional and friendly relations with countries who are our  long-time friends. The countries I visited are also in the  process of developing their economies where cooperation and  solidarity with other countries are essential, so the second  goal of my trip was to study the possibility of cooperation  between Vietnam and these countries in economic, trade,  cultural, and social fields, and to exchange experiences in  national construction."    Nguyen Thi Binh also revealed that she and her delegation  have made "a number of agreements on economic, trade, cultural,  science, and technology cooperation. The leaders of the  countries I visited wanted us to help them in agricultural  development."    She added that the leaders and people of these countries  understood well the political and economic developments in  Vietnam. They highly regarded achievements of the Vietnamese  Government and people in renovating the economy and improving  ties with the world community. As a representative of Vietnam,  she was warmly and solemnly welcomed at all the countries she  visited. The Algerian and Malian governments also conferred  noble orders on her.    Asked to assess the prospects of cooperation between Vietnam  and these countries in particular and Africa in general, Nguyen  Thi Binh said presently both Vietnam and the African "friends"  have limited capital, thus making economic cooperation  difficult. However, Africa is a "potentially large market for  Vietnamese agricultural produce and consumer goods" thus  "promising mutually beneficial cooperation in the future."    Asked about her impression on meetings with the French  President Francois Mitterrand and the ministers of foreign  affairs and cultural and francophone affairs, Nguyen Thi Binh  said that although these were only courtesy calls, she had a  chance to exchange views with French leaders on issues of common  concern. She said: "The most profound impression I got from  these meetings was that the ties between Vietnam and the world  community in general, and France in particular, are constantly  improving. The French leaders as well as businessmen wish to  promote cooperation with Vietnam in all fields, which we  heartily welcome."</p>

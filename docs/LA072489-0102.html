			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXXON PROFITS DIVE $1 BILLION 2ND QUARTER;  </P> <P> 87% PLUNGE TIED TO $850 MILLION IN OIL CLEANUP COSTS  </P> <P> Exxon Corp.'s second-quarter profits plunged by more than $1 billion, largely  due to an estimated $850-million cost associated with the nation's worst oil  spill, the company reported today.  </P> <P> Net income fell 87% to $160 million, or 13 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or  90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter, Exxon said.  </P> <P> Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said the drop was the result of "a special  provision" allowing for an estimated $850 million, or 67 cents a share, in  cleanup costs for the March 24 spill of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Alaska's  Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> Without the special provision, Smith said the company's second-quarter earnings  would have been $1.01 billion, or 80 cents a share.  </P> <P> The company said the charge "does not include the potential effect of  litigation, which cannot reasonably be assessed at this time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $600 Million Spent  </P> <P> Exxon has already spent about $600 million on cleaning up the spill, the worst  in U.S. history, Smith said.  </P> <P> He stressed the $850 million is only an approximate cost including estimated  expenses and estimated insurance recoveries, and cautioned against drawing the  conclusion that there is only $250 million remaining to be spent in the  cleanup.  </P> <P> Exxon has previously disclosed it had an estimated $400 million in spill  insurance.  </P> <P> Exxon revenues for the second quarter were $23.61 billion compared with $21.63  billion for the same period in 1988, Smith said.  </P> <P> Investors reacted negatively to the announcement, with Exxon off $1.125 a share  at $45.625 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Michael Young of Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York said he  changed his rating of Exxon stock this morning from a "hold" to an "avoid."  </P> <P> Young said he had anticipated the sharp earnings drop since last week because  congressional testimony indicated a write-off of this magnitude as a result of  of the cleanup costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consensus at Odds  </P> <P> Another analyst, who declined comment until he had seen the actual Exxon  numbers, said the consensus among analysts had been that Exxon would report  higher operating earnings, before the write-off, than 80 cents a share.  </P> <P> The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez  fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline.  </P> <P> The cost of the Valdez spill appears likely to approach that of the March,  1979, near-meltdown at the Three Mile Island No. 2 nuclear power plant in  Pennsylvania. Cleanup efforts in that accident, which continue after more than  10 years, have cost General Public Utilities Corp. an estimated $1 billion.  </P> <P> Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said that despite the cost of the cleanup, Exxon's  financial condition remains strong. "We are continuing to pursue our long-term  business strategies and to implement planned capital programs," he said.  </P></p>

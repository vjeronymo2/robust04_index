			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Moving fees knock 14% off Bentalls BENTALLS, which owns six department stores in the south-east, announced pre-tax profits down 14 per cent from Pounds 3.86m to Pounds 3.32m in the 53 weeks to February 2 1991 - a year which saw a new location for the flagship store and headquarters. After steps to maintain margins, second-half operating profits showed improvement. Turnover last year fell to Pounds 70.73m (Pounds 71.85m). Sales at the new store in Kingston-upon-Thames, usually accounting for more than half group turnover, were affected by building works and competition from a new John Lewis branch. Costs included fitting out the Kingston store (Pounds 13.5m net) and an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.4m for the move. Bentalls is a partner to Norwich Union in a shopping centre development at Kingston, to be opened in September 1992. Its contribution is being financed by a loan facility of Pounds 25m from Natwest, of which Pounds 18m has been drawn down. The company has a 23.6 per cent stake in the project's rental income. This is expected to exceed the guaranteed Pounds 1.65m per year, coming closer to Pounds 2.5m. Property revaluations put the company's investment property at Pounds 75.9m, of which the discounted value of the Bentall Centre project is Pounds 33.5m. This increases shareholders' funds to Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 25.75m) and raises net asset value from 62p to 169p per ordinary share. The final dividend of 3.25p leaves the total unchanged at 3.85p on reduced earnings per share of 4.87p (5.59p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 11 Mar (EFE) -- A group of 26 Cuban lawyers  today requested approval by the People's Government National  Assembly [ANPP] (parliament) of a "broad amnesty" to "help  alleviate social tensions."    In a note delivered today to the press and signed by this  group of lawyers who say they represent various ideas, the group  states the request was made on 24 February in a letter addressed  to the ANPP deputies who on that date had served one year since  the time of their election.    The amnesty request includes prisoners for crimes "against  state security" or for illegal departures or entries, those  imprisoned for being a "menace to society," and those officials  penalized while exercising their duties in office.    The lawyers state that in 35 years of the revolution, there  has never been an amnesty, "even though it is included in Cuban  legislation." The lawyers also say many of the individuals who  will probably attend the conference with the Cuban community  abroad, which the government has scheduled for April, "left the  island where they were born for the same reasons why the others  are imprisoned today."    The lawyers' letter concludes: "We are not moved by  political passion or ideological stands, rather, by the purpose  of helping alleviate social tensions of the fatherland with the  resources of our profession and your solidarity."</p>

Sha'th told MBC in Washington today that he discussed the  Palestinian demands in this regard with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.    [Begin recording] [MBC correspondent in Washington 'Aziz  Fahmi] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher received Dr.  Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, in Washington this morning in an attempt to settle the  current differences between the two sides over the Palestinians'  return to the negotiating table. The Americans want the  negotiations to resume now and then discuss during the  negotiations securing protection for the Palestinians and  disarming the settlers. But the Palestinians want to settle this  before they return to the negotiating table as a condition for  the resumption of the negotiations.    The MBC met Dr. Sha'th before he left for the State  Department to meet Warren Christopher.    [Sha'th] We are here for negotiations with the U.S. side to  secure all means of international protection, disarming the  settlers, and the necessary security measures to guarantee  security for the Palestinian people. These are the requirements  for restoring momentum to the peace process to complete our  achievements. Hence, I believe the U.S. side understands that  there is need for Palestinian security but it should understand  that this requires measures, not just an expression of  principles.    [Fahmi] What if they refuse?    [Sha'th] We do not jump to conclusions. We have come here to  meet Secretary Christopher to get what we want. So I cannot  begin the talks by expecting a rejection.    [Fahmi] Meanwhile, press sources cited the PLO  representative  at the United Nations as saying that Dr. Nabil Sha'th must  discuss with Warren Christopher the deadlocked UN discussions.  It is known that the United States suspended these discussions  until it reaches agreement with the Palestinians on drafting the  resolution due to be passed by the Security Council. The  Palestinians' main aim now is to secure Israel's and United  States' consent to the principle of the presence of  international observers to protect the Palestinians in the  occupied territories. Israel has rejected this demand since it  occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. [end recording]</p>

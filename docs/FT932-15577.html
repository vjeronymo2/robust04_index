			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Hungary raises trade defences AT Hungary's Hegyeshalom frontier post, customs officers used to search for smuggled currency and subversive literature from the west. This Easter weekend, three years after the iron curtain disintegrated, customs officers on both sides of the Austro-Hungarian border spent their time blocking the passage of meat and livestock in both directions. For Hegyeshalom is on a new front-line in the first tit-for-tat trade conflict between western Europe and its eastern neighbours since their association agreements with the EC came into effect just over a year ago. The European Community last week ordered a one-month blanket ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products from across eastern Europe. Ostensibly the aim is to suppress foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious virus affecting cattle, sheep and pigs. An outbreak in Italy has been traced to imports of live cattle from the Yugoslav successor states. But east European governments doubt the EC's good faith. Officials privately suspect agricultural protectionism motivated the European Commission's decision. Budapest and Warsaw quickly retaliated with their own prohibition on imports and transit of meat and livestock from the EC. Hungary and claimed it would lose exports of Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) and Poland estimated Dollars 30m. Both countries said they were unaffected by the disease. The east European reaction was unprecedented in speed, confidence and anger. The dispute is symptomatic of a broader trend. East European governments are wiser now about the gap between liberal trade rhetoric and hardball practice. The political momentum behind liberalisation of trade between east and west is fading; and protectionist pressures in both halves of Europe are growing. The Commission recently prolonged dumping duties against steel tubes and pipes, primarily from former Czechoslovakia. Beyond that the EC is issuing guideline prices for other steel products in order to assess dumping; working on a new system of tariff quotas for steel; and floating the idea of 'voluntary restrictions' on east European producers. Austria, outside the EC and the most exposed to eastern competition, is scheduled this week to apply what officials call 'emergency brakes' on imports of east European cement, fertilisers and tractors. US officials say there is a real possibility that the Clinton administration will blacklist Hungary as an unfair trader alongside South Korea. The US accuses Hungarian pharmaceutical companies of pirating US drugs. Prospects are poor for a crucial round of negotiations on the issue this week. East European countries are themselves moving tentatively in the direction of protection. Poland is due to announce a new set of customs duties this month. Hungary is considering 18 tariff increases on paper and other goods. The measures come against a background of spreading political demands to restrict imports. Mr Istvan Major, Hungary's deputy state secretary for trade, identifies a general 'back-pedalling' on open markets all over eastern Europe. Eastern Europe could find that defences against imports backfire. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's external economic affairs commissioner, has urged east European governments to refrain from trade protection if they want improved access to EC markets. He said that east European governments needed only to be patient until the forthcoming EC summit in Copenhagen, where the EC hopes to go beyond the rather limited association agreements in opening up its markets. But east European governments are worried that EC concessions, if any, will come too late to dampen the momentum for trade defences.</p>

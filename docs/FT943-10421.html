			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: White House plan to revive fast-track negotiating The Clinton administration will next week seek to include a fast-track negotiating authority in the Uruguay Round implementing legislation so it can negotiate additional free trade agreements with Chile and other eligible trading partners. Fast-track authority allows the executive branch to negotiate trade agreements which Congress promises not to amend. The administration's request for a seven-year fast-track negotiating authority has been in trouble for weeks, and a compromise proposal to a joint committee is seen as its last hope of resurrecting the authority. Senator Daniel Moynihan, the committee chairman, on Tuesday stunned the Washington trade establishment when he pronounced the renewal of the negotiating authority 'dead' for this year. Republicans oppose administration plans to include environmental and labour provisions in future free trade pacts. Many Democrats are refusing to agree to a fast-track authority without inclusion of labour and environment language. The Senate finance committee, writing the implementing legislation, has refused to approve a compromise 2 1/2 -year fast-track authority. But administration officials said they would seek to insert it when representatives of the finance committee and the House ways and means committee meet to work out final implementation of Uruguay Round legislation. There is concern that a failure to get fast-track will damage the administration's credibility. The finance committee also refused to go along with an administration plan, supported by the textile and apparel industries, to alter the way rules of origin are calculated. It rejected a proposal to revise current rules to designate the place of origin as the place where a product is sewn rather than cut. The committee extended for five years the Super 301 law, which permits the US to list unfair trade practices with the objective of erasing trade barriers.</p>

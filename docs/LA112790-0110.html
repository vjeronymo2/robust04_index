Wagner had 21 kills and  18 digs in Lynbrook's second-round victory over Vacaville.  </P> <P> Other top players for Lynbrook include setter Dawn Hill and outside hitters  Julie Dare and Summer Love.  </P> <P> La Habra enters the Division II final with a 43-match winning streak.

St. Joseph's top players are Erin Balderama and Jaime  Torromeo.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar has played La Habra and St. Joseph this year. The Sea Kings lost  to La Habra in the finals of the Orange County Championships and beat St.  Joseph in the Southern Section 5-A semifinals two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised if St. Joseph beats La Habra," Flickinger said.  </P></p>

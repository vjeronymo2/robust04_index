			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Technology: A serious investment - Rob Causey counts the cost of building today's chip plants All businesses are under pressure to cut costs, but the problem is particularly acute in the Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46bn) semiconductor market. A new computer chip factory needs an investment of up to Dollars 1bn and only the largest and most profitable players can afford this. Thus medium-sized semiconductor companies have been changing the way they make chips in order to stay at the leading edge of technology without paying this vast bill. In April, Intel, the world's largest chip supplier, announced it would invest Dollars 1bn in a plant in New Mexico to start production in 1995. Its US rivals, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola and Texas Instruments, have all followed suit over the past six months. Such large sums have caused even the large Japanese companies to worry about making a return on their investment. Takao Nakano, general manager of Mitsubishi Electric's Kumamoto plant, said earlier this year that R&amp;D investment to produce leading-edge memory devices would rise from 9 per cent of sales in 1991 to 20 per cent of sales in 2000, if current trends continued. Investment on production equipment would rise from 13 per cent to 70 per cent of sales over the same period, he predicted. Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel, put it more bluntly. 'The entry fee to be a major player in the global semiconductor market of the 1990s is Dollars 1bn, payable in advance.' This has led even the largest chip companies to form alliances, such as those between IBM, Toshiba and Siemens, AMD and Hewlett-Packard, and NEC and AT&amp;T, to share the cost. The medium-sized companies, which in the chip business means anyone with sales of less than Dollars 2bn, do not have these options. Micron Technology of the US has traditionally competed at the leading edge of the memory business, but had sales of only Dollars 557m last year. Its president, Steve Appleton, has the problem of keeping up without paying the Dollars 1bn price. 'You have to target your R&amp;D money,' he says. 'If I give you a shovel and tell you to dig a 1 sq ft hole, and you come back to me and say it's a bit tough, will it help if I say: 'Okay, here's 100 more people to help you dig a 1ft hole'?' The manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process, involving both printing and baking. A round piece of silicon, or wafer, is put into an oven and a layer of silicon oxide baked on to its surface. Some of the chip's circuit patterns are then printed on to the oxide and the oxide around these patterns is etched away. Chemicals are then burned into the silicon surface. This process is repeated, with more circuit elements built up on top, until the chip is finished. Each stage requires a specialised piece of equipment, costing about Dollars 4m and adding up to about Dollars 600m of the Dollars 1bn total. One way to cut the cost of the factory is to buy less equipment; a number of companies have been working on ways of making more chips with fewer machines. When Appleton talks about targeting R&amp;D money, he means using as few printing stages or 'masks' as possible. To make 4Mbit memories, Micron uses 11 masks; some rivals use 21. 'I get twice the output for the same piece of equipment, because I only have to process a wafer for half the time.' A Dutch company, ASM Lithography, which makes printing machines (steppers), is helping to cut equipment costs. Its latest steppers are designed to allow the lenses that focus the circuit image on the wafer to be replaced when new technology becomes available. This means companies do not have to buy new steppers every time technology advances. Another Dollars 250m of the Dollars 1bn goes on air conditioning. The circuit designs on most wafers are so small that a microscopic piece of dust can cause a short circuit. Thus the air has to be extremely clean. ASM's steppers blow inert gas on to the centre of each wafer. As this gas flows to the edge of the wafer, it carries dirt away with it, preventing damage to the circuits. This technique allows wafers to be kept clean inside machines which themselves are not standing in the cleanest part of the plant. The chip maker can then reduce the amount of air cleaned to the highest standard and keep costs down. SGS-Thomson Microelectronics has just started making chips at a plant near Grenoble in France which, when completed, will have cost Dollars 500m and have 3,400 sq m of floor space at so-called 'class one' cleanliness. AMD's new Texas facility, with the same output, will use about 8,000 sq m of 'class one' cleanroom and cost twice as much. Chipmakers are taking this approach further and creating 'mini-environments'. This involves moving the wafers around in an airtight box, only opened inside the machine. The whole factory does not have to be kept so clean. Lloyd Doyle, manager of IBM's East Fishkill plant in New York state, believes chip making costs will remain high. 'If you're asking me if a state-of-the-art fab (fabrication plant) costs between Dollars 500m and Dollars 750m, I'd say yes. But there are ways of getting more devices for your money.'</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sage to restructure and sell non-core assets SAGE group, the South African financial services, life assurance and property organisation, has announced a major restructuring. Mr Louis Shill, founder and chairman of Sage, said the deal would increase the marketability of shares, enhance the expansion of core businesses and strengthen the capital base by combining the group's three segments into one. In terms of the deal, Sage Financial Services (SFS) will cease to be a Sage subsidiary, acquire Sage Holdings and the non group-held Sage Property Holdings (SPH) shares. SFS will change its name to Sage Group, which will then have two divisions - property and finance, and life assurance. Mr Shill also said Sage planned to dispose of non-core interests which would raise at least R300m (Dollars 106.7m). This would help reduce group gearing from its current level of 55 per cent to negligible levels. The new group will have assets on the balance sheet of R3.2bn. This puts it in the second league of South African life companies. It does, however, have some important strategic investments, notably a 21 per cent holding in Universa, the company which holds 25 per cent of ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group; and a 26 per cent holding in Rand Merchant Bank Holdings. The terms of the restructuring are that 270 new SFS ordinary shares will be issued for every 100 ordinary shares held in Sage, and 55.6 new SFS shares for every 100 ordinary shares held in SPH. In the year to March, Sage Holdings lifted attributable earnings to R28.4m from R23.6m. Earnings per share rose 14.5 per cent to 118.07 cents and the dividend roseto 70 from 60 cents a share.</p>

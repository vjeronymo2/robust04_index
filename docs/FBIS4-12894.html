			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--AL-RA'Y--Competent security authorities have  managed to apprehend 10 persons on charges of setting up an  "Islamic" organization in order to carry out terrorist acts  inside the Kingdom.    Security sources explained that the group, led by a 38-year  person, met in an Amman neighborhood. It had prepared a phased  plan to execute its operations.    Under the first phase of its plan, the sources indicated,  the  group would do anything to collect money. Therefore, it carried  out armed robberies against a number of shops and taxi drivers  in the capital.    The sources added that the second phase was aimed at  carrying  out robberies against some commercial banks in Amman. The group  kept a special record of banks against which armed robberies had  been planned.    The sources explained that during the third phase they would  use the stolen money to purchase weapons. The sources explained  that the robberies were still in their initial stages, during  which light weapons were used and tear gas was used against taxi  drivers.    The sources said the first phase of the operation was  successful. Members of the group managed to attack some taxi  drives and to burglarize some shops. However, having monitored  their movements, the security authorities arrested the thieves  and uncovered other members of the organization and their  objectives.    The sources stressed that members of the armed group have  been placed under intensive interrogation. They will be  referred to specialized courts. Public trials will be held to  acquaint the public with the robberies that had been carried out.</p>

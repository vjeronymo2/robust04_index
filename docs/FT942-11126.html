			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (10): Reid's provides oasis of luxury What have the following in common: Lord Birkenhead, George Bernard Shaw, Sir Winston Churchill, Gregory Peck, Amy Mollison (nee Johnson), King Umberto of Italy, Sir Ernest Shackleton and the composer Pedro de Freitas Branco? The answer is that all, at one time or another, were guests of Reid's Hotel in Madeira. Even its commercial competitors speak of it with awe. Said one hotelier: 'In Madeira we have five de luxe hotels, and then there is Reid's]' Reid's is not just an hotel; it is a luxurious tourist institution frequented by the world's great and good. It was opened in 1891 by Willy and Alfred Reid, three years after the death of their father, who was one of 12 children born to a Kilmarnock (Scotland) farmer in 1822. Fourteen years later, the family doctor recommended a warmer climate for the ailing son, William. Now owned by the Blandy family, Reid's is unquestionably one of the world's leading hotels, perched on a rocky cliff point on the outskirts of Funchal and enclosed in an extensive garden which rivals the city's Botanical Gardens where William Reid lived in a quinta (large house). Reid's today with its 152 luxury bedrooms, 21 suites, poolside restaurants, two dining rooms and adjacent Villa Cliff restaurant (soon to be converted into a high-class Italian trattoria) represents tourist living on a very grand scale. Here everyone still dresses for dinner, and in black tie. Your daily FT, or indeed any of the world's leading newspapers, doesn't quite come gift-wrapped, but it is hung on your bedroom door in a white linen bag. Presiding over this expensive oasis is the Swiss-born Kurt Schmid, formerly of the Hotel Le Plaze in Basle, the Drake in New York and the Arthur's Seat in Cape Town. As Reid's general manager since the spring of last year, he gives the impression of appreciating that his hotel's clientele is ageing and that there is a need to go for new business, mainly in Germany and North America. If tourists from there can pay for luxury, Reid's is still one of the world's unique havens. The golf, tennis, swimming and fishing for 250-kilograms marlin are simply an add-on.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Patten wins HK reform vote: Colony's legislators support governor's plans for greater democracy Governor Chris Patten's controversial proposals for political reform in Hong Kong last night won approval from the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) despite a long campaign by China to block the changes. Mr Patten's legislation, which seeks to broaden the franchise in elections due this year and next, was backed by 32 votes to 24 after a 17-hour debate. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, last night called the outcome 'a very good and decisive result'. He said: 'Our task now is to press on, in close co-operation with China, with tackling the many issues which need to be settled in the remaining three years of British administration.' Mr Patten said the vote ended 'a significant chapter in Hong Kong's history. We must now turn the page'. However, Beijing made it clear before the vote that it was determined to hold fresh elections after China's resumption of sovereignty in 1997. It has objected as much to the manner in which Mr Patten announced his plans in October 1992 as to their content. Last year, Britain and China failed to agree about how Hong Kong's remaining elections under British rule should be conducted. However, there were indications yesterday that Beijing may move to resolve outstanding issues with Britain over Hong Kong's transfer. British officials believe China may today settle seven-years of negotiations over the terms for the transfer of military land in the colony. Mr Patten's plan envisages a 1995 legislature consisting of 20 elected members, 30 from so-called functional constituencies representing businesses, professions and labour unions, and 10 picked by a committee of elected municipal officials. An amendment by the pro-business Liberal party was voted down by the narrowest of margins - 29 to 28. It would have altered the rules for the 10 lawmakers picked by committee and reduced the electorate for the functional constituencies. Two members of the legislature, Mr Martin Barrow, a director of Jardine Pacific, and Mr Simon Ip, the legal profession's representative, abstained. Both had intended to vote for the Liberal amendment but changed their minds at the last moment. Mr Barrow, who was closely involved in devising the Liberal amendment, said he abstained so that 'the scales could be tipped by people whose home has been and will be Hong Kong for generations to come'. He saw the governor on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day Mr Allen Lee, Liberal leader, said that no one believed the governor's electoral arrangements would survive the transition to Chinese rule. 'Only an idiot would believe that,' he said. Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary who has an ex-offico seat in LegCo, said she hoped legislators would act in accordance with the people's wish for more democracy. She said only China could answer whether it would dismantle all tiers of representative government in 1997. If it did it would go against the community's clear wish for continuity.

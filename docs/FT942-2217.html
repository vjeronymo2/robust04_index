			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Belgian optimism on deficit Belgium is on course to meet this year's target for the public sector deficit of 5.7 per cent of gross domestic product, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, said yesterday. Presenting the Treasury's seventh annual report on the public deficit, Mr Maystadt said he was confident the federal government would be able to stick to its goal, even though it was too early to say how well Belgium's three regional governments had performed. Mr Maystadt also announced that Belgium was to introduce a new clearing system that would enable private retail investors to hold government Treasury bills and linear bonds (OLOs), previously only held by banks and institutional investors. Individuals would be allowed to hold the debt instruments in a special bank account. The report said that consolidated debt represented 66.6 per cent of the federal government's total debt at the end of May this year, compared with 69.5 per cent a year earlier. Sweden's May trade surplus rose to SKr5.5bn (Pounds 462m) from SKr4.5bn a year earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a SKr6.7bn surplus. Registered businesses in Hungary rose to 92,314 in May from 91,004 in April, the Central Office of Statistics said.</p>

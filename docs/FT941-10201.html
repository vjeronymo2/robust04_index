			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hungarian retailer plans share offering Fotex, the Hungarian retail group, is preparing to make a Dollars 100m international equity offering, after revealing a post-tax profit rise of 43 per cent to Ft1.08bn (Dollars 11m) in 1993, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Sales revenue grew 80 per cent to Ft15.5bn. Fotex plans to place about 30 per cent of the company with selected institutions and later seek a quotation on New York's Nasdaq exchange. The Dollars 100m tranche would be the largest international equity issue by an east European company, topping Fotex's own record established in 1991 with a Dollars 54m private placement with US investors.</p>

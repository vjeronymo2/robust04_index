			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Firmer tone in European prices Amid thin volume with US markets closed for Thanksgiving, European bonds firmed on fresh easing hopes after reports that the Bundesbank's vice-president said conditions in Germany may offer room for further declines in interest rates. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum was reported to have made the comments after delivering a prepared speech in Paris. Early news reports of that speech caused market confusion after a news agency incorrectly reported Mr Gaddum as saying that German money market rates would fall to 4 per cent. It later corrected the story, stating the error stemmed from incorrect simultaneous translation of the speech. The December bund contract blipped higher after the erroneous report and shed few of the gains when it was rectified. It finished at 99.78, up 0.21 point from Wednesday's close. Meanwhile, more regional German inflation data indicated that German inflation is continuing its steady decline. According to Mr Armin Kayser, economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Frankfurt, the November data indicate a seasonally adjusted month-on-month rise of 0.2 per cent and a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. 'This is the fourth consecutive month of declining inflation, and the data indicate we won't have to revise our optimistic inflation outlook,' he said. French bonds outperformed their German counterparts after the Bank of France's weekly statement indicated that net currency reserves had risen by FFr31.6bn in the week to November 18. That put reserves FFr8.3bn in the black, the first positive balance since the summer currency crisis which depleted the country's foreign currency reserves. In recent months the central bank has resisted cutting interest rates to protect the franc while rebuilding its reserves. But 'now that they are long reserves, I feel the chances of a small near-term repo rate cut have increased,' said a French bond trader. The French central bank's next open-market operation is on Monday. The French 10-year yield gap over German bunds narrowed to 14 basis points from around 20 basis points on Wednesday, and traders see it shrinking back to near-parity if France does ease rates independently of Germany. UK gilts were buoyed by firmer German and French bonds, with the long gilt contract ending some  3/8 point higher at 115 21/32 . Prices were further supported by the drop in oil prices caused by Wednesday's Opec decision not to cut production, which was seen to improve the already positive inflation outlook and prompted buying of longer maturities, traders reported. Spanish bonds rose only slightly and the currency was dogged by nervousness ahead of today's third-quarter jobless data and the spectre of a general strike. The long bond contract on MEFF ended 0.15 point higher at 102.44. Italian bonds fared slightly better, lifted by strong markets elsewhere and hopes that the 1994 budget will be passed. The BTP future on LIFFE ended at 112.76, up 0.24 point.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Cloves row gives Indonesian politics a shot in the arm: Suharto's son replies to criticisms of monopoly INDONESIA'S governing political party, Golkar, has been publicly criticised by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, a leading businessman and youngest son of President Suharto. The attack has given the country's political life a shot in the arm in advance of June's general election. Mr Putra, a majority shareholder of Humpuss Group Indonesia and chairman of BPPC, a private agency with monopoly rights over the trading of cloves, was responding to criticisms by senior Golkar figures of BPPC. 'The critics do not know what they are talking about,' Mr Putra told the daily Media Indonesia at the weekend. In the run-up to the election on June 9, local papers have identified the monopoly as a key political issue. Golkar is widely expected to win the election, but political pundits say the issue will test the bond between party, the President, and his family. The Jakarta Post, a leading English-language paper, has run two editorials within three weeks critical of BPPC. About 70,000 tonnes of cloves are sold each year to Indonesia's kretek cigarette manufacturers. Early this year, however, BPPC ran into financial trouble and the trade in cloves ground to a halt. Diplomats and donor officials say the monopoly runs counter to the government's commitment to deregulation. Mr Usman Hasan, the deputy secretary-general of Golkar, was reported as saying BPPC should be closed down. The agency has also been criticised by Mr Kharis Suhud, speaker of the House of Representatives, who argues that it is hurting, not helping farmers. Set up in 1990, BPPC has provided a floor price of Rp7,000 a kilo for Indonesia's 3m to 4m clove farmers, twice the level of previous lows; the agency sells on to the kretek manufacturers for about Rp12,500 per kilo. Its problems stem from its current clove stock - 155,000 tonnes, equal to two years production - and Mr Putra recently suggested that farmers should burn half this year's crop to ease over-supply. BPPC officials have also conceded that the agency will be unable to meet repayment terms on a Rp760bn soft loan made in 1990 by the central bank. Last week the government announced that BPPC would transfer much of the cloves procurement to local co-operatives. The floor price would be lowered by 7 per cent, and up to 49 per cent of the price would be retained by the co-operatives in the form of equity funds and 'compulsory savings' for the farmers. BPPC will remain the exclusive supplier to kretek manufacturers, and Mr Putra has said there will be no reduction in the selling price until its current stock is exhausted.</p>

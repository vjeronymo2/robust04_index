			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Observer: Driving seat Remember Kevin Morley, Rover's marketing supremo who transformed himself into an advertising agency last year? He seems to have made a scintillating success of his first year - at least in terms of his salary. In the first 18 months of the Kevin Morley Group Ltd, he paid himself a salary of Pounds 481,593, including a performance-related bonus of Pounds 304,316, according to accounts filed at Companies House. That works out at Pounds 321,062 annually, a smidgeon more than that taken by Maurice Saatchi, chairman of advertising mammoth Saatchi and Saatchi. Mind you, Morley has some way to go before he reaches the level of Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP. He got Pounds 510,000 in 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fabiola Sanchez] </F>   [Text] The Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] has agreed to  open a bidding process to let national banks manage assisted  financial entities, sources in that institution have stated. In  that respect, it agreed to begin talks with the representatives  of banks to define the list of financial entities that will  participate in the bidding process.    That proposal is part of the overall rehabilitation plan  Fogade will impose on all banks that are under the financial  assistance program. Initially, Fogade had studied the  possibility of including 12 banks in the process, but the board  members agreed to decrease the number to eight.    The conditions under which banks will take over the  administration of assisted banks have not yet been defined, but  the plan calls for temporary external supervision until the  institutions recover their stability.    During a 9 March meeting, the Fogade board members  considered  for the first time the possibility of letting national banks  with a greater solvency manage the assisted banks. Serious  differences arose among the board members regarding the  proposal. Some felt that letting the major banks manage the  assisted banks would generate legal problems, since the process  may be at odds with the content of the law to promote free  competition.    Next Friday, the Fogade board will study the rehabilitation  plans that will be established on the Maracaibo, Construccion,  Barinas, Metropolitano, La Guaira, and Sociedad Financiera  Fiveca banks.    The Banco Barinas Bank, one of the assisted entities, has  made great strides in its rehabilitation plan. On this matter,  it was reported that this bank will apply the following measures:    -- Merge Banco Popular with Banco Barinas.    -- Cut costs by 40 percent.    -- Sell some Banco Barinas assets, including its  headquarters  in Castellana.    -- Allow the contribution of capital by the partners.    Regarding the Banco Metropolitano rehabilitation plan, it  was  reported that its board members are considering selling assets,  reducing the managerial staff, and permitting new contributions  of capital.    Banco Metropolitano has already begun talks with a group of  national and foreign banks to get those entities to become  partners of this institution. In addition, the Fogade board  named Manuela Daria and Angel Magdaleno as the administrators of  Banco Hipotecario de Occidente.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Daniel Victoria] </F>   [Text] The Cabinet Council has authorized the Foreign  Ministry to proceed with the return of the building that has  served as the Panamanian Embassy in Nicaragua for 14 years. An  official document indicated that the building had been  expropriated from its legitimate owner and donated to Panama.    According to the document, the Nicaraguan Government asked  the Panamanian diplomatic mission in Nicaragua to return the  building because it had been expropriated from its legitimate  owner during the administration of Anastasio Somoza, who was  killed after being overthrown by the Sandinists.    In 1982, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry decided to donate  the building to the Panamanian Embassy in Managua. The building  has served as residence for our diplomatic missions since then.    Through a "verbal note" on 17 February, the Nicaraguan  Government notified the Panamanian Government that in order to  correct actions committed by previous administrations, it is  working to return property expropriated from Nicaraguans and  foreigners. Therefore, it requested the return of the building  being used by the Panamanian Embassy.    The Panamanian Government replied it has no objections to  returning the building, specially if the donation was never  legalized. Therefore, it authorized the Foreign Ministry to  return the building through the Panamanian diplomatic mission in  Nicaragua.</p>

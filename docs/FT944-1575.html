			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Major takes firm line with rebels: PM says Eurosceptic MPs will not regain whip 'for months' Mr John Major said yesterday that he would make peace with the Conservative party's rebels over Europe only on his own terms, as he issued a strong appeal for party unity. Rejecting calls from the Tory right for a speedy reconciliation, the prime minister said it would be months before he would consider lifting the suspension from the parliamentary party of nine Eurosceptic MPs. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Major said it would be 'unwise' to rule out a referendum either after the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference or on the issue of a single currency. But he did not expect the 1996 conference to lead to a further institutional upheaval in the Union, adding: 'I do not expect to come back with anything that would justify a referendum.' Mr Major suggested there would be a stronger case for a referendum on a single European currency but said there was no possibility of economic and monetary union in 1997 and only a small chance of such a move in 1999. In a wide-ranging review of the political and economic outlook, Mr Major played down speculation that the government might legislate to prevent large increases in boardroom salaries. Some of the recent increases in directors' pay had been 'insensitive' but there were serious obstacles to legislation. The prime minister dismissed also the calls from some Tory MPs and ministers for early and large tax cuts to improve the government's standing in the opinion polls. He said he was '100 per cent' behind Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his insistence that taxes would be reduced only when the economy could afford it. Speaking in Downing Street at the end of a year that has seen his premiership repeatedly under fire as Labour's lead has soared in the opinion polls, the prime minister dismissed the sniping from the Tory backbenches. Stressing his commitment to sustained economic recovery, peace in Northern Ireland and a radical overhaul of public services, Mr Major said he did not believe 'that it is the loudest voice that carries furthest; it is often the still voice that lasts right the way through the storm'. Mr Major issued another strong call for unity in the Tory party to allow the government to reap the political rewards of the economic upturn: 'Divided parties, as we have seen in British history, have great difficulty in winning general elections.' It would be 'folly running off the Richter scale' if the Conservatives threw away the opportunity of 'the best economic recovery in living memory'. But Mr Major was absolutely clear that the nine Tory MPs suspended since last month's rebellion over the European Union budget would not be readmitted unless they demonstrated their support for the government. Assuming they voted for the government 'over the months ahead', he would consider whether they should be readmitted to the party whip. Mr Major added: 'But it is not imminent at all, they must show that they are in the business of supporting the government.'

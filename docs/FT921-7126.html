			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Warsaw looks west for a fast track into private hands: A Polish plan to float half the country's state-run companies by 1994 DEBATE continues over Polish economic policy following the recent resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski as finance minister, but there is still a broad consensus behind giving top priority to the fastest possible privatisation of state enterprises. Using a mix of conventional and non-conventional methods, the aim is to convert half of Polish industry to private ownership by 1994. The most innovative plan is a mass privatisation programme involving western-managed investment funds. It has been in gestation since 1988 and steadily refined by Polish and foreign economists, lawyers, bankers and accountants. The details must be debated and approved by parliament, but 200 of the 1,300 state-owned enterprises with an annual turnover above Dollars 10m have been selected for the first round, which should begin by the second half of the year, and another 200 are being prepared. The target enterprises will be converted into joint stock companies owned by the Polish Treasury and their shares transferred to a dozen investment funds. These will be managed by Polish and foreign fund managers. The Treasury will retain about 30 per cent of the shares, while up to 10 per cent will be given to employees. The lead investment group will become the biggest single shareholder, with 33 per cent of the target company shares, and 27 per cent will be distributed among the other investment funds. Tenders are being evaluated from foreign consultants and merchant banks that have applied to manage the funds for an annual fee and a stake in the eventual capital gains. Polish citizens initially will be offered 'participation certificates' exchangeable next year for a set of shares in the new mutual funds. The public will not become owners of shares in the actual enterprises, which will remain in the hands of the funds, until they are eventually liquidated, probably after 10 years. All adult Poles originally were to receive a free allocation of shares, but that idea was dropped as redolent of the now-discredited socialist egalitarianism. Opponents successfully argued that free shares would not educate people in the rights and responsibilities of ownership, a key part of the cultural transformation required to make capitalism work. Poles, like their Czechoslovak counterparts, will soon be invited to pay a relatively nominal sum for shares in the new funds. Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, a former academic who has become minister for privatisation in the new coalition government led by prime minister Jan Olszewski, says that privatisation will also be closely co-ordinated with the government's industrial policy. Teams of merchant banks and consultants have been carrying out 34 sectoral analyses of Polish industry in a programme partly financed by the World Bank, the results of which should provide the government with a clearer vision of the broader strategic implications stemming from the privatisation of individual companies, especially those sold to foreign buyers. A series of highly publicised banking scandals, months of political uncertainty and the difficulty of getting quick decisions from over-stretched and under-paid government ministries have delayed several potential foreign investments. However, up to 30 or 40 possible foreign purchases in the automobile, pulp and paper, cement, brewing and other industries are in the pipeline, and the government has made clear that it will remove any enterprise from the mass privatisation scheme if a foreign buyer is interested in acquiring it. The government is hoping for a renewed flow of private investment following the completion of most sectoral studies. Among recent investors are Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical group, which already employs more than 10,000 people in Poland and has taken a 10 per cent stake in the recently privatised Elektrim trading company, and Unilever, the UK-Dutch consumer goods multinational. Two German detergent companies, Henkel and Benkiser, have bought controlling stakes in Polish detergent companies. Until now, however, Poland has made greatest progress in privatising trade and retail outlets. Nearly 80 per cent of shops have been privatised within two years, and more than 46 per cent of Poland's Dollars 14bn imports were handled last year by the newly privatised trade sector. A retail revolution has brought unprecedented choice of food and consumer goods in place of shortages and queues. While private enterprise has transformed Polish consumption patterns, the flood of imports has created unprecedently tough competition for Polish farmers and much of Polish industry, including companies already reeling from the collapse in trade with the former Soviet Union. Mr Jerzy Thieme, chief adviser to the minister of privatisation, admits it would be far better if Poland could import 400 first-class industrial managers to run its ailing state enterprises. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'we cannot afford the Dollars 250,000-a-year it would cost to put a first-class general manager and finance director into each of our companies.' Instead, the ministry, which is being advised by SG Warburg, the London-based merchant bank, expects the new fund managers to exercise ownership rights and provide strategic assistance and guidance to the enterprises in their portfolios. 'What we are looking for,' Mr Thieme said, 'are strong team leaders for the funds, professionals with 15-to-20-years' portfolio experience and previous involvement in the management of industrial companies. It will be a very hands-on commitment.' But mass privatisation remains an untried experiment thought up by academics. To critics, it still looks suspiciously like an attempt to avoid hard decisions which would lead to bankruptcies and mass unemployment. To supporters, it is an attempt to inject management disciplines, restructure enterprises and build up capital. PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has decided to risk clashing with Poland's parliament over Ms Hanna Waltz Gronkiewicz, his candidate for head of NBP, the central bank, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The post has been been vacant since August. President Walesa said at the weekend that he would re-nominate the 39-year-old academic for the post even though last December parliament failed to give Ms Gronkiewicz the absolute majority required for the position. 'I shall draw far-reaching conclusions if I am not permitted to fulfil my constitutional duties,' Mr Walesa said in a reference to the possibility that Ms Gronkiewicz, who has specialised in banking issues, will be voted down again. The statement suggests that he is prepared to use the issue to campaign for limits to be placed on parliament's powers, arguing that deputies were hindering efficient government. Opponents of Ms Gronkiewicz argued that her lack of banking experience disqualified her for the post. President Walesa, however, says this makes her the ideal candidate to reform the banking system, which has been shaken by a series of scandals.</p>

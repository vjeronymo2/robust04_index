			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Yesterday the Zionist regime carried out a new  terrorist act by resorting to a kidnapping inside Lebanese  territory. Dozens of armed men attacked a village in southern  Lebanon on Saturday morning and kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, the  head of Lebanon's faithful resistance, from his village home.    In reaction to this kidnapping, the Lebanese Hizballah  issued  a statement yesterday in which it said that the Zionist regime's  fresh crime is a manifestation of the terrorist nature of a  regime supported by America. Stating that the Islamic ummah has  no alternative but to resist the Zionist regime, the Lebanese  Hizballah called on all of Lebanon's party and official circles  to react to this kidnapping.    Also, 'Allamah Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, one of Lebanon's  Shiite leaders, described the Zionist regime's terrorist act as  a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on the UN  Security Council to strive for al-Dirani's release. In reaction  to this incident, 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah,  another Lebanese Shiite clerical leader, pointed out that the  Lebanese Government's sovereignty has been violated, and he  criticized Europe and the United States for their silence  vis-a-vis Israel's renewed aggression against Lebanon.    Five years ago, in 1989, the Zionist regime took hostage  another Hizballah leader, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, in the  same manner, kidnapping him from his home. Also, in 1992 a  Zionist helicopter violated Lebanese airspace and fired a rocket  at the car carrying Hizballah Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi  and his wife, martyring both of them.    The Zionist regime's flaunting of international practice and  its aggressive nature has turned the Middle East into a constant  hotbed of crisis. Following yesterday's kidnapping, Zionist  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres admitted that the terrorist act  had been carried out and lied that the Zionist regime's military  ability to strike at its opponents even inside Lebanese  territory is very high. Apart from the fact that this overt  confession can be used as a proof to condemn the Zionist regime  in international circles, it should also not be forgotten that  military experts consider this escapade by the Zionist regime to  be worthless and an act stemming from weakness.</p>

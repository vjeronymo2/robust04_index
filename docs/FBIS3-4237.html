			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- Information released by  the State Information Centre shows that saturation has nearly  been reached in the market for several different kinds of  products whose further production should be curtailed at present.    -- Colour television sets: There are now at least 57  enterprises undertaking this business with a total turnout of  nearly 20 million sets in 1990. The annual turnout was put at  10 million in recent years, represented only 50 percent of  production.    -- Personal computers: These are produced by 30 enterprises  across the country with a mere four of them being big in scale.  The current turnout in this business sector is put at 150,000  computers. An increase of 250,000 was seen during the Eighth  Five Year Plan period, a gain capable of meeting the market  needs.    -- Colour TV tubes and screens: Production of colour TV  tubes registered 7.5 million in 1990 and will rise to 12.9  million during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Some  export-oriented enterprises can produce 4.1 million colour TV  tubes. The turnout of television screens was 5.26 million  pieces in 1990 and this increased to 19.08 million during the  Eighth Five Year Plan period. Meanwhile, export- oriented  enterprises were capable of turning out 4.45 million screens.    -- Videotape recorders: Production of this item is three  million while production of components and spare parts and  certain supplementary devices for the recorder has also been  arranged in the country.    -- Magnetic tubes for microwave ovens: There are now five  enterprises specializing in the production of these tubes with  an annual turnout of between 2.4 million and 2.5 million,  sufficient for meeting domestic and foreign demand.    -- Television cameras: There are so many enterprises  applying for production of this item, resulting in a heavy input  of high technology and capital.    -- Digital programme-controlled switchboards: Production of  this item is now increasing and the state will select certain  production entities for renovation in order to meet the market  demand.    -- Laser discs, karaoke machines, mobile communications  sets,  facsimile machines and optical fibre communications items:  There are so many enterprises now producing these items which  involve a heavy input of technology and investment and the  market is yet to be developed.    -- Transport vehicles for agriculture: As this item is in  strong demand, many plants are tending to produce them.  Incomplete statistics indicate that there are now 80  enterprises in this sector across the country with an annual  turnout of between 130,000 and 150,000. A mere three big-sized  enterprises are capable of turning out over 10,000 vehicles a  year while 75 percent of all such enterprises have a turnout of  not more than 1,000 each a year. Production of such kinds of  vehicles should be reserved for big- sized plants in a bid to  improve product quality.</p>

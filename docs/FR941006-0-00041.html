Federal agencies or fugitives from the law cannot make FOIA requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Requesters should not use Government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels to make FOIA requests. FOIA managers will process such requests and tell requesters that using government resources to make FOIA requests is not an authorized official use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Submitting FOIA requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written requests that reasonably describe the desired records and include a statement on fees. Address letters to the FOIA office of the activity that has the record. List other addressees to save time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.6  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Processing requests under FOIA and Privacy Act (PA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Process requests under the Act that gives the most information. If the requester cites both Acts, address each in the reply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Describing records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requester is responsible for identifying the desired record. He or she should sufficiently describe the record to help locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Generally a reasonable description contains enough information for an organized, nonrandom search. Offices must make reasonable efforts to find the records described. This means searching all activities and locations most likely to have the records, including staged or retired records. If the description is unclear, ask for more specific information. When possible, tell the requester what information would help. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Creating a record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Air Force is not required to create, compile, or obtain a record from outside the Air Force to fulfill a request. You may want to create a new record when it would be a more useful response to the requester or is less burdensome for the agency than providing an existing record and the requester agrees. Do not charge the requester more for creating a record than you would charge for the existing record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Apply a standard of reasonableness for electronic data when there is a question on whether you are creating, programming, or formatting a record. If you can respond with a ``business as usual'' approach, process the request, otherwise offer the requester appeal rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;806.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special disclosure procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some instructions have disclosure procedures for certain types of records. Refer to those instructions for specific disclosure procedures when you process FOIA requests. The only reason to deny a request is a FOIA exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Process FOIA requests from foreign citizens, foreign governments, their representatives, or international commands under this part, and coordinate with your foreign disclosure office. If the command has no foreign disclosure office, refer the request to SAF/AAIS (FOIA) for SAF/IAD coordination through the MAJCOM FOIA office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If requests from foreign government officials do not cite the FOIA, refer them to your foreign disclosure office and notify the requester. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a Foreign Ministry report, at 1230  yesterday Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri, who  is on an official visit to the UK at the invitation of his UK  counterpart Douglas Hurd, and his party paid a courtesy call on  British Prime Minister John Major. The meeting was cordial and  proceeded in friendly atmosphere based on the long-standing good  relations between the two countries. They exchanged views on  issues of mutual interest, particularly bilateral trade and  investment which has expanded a great deal in the past year and  its great potential.    The British prime minister stressed the interest and  importance the UK gives to the nations in Asia and the Pacific,  a region with high economic growth, particularly Thailand. He  pledged to encourage UK businessmen to do more business in  Thailand.    As the Thai foreign minister is the current chairman of the  ASEAN Standing Committee, the UK prime minister felt that  cooperation between ASEAN and the EU could be closer. The two  sides also discussed antinarcotics cooperation as the narcotics  problem in the UK has become more acute. They expressed  satisfaction with their existing cooperation in education,  training, and information and equipment exchanges. They also  discussed regional security issues, including the Cambodian  problem and hope the Cambodian factions would be able to resolve  their problem in the interest of peace and stability in that  country.    The fact that the UK has arranged a meeting between the  foreign minister and its prime minister demonstrates the UK's  awareness of Thailand's role and importance in the Asia-Pacific  political arena.    After the meeting with the UK prime minister, Prasong, the  Thai Foreign Ministry permanent secretary, and other Foreign  Ministry officials had a meeting with senior UK Foreign Office  officials. In attendance was also a group of UK  parliamentarians and businessmen.    Later, the foreign minister also granted an interview to the  BBC on topics such as ties between Thai and post-election South  Africa, the Cambodian problem, and Burma's attendance at the  ASEAN ministerial meeting. After the interview, the foreign  minister attended a dinner hosted by the UK foreign minister at  his office.</p>

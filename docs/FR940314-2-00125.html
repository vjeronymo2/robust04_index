			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD estimates that it will collect the $200 surcharge on 75 percent of the approximately 5700 arbitration cases expected to be filed in 1994, which will result in over $800,000 of additional revenue for the Arbitration Department in 1994. Thus, the surcharge will effectively offset expenses to be incurred on arbitrator education through 1994. The NASD expects the arbitrator education program to reach over 3,000 new arbitrators and almost 500 chairpersons during the period that began in the fourth quarter of 1993 and will end at the end of 1994. This will add over $750,000 to the Arbitration Department expenses, which will include costs for staff and travel time, conference rooms, written materials, videotape production and mailing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  of the Act, which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge on each member that is named or whose associated person is named and for which service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding and applies such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> -3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH: YOUR BODY;  </P> <P> THE CAUTION LIGHT FOR A SUNLESS TAN  </P> <P> Sounding just like a desperate smoker trying to kick the habit, the woman  pleads her case.  </P> <P> "I'm really trying to stay out of the sun," she tells Beverly Hills  dermatologist Steven Weiss. "I've cut down. But it's summer -- and walking  around with white, white legs is just too much to bear."  </P> <P> Now she thinks she has found the perfect "fix" -- a "self-tan" lotion that  darkens skin without the sun.  </P> <P> Indoor tanning isn't new, of course. Coppertone's QT, which debuted in 1960,  has been a steady seller ever since, a company spokesman claims. But this  season, several brand-new self-tan products -- some sold at posh department  store counters -- are giving the old standby some stiff competition.  </P> <P> "We're out of stock in the factory," says Susan Donnelly of Chanel, which just  introduced its own brand.  </P> <P> In most self-tan lotions, the active ingredient is a tongue-twister substance  called dihydroxyacetone. "It reacts with the amino acids in the outer layer of  epidermal cells to change the color," says Frank Akin of Schering-Plough Inc.,  a manufacturer of sunless tanning lotions.  </P> <P> But are indoor tan products safe? The American Cancer Society has taken no  stand on self-tanning. But Weiss and several other dermatologists tell their  patients to slather it on -- evenly, or you'll look streaked -- and enjoy.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of any adverse long-term effects from dehydroxyacetone," says  Dr. Pearl Grimes, an assistant professor of dermatology at King-Drew Medical  Center. "The question is -- do the preparations really work? Some patients find  it gives them a yellowish color." Actually, the boom in self-tan products  reflects Americans' new willingness to reduce skin cancer risk after years of  medical preaching. If using self-tan lotion even a little "leads to people  tanning less in the sun, it's a positive step," says Weiss.  </P> <P> But not everyone's aglow about indoor tanning. "Very fair-skinned people who  don't tan in the sun have told us it just doesn't work for them," one  department store salesman says. And some buyers might cringe at the investment.  One application lasts about three days. At $12 or more a tube, it could be a  dark but expensive summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Norplant Report Card  </P> <P> Norplant, an implantable birth control method not yet approved by the Food and  Drug Administration, gets high marks in a study just published by USC  researchers in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  </P> <P> Here's their report card: Once implanted in the upper arm, Norplant's six  silastic capsules release the hormone levonorgestrel and prevent ovulation just  as effectively as birth control pills. It works for three to five years. It  doesn't seem to increase the risk of heart disease. And it's reversible. The  capsules can be removed at any time, using only a local anesthetic.  </P> <P> Although it is still under review at the FDA, an influentia advisory panel  recommended approval last April. Norplant could be on the American market by  next summer.  </P> <P> The draw? One-shot compliance. "It will appeal most to those who have trouble  remembering to take the Pill," believes Dr. Edward Savage, chief of gynecology  at King-Drew Medical Center. Teen-agers will be clamoring for the prescription.  And Norplant might be a more humane alternative to sterilization for women with  below average intelligence, suggest Savage.  </P> <P> However, there are downsides. Up to a fifth of Norplant users get headaches.  And up to 70% have longe menstrual periods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Booze and Health  </P> <P> Heavy drinkers who consume three or more drinks a day may increase their risk  of stroke while light to moderate drinkers could reduce it.  </P> <P> Those are the newest finding of Dr. Arthur Klatsky, chief of cardiology at  Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, who has studied the health effects  of alcohol for about 20 years.  </P> <P> His results, published this month in the journal, Stroke, are based on a study  of more than 100,000 patients seen at Kaiser in the early '80s. Patients were  questioned about their drinking habit and then followed for up to seven years  to determine if they suffered a stroke.  </P> <P> Heavy drinking seems to increase a deadly type of stroke caused by hemorrhaging  in the brain. On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption, which is no more  than two drinks a day, seems to reduce the risk of a more common type of stroke  caused by blood clots that plug the vessels supplying blood to the brain.  </P> <P> Klatsky isn't sure why moderate drinking may protect people, but he speculates  that the alcohol may decrease the tendency for blood to clot or alternatively  increase high-density lipoproteins, the so-called good cholesterol believed to  reduce blockage of blood vessels.  </P> <P> Drinkers should not interpret the new study as an excuse to imbibe, Klatsky and  other physicians emphasize. "Consuming alcohol solely to reduce stroke risk  would not be medically recommended," says Dr. John Moseley, a neurosurgeon at  St. John's Hospital in Santa  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Talented Tenderizer  </P> <P> Picnic time? Beach day? Pack the meat tenderizer along with the first-aid kit,  suggests Dr. Ricardo Martinez, clinical director of the Stanford University  Hospital Emergency Department. It can help relieve pain when bees sting or  jellyfish bite.  </P> <P> "Mix the tenderizer with water and put the paste on the painful spot," Martinez  suggests. The tenderizer breaks down the protein found in the venom of wasps,  bees, jellfishes and coral just as it does with meat proteins.  </P> <P> "I've heard good things about the tenderizer," says Dr. Alexander Lampone,  medical director of St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> But it's no cure-all. "Don't count on tenderizer to eliminate the misery of  mosquito bites," Martinez says.  </P></p>

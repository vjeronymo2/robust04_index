			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Tory attack on Labour tax planfuelled by report: More gainers overall says think-tank AN INDEPENDENT analysis showing that Labour's proposed National Insurance changes would push up the contributions of one in five households in London and the south-east yesterday fuelled the intense Conservative attack on opposition tax policies. But Labour seized on figures in the report - produced by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies - which showed that if Labour pledges to increase pensions and child benefit were included in the calculation the number of gainers far outstripped losers. The Conservative strategy of shifting the general election battleground to issues such as tax, spending and economic competence also received a setback from official figures showing higher public borrowing and another rise in inflation. The borrowing figures underlined the problems that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, faces in finding money for tax cuts that cabinet colleagues see as an essential ingredient in a pre-election Budget. The headline inflation rate rose from 4.3 per cent in November to 4.5 per cent in December, prompting a strong Labour attack on the government's economic performance. But at the end of a frenetic week in which Labour confusion over tax policy gave the Conservatives the campaign initiative, the IFS highlighted the potentially damaging impact of Labour's planned abolition of the present ceiling on NI contributions. In a report that helped to explain why Mr Neil Kinnock indicated this week that he is now ready to phase in the change, the IFS calculated that 20 per cent of households in London and 18 per cent in the south-east would pay more if the ceiling of Pounds 20,280 were removed. Across the country 11.8 per cent would lose. The IFS also agreed that if pensioners and the unemployed were excluded from the calculations, the proportion paying more would be significantly higher. The IFS praised the economic logic behind the Labour policy. It produced detailed figures to show that if the party's planned increases in child benefit and pensions were set against the abolition of the NI contribution ceiling, 46 per cent of households across the country would gain and only 8.7 per cent would lose. However, the losers would be heavily concentrated among potentially floating voters in a swathe of marginal constituencies in London and the south-east which Mr Kinnock must win if he is to form a government after the election. As the IFS figures came under the spotlight, the Conservatives broadened their attack on Labour policies with a new document entitled Labour in Limbo. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, said the party was 'stuck in a no man's land' between the socialist policies it had abandoned and a coherent vision of the future. Conservative Central Office also announced the postponement of a string of annual party conferences, including that of the Tory Trades unionists in April, the Scottish and Women Conservatives in May and the Welsh conference in June to avoid potential clashes with the election date.

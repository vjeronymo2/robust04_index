			<p>BFN     [Text] Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis, speaking  today at the meeting of heads of local authorities at Kuldiga,  announced that he has put off for an indefinite period the visit  to Russia he planned to make on 20 April. During the visit he  was to meet the Russian president and possibly sign the  agreements initialled by Latvia and Russia. Ulmanis explained  that the reason for this decision was the edict by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin on the creation of military bases in the  CIS states and Latvia. Moreover, immediately after receiving  the report, Ulmanis had proposed a talk with the Russian  president. Yet he has still not received a reply. Ulmanis also  has been trying unsuccessfully for two days to talk to Leonid  Mayorov, commander of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of  Forces. Ulmanis has the impression that Mayorov is deliberately  avoiding talking. Ulmanis does not rule out the possibility  that Yeltsin's decree might have come about in connection with a  power struggle in Russia and disagreements between the Foreign  Ministry and military corps in Russia. Ulmanis is also planning  to present a proposal to the presidium of the Saeima on Saturday  to cancel the extraordinary plenary session on 15 April, in the  belief that at present there is no sense in discussing powers to  sign the initialled agreements because in such a situation as  this the signing of the agreements is not possible.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ernst Isaakovich Chernyy, expert at the </F> Association of Independent Professionals, chairman of the Union  of Independent Fishing Industry Representatives, candidate in  geographical sciences: "Does the Coat of Statehood Fit the  Regions? On the Danger of Separatism in the Economy"]    [Text] The simplest way to confuse any question is to  introduce the principle of joint responsibility and joint  administration. If several structures are concurrently  answerable for the realization of some function, we may say with  full assurance that confusion and muddle are guaranteed, and  that in the "gaps" between the joint administration there will  always be a place for abusers, for corruption and bribery.  Considering the fact that certain regional administrators assume  functions which are characteristic only of the state, the danger  of emergence of a new separatism is quite real, and Article 72  of the Constitution will present us with many more  surprises.    The decline of the local soviets was characterized by a  sharp  increase in their politization and a striving toward so-called  "sovereignty" to the detriment of their obvious tasks: The  creation of conditions for normal life of their electors--the  taxpayers.    Many regional administrators even today believe that their  sovereignty consists of "lowering" state functions to the level  of the region, which after this appears to them as a reduced  copy of the state. Then the policy of the region may, in their  opinion, differ from the policy of the state, and especially the  economic policy. This constitutes the primary error in some  cases, and the fine calculation and intent in others. We will  note that if there is an economic policy of the regions which  differs from such policy of the state, then, in the normal  understanding, the state simply does not exist.    Regional administrations want first of all to permit and  distribute, rather than to develop the rules of such  distribution which are known and understandable to all, and  under which the subjective decisions of bureaucrats will no  longer be needed.    Kamchatka Governor Biryukov, for example, believes that the  oblast has not only its own economic policy, but also its own  foreign economic policy. Attempting to hinder one of the  enterprises in his oblast in obtaining permission for foreign  economic activity, the governor writes to the minister of  foreign economic relations: "The oblast administration  categorically objects to the request by AO UTRF (the name of the  enterprise), which runs counter to the foreign economic policy  of the oblast." Can such a thing be? After all, foreign economic  policy is an attribute only of state power, and it is reduced  ultimately to developing principles of foreign economic  interaction with various countries (preferential, common,  discriminatory), concluding interstate treaties and agreements,  and establishing a system of export-import tariffs and duties.    Can the regions themselves develop such principles?  Obviously  not. Otherwise, that which is prohibited in one region will be  done through another, and the unified economic space specified  in the constitution will simply disappear.    It is easy to note that the interests of individual regions  may contradict each other. Here is the simplest example: A  region which produces bread is interested in its export, while  bread consuming regions are interested in having the bread  remain in the country. Foreign economic policy is not the  mechanical sum of the foreign economic interests of the regions  and may exist only as an all-state policy, but one which takes  into consideration the management-economic structure of the  regions. Therefore, Mr. Biryukov's aspirations to his own  specific oblast foreign economic policy are, in the very least,  untenable.    They are untenable and contradict the constitution, as well  as the wishes of the participants of the Khabarovsk Kray  administration collegium to prohibit the export of food and  other goods from its territory. Moreover, the law on enterprises  and entrepreneurial activity is contradicted by the desire of  the deputy head of administration of Primorskiy Kray to set  quotas on fishing primarily for those enterprises which "bring  more benefit" to the kray. And, after all, he, Novikov, as the  former secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee], knows  better than others what is best for the kray.    Having assumed all-state functions, the regions often make  decisions which are fraught with grave consequences for several  generations of their citizens. The reason for this is political  infantilism and, evidently, serious personal interest.    Here is a rather telling example. The governor of Sakhalin  Oblast, Ye. Krasnoyarov, in his decree No. 284 dated 5 November  1993, granted the inter-regional joint-stock bank for economic  cooperation (MABES) "Sakhalin-West", which had sprung up  unexpectedly, was not known to anyone and not backed by its own  assets, the status of a bank serving as an agent of the oblast  administration for (and I quote) "organizing and coordinating  work associated with the implementation of financing projects  and programs for the socioeconomic development and  reconstruction of Sakhalin and the Kurils." In section 3 of the  decree, Ye. Krasnoyarov generously allocates the bank R100  million from the oblast budget (let us be frank--Sakhalin  taxpayers' money) as the initial contribution to the MABES.    As an aside, we will note that the firm which Krasnoyarov  managed before he became governor, "Pilenga-Godo," was one of  the founders of this bank. Thus, the generosity by oblast  Governor Ye. Krasnoyarov was of benefit to one of the bank's  founders--the entrepreneur Ye. Krasnoyarov. It is an interesting  story in economic independence. But that is not all. One of the  subsections of section 7 of the decree is addressed to the  government with a request to allocate preferential credit to the  bank in the sum of R5 billion for a term of 5 years at a rate of  20 percent per annum. Have you noted any state interests here?  Or what about Sakhalin interests? Well, are Gaydar and Fedorov  not correct when they say that those who are "gratified" by the  public wealth will drag away the entire budget to preferential  credits for themselves and their good friends? If someone has  remembered about inflation now, it would not be bad to  understand that this is one of its visible components. And there  are many such smart governors in Russia. Let us proceed ferther,  since the crowning touch is section 5 of the above-mentioned  decree. It should be quoted in its entirety, since the "intent"  of the neophyte of politics and economics has become clear to  everyone: "5. To allocate to the MABES `Sakhalin-West' as a  guaranteed security for obtaining foreign currency credit along  the bank's existing credit line the export goods and raw  material resources (fish and marine products, timber, oil,  metals, etc.) which are at the disposal of the oblast  administration's territorial fund, as well as undeveloped  mineral deposits (oil, coal, zeolite, facing stone, etc.), uncut  forest areas and other raw material resources in the oblast in  accordance with the established procedure." Section 6, which  provides for the annual allocation of R1 billion and $2.5  million to the bank from the oblast budget, appears as an  innocent prank next to this.    Up until now, I believed that banks, "trading" in money,  must  themselves create their own assets and then give credit to  interested parties at the appropriate interest rates. After  Krasnoyarov's decree, I began to doubt this. We may hope that  the underlying meaning of the governor's decree is  understandable even to those who are not experienced in politics  and economics. If a bank, having received many millions in  foreign credit, "suddenly" finds itself insolvent, then  everything that is listed in the above-mentioned section 5 will  become the property of the foreign creditor or will demand  immediate repayment of the credit from the state budget, i.e.,  at our, the taxpayers', expense.    Are there any other questions about Ye. Krasnoyarov? Perhaps  only for the president's administration. After all, their  appointments are too "exact." Ye. Krasnoyarov is by no means the  only one. And so the doubt arises: Will such governors not drag  the country away piece by piece? Is this not where the most  refined separatism is formulated, which is indulged by certain  federal departments, pursuing their own not quite unselfish  interests?    In connection with the tendency to assume someone else's  functions, we will try to understand what the economic  sovereignty of regions ultimately consists of.    The fact is that we have always lived in a system where, due  to the actual confiscation of the surplus product and taxes, all  the funds collected by this method went into the highest level  budget, and were then distributed by regions on the basis of  "plan" guidelines.    It is necessary to re-create the principle under which each  region will supply itself with all that is necessary (by  producing or buying). After all, living in a country, republic  or oblast, we are in fact living in an entirely specific region.  It is only here that we need a home, municipal services, roads  and schools. What good are statements to the effect that we have  free education if there is no school in a specific village? Can  Bratsk develop normally if out of the R100 billion in taxes  collected here it gets only R20 billion? Improvements are  possible if the very concept of taxes includes the principle of  their divergence, or payments made by the lower budgets to the  higher ones.    Under such a tax structure, the regions on whose territory  billions of rubles worth of products are produced will cease to  be constant humble supplicants. It is obvious that only the rich  regions are able to support central administrative organs, an  army and other structures. At the same time, the state expenses  themselves must be significantly reduced.    It seems, however, that the economic sovereignty of regions  consists only of the right to collect taxes and use them for the  benefit of the citizens living on their territory. This is  really a basic necessity, because it is imprudent to collect  taxes in the regions, to "take" them to Moscow, and then to  distribute them throughout the regions as budget allocations or  subsidies. Other economic functions belong either to the state,  or to the enterprises. The task of the local administrations,  then, is not to "drag and prohibit," but to create such  conditions under which the effect from the activity of  enterprises and citizen taxpayers would be maximal. There is no  need, and it is simply dangerous, to equate state regalia to the  uniform of the region.    Moscow Mayor Luzhkov once said about himself: I am an  economic manager! These are the right words. Especially now,  when most of the managers of the regions are former directors  who think that the state is simply a large factory or kolkhoz  [collective farm]. The Gaydars and Fedorovs know what buttons to  push in order to get the necessary result thousands of  kilometers away from the "control panel." This is economics. We,  the "wise" voters, have with our votes helped to remove market  economists from management of the economy. If we are now  controlled by the Biryukovs and the Krasnoyarovs, we have no one  to blame but ourselves.</p>

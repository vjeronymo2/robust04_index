			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Italy seeks new budget formula The Berlusconi government is urgently studying ways to reformulate its 1995 budget after its rejection by the senate. The search for a new formula followed a surprise vote in on Thursday rejecting plans to raise L5,000bn (Pounds 2bn) from an amnesty on buildings constructed without proper permits. The funds would be raised through charging registration fees for regularising property development and construction carried out without permits since 1985. Along with a further L10,000bn due from a pardon on disputed tax assessments, the two items were the main source of new revenues in the 1995 budget. Overall the budget, which began its path through parliament this week, is due to find L50,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts to reduce the public sector deficit to below 8.5 per cent of GDP. The illegal construction amnesty has been hotly contested by the opposition, especially the Greens. Also at least five regional administrations have filed suits with the constitutional court seeking to block the measure which is seen as condoning uncontrolled speculative building. In the senate, where the right wing coalition lacks a majority, the government was handicapped by several absences. The vote was lost by 113 to 115. The government has pledged to devise a means of re-introducing the legislation; but finding the necessary consensus in the senate may prove difficult. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, warned this week that in the event of revenue shortfalls, the government would have to resort to extra taxes.</p>

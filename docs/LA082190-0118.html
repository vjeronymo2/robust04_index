			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Petitions About 'Miss Saigon': Several Asian-American activists in New York and  Los Angeles are circulating petitions among Actors' Equity members asking for  yet another meeting to reconsider the controversial casting of Jonathan Pryce  in "Miss Saigon" on Broadway -- which Equity first disapproved and then  approved -- and the issues it raises. An Equity spokeswoman said that if  petitions with more than 100 signatures are received, "there will have to be a  meeting" of either the union's general membership or its council.

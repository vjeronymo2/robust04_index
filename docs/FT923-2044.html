			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities stay calm on triple witching day Wall Street US EQUITIES withstood the first round of yesterday's 'triple witching' with equanimity, although prices moved broadly higher as the last round of afternoon expirations kicked-in, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.35 higher at 3,327.05, in reasonably heavy volume of nearly 238m shares, with advancing issues leading those declining by 1,118 to 634. Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was quoted 2.99 higher at 422.92, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.30 to 589.12. On Thursday the Dow closed 3.51 lower at 3,315.70. The quarterly 'triple witching', when stock-index futures, stock-index options and options on individual stocks all expire, is usually marked by volatility. Yesterday's session was notable for its comparative calm. In the bond market, trading was light as investors awaited the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht tomorrow. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/32 at 99 1/8 , yielding 7.317 per cent, after losing ground in morning trading. Shorter-dated maturities moved in a narrower range, ending the day slightly higher. Blue chip stocks dominated big board trading through the day, with Chrysler climbing Dollars 2 to a year-high of Dollars 23 3/8 , Merck gaining Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47 3/8 , Coca Cola adding Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 45 and International Business Machines off Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 83 1/2 . Boeing edged Dollars  7/8 lower to Dollars 34 1/2 , a 52-week low, after PaineWebber cut its rating on the stock and reduced earnings predictions for the company, reflecting a weak market for jet aircraft. Boeing shares lost ground on Thursday on news of the company's agreement with PGA Group to defer delivery of aircraft worth Dollars 5bn for up to three years. Both companies said yesterday that the value of GPA's commitment to Boeing had not changed. Shares in McDonnell Douglas, another big US aviation company, lost Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 . In the insurance sector, shares in USF&amp;G added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 3/4 in spite of news that the company expects its losses from Hurricane Andrew to be about Dollars 45m after taxes and reinsurance, compared with earlier estimates of about Dollars 40m. Shares in Aetna, which has a large exposure to Hurricane Andrew, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 39. Photographic equipment maker Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 . The company said that its chief financial officer would retire on February 1. In Nasdaq trading, Borland International tumbled Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 41 7/8 in hectic business after Goldman Sachs cut its second-quarter earnings estimates for the company to 20 cents a share from 25 cents, and reduced its fiscal 1993 projections by 20 cents to Dollars 1.45. Other active Nasdaq stocks included Microsoft, down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 7/8 and Intel, up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 65 1/4 . Food Lion, which reported third-quarter net earnings of 10 cents a share, against 11 cents a year earlier, fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 9 7/8 . Canada TORONTO ended little changed in active trading. The TSE 300 index fell 1.10 points to 3,444.95 in volume of 30.9m shares valued at CDollars 326m. Advances led declines 275 to 269. On the week, the index was up about 4 points. Industrial products, gold and consumer products rose moderately while mining fell and banking and energy were flat.</p>

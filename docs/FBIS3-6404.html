It is also seeking links with military-security  organizations  in Europe such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  and the Western European Union (WEU), the officials said.    Assistant Minister for Policy Planning Yi Chang-chun began a  tour on March 13 taking him to Russia, Finland, Hungary, Austria  and Belgium for meetings with foreign affairs and defense  officials. He returns on March 27.    Seoul hopes to participate in the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) session opening in Hungary this  December under "special guest" status like Japan, they said.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said on a number of  occasions that Northeast Asia needs a multilateral security  dialogue forum, recommending a mini-CSCE body for the region.    Yi has already met with Russian Vice Foreign Minister  Alexandre Panov and will discuss cooperation at the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), the  first regional security forum in the Asia-Pacific zone, slated  for July in Bangkok, officials said.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O slightly ahead of forecast at Pounds 270m as conditions improve PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday announced slightly higher than forecast profits for last year and said conditions had improved for a number of divisions. Pre-tax profits increased 16 per cent, from Pounds 233m to Pounds 270.4m, after restatement of the previous year's figure under FRS 3. Under the old accounting standards, profits increased 4.5 per cent to Pounds 227.1m. At the interim stage, profits increased 38 per cent to Pounds 101.1m. Lord Sterling, chairman, said the performance was 'very creditable'. He said Bovis Homes, the housebuilding arm which suffered during the year, had improved and 'gone along quite merrily' in the last few months. Turnover increased 12.9 per cent to Pounds 5.53bn. Excluding discontinued operations such as the business service companies sold yesterday to Granada, turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn. P&amp;O's cruises and ferries division performed well, lifting operating profits 19 per cent to Pounds 153m despite recession in its main markets of the US and UK. Container and bulk shipping saw flat operating profits of Pounds 36.2m, despite lower freight rates, thanks to cost cutting. Other divisional profits were: service businesses fell 5 per cent to Pounds 77.3m; investment property increased 38 per cent to Pounds 90.9m. Housebuilding, construction and development reported operating losses of Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 25.1m) after a Pounds 30m write down on land values. The profits were struck using year end exchange rates, and would have been about Pounds 10m lower if average rates had been used. Lord Sterling said the company was discussing with its auditors whether to move to average rates. Net borrowings rose nearly Pounds 300m during the second half of the year to Pounds 1.89bn on stockholders capital and reserves of Pounds 2.25bn, to give gearing of 84 per cent. Following the sale of businesses to Granada, gearing will fall to about 60 per cent, the company said. Earnings were affected by a Pounds 20m increase in the tax charge and fell from 35.2p to 32.9p. A maintained final dividend of 17p is recommended, for an unchanged total of 30.5p. P&amp;O's shares added 2p to 603p. See Lex</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fraud inquiry at Alan Paul The Merseyside fraud squad is investigating Alan Paul, the hairdressing and beauty company placed in receivership last December. Papers are being evaluated by the Crown Prosecution Service, but police have refused to discuss details of the investigation. Questions were raised ahead of the receivership about Alan Paul's financing arrangements for its franchises. Franchisees also claimed their accounts were mismanaged. Alan Paul was a high profile company which claimed to be recession proof when it came to the USM in 1989. It was hit by a failed rights issue, profits warnings and boardroom rows.</p>

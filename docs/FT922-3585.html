			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Great Portland static as asset value falls for third year GREAT PORTLAND Estates yesterday underlined the continued pressure on central London property values by announcing a 26 per cent fall in its net asset value, from 286p to 212p, for the 12 months to March 31, its third consecutive year of declining assets. Pre-tax profits increased marginally, from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 33.9m, before taking account of an extraordinary loss of Pounds 13.7m which resulted from the disposal of its investment in Bride Hall, an investment and trading company. 'It is generally accepted that we face the worst conditions to have been experienced in nearly half a century,' said Mr Richard Peskin, chairman. 'Recovery from this deep recession is likely to be slow and fragile and, inevitably, property values will lag behind any general improvement in the economy,' he said. He expected the next year 'to be primarily one of consolidation'. Mr Peskin said that the dividend was likely to be maintained. 'At this time I have no reason to feel that, except in the most unlikely of circumstances, the current dividend of 10p will not be paid for the year ending March 31 1993,' he said. Over the period, the company spent Pounds 300m in reducing the exposure to central London from 83 per cent to 67 per cent and increasing its re-tail and industrial property from 14 per cent to 24 per cent. Rental income increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 70.7m. Gross rental income at the end of the period was more than Pounds 82m a year, of which 85 per cent is expected to be secure for three years. The company has cash balances of Pounds 24.8m and more than Pounds 100m of unused facilities. Voids comprised 7 per cent of floor area and 10 per cent of gross rental income, representing Pounds 8m of rental income. Great Portland's investment property was valued by Hillier Parker at Pounds 874m, reflecting a yield of 9.2 per cent on current income, representing a decline of just under 14 per cent for the year. The revaluation comprised an 18.7 per cent decline in London's West End, Victoria and Covent Garden; a 19.4 per cent fall in the City and Holborn; a 4.3 per cent fall in outer London and suburbs; and a 3 per cent rise in the prov-inces. Office and commercial property fell by 16 per cent; retail and showroom by 4.6 per cent and light industrial by 8.8 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 11.5p to 11.2p. A final divi-dend of 6.6p is proposed making an unchanged total for the year of 10p. COMMENT An otherwise dreary chairman's statement was leavened with Mr Peskin's idiosyncratic wit. 'When the going gets tough, the tough get gearing]' he declared, alluding to acquisitions which reduced the company's exposure to central London. The comment slightly nonplussed the City; although it approves Great Portland's strategy of reducing its exposure to London property, its increased gearing of 75 per cent leaves little room for manoeuvre. Apart from letting the voids in its portfolio, it is treading water until the London property market recovers. For several years, pre-tax profits and dividends, which are only just covered, are likely to be static. The net asset value is likely to drop to about 190p this year, before a small uplift the following year. Prospects are unexciting for the shares - down yesterday from 153p to 152p - which are on a discount to net assets of 20 per cent and a yield of 8.8 per cent.</p>

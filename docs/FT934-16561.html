			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Hungary sets up investment promotion agency HUNGARY yesterday set up eastern Europe's first independent investment promotion agency, marking a new maturity of the region's solicitation of international investors. In 1990 western business interest in the former communist countries of the region was feverish and the new democratic governments could afford to wait for approaches. But recession in eastern and western Europe has inhibited capital flows and sharpened competition for investment. Hungary has attracted more than Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.64bn) of foreign direct investment since 1989, and claims this represents more than half the total put into east Europe. However, foreign investment in Hungary peaked in 1991 at Dollars 1.7bn and is forecast to slow to Dollars 1.5bn this year. 'The beautiful days are over and we have to struggle with a new and more difficult environment,' said Mr Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for international economic relations. Yesterday, ITD Hungary, an investment and trade development agency modelled partly on those of Scotland and Ireland, was founded. ITD Hungary said it would take a 'targeted and proactive' approach. 'We have learned that new and more sophisticated methods are required to attract quality, greenfield investment.' ITD aims to provide a one-stop shop for western investors, who have had to deal directly with overlapping branches of government. The new agency also plans to focus on drawing western investors into the motor components, food processing and tourism sectors. Hungary puts particular emphasis on motor components because of the country's strong combination of developed skills and wages that are low compared with western levels. Until the latest initiatives, the main device to promote foreign investment has been the tax incentive. Hungary granted tax holidays for five years to joint ventures in preferred sectors. But the current law is to expire at year-end. Also, complaints about discrimination against domestic investors and Finance Ministry concerns at the mortgaging of future tax revenue have induced a change in regulations. The latest draft proposes tax relief for reinvested dividends and for companies in high-technology sectors, but on a largely discretionary basis. Whatever the outcome, Hungary's investment regime will remain more generous than those in Poland and the Czech Republic, which have phased out almost all tax advantages for foreign investors.</p>

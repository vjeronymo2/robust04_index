			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia sees trebling of telecoms in six years The Malaysian government wants to more than treble the size of its telephone network in the next six years, and is anxious for western telecoms companies to help, the country's telecommunications minister said yesterday. Mr Samy Vellu told an FT conference on Asia-Pacific telecommunications in Hong Kong that Malaysia planned to increase its number of phone subscribers from 2.3m to 7.8m by 2000 as 'a core aspect of our infrastructure modernisation'. It looked to western operators and equipment suppliers to play an 'active role'. Mr Vellu made no reference to the Malaysian government's ban on state contracts going to UK companies. Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group with a majority share in Hong Kong Telecom, is keen to invest in Malaysia. It has been in talks with Binariang, a private Malaysian company which recently gained a digital cellular telephony licence and is believed to be seeking a western strategic partner with which to build its network. Mr Joseph Farina, president of network systems for Nynex, the US regional Bell operator which has invested in Thailand, said Nynex's joint venture with local partners to build 2m new lines for the Bangkok area was 'an attractive model' for other partnership projects in the region, notably in China. Nynex is one of several US operators investing in the region's countries with emerging markets. Mr Farina contrasted the equivalence in the number of phones and television sets per head in the US - about 1.2 - with the position in Asia. Vietnam has 26 people per TV but 435 people per telephone. 'That is an important validation for us of the likely boom in the Asian telecoms market,' he said. Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, predicted that the market capitalisation of listed telecoms companies in the region would increase from about Dollars 85bn to Dollars 150bn over the next four years, with the number of listed companies rising from about 20 to 50. Mr Alex Arena, Hong Kong's telecommunications regulator, said the Hong Kong government's aim was to make the colony a 'telecommunications hub' for the region by pursuing strong pro-competition policies. Hong Kong Telecom's monopoly in domestic traffic is to expire next year. Three companies have been licensed to enter the market. The Australian government is pursuing still stronger competition policies, giving all city residents the chance to vote to change telephone company in municipal ballots. Mr Robin Davey, Australian telecommunications regulator, said more than 50 per cent of residents had voted.</p>

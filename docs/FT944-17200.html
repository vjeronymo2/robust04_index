			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / This Week: Television Cracker (Monday, 9-10pm, ITV) returns for an encore which is shorter than ITV would have liked. Writer Jimmy McGovern has decided to restrict himself to half the number of episodes Granada wanted to commission. Robbie Coltrane fizzes as Fitz the hard-drinking, big-gambling forensic psychologist who, in the first episode, gets to grips with a bereaved father seeking revenge for his son, who died in the Hillsborough tragedy. An absorbing documentary on Porton Down in Network First (Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm, ITV) details Porton's leading role in developing chemical weapons since the start of this century. Porton Down also appears to have benefitted from data collected by Nazis in the concentration camps. The programme-makers have unearthed evidence of experiments performed on human volunteers which have left them riddled with disease and, in one case, dead. Many of the British volunteers have suffered quietly for years, having been sworn to silence by the Official Secrets Act. However, Porton Down's US counterpart has started paying compensation to its human guinea pigs, which has resulted in a trickle of information that the documentary traces to its source with astonishing results. Jazz fans should tune in for Alan Plater's Screen One: Doggin' Around (Sunday, 10.05-11.35pm, BBC1), with Ronnie Scott playing himself, Elliott Gould as a has-been pianist and Geraldine James as his minder. It combines Plater's two obsessions - jazz and the north of England - and he has a lot of fun with in-jokes, some of them so obtuse that only aficionados will get them all.</p>

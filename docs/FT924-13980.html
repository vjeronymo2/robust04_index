			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / When unity can sap the strength of a union: Germany's IG Metall wields unusual power, but will have to struggle to maintain its influence Germany's 3.5m-strong engineering union, IG Metall, is an increasingly rare organisation in the industrialised world - a trade union with power and self-confidence. But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of the union who this week presides over its triennial Congress in Hamburg, will need all his own strength to keep it that way, as German politicians and employers look to organised labour for the sacrifices needed to finance unification and to resist recession. Mr Steinkuhler's union faces these difficulties from a position of relative strength. It has won for its west German members a 35-hour week and, in 1991 and 1992, secured pay deals which were above the rate of inflation. For its 850,000 new east German members it has done even better - winning a deal with the engineering employers to implement a phased equalisation of wages between the two parts of Germany by 1994. Much of the union's historic success has been rooted in laws which give employees a significant voice at both plant and board level in German industry. IG Metall, the largest of Germany's 17 industrial unions, has also played an important role in the institutional web of government, employers, unions and the Bundesbank, which steers the German economy. But as the economic costs of unification have become more apparent, the German corporatist model - and in particular the privileged position of organised labour - has come under increasing attack. Critics, led by the liberal Free Democrats, the smaller party in the coalition government, say that while the model may have helped to distribute wealth in a steadily expanding economy it should now be jettisoned. They claim that the external shock of reunification, exacerbated by the threat of recession, has revealed the lack of flexibility in the corporatist system. Mr Steinkuhler sees his job as maintaining the union's place at the centre of economic management during what he describes as a defensive period for organised labour. He accepts that a dialogue over financing reconstruction in the east is urgently required, and is even ready to accept a five-year pay agreement, providing wages are raised in line with inflation and taxes. But in contrast to the government, which wants cuts in pay and welfare in the west to form the centrepiece of a 'solidarity pact' to finance a transfer of funds to the east, the union wants more tax increases. This time, says Mr Steinkuhler, the taxes must last longer and 'all social forces must pay according to their ability to do so'. By that he means that the self-employed and public officials - who were excluded from part of last year's unification tax increase - should bear a greater share of the burden. He also favours a levy on post-tax profits, which would be higher for companies not investing in eastern Germany. In support of his demands he says that, since 1990, employees have contributed DM73bn (Pounds 29.2bn) to the cost of unity compared with only DM17bn from employers. Mr Steinkuhler is equally clear in rejecting arguments for a suspension of the wage equalisation deal for eastern Germany. Employers say the agreement merely protects the well-off western workers from competition by raising unit labour costs in the east. Mr Steinkuhler believes that the problem in the east is not wage levels but a lack of marketable products. He says that where workers have taken pay cuts - such as at the MZ Zschopau motorbike plant - factories have still closed. There is also said to be opposition to the wage equalisation agreement from within his own union. Some of the eastern members of IG Metall are believed to oppose the deal because they attach more importance to job security than to wage increases. Mr Steinkuhler, however, claims that the equalisation deal is popular in the east. 'Our people there tell us that they cannot pay capitalist prices with socialist wages,' he says. The equalisation deal is also a measure of how attitudes towards the financing of reunification have changed. In 1990 the deal enjoyed almost universal assent. It was expected to promote the swift social union that the east Germans had been promised as well as helping to slow the exodus of east Germans to the west. Mr Steinkuhler argues that the emigration from east to west continues and that without the agreement it would accelerate again. Many economists, however, claim that the flow is driven by unemployment more than low wages and that the equalisation deal is contributing to the loss of jobs. The IG Metall leader appears to concede there is some connection between higher wages and unemployment in eastern Germany. For example, he quotes approvingly the expectation that real labour costs in eastern Germany will remain 20 per cent below those in western Germany even after wages are nominally equalised in 1994. That is because east Germans will not receive many of the extra benefits enjoyed by their counterparts in the west. A senior colleague also says that the union might offer a freeze at the 1994 wage level in the east for several years. Even if he wins the arguments on such issues, however, Mr Steinkuhler is facing more practical problems. Most worrying is the fragmentation of the bargaining system in the east. German employers say that a large number of companies in the east have not joined their respective employers' associations and even those that have are often paying below the agreed level - with the approval of their employees. In western Germany a 21-month deal agreed in May has resolved wage disputes for the duration of the pact, but IBM Germany, a subsidiary of the US computer company, has recently announced its withdrawal from Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' body. Other big employers, such as Daimler-Benz, are transferring jobs abroad. In another worrying precedent for IG Metall, the DAG white-collar union recently offered a pay cut at Lufthansa. This must all seem a long way from the union's last West German Congress in 1989. Then it was rallying for its successful assault on the 35-hour week and developing a new bargaining programme for eliminating distinctions between blue and white-collar workers. As in Germany, times have also become harder in international markets. In response, IG Metall has tried to support the international competitiveness of its members by strengthening sister unions around the world and by pushing the Social Charter within Europe. For the moment, according to Mr Steinkuhler, the big challenge is to prevent a flood of cheap labour from eastern Europe. Ahead, he observes, lies a period of 'tougher distributional conflict' throughout the industrial world. But few other unions are as well equipped to tackle the struggle.</p>

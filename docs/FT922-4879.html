			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Automotive shares lively as French equities rise BOURSES seemed to be recovering yesterday from last Thursday's Ascension Day holiday which, until Monday evening, seemed to be extended in spirit if not in fact, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS improved with the automotive sector in lively form. The CAC-40 index closed up 7.47 at 2,024.87 in turnover of some FFr2bn. Peugeot gained in early trade on the positive outlook for the US car industry. The car group rose to an intraday high of FFr802.00 before the release of disappointing May sales figures sent it down to close off FFr4 at FFr789. However, in spite of Peugeot's fall yesterday the shares have outperformed the index by 21 per cent in the last year. Michelin also took comfort from the US data, and a buy note, to close up FFr4.40 at FFr219.40. Eurotunnel lost 55 centimes to FFr35.95 following an announcement by the regulator that recent price movements were to be investigated. Some analysts commented that the warrants have been more volatile than the shares recently; yesterday they were down 2 centimes at 29 centimes. FRANKFURT stayed firmly in its consolidation phase, the DAX index closing just 3.25 higher at 1,801.39 after a 0.12 decline to 718.22 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover remained low after Monday's DM5.1bn. News did not help share prices. A Siemens Eurobond issue with warrants to raise some Dollars 1.3bn apparently ended an existing game in the expiring 1986/92 warrant series, and the shares fell DM4.60 to DM689.40. Meanwhile, Schering was unhappy about government proposals to freeze pharmaceutical prices for two years; the shares fell DM6.80 to DM786.50. There was an upswing in steels, and some engineers. In construction, Bilfinger rose DM17 to DM1,075 on a 50 per cent rise in 1991 profits. MILAN returned to life as its computerised trading system came back on stream, turnover recovering from a truncated L63bn as the Comit index rose 2.33 to 500.31. Interest centred on industrials, high asset value stocks lagging behind because of fears that the government might impose a wealth or real estate tax. Fiat rose L67 to L5,407, climbing to L5,430 after hours, while the agro-industrial and chemicals group, Montedison, was L23 better at L1,503. AMSTERDAM picked up as the dollar strengthened and the CBS Tendency index finished 0.8 firmer at 131.1. Turnover was a moderate Fl 800.3m. Attention remained focused on KLM which reports its annual figures tomorrow. There is a wide range of analysts' forecasts to pick from, but all point in a positive direction. The shares were 30 cents weaker by the close at Fl 39.60. Fokker improved 80 cents to Fl 35.50 on unconfirmed reports that negotiations between the aircraft group and Dasa were nearing completion. ZURICH's SMI index put on 7.1 to 1,930.4, brokers saying that buying came mostly from foreign investors. STOCKHOLM lost most of Monday's gains, the Affarsvarlden General index falling 5.7 to 992.7 after the suspension of interest payments by two units of the real estate company, Coronado. The company said that SE-Banken and Nordbanken were its main creditors. SE-Banken A lost SKr3 to SKr36.50 in heavy volume. Meanwhile, the insurer, Skandia, Sweden's largest real estate owner, saw its B SKr6 lower at SKr113. HELSINKI fell another 1.1 per cent after the 1.0 per cent fall on Monday, the Hex index closing 8.8 lower at 820.4. Forestry shares rose by 0.3 per cent on average, due to investor interest in Finnish export companies, but banks and finance houses fell 1.7 per cent after KOP's report last week of a widening loss for the first four months of this year. VIENNA rose in active trade with the ATX index up 11.89 to 1,002.09. The market was still buoyant following Monday's successful placing of 5.4m new shares in Vienna airport. Some analysts said that the shares were being traded on the grey market at Sch370 for a Sch35 premium over the issue price. Dealing is expected to begin by mid-month. Elsewhere OMV gained Sch21 to Sch922. BRUSSELS was lifted by interest in cyclical stocks. The Bel-20 index closed up 2.84 at 1,235.40 in volume estimated at BFr957m. Solvay advanced BFr175 to BFr13,600 for its fourth consecutive rise, while Petrofina fell BFr50 to BFr10,750. MADRID rose on good institutional buying with the utilities sector leading the way. Endesa gained Pta90 to Pta3,735. The closing index was delayed by technical problems in Spain.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1200.25  1200.68  1200.55  1200.99  1200.95  1200.87  1200.87  1200.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1201.76            Day's Low  1199.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jun 1         May 29        May 28         May 27         May 26    1196.12       1199.58       1195.22??      1194.56        1198.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).                               ??

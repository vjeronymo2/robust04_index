			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Miller Lectures on Strikes in </F> Senate"]    [Text] "Is the government in favor of salary  controls? What is Waldemar Pawlak's position on the issue? How  long is this chaos supposed to last?" Senators asked Labor  Minister Leszek Miller these questions yesterday. "Real  unanimity is found only in cemeteries," the minister said.    Labor Minister Leszek Miller reported to the Senate on the  situation in which the country has found itself as a result of  the wave of strikes. According to the minister, the action by  "Solidarity" may endanger economic stability. "Inflation is  falling, unemployment has stopped rising, and economic  indicators are optimistic." This is the way the minister  portrayed the country's economic picture. "The protests by  Solidarity are an obstacle to overcoming economic stagnation,"  he lamented.    According to Minister Miller, destroying social peace, which  has been built with so much hard work, may also be a result of  the strikes, while the social situation is being carefully  watched by foreign partners, who regard the situation as a test  of the state's credibility.    According to Miller, a majority of demands put forward by  Solidarity can be discussed within the framework of a trilateral  commission, which includes representatives of the government,  employers, and trade unions (the government will strive to have  the commission's powers defined statutorily). The minister  thinks, for instance, that it is possible to abandon central  salary-control measures in state-owned enterprises provided some  conditions are met. First of all, a process of  commercialization of these companies must take place. But the  minister stressed that the government will not be able to  approve of solutions that would exceed the inflation level  provided for by this year's budget.    Miller also holds it against Solidarity for having withdrawn  from negotiations concerning social guarantees for citizens. In  his view, the reason it happened was that Solidarity fears  losing the special position it enjoyed during talks with  previous governments. "Negotiations are not as spectacular as  strikes and demonstrations," Miller said, "but negotiations will  at least result in changes being made to laws."    The minister announced that the government wants to  establish  its own rapport with trade unions based on principles of  partnership and treating all trade union centers the same way.    The senators, however, were not happy with these  explanations. "What is Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's position  on the neopopiwek [salary-controlling legislation]?" they  pressured Miller. "There should remain a control of salaries in  some form until the end of the year," Miller presented the  government's position. "After that, one can gradually abandon  such controls, provided certain conditions are fulfilled that  would prevent an uncontrolled increase in salaries."    "How long will this chaos last?" asked Senator Krzysztof  Kozlowski of the Union of Freedom (formerly Democratic Union) in  a dramatic tone. "Either one should be in favor of salary  controls, or against them," he demanded unequivocal  declarations. Miller responded by saying that the Democratic  Left Alliance and the entire governing coalition has a right to  have different views on an issue as fundamental as this one.  "Real unanimity is found only in cemeteries," Miller said.  "One can call this chaos, but one could also describe it as  learning the difficult art of reaching a compromise."    "Why does the prime minister not take a stand of his own in  a  situation when the country is in danger?" attacked Zbigniew  Religa, chairman of the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms.  Miller replied that Pawlak will make a speech in the Sejm on  Friday [29 April], while the Government's Press Office has  presented the prime minister's position before.</p>

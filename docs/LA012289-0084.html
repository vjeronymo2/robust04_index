			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH GATE POLICE CUT SERVICE AFTER PHONE TAX DEFEAT  </P> <P> Police are reducing some non-emergency services and eliminating homicide  investigations because of budget limitations, Police Chief Ronald George has  announced.  </P> <P> The cutbacks are in response to the defeat in November of a proposed tax that  police had hoped would pay for more officers.  </P> <P> Police response time to less serious crimes, such as thefts of car stereos, may  increase from 20 minutes to as long as an hour, or officers may not respond at  all, George said.  </P> <P> "In some cases we'll probably not go to the scene of minor crimes, but will be  asking citizens to come into the station to fill out reports," George said.  </P> <P> Police will continue to respond as soon as possible to major crimes such as  burglaries and robberies in progress or life-threatening emergencies, George  said. On the average, South Gate police get to the scenes of those crimes  within 3 1/2 minutes, George said.  </P> <P> "I know we will be getting some complaints (about not responding to lesser  crimes) but we can no longer afford the niceties. We'll try and make the  transition as painless as possible," George added.  </P> <P> The chief of the 89-officer force had warned of service cutbacks if voters  failed to approve a tax on monthly telephone bills to help pay for 10 more  officers, five more civilian police employees and new equipment.  </P> <P> As a result, George said, the department has asked the county Sheriff's  Department to investigate homicides in South Gate, a service provided regularly  to small police departments. About eight or nine homicides occur in the city  every year. Three South Gate homicide detectives have been reassigned to  investigate other major crimes, he said.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, eight officers were reassigned to a new Crime Impact Team  to concentrate on serious crimes. Four of the officers were from the patrol  division, and two each were from the narcotics squad and grand theft auto  squad.  </P> <P> The team, which dons black jackets with gold lettering and rides in unmarked  police vehicles, has been assigned initially to concentrate on a significant  increase in stolen vehicles, George said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crime Rates Rose  </P> <P> Although major crimes in the city rose 5% last year, the number of auto thefts  increased 18.6% to 981. The stolen cars generally are stripped, and the parts  are sold, he said.  </P> <P> "We think gangs are heavily involved in grand theft auto crimes. So, by  fighting grand theft auto crimes we are also fighting the gangs," George said.  He estimated that there are 17 known active gangs with about 1,700 members in  the city of 80,000.  </P> <P> A 24-hour telephone hot line was installed last week to allow people to report  crime tips that the team will follow up on, George said.  </P> <P> Lt. Doug Christ, the impact team's supervisor, said it has been very successful  in the first eight days of work, making 53 arrests, including eight arrests for  stolen vehicles. The other arrests involve charges ranging from possession of a  deadly weapon to burglary. George said the number of arrests is much higher  than it would have been without the team.  </P> <P> Christ said: "These are pro-active arrests, as opposed to someone calling us.  We went out and generated them. We went out and found them (through  surveilance) by being on the streets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Councilmen Told  </P> <P> Last week, George described the Crime Impact Team plan to City Council members  and other officials, who approved.  </P> <P> Councilman William H. DeWitt said: "It is an economic fact of life, we can only  do so much with the resources we have. I hope we will be able to satisfy most  of the people. Time will tell."  </P> <P> Bruce Spragg, city administrator, said: "We are trying to make the best use of  our resources by re-shifting them. There will be some complaints about the slow  response, but that is the price we must pay."  </P> <P> Five positions in the department were eliminated last year because of budget  cuts.  </P></p>

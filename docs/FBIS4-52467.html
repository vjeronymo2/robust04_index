			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has just issued a resolution on  reforming administrative procedures. The resolution said that  administrative procedures, especially those related to resolving  the problems of citizens and organizations, problems are not  uniform and sometimes cumbersome. It said that responsible  agencies trend to arbitrarily resolve these problems by focusing  on their conveniences rather than paying attention to the  people's interests and aspirations.    The resolution stressed that many state organizations have  incorrectly implemented regulations on receiving and resolving  complaints while adopting an attitude of deferring work to other  agencies. This has resulted in a stalemate. Some agencies even  establish procedures and fees in an arbitrary fashion beyond the  boundaries of their authority, while others collect fees higher  than the permissible rate set by the state. Many organizations  do not make various state administrative procedures public, as  they fail to train cadres to handle tasks effectively in this  regard. Many civil servants fail to show courtesy toward the  people and adopt a self-conceited attitude. Worse still was  that some even asked for a bribe to help people resolve their  problems.    These negative practices have not only wasted time, effort,  and funds of various agencies and units, but have encouraged  corruption, created indignation, and diminished confidence in  the state. As a result, it is necessary for us to urgently  reform administrative procedures to meet the people's legitimate  aspiration. It is also an important step in further reforming  the national administration system.    The government resolution set forth eight concrete tasks to  be implemented in the second quarter, which are aimed at  fundamental change in resolving work and problems between state  agencies and other organizations and between state agencies and  the people, especially in receiving and resolving problems.    The government also asked various echelons and agencies to  strive to urgently improve their work and performances,  especially members of the cabinet, directors of government  organizations, chairmen of people's committees of provinces and  municipalities directly subordinate to the central government,  ministers, deputy ministers, and organizations at ministerial  level.</p>

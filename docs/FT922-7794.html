			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Bruges II lives up to its billing: Thatcher's speech on Europe SENIOR Conservatives these days are inclined to respond to Mrs Margaret Thatcher's public pronouncements on the future of Europe with a carefully patronising smile. Their expressions carry a simple message: 'Of course we listen but, well, the former prime minister is finding it so difficult to adapt to retirement; we should not be surprised if she sometimes sounds a little eccentric.' It is an image for which Mrs Thatcher must accept some of the blame. Even as prime minister she tended to shoot from the hip. Freed from the steadying hand of her Downing Street office, she has too frequently allowed intemperate language and unguarded outbursts against her successor to blur her message. She did not make that mistake yesterday. Her speech on Europe's political architecture during the 1990s ceded no ground to those who believe in a federal future for the continent, but it carefully avoided gratuitous criticism of Mr John Major for his willingness to remain, albeit grudgingly, on the route mapped out by Britain's European partners. The speech was billed 'Bruges II', the follow-up to her devastating attack four years ago on the ambitions of Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission. It lived up to the billing. The central theme was that everything that has happened since Bruges has strengthened rather than weakened her argument for a loose confederation of sovereign states rather than a federalist superstate. Since the row in her party that triggered her political downfall, Mrs Thatcher has become more convinced that Europe's leaders are grappling with a vision of the past rather than of the future. She believes it should be looking forward to a community of 30 states rather than to a bureaucratic structure designed to impose uniformity on the present membership of 12. The community's duty to embrace the emerging democracies of eastern Europe argued for a 'multi-track' Europe based on a single, free market but in which ad hoc groups of countries could forge varying degrees of co-operation on different issues. She is as concerned as ever about the dominant role Germany might take in a tightly knit community; as certain as ever that the way to constrain German ambitions is to widen rather than deepen the community. Mr Major, no great admirer of the commission, is sympathetic to some of the detail of her analysis. In spite of Downing Street's deliberately low-key response, it is one that is impossible to reconcile with the prime minister's commitment at the heart of Europe.</p>

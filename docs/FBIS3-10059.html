CEDLA asserts that eight out of 10 urban families do not  have  enough income to pay for their basic needs, according to  research carried out in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba, and Santa  Cruz.    According to the study, 80.1 percent of the urban population  are poor, of which 49.4 percent are destitute, while the  percentage of non-destitute (those who earn enough to buy food,  but not clothes or pay for housing or anything else) reached  30.5 percent.    The CEDLA study, which was disseminated today by the JATHA  news agency, states that "the neoliberal adjustment implemented  by Bolivian governments since 1985 has worsened the unfair  distribution of wealth, increased the concentration of income,  and reduced the purchasing power of salaries and wages."    During the last few years, workers in the largest cities  extended their work week by four weekly hours, with low  salaries, lower income, and less labor stability.    The researchers said that not only has poverty increased,  but  the benefits to which a minority are entitled have been reduced  as well.    The report states that 15 percent of the working population  obtained half the income generated by the Bolivian economy,  while the remaining 85 percent of the working population got the  other half.    Bishop Edmundo Abastoflor, chairman of the Bolivian Bishops  Conference, today warned of the serious social consequences that  this gap between rich and poor, which increases daily, may bring.    "It is shocking to see the squandering of money in the  downtown areas of Bolivian cities, with luxury cars and  millions' worth of construction work, while you can also see the  deterioration in the standard of living of the poor classes,"  said the bishop, who is worried about the increase of poverty in  the country.    Abastoflor said that the poor must be helped with political  and social measures so that they can improve their standards of  living with dignity, as is appropriate for human beings.</p>

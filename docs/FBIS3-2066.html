Statistical data show that the amount of salt output and  sale  that was not covered by the state plan totaled more than 800,000  metric tons last year. Because of tax evasion, this portion of  salt sales did not contribute to tax revenue but had impact on  the domestic salt market.    The value of salt is not high. Then why does salt smuggling  run wild? The root cause lies in the pretty high levy on salt.  The state makes a levy of about 200 yuan on each metric ton of  salt. For instance, from January to November 1993, some 30,000  metric tons of smuggled salt was seized in Sichuan province,  which implies that about 6 million yuan of salt tax drained  away, not to mention the actual amount of smuggled salt which  could be very much higher. Therefore, salt smugglers can reap  staggering profits from their deals, at the expense of  considerable losses on the part of the state. A source from the  Sichuan Provincial Salt Industry Bureau said some 200,000 metric  tons of smuggled salt was sold on the market in Sichuan last  year, incurring a 40 million yuan loss in tax revenue to the  state.    What is more worth to be brought to our attention is that  the  spread of salt smuggling may directly impair consumers' health.  As some salt of inferior quality has been sold to some  impoverished areas, cases of poisoning or even death caused by  salt consumption have taken place from time to time. There have  been also some cases where industrial salt was sold as edible  salt, and the consumption of iodine-free salt was the cause for  the increase in the amount of iodine deficiency in areas where  iodine is in short supply.    The source concerned noted that the spread of salt smuggling  is a reflection of the fact that laws are not observed. The  department concerned suggests that administrative actions,  economic legislation, and other means be applied to a  comprehensive operation to curb salt smuggling.</p>

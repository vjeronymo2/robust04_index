			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Savoy/Forte Mr Rocco Forte may not have won the Savoy Hotel for his own group but the effort has not been as in vain as it seems. The Savoy is never likely to earn more than a few million pounds and the bid for Meridien is strategically much more important. Yet Forte needed to generate real value out of its Savoy holding, something which should become easier with the change in management. Perhaps that will eventually give Forte the chance to sell out at a reasonable price.</p>

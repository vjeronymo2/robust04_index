			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Market forces were the power behind sanctions BLACK and white South Africans alike find it difficult to be dispassionate about the 30-year sanctions era, which ended with yesterday's call by Nelson Mandela to abandon the sanctions weapon. In anti-apartheid circles, it is treated as self-evident that sanctions brought the economy to its knees and the ruling National Party to its senses; conversely, many whites believe they were either unnecessary or actually counter-productive. The answer is that sanctions had different effects on different segments of the population, reinforcing the paranoia of the right while simultaneously spurring reform among those already committed to change; angering some blacks while boosting the morale of others; and while usually achieving some effect, often missing the intended target. Viewed as a strategy aimed at bringing about a clear transfer of power from whites to blacks, sanctions cannot be said to have succeeded. But they were clearly a factor in the potent cocktail of forces which led to the demise of apartheid. In an authoritative report for the London School of Economics, researcher Ms Merle Lipton concludes: 'His (Mr FW de Klerk's) unexpected crossing of the Rubicon (in 1990) goes beyond any consideration of sanctions, which were not hurting enough to explain such a dramatic move.' Mr de Klerk has simply recognised, as his predecessor Mr PW Botha had begun to do, that apartheid had led South Africa into a cul-de-sac from which it had to emerge to guarantee its survival. Whatever the political impact of sanctions, it is clear that they had considerable psychological and economic effects: whether they were unavoidable or unnecessary, there can be no doubt that they were costly. Tens of thousands of skilled whites left the country rather than accept the status of international pariahs, refusing to live in a society deprived of normal cultural and sporting exchanges. And even the most defiant supporters of apartheid have nonetheless shown obvious delight at being readmitted to the international sporting community since 1990. Indeed, many would argue that sporting and cultural sanctions were the most effective of all - not least because these measures had a clear and unambiguous impact, unlike economic sanctions whose effects are difficult to differentiate from normal market forces. Ms Lipton argues that while sanctions imposed extra costs and difficulties for the South African economy, the country's economic problems 'are neither unique nor solely due to sanctions. They are primarily due to market forces reacting to adverse perceptions of its economic and political problems.' Indeed, markets and not politicians imposed the harshest sanctions of all: the shortage of international loan capital which has so severely constrained economic growth since the mid-1980s. The crisis was provoked in 1985 when, against a background of internal unrest, several US banks refused to roll over existing loans to South Africa, precipitating a liquidity crisis which forced Pretoria to declare a unilateral moratorium on debt repayments. It has since been repaying those debts under a scheme agreed with creditor banks, reducing its debt to 15 per cent of GDP at the end of 1992 from 43 per cent in August 1985. This has come at a price, however: debt had to be repaid from the country's savings, leading to a net capital outflow of more than R40bn. Not only could this money have gone towards much needed domestic investment, but the need to repay debt has forced Pretoria to constrain growth to avoid sucking in imports which would endanger the current account, which had to remain in surplus to cover repayments. In terms of direct investment, both domestic and foreign, the effects are difficult to quantify. Sanctions prompted uneconomic investment decisions from the public sector, including the decision to invest in a synthetic fuel industry to provide 30 per cent of fuel needs at well over the world market price. The R12bn invested in the Mossgas synthetic fuels project, for example, is 10 times the 1993/94 budgetary allocation for housing, an area of dire shortage. Foreign disinvestment also imposed a burden, with hundreds of US and European companies pulling out. However, the effects were ambiguous: though many companies which wanted to remain were forced out by sanctions, over half are believed to have sold out at bargain basement prices which primarily benefited rich whites, and many retained non-equity links which made their withdrawal largely symbolic. Some job losses among blacks also resulted. Trade sanctions were probably less effective: merchandise exports held up remarkably well during the sanctions era. Figures from the Reserve Bank (central bank) show that the physical volume of exports rose by 10 per cent a year from 1984-90 and from the mid-1980s onward, despite sanctions, growth in South African exports compares favourably with the overall growth in world trade. This is partly explained by the fact that two thirds of exports were remarkably 'sanctions proof', being strategic metals and gold. And though exports would certainly have been even higher without sanctions, their effect was not decisive. Over time, the effect of the oil embargo also declined: local oil companies have been able to buy crude on international markets for some time, without paying an 'apartheid penalty.' However much as South Africans disagree over the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool to inflict economic pain and reap political gain, they agree on at least one thing: they are heartily glad to be rid of them. They realise that the imperative now is to build the economy, not attack it for political ends. That, in itself, is progress.</p>

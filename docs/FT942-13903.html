			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Dredging up 81% Improved margins, rather than a higher volume of business, helped British Dredging, the building materials, ship repairing and concrete products group, to pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.91m for 1993, up 81 per cent from Pounds 1.06m last time. Underpinning the rise was an improved operating profit of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 232,000), slightly offset by reduced interest income of Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 457,000). Turnover increased to Pounds 36m (Pounds 33.7m). Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said this was due almost entirely to a full year's trading from the Selco Trade Centre, Cardiff, which opened in July 1992. The group plans to invest in more building materials distribution outlets, with one opening next year and others to follow. Locations for the new centres have not been revealed. Mr Vernon said the group would make further progress as the volume of business grew. He believed that this would happen this year, 'although there is very little sign of it yet'. He added: 'BDC Concrete Products, which used to be one of our star earners, has shown slightly improved volumes of business.' Earnings per share rose by 86 per cent to 7.91p (4.26p). A final dividend of 3p is proposed, making a total of 5.6p (5.2p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Betzelem Human Rights Organization demands an  inquiry into yesterday's incident in the Jabalyah refugee camp,  in which six Fatah members were killed by gunshots fired by  undercover IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers.    Betzelem says that a probe conducted by its personnel  reveals  that the event was initiated by the IDF unit and that the  soldiers deliberately opened fire without a warning and without  firing in the air. According to Betzelem, the first round of  fire was followed by another, which was apparently meant to  ensure that the masked men were dead.</p>

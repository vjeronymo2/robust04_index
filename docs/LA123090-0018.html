			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: ROCKENWAGNER: REMEMBER THE NAME  </P> <P> Times may be tough in the restaurant business, but that isn't stopping Hans and  Mary Rockenwagner, proprietors of Rockenwagner in Venice and Fama in Santa  Monica, from fulfilling their dream of moving to new, larger quarters. The  couple has just signed a lease on the restaurant space in the Frank  Gehry-designed Edgemar complex on Santa Monica's Main Street -- a space in  which chef Peter De Lucca and his partners had planned to install a bar and  grill last year, but which has in fact remained unoccupied since Edgemar opened  in 1988.  </P> <P> "I see Edgemar as being like a modern town square," Hans Rockenwagner says. The  interior, being designed by David Kellen and Rockenwagner himself (the two also  designed Fama) will elaborate on the town-square theme. "You'll be sitting in a  restaurant surrounded by the facades of buildings," continues Rockenwagner.  "One will actually be the kitchen, one will be the bar, one will be the deli,  and so on." The deli in question is a combination bakery and informal  restaurant planned for one portion of Rockenwagner. Informal Continental-style  breakfast and soups and sandwiches for lunch and dinner will be served there.  The main restaurant will feature an expanded version of the present  Rockenwagner's menu, and will be open for lunch. "We might even have a  hamburger and steak with fries," Rockenwagner says.  </P> <P> The new Rockenwagner, which will seat a total of 75 (instead of 48 as the  Venice location does), is scheduled to open in summer of 1991. Meanwhile, the  fate of the original restaurant is undecided. "We have all kinds of ideas,"  says Rockenwagner. "We might keep it and change the concept, or we might sell  it. If we do close it, though, we'll probably do it about a month before the  new one opens."  </P> <P> SABROSO DOS: Rockenwagner's recently departed Venice neighbor, Sabroso, may not  be gone for good after all. Restaurant owner Jeanine Coyle reports that one of  her regular customers, distressed at her announced plans to temporarily retire  ("I'm just going to take the dog and drive towards Guatemala," she told this  column recently), has found her a new location in Marina del Rey, where she  plans to reopen early this coming year. "A lot of things have happened very  fast," she says. Watch this space for details.  </P> <P> ON THE FIRE: Jean-Francois Meteigner, former chef at L'Orangerie, has taken  over the kitchen temporarily at Diaghilev, the newly renamed luxury dining room  in West Hollywood's Bel Age Hotel. . . . David Teck, former co-proprietor of  Ingrid and David's Gingerhouse International in Tarzana, has a new restaurant:  the World Cafe in Santa Monica. . . . Fleetwood's is new in West Hollywood, on  the site of the old Palette. Namesake and co-owner (with Peter and Ernest  Lepore) of the place is Mick Fleetwood, drummer for and co-founder of Fleetwood  Mac. . . . Mori Teppan Grill and Hibachi Pasta is new in Glendale -- the  Hibachi Pasta part of the name refers to the restaurant's specialty,  quick-grilled Japanese noodles with shrimp, beef, chicken or assorted  vegetables. . . . And, on Thursday nights through the end of February, Emilio's  Ristorante in Hollywood is serving that wonderful Italian "boiled dinner"  called bollito misto -- including beef, veal, veal tongue, capon, and cotechino  sausage, with lentils, sauerkraut and assorted sauces -- at $25 per person.  </P> <P> FRENCH NUMBERS: What are L.A.'s best restaurants -- according to the French?  The November 26th issue of FYI, a magazine published by Forbes, answers that  question -- or at least tell us how Andre Gayot of Gault/Millau rates local  places. His listing of America's top 40 restaurants includes five Southern  California entries: Citrus (with a score of 18/20); Chinois on Main, Patina and  Valentino (all with 17/20); and St. Estephe (16/20). The top-rated U.S.  restaurants are Le Cirque in New York, at 19.5/20 -- the same score given by  the French edition of the guide to such legendary establishments as Robuchon,  Michel Guerard, Troisgros, Marc Meneau and Giradet; and then, at 19/20, Le  Bernardin and Lafayette in New York (the latter of which has just lost its  chef) and Jean-Louis in Washington.  </P> <P> COLETTE'S COOK: Famed French restaurateur, author and gastronomic godfather  Raymond Oliver has died in Paris at the age of 81. Born in Langon, in the  Bordeaux region, he learned his trade at his father's hotel in the city of  Bordeaux itself. In 1948, he and Louis Vaudable, proprietor of Maxim's (which  had been closed temporarily after the liberation of Paris), took over the  venerable old Le Grand Vefour in the Galerie de Beaujolais near the Palais  Royal. Almost certainly the oldest continually operated restaurant in Paris, Le  Grand Vefour was opened in 1784 (as the Cafe Chartres), and had once played  host to Diderot, Dumas and Victor Hugo. It's even said that Napoleon courted  Josephine there. By the 1940s, though, it had fallen into disrepair and  disrepute. Oliver and Vaudable revived it, refurbishing its elaborate  Directoire interior and winning back a latter-day celebrity clientele,  including Colette (who lived a few doors away) and Jean Cocteau. In 1950,  Vaudable went back to Maxim's and Oliver became the sole proprietor -- winning  three stars in the Guide Michelin in 1954. Oliver's kitchen became famous as a  training ground for chefs -- among its graduates is Claude Deligne, chef at  Taillevent. He wrote at least 30 books on cooking and food history and  broadcast several popular cooking shows on TV. In 1983, after he had lost his  third star, and seen his dining room damaged by a terrorist bomb, he sold Le  Grand Vefour to the Taittinger Champagne group -- and a year later he retired  from professional life. His son, Michel, has become a famous restaurateur in  his own right, with the popular, casual Bistrot de Paris, among other  establishments.  </P> <P> SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS: Joss, the upscale contemporary  Chinese restaurant on the Beverly Hills end of the Sunset Strip, offers what it  dubs a "Maid's Night Off" dinner every Sunday night -- five courses at $18 per  person. I wonder if potential customers have to provide proof that they employ  domestic help?  </P></p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Schering turns to core operations - The chemicals group is selling a series of assets SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is focusing on core operations through a series of asset disposals. Last month, the group completed the sales of two of its divisions, manufacturing industrial chemicals and natural substances divisions, to Witco of the US for DM660m (Dollars 415m). This month it will transfer its electro-plating operations to Elf Atochem of France. It is actively seeking a partner for the flagging agrochemicals business. The aim is to dispose of activities in which Schering holds a small part of the market and has little chance of becoming a significant player. Sales of the three disposed divisions were DM895m in the first nine months of this year, compared with DM1.06bn in agrochemicals. Mr Giuseppe Vita, the Italian chairman of Schering's executive board, emphasised the company had no intention of selling off its agrochemicals business but was open for 'global or regional alliances' as well as co-operation. The search for a partner in agrochemicals is taking on added urgency as Schering's output of pesticides and herbicides slid 12 per cent in the first three quarters of last year. This made up 21.8 per cent of group turnover, compared with 25.2 per cent in the same period of 1991. Agrochemicals producers have been hit by a slump in the market and it is among these companies that Schering is seeking a partner. Talks collapsed two years ago with Sandoz on a 50-50 joint venture in agrochemicals after the Swiss company raised its sights to include a share in Schering's lucrative pharmaceuticals business. A company source said Hoechst, the German chemicals company, was seen as a favourite to take over Schering's agrochemicals division. The EC's reform of the common agricultural policy is seen as the main culprit for the fall in the agrochemicals market. Farmers, faced with cuts in subsidies for grain production, are reducing their purchases of plant protection agents. The payments farmers are to receive for each hectare of land they take out of cultivation is regarded as a further disincentive to buy agrochemicals. Mr Vita said the effect of these measures would be a reduction in the European agrochemicals market of about 15 per cent.  Grain production was likely to shrink by up to 25 per cent which would affect Sportak, Schering's top-selling herbicide. Sportak is produced exclusively by Schering's UK subsidiary, the former FBC, which last year closed down part of its plant producing Sportak at Hauxton because of excess capacity. More than 50 per cent of the company's agrochemicals are produced by the UK subsidiary which, along with German agrochemicals output, will bear the brunt of a rationalisation programme. The group's UK agrochemicals operations employ about 1,800 people. Schering began reducing personnel throughout its agrochemicals business in 1990 and by 1994 aims to cut the workforce by 20 per cent. The company believes it has a strong hand to play in its co-operation talks with other agrochemicals producers. Schering's beetroot herbicide and grain fungicide each has an annual turnover of more than DM200m. As a result of last year's divestitures, Schering's turnover this year will drop 20 per cent to roughly DM5bn. Pharmaceuticals will make up 75 per cent of sales and agrochemicals the remainder. Mr Vita said the company intended to concentrate its pharmaceutical activities on Europe, the US and Japan, which would make it less susceptible to economic and exchange rate fluctuations. However, although pharmaceuticals sales rose 10 per cent in the first nine months to DM2.9bn, group earnings dropped 6 per cent to DM201m because of the depressed state of chemicals market and adverse exchange rates. Development and marketing costs are to be reduced by increased co-operation with other companies. This year Schering entered into a co-operation agreement on diagnostics with Sterling Winthrop, the US pharmaceuticals company, under which Schering has an option on all of Sterling Winthrop's diagnostics for magnetic resonance tomography. In return, the US company will be able to introduce Schering's Omniscan diagnostic for which it holds worldwide patent rights. A similar co-operation deal was concluded last year with Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US.</p>

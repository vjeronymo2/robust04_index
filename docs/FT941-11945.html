			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / 'Wise men' of the air see turbulence on the horizon: Their report calls for further airline restructuring Governments should stop interfering in the airline industry and let management take the required steps to restoreprofitability, according to the 'committee of wise men' report published yesterday. The 56-page report on the future of the European airline industrywas ordered by the European Commission. It calls for further liberalisation and'ultimate privatisation' as a solution to the industry's woes. 'There is no way back to previous era of national protectionism,' it states. But the report, entitled 'Expanding Horizons', softens its deregulatory message on thequestion of state aid. It argues that state-owned carriers should be allowed one last dip into public coffers to help their restructuring efforts. Mr Abel Matutes, the outgoing Spanish transport commissioner, appointed the 12-member committee six months ago. Members included Mr Hermann De Croo, a former Belgian transport minister and panel chairman; Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman of Lufthansa;Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman of KLM; Mr Rene Valladon, representative of the trade unions, and the Aga Khan, the billionaire businessman. Although the report's recommendations are non-binding, reaction in Brussels suggested that the committee's calls for liberalisation were bolder than expected. Even Mr Matutes, who otherwise welcomed the report, distanced himself yesterday from its decision to lean towards privatisation. European airlines employ about 400,000 people, while European airports employ a further 500,000. But the airline sector combines strong growth with poor profitability. State-controlled flag carriers are steadily losing market share to independents, particularly charters, the report says. Moreover, European airlines' operating costs are about 48 per cent higher than those of their US counterparts, measured per available tonne kilometre (ATK). Total labour costs per ATK are nearly 37 per cent higher, leading to much lower productivity than in the US, according to the study. These structural weaknesses, combined with tough competition inside the European market, have led to heavy losses since 1990. The report warns that cash-flow generated by European carriers is becoming increasingly inadequate, with debt-equity ratio possibly reaching 80/20 by 1995. Yet 'Expanding Horizons' makes clear that there should be no question of halting the deregulatory tide. It rejects rolling back the limited liberalisation agreed under the so-called Third Package, in effect since January 1, 1993. On overcapacity, the panel recommendsthat airlines themselves must tackle the problem. But the Treaty of Rome's competition rules 'should not unduly inhibit airlines' efforts to solve their problems by means of voluntary agreements'. On pricing, it says the European Commission should as a rule refrain from intervention: 'In present difficult circumstances, the need for increased revenues should be recognised.' Turning to back-door public subsidies, capital injections and other forms of stateaid, the panel says that these have severely contributed to overcapacity and uneconomic pricing. 'Significantly, all the cases submitted during the last three years have involved carriers that are state-owned. 'This in itself is a potentially significant distortion of competition between state-owned and privately-owned airlines.' The committee argues that privatisation is the implicit answer to the privileged treatment of state carriers; but it agrees that privatisation 'normally needs restructuring'. It calls, therefore, for a transitional period in which member states could have a 'one time, last time' opportunity to put carriers on a normal commercial footing. Other conditionsfor state aid include: The submission of a restructuring plan leading to economic and commercial viability within a specified time frame, along with 'significant interest' from the private sector; A recommendation for restructuring plans to be scrutinised by independent professionals working with the European Commission; An undertaking on the part of the governments to refrainfrom interference in commercial decision-making of carriers, and a ban on airlines using public money to buy or take over another air-carrier or extend its owncapacity beyond normal development. The committee also recommends the creation of a 'single airspace for Europe' and the establishment of a separate utility responsible for monitoring a single air-traffic management system. This would end the current system of European air-space and national air-traffic controls. In a concession to the aviation industry, the panel argues that value-added tax on air transport should be ended and that proposals for a carbon energy tax should be dropped. It also recommends that 'member states and the EU should ensure the competitiveness of the European aeronautical industry by providing the same level of support available to the US aeronautical industry'.</p>

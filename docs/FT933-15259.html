			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / BAe cuts risk of breaching covenants BRITISH Aerospace reorganised its debt yesterday to reduce the risk of breaching loan agreements with its banks and to increase flexibility in managing its assets. The company is replacing an Dollars 825m (Pounds 550m) loan, which falls due in June next year, plus some other loans with a Pounds 1.4bn five-year revolving credit facility. At the same time it has changed its main loan covenant from one based on its net assets to one based on its interest cover  -the number of times interest costs are covered by profits. The old net worth covenant was Pounds 1.6bn and net assets are about Pounds 1.8bn. Under the new agreement, BAe is obliged to gradually increase its interest cover from an actual rate of about one-and-a-half times now to a covenant of about three times by 1996. The change allows BAe to 'crystallise liabilities without breaching covenants (with its banks)', said Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director. This means the company could sell assets below book value, making possible the sale of, for instance, its carmaker Rover Group. BAe is legally able to sell Rover next month - five years after buying it from the government. BAe said it had no intention of selling the division and yesterday included motor vehicles in a list of its core businesses. Others were defence, commercial aircraft and aerostructures. Mr Lapthorne said the arrangement 'has been tailored to the company's five-year plan as presented to the banks'. Referring to the increased borrowing limit of Pounds 1.4bn, he said this would reduce the company's reliance on any one of its bankers. He said there would be a small increase in the cost of servicing the debt. When the five-year Dollars 825m loan facility was set up, loan margins were relatively low, making it attractive for borrowers to raise financing in the syndicated loan market. The margin was 10 basis points over London interbank offered rate (Libor). Since then, the cost of borrowing has risen. The new credit facility has a margin over Libor of 62.5 basis points on the first third of the loan, rising to a maximum of 87.5 basis points over Libor. Bank commitment fees on the new loan range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points. The syndicated facility is being arranged by Barclays Syndications, Lloyds Bank Capital Markets Group, Midland Bank and NatWest Capital Markets. Lex, Page 22</p>

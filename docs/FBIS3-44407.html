In his report, Comrade Guan Guangfu first reviewed the  province's work over the past five years since the conclusion of  the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress. He stated: Over the  past five years, the broad masses of cadres and people across  the province have comprehensively implemented the party's basic  line, acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, further emancipated the mind, made constant  efforts to explore in light of actual provincial conditions new  ways and means of deepening reform, expediting growth, and  fulfilling such a strategic goal as making Hubei rise in central  China, persistently deepened various reforms, further expanded  opening up to the outside world, gradually quickened the pace of  economic construction, and correspondingly improved people's  livelihood.    Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Over the past five years, party  committees at all levels across the province have continually  grasped two work aspects at the same time by taking account of  the overall provincial situation as well as united and guided  the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in  unremittingly forging ahead and constantly opening up new  vistas. In the last five years, Hubei's average annual  industrial output value and agricultural output value have  maintained a 10.2 percent increase and a 4.7 percent increase  respectively. As a result, we have basically attained each and  every goal laid down by the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress  and laid a solid foundation for speedier economic development in  the future.    It should be especially noted that since Comrade Deng  Xiaoping gave a series of important talks during his south China  tour and since the 14th CPC National Congress, Hubei has  witnessed an unprecedentedly gratifying situation in reform and  development. In 1992 Hubei's total gross national product  recorded a 12.1 percent increase. That year also saw an  accelerating economic growth across the province with per unit  area yield of grain, cotton, and oil crops each hitting an  all-time high and the province's total cotton output setting a  new record. In 1992, Hubei's industrial production also  registered faster growth coupled with increased economic  efficiency.    Comrade Guan Guangfu went on: It is estimated that by the  end of 1993, Hubei's gross national product, total agricultural  output value, and total industrial output value will have  registered a 12.5 percent increase, a 5.5 percent increase, and  a 17 percent increase respectively. Hubei is also expected to  have raised economic efficiency by a large margin, raised  financial revenue by 10.25 percent, accelerated key projects  construction, increased fixed assets investment by 5.4 percent,  and opened up new vistas for a fledgling export-oriented  economy. Hubei will have raised export trade volume by 16  percent, made use of a total of $630 million of foreign funds,  approved a new batch of over 2,200 foreign-funded enterprises,  pushed ahead with township and town enterprises development at  an extraordinary pace, and considerably raised the proportion of  secondary and tertiary industries in comparison with the  proportion of primary industry in the vast rural areas, thereby  bringing about a historical takeoff.    Comrade Guan Guangfu maintained: I'm convinced that Hubei  will have attained each and every goal laid down by the Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee at the start of 1993, including: To  raise gross national product to over 100 billion yuan, to raise  total industrial and agricultural output value to over 200  billion yuan, to raise financial revenue to over 10 billion  yuan, and to increase income of urban and rural residents by a  large margin. I'm also convinced that Hubei will have  accelerated scientific, educational, cultural, public health,  and other social undertaking developments by the end of this  year, thereby pushing ahead with both spiritual civilization and  material civilization building.    Guan Guangfu concluded: By conscientiously and meticulously  handling various social contradictions, we have successfully  maintained political and social stability here in Hubei and  continually stepped up party building amid the tide of reform  and construction.</p>

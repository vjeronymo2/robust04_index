			<p>BFN     [Text] Registration of voters for the upcoming October  general and multiparty elections began in Mozambique today.  President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano registered as a  voter this morning at the station operating in the Josina Machel  High School near the Ponta Vermelha palace, the official  residence of the Mozambican head of state. Afterwards, Chissano  gave an interview to journalists covering the event. The  journalists wanted to know what assistance the president of the  republic would give to resolve the transportation problem  hindering the electoral process.    [Begin recording] [Chissano] We are aware of the shortage of  transportation, even for state and government activities. There  are even government administrators and heads of administrative  regions who walk. We would like every vehicle to be used fully  so that government departments and the National Elections  Commission [CNE] may successfully accomplish their missions.    [Unidentified correspondent] Transportation difficulties  have  to a certain extent affected the integration of Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance] areas, even [words indistinct]  Renamo says its advisers lack the facilities to ensure the full  integration of its areas into state administration. The  registration of voters is under way, but reports from the  provinces say it has been difficult to reach Renamo areas. So,  one could say the government and Renamo bear a degree of  responsibility, in that the former has not created facilities  for Renamo advisers and the latter is preventing people from  entering its areas. Would you like to comment?    [Chissano] The question of transportation for Renamo  advisers  is a false one. I have just said there are administrators who  have no transportation whatsoever. Yet, they continue to carry  out their activities. As for the advisers, they are not  advising Renamo, but the governors. They have been named by  Renamo to be appointed by the government as advisers to  governors. They work under the same conditions as other  officials serving provincial governors. So, that is a false  problem because no one ever said vehicles would be allocated to  every official. What was said was that an adviser was entitled  to transportation. That means the use of public transportation,  if available, or facilities that have fortunately been provided  by communities so that our officials may operate. So, that is a  false excuse.    [Correspondent] How do you view the difficulties Renamo has  created [words indistinct] it seems that in most provinces the  (?CNE) teams have been (?prevented) from operating?    [Chissano] Really, I think Renamo has some difficulties. It  had problems in filling certain teams of district electoral  commissions. They have been recruiting personnel in districts  and areas. We know of people who used to work for us, but who  have been recruited by Renamo. So, Renamo is recruiting people.    I would like to say that the integration of areas has  already  begun. I announced it at the opening of the meeting of Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] cadres yesterday. The minister of  state administration today met with the Reintegration  Commission. Areas have been identified. We have appealed to  Renamo to name those who will be appointed to state agencies at  location, district, and administrative region levels. This is  something that is in progress. So, I think every difficulty  will be overcome. I believe Renamo is facing real difficulties.  [end recording]</p>

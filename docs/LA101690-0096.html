			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TWELFTH NIGHT' IN LA JOLLA . . . AS YOU MIGHT LIKE IT  </P> <P> No one will accuse Des McAnuff of wanting for imagination.  </P> <P> Following his witty staging of "A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum"  this summer, he has now delivered a Shakespearean semi-equivalent to cap the  season at the La Jolla Playhouse. It is "Twelfth Night," that comedy of  star-crossed twins and star-crossed lovers, that opened Sunday as an outrageous  hodge-podge of periods, plunkings, pictures and pranks.  </P> <P> The jokes are on every level. The lyricism . . . that's another matter. How  well this "Twelfth Night" agrees with you will depend on the size of your  appetite for the eclectic.  </P> <P> It is, however, impossible not to admire it -- if not for the individual  performances, which can be disappointing, then for the improbable coherence of  its visual and aural incongruities: the massive Venetian Palazzo beauty of  designer Neil Patel's faux-marble walls, archways and floors, and the  shimmering Adriatic projected beyond them; the ruthless scrambling of periods  in Christina Haatainen's costume design, ranging from Elizabethan to Victorian  to modern, with Sir Toby Belch (Clarence Felder) looking like the March Hare  and Sir Andrew Aguecheek (William Youmans) like a refugee from Le Cirque du  Soleil.  </P> <P> Even wilder and more distinctive is the tangy electronic sound of the music for  the Shakespearean songs that McAnuff co-composed with Michael Roth (who  performs them with relish).  </P> <P> If this lunacy had to breakdown somewhere, it does so in the less persuasive  cross-gendering of Curio (Tracey Leigh) and Valentine (Kari McGee), attendants  to the lovesick Duke Orsino (James Morrison), who come off as wimpy henchmen.  Casting women in those male roles fools no one, certainly, but it does support  the plausibility of the acceptance of Viola as Cesario (played with inviting  self-assurance by a gamin Molly Hagan).  </P> <P> Plausibility, however, is not what "Twelfth Night" is about, especially not  this one.  </P> <P> What's plausible in a story of twins separated by shipwreck, in which the girl  for no terrific reason decides to dress up as a boy and seek employment with a  Duke? What's plausible about a Duke who sends him/her to press his suit with  the woman he loves, the lady Olivia (Lisa Pelikan) instead of doing it himself?  And what's plausible about that woman promptly falling in love with the  androgynous messenger?  </P> <P> As for subplot, it is the implausible buffoonery of the triumph of the servant  Maria (Katherine Hiler), the rake Sir Toby and the wimp Sir Andrew over the  puritanical Malvolio (Mark Bramhall).  </P> <P> Scratch plausible. If anything is supported in this production it is the  totality of the director's deconstructionist habits and his compleat creative  control. Make that grip. The zaniness of that vision may not be for all  markets, but a "Twelfth Night" set, at various times in a steam room, on a  tennis court, in a Williams-Sonoma kitchen with suspended refrigerator, and  where Sir Toby and his crew order pizza, can't be all bad.  </P> <P> It's not. Its weakest elements are the actors, particularly Morrison and  Pelikan who look every inch their regal parts but speak the speech less than  trippingly on the tongue. Excepted from this criticism are Hagan, Bramhall's  Malvolio (who can be colorless, but is always clear), Daniel Jenkins' strumming  troubadour of a Feste, Zaraawar Mistry's Antonio and Evan MacKenzie's  Sebastian.  </P> <P> The triumvirate of real fools -- Felder's Toby, Youmans' Aguecheek and Hiler's  lisping Maria -- are lucidly vociferous and funny (though we could do without  Aguecheek throwing up, thank you), but more as the instruments of McAnuff's  comedic imagination than on their own initiative.  </P> <P> The production is quintessentially a director's confection -- distinguished  more for the way McAnuff has manipulated his strings than the individual  contributions of his players. The advantage is a conceptual unity that would  not have seemed possible given the disparate mix of ingredients.  </P> <P> Since there is no accounting for taste, it's take it or leave it.  </P> <P> Personally, I'll take it -- including a final, sobering image that tacitly  presages a changing of the guard and the discomforting arrival of more chilling  and repressive times. One may, without any great leap of faith, draw the  appropriate contemporary parallels.  </P> <P> At the Mandell Weiss Theatre, La Jolla Village Drive and Torrey Pines Road,  Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2.

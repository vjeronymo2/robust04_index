			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL STUDIES ALLOWING ALCOHOL AT CITY FACILITIES  </P> <P> A decision on whether to allow alcoholic beverages to be served at city  facilities was postponed Tuesday night by the Hawaiian Gardens City Council.  </P> <P> A resolution before the council would, if adopted, allow groups renting the  Robert E. Lee and Lee Ware activity centers to serve alcohol as long as the  renters pay for security officers and provide a $300,000 liability insurance  bond.  </P> <P> However, the council has not yet decided whether security would be provided by  the Sheriff's Department or a private security company, said Lt. Henry  Villanueva, sheriff's liaison officer for Hawaiian Gardens.  </P> <P> "The officers used would not be our local officers," Villanueva said. "We don't  pull a patrolman off the street for a special event."  </P> <P> "There won't be any problems if there are the proper safeguards," said Leonard  Chaidez, director of recreation. "I'd like to check out other cities that allow  alcohol in their facilities: Do they have any problems?"  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to vote on the resolution at its Oct. 9 meeting.  </P></p>

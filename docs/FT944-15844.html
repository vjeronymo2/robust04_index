			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Ceasefire in verbal war - Kuwait For the past 10 days, a ceasefire has broken out in the traditional rivalry between Kuwait's three main Arabic dailies. The reason: for the second time in four years, Iraq seemed to be threatening Kuwait's very existence. The satirical wit of Kuwait's celebrated cartoonists was aimed at Saddam Hussein rather than members of the government or rival factions of the opposition; and the subtle barbs of laborious editorials, composed by editors-in-chief who are often newspaper owners, were kept for those who seemed to be slow in showing support for Kuwait. All the dailies have run extra pages devoted to the crisis; the English-language daily Arab Times broke all tradition by publishing on the Friday weekend; while the owner of Al Qabas, which many regard as the leading daily in both circulation and quality, outdid himself in devotion to the cause, by voluntarily giving up the Crime Watch column. This is an episodic discussion among Kuwaitis about the rising crime rate; hardly a suitable talking point when attention needed to be focused on the chief enemy in Baghdad. However, Arabic newspaper editorials and opinion columns kept their place on page one; a reminder that in Kuwait, as in many other Arab countries, those in authority imagine their views on current affairs to be more important for the reader than straight news. Extraordinarily, in a country of just over 1m Arabic-speakers, Kuwait has five daily Arabic papers, plus two Arabic weeklies and two English-language dailies for the small minority of non-Arabic-speaking expatriates who would want to read an English paper.</p>

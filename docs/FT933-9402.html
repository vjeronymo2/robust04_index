			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Deutsche Bank four-year deal dominates quiet day DEUTSCHE Bank provided the main focus of activity in a quiet start to the week for the international bond market, borrowing DM1bn through an offering of four-year Eurobonds. In contrast to last week, when Denmark raised a record Pounds 1.3bn in the sterling Eurobond market, syndicate managers said they expected the market to remain uneventful for the rest of the week as investors and borrowers take their summer holidays. Deutsche Bank's bonds were priced to yield 11 basis points above the series 101 of medium-term German government bonds and traded inside fees shortly after the launch, the bank said. Demand came from investors in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux. Meanwhile, the World Bank has made progress on the legal framework for its first D-Mark global bond and expects to raise around DM3bn through the offering later this year, market conditions permitting. The Bank also plans to issue another dollar global bond at around the same time. Mr Hans Rothenbuhler, head of the Bank's European currency borrowing division, said the launch of the D-Mark global bond had been delayed by legal issues arising from the unprecedented attempt to link the German and US domestic clearing systems. 'We should have everything in place in the autumn,' he said. He added that the lead managers for the D-Mark deal - most likely to be one German and one non-German bank - would be announced in the coming weeks. The maturity of the bonds would be decided closer to the launch.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMS GETS SAVE; FULLERTON WINS IN OVERTIME, 90-84  </P> <P> Time was running out on Cal State Fullerton Thursday night for what seemed like  the umpteenth time in Wayne Williams' career.  </P> <P> With his team trailing San Jose State by two points with less than 10 seconds  left, Williams had the ball near the top of the key.  </P> <P> Five times in his two-year career, Williams has hit desperation three-pointers,  twice winning games with them. But this time, Williams drove for a scooping  layup with two seconds left, forcing an overtime period that ended in a 90-84  Fullerton victory in front of 2,201 in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> "It was a prayer," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "But his prayers have been  answered so many times."  </P> <P> In overtime, Fullerton (11-8, 5-5 in the Big West) took the lead and held it,  and Williams hit four consecutive free throws in the final 28 seconds to clinch  the victory.  </P> <P> As regulation time ran down, there were those in the crowd who thought Williams  might try a three-pointer.  </P> <P> "I didn't want him to get into that buzzer-beater thing," Sneed said.  </P> <P> Williams said it crossed his mind.  </P> <P> "Just for a second I started to take a long shot, but when I saw how much time  was left I thought I could get a little closer. . . . Really I was trying to  draw the foul, but I got the bucket."  </P> <P> Williams' latest last-second heroics took a bit of the spotlight away from  Cedric Ceballos, who for the second game in a row played every minute of an  overtime game, finishing with 31 points and 16 rebounds, eight offensive.  </P> <P> Ceballos played one of the finest games of his career Monday night against UC  Santa Barbara, scoring 33 points in a game Fullerton lost in overtime after  holding an 11-point lead with 2:20 left.  </P> <P> "I'm playing great," Ceballos said. "Things are just flowing. It's that time of  year to get a run going. This is the homestretch. I'm just putting my head  down."  </P> <P> Andre Brooks scored 27 points for San Jose, including five three-pointers, and  Troy Batiste added 21 points. San Jose is 5-14, 2-8.  </P></p>

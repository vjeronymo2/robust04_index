			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH AIRWAYS SELECTED TO FLY SOVIET FESTIVAL PERFORMERS, ART  </P> <P> Officials of the San Diego Arts Festival have contracted with a commercial air  carrier to transport Soviet participants here at a "substantial discount air  fare," festival officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> British Airways was chosen over half a dozen other international air carriers  because it offered savings "in excess of $175,000" and because of its daily  London-to-San Diego service, festival executive director Bruce Herring said.  Total round-trip fares from Moscow to San Diego with an overnight stop in  London will run about $265,000 for the $6.25-million festival.  </P> <P> "It saves us money to get (the performers) here as close as possible to the day  they perform," Herring said, "and British Airways has everyday service."  </P> <P> Airlines submitting proposals included Pan Am, TWA, SAS, American and FinnAir,  "and British Airways had the best proposal," Herring said.  </P> <P> Besides providing "special VIP protocol service," including Soviet  interpreters, the airline will fly religious art objects and one dozen Imperial  Faberge eggs from Moscow, London, Paris and Zurich, Herring said.  </P> <P> The eggs, which will be displayed at the San Diego Museum of Art, will be  ferried in specially constructed cases. They will be insured while traveling  with "nail to nail" coverage, that is, from the time the containers are closed  to the moment they are opened, Herring said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 250 Performers to Be Flown  </P> <P> More than 250 Soviet musicians, performers, artists and government officials  involved in the "Treasures of the Soviet Union" festival Oct. 21-Nov. 11 will  be flown to San Diego.  </P> <P> The event, which will include performances of an opera, two Russian plays and  numerous folk arts and crafts exhibits and performances, is expected to attract  large crowds of visitors to San Diego.  </P> <P> Though tickets are available for the San Diego Opera's production of "Boris  Godunov," tickets for most events do not go on sale until mid-July, Herring  said.  </P> <P> "We haven't placed ads yet," he said. "That'll be in conjunction with the  ticket sales."  </P></p>

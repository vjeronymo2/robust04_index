			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Large increase at Continental CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company which has spent much of the past two years fending off the approaches of Pirelli of Italy, yesterday reported a sharp jump in first-half profits but said its results were still unsatisfactory and held back by low prices. The company said pre-tax profit totalled DM119m (Dollars 85m) in the first six months against DM31.5m in the same period of 1991, a rise of 277 per cent. It said all activities turned in improved results. In the first half of 1990, Continental had profits of DM100m. Its Continental, Uniroyal and Semperit tyre brands in Europe experienced a marked rise in profits, mainly as a result of replacement business. ContiTech, the non-tyre products subsidiary, was able to raise profits. The group said business with car companies still suffered from heavy pressure on prices, further burdening a result which was unsatisfactory. Tyre and components companies have long complained that car manufacturers have squeezed prices for equipment on new vehicles. Some tyre concerns have also gone in for price cutting to raise market share. Turnover in the period was 8 per cent higher at DM4.9bn. Tyre sales in Europe were 12 per cent higher at DM2.5bn, partly because of the inclusion of Nivis of Sweden for the first time. ContiTech's turnover was 4.5 per cent higher at DM1.2bn. General Tire, at which the group took a heavy loss last year on the closure of a Canadian plant, achieved an unchanged turnover in dollars but this emerged as a 1.2 per cent decline to DM1.05bn in German currency terms.</p>

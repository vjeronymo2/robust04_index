			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Prize bed of nails - Off the Wall There can be little doubt where the real artistic avant-garde was on Tuesday night. Inside the Tate Gallery the well heeled, black tied, glitterati were clapping to the echoes the news that Rachel Whiteread had won the Turner Prize, and Pounds 20,000, for her plaster cast of a room. Outside, the K Foundation, which has devoted around Pounds 200,000 to exposing the hollowness of the Turner, had nailed Pounds 40,000 in notes to a picture frame tied to the railings of the Gallery, and was taunting Whiteread to come and collect her prize for being voted the worst artist among the Turner short list of four - or see the money consumed by flames. Slightly behind deadline Whiteread emerged, promising she would give the cash to deserving artists. In terms of mind expanding innovation, and the creation of a challenging example of conceptualism, the K Foundation won hands down. It had staged an event, performance art of the highest order. Nailing notes to an empty frame was a most expressive mockery of the events inside the Tate. Once again the Turner has exposed the elistist sectarianism of contemporary art. The Prize is controlled by the Patrons of New Art, a small clique of dealers and collectors who invariably select artists that they either trade in or buy. It made a change that the winner was not a sculptor handled by the Lisson Gallery. Instead it was an artist who works abroad and has pursued one idea - making casts of everyday objects of a size that can only fit into museums. The jury made fools of itself in suggesting that Whiteread's work, 'by exploring such themes as memory, death, community, isolation and homelessness, stimulates public awareness of these significant issues.' The local council at Bow, which had Whiteread's latest commission, the cast of a house, thrust upon it, showed its stimulation by also voting on Tuesday night - to knock the house down this week end. No one can doubt where the true pioneers of 20th century art - the Dadaists, the Surrealists, the conceptualists, would be on this issue - outside in the cold, garlanding with notes the empty frame. Less exalted collectors of contemporary art are well served this week end at London's Cork Street. For the second year running this bazaar devoted to 20th century art is open all of Saturday and Sunday. The first event was a great success, with galleries like William Jackson attracting 2,000 visitors, equal to about three months usual throughput. All the galleries, including the mighty Waddington, are concentrating on 'affordable art'. Dealers have finally accepted that to beat the recession they must grow a new generation of collectors, whose cheque books start at Pounds 1,000 or so, or even less. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, used this week's annual Prudential Awards to mix soft soap and tough talk as he rallied the massed ranks of the arts infantry to go over the top against cuts in subsidy in next Tuesday's Budget. He praised to the skies the Heritage Minister Peter Brooke (to hollow laughter) while stridently making the economic and spiritual case for the arts. He even managed a threat. Prudential had told him that its continued support for the arts depended on the government maintaining its contribution: business was not going to make good any shortfall in state funding. In fact the Pru thinks that sponsoring the arts makes good commercial sense. It invests Pounds 800,000 a year in its awards and although most of the money goes on advertising and promotion it still hands over cheques worth Pounds 265,000, generally to experimental arts ventures, who must spend the money on creating new works. The winner of the Pounds 75,000 big one this year was the Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. It had already received Pounds 25,000 as the winner of the dance category. The Pru is raising the stakes next year, adding a film and television category to dance, music, theatre, opera and the visual arts. Shobana Jeyasingh was a popular winner but it is slightly odd that in its five years of existence the Pru's top prize has three times gone to modern dance - Rambert and Dance Umbrella were previous winners. This would be fine if modern dance was enjoying a popular renaissance but in fact audiences have been falling and some leading practitioners, like London Contemporary Dance, are in crisis. Perhaps the obviousness of modern dance gives it an edge over other art forms in the eyes of the final judging panel.</p>

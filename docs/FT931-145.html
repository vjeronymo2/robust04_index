			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Thames TV to make write-downs THAMES Television, the independent production company, is expected to announce tomorrow that it is making significant write-downs on the value of Reeves Entertainment, its loss-making US subsidiary, and UK property. The write-downs in a profitable trading year for Thames will clear the way for a possible bid for the company from Pearson, the publishing, investment banking and oil services group which owns the Financial Times. Shares in Thames were suspended yesterday at the company's request, partly because of an FT report on talks about a possible acquisition of Thames by Pearson, but also because of the provisions which are expected to hit the Thames share price. Thames paid around Pounds 57m for Reeves but the company has never performed as well as expected. The property write-downs follow the loss of the Thames ITV franchise and the fact that its Euston Road headquarters in London are now surplus to requirements. Before yesterday's suspension, Thames shares had risen to 221p, up from 189p at Monday's close. The suspension price values Thames at Pounds 109.6m, a rise of 17 per cent since Monday's close. Pearson shares closed yesterday at 410p, up 6p. Thames announced that the shares had been suspended 'pending a further announcement concerning this morning's press report of talks between Thorn EMI and Pearson and other matters affecting Thames Television's financial results for the year ended December 31 1992'. Thorn EMI owns 58.9 per cent of Thames. In 1990, when Thames still held the ITV weekday franchise for the London region, Thorn EMI and BET, which between them held 56 per cent of Thames, put the combined stake for sale. There were no takers, because of uncertainty over the outcome of the imminent franchise auction. The two companies withdrew the shares from sale, and Thorn EMI bought out BET in 1991. Thames lost its franchise in the auction. Since then, it has become an independent production house, selling its programmes to the ITV network and other broadcasters. Pearson says it is keen to expand in media businesses, including television. It already owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire Television and 17.5 per cent of BSkyB. Pearson started talking to Thames last year about the television company's plan to bid for a new Channel 5 franchise.</p>

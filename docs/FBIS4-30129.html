			<p>BFN     [Text] As 1995, which marks the 50th anniversary of the end  of World War II, approaches, the recent visit of the [Okinawa  Prefecture] governor to the United States to appeal for  "tangible solutions to bases issues" emphasized petitioning the  U.S. Congress, particularly the Armed Services Committee. This  was the first time that Okinawa has been able to speak about the  actual situation on the island directly to the influential  chairman of this committee, who was instrumental in passing in  the House of Representatives the bill on reviewing national  defense in FY 1995, which partly aims at consolidating U.S.  military bases on Okinawa. While it is still unknown whether  any concrete action will be taken in the House, the "key  mission" of this visit can be said to have been accomplished.    The United States, which used to maintain that "pending  issues relating to Okinawa are Japanese domestic problems," now  says that "there is a need for the Japanese and U.S. Governments  to discuss these problems." There has indeed been some progress  in its attitude. Thomas Bird [name as transliterated], acting  assistant secretary of state, referred to working-level efforts,  saying "we will work for solutions to the problems at the  Japanese-U.S. joint committee." Marine Corps Commandant Carl  Mundy also said, "Action by both governments is important."    The security conference held in Tokyo in March confirmed  efforts toward the retrenchment, consolidation, and  reorganization of U.S. military bases on Okinawa. Remarks made  by U.S. Government officials during the governor's visit to the  United States were based on such an agreement.    However, the United States would actually like to maintain  its military bases. According to Representative Patricia  Schroeder, with whom the governor held a discussion, when she  submitted a bill last year asking that the "reorganization of  military bases taking place in the United States be extended to  overseas bases," the Department of Defense strongly opposed the  bill, saying "U.S. military bases on Okinawa are of special  strategic importance." This was an indication that basically,  the U.S. Government has a strong desire to keep [its bases on]  Okinawa.</p>

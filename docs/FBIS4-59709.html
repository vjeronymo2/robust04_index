			<p>BFN     [Text] MK [Knesset Member] Binyamin Begin of the Likud  says he would initiate a debate in the Knesset this week about  Warren Christopher's visit to the region. He said that in spite  of the repeated capitulations and compromises of the Rabin  government towards Damascus, the negotiations were deadlocked  because al-Asad insisted on getting back all of the Golan  Heights.</p>

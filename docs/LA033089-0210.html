			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PERFORMING ARTS EXPANSION URGED  </P> <P> A new survey for the Orange County Performing Arts Center recommends that board  members consider building up to three new theaters, ranging from a drama  theater for 650 or more to a concert hall with up to 2,500 seats.  </P> <P> The study, prepared by Harrison Price Co. of Torrance and released this  morning, found that the center's 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall is operating at or  near capacity.  </P> <P> "The best way to relieve pressure on Segerstrom (Hall) is to construct a  concert hall" at a cost of about $70 million, the study says, although "a  lesser-quality concert hall . . . could be built for as low as $40-45 million."  </P> <P> A drawback to the proposal, the study says, is that land next to the center is  too small to accommodate such a hall, requiring construction at a different  site.  </P></p>

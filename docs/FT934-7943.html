			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Greece revives project to build alumina plant GREECE'S new Socialist government is reviving a much-delayed project to build a Dollars 500m alumina plant in central Greece, using Russian technology and equipment. The plant at Thisbe, 120km from Athens, would produce 600,000 tonnes of alumina a year from locally-mined bauxite to supply aluminium plants in Russia. The industry ministry wants private investors to take a 10 per cent stake in the project. A group of state-owned Russian companies, including several aluminium smelters, would have a 51 per cent stake, with the remainder held by a Greek state company. The ministry said it was reappointing as its advisers Salomon Brothers of the US, which worked on the project under the previous conservative government. The project was halted two years ago because of financing problems. Construction of a port for the plant on the Gulf of Corinth near the site was completed but work on the processing facility failed to start because of financing problems.</p>

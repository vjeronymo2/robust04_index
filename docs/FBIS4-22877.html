			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. S. Golubenko, G. M. Galimov, V. T, </F> Perekhrest, A. P. Lozovskiy, A. V. Trubin, T. V. Andreyeva, V.  Ya. Krivokorytov, A. V. Shipilevskiy, Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]    [Abstract] The Yuzhnoye design bureau has designed a number  of windmills for energy production using CAD packages. The YeSKD  package creates drawings and transmits information to other  programs. It is based on AUTOCAD 10.0 and has a program package  written in AUTOLISP. The ASSISTENT system automates the  production of design documentation. SKHEMA designs circuitry and  conduit for electrical, pneumatic, pneumatic-hydraulic,  kinematic, and other types of systems. SPETSIFIK formulates  specifications and uses guidebooks to standardize parts,  materials and nomenclature. These program packages are  general-purpose systems for machine building. Yuzhnoye developed  a program to determine the aerodynamic properties of windwheels  with a horizontal axis of rotation. The program is written in  FORTRAN. The automated control system of one windwheel is  described The problems of designing these systems are discussed.  A proposal to construct a system to automatically regulate the  angular velocity of a windwheel is discussed. Figures 2.  &lt;graphic&gt;     &lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Flow chart of program  to determine the aerodynamic properties (ADP) of a windwheel  (WW) with a PC.  &lt;annot&gt; Key (top to bottom): Flow chart of main  program; input of initial data of design variants; input of  parameters of graphic device; input of geometric parameters of  support cross sections; input of ADP of WW profiles;  determination of geometric parameters of calculated cross  sections using linear interpolation between support cross  sections; beginning of variants loop; calculation of blade cross  sections using iterations method in the theory of elementary  flows; do the iterations converge? (yes to side, no below);  calculation of cross sections in turbulent flow mode;  calculation of integrated ADP of WW; end of variants loop (no to  side, yes below); output of results; end of program.&lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;graphic&gt;    &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Flow chart of program  to calculate optimal windwheel parameters.  &lt;annot&gt; Key (top to  bottom): initial data: calculation of power, initial and  calculated wind speed, number of blades, profile design limits;  calculation of geometric parameters of blades; program to  calculate ADP of WW; input of additional initial data: diamater  of WW, number of revolutions of WW, etc.; preparation of graphic  device; calculation of equations P = f(V) for various WW  revolution numbers where P is WW power, V is wind speed;  calculation of output of electric energy for a given region;  selection of optimal WW parameters.&lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

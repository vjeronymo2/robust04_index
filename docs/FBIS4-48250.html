			<p>BFN     [Text] The security situation in Liberia seems to be going  from bad to worse. The two splinter groups in the ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction have  failed to resolve their leadership dispute. The Liberia Peace  Council has been on the offensive against Charles Taylor's NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeast. And now  the commander of the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, has come out  with a strong complaint about how Taylor's forces have been  behaving at the Firestone rubber plantation some 30 miles from  the capital. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this  report:    General Hezekiah Bowen today threatened to turn Liberia into  another Kigali if heavily armed NPFL fighters do not vacate  Harbel and stop their attacks on AFL soldiers patrolling the  area. Bowen told newsmen at his headquarters in Monrovia that  fighters of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front, currently  occupying certain strategic areas in and around Harbel, are  constantly disarming AFL soldiers on assignment there. Bowen  said the latest incidents of the NPFL troops moving into Harbel  occurred last Friday [13 May] when an AFL sergeant was disarmed  by 10 child soldiers from the NPFL. The child soldiers then  seized their Firestone rubber plantation's company vehicle.  Gen. Bowen said that some of the Firestone employees were  undressed and kicked and had their personal effects taken away  leaving them only in their underpants.    According to Bowen, NPFL fighters told the Firestone workers  that the company can only operate with the approval of Charles  Taylor. If this situation is not properly addressed by ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group], said Bowen, the world should not be surprise to see the  AFL bitterly engaging the NPFL in a battle that could turn  Liberia into another Kigali. He claimed that the influx of NPFL  troops in Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious risk  to the AFL barracks at Schieffelin, as well as to Monrovia, and  if they are not cleared from the area we, said Bowen, will go to  war soon.    Meanwhile, NPFL leader Charles Taylor said on Saturday [14  May] that he would no longer carry on disarming and handing in  weapons to ECOMOG. They, he said, are not neutral. A Gbarnga  Radio broadcast monitored here said that Taylor had accused  Nigerian elements among the peacekeepers of gun running between  the two ULIMO factions and the Liberian Peace Council which is  battling with the NPFL for control of southeatern Liberia.</p>

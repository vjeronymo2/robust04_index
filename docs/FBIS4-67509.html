			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pimonov, department prosecutor in the </F> Volga Interoblast Nature Conservation Prosecutor's Office:  ``Who Will Be Frightened of a Fine?'']    [Text] Checks by nature conservation prosecutor's offices  in the Volga basin have shown that the Statutes on Water  Conservation Areas of Rivers, Lakes, and Reservoirs in Russia  are being breached all over the place. Take the Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast Soviet, for example, Back in 1989 it approved a  list of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in which conservation  areas were to be set up before the year 2000. The planning was  supposed to be completed this year. But none of the work is  being monitored, so one cannot expect any early results.    The riverbank situation in the Volga basin is no less  lamentable. There are piles of scrap metal, domestic garbage,  and dung. At the moment there are around 3,000 livestock units  in the vicinity of the Volga basin rivers discharging effluent  and waste directly into rivers because they have no treatment  plants.    But the saddest thing of all is to see the small amounts of  money allocated by the state for ecological purposes being  squandered and plundered. For instance, in Aktanyshskiy Rayon,  Republic of Tatarstan, as a result of the erosion of the banks  of a stream called the Syun, three livestock burial grounds are  in danger of being exposed, and one of them is infected with  anthrax. The money that was intended for riverbank reinforcement  work and for the removal of the livestock burial grounds to  sites outside the conservation area has been used by the rayon  administration for other purposes.    What can change the situation, I believe, is the elaboration  of new statutes on water conservation areas</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MANILA TO SELL PART OF MARCOS ART COLLECTION  </P> <P> The Philippines plans to sell part of the art collection of the late dictator  Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, in auctions in New York early next  year, an official said today.  </P> <P> Mateo Caparas, chairman of a presidential commission tracking down the  allegedly ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses, said the collection included  Italian paintings and 18th- and 19th-Century English silverware.  </P> <P> Christie's International had been appointed as auctioneer.  </P> <P> The Presidential Commission on Good Government said in March that Manila hoped  to raise $20 million by selling paintings, jewels and antique furniture  collected by the Marcoses during their 20 years in power.  </P> <P> Stephen Lash, executive vice president of Christie's, said they are planning  two major auctions in New York, probably in January, for the artwork, which is  valued at $10 million.  </P> <P> He told reporters that one painting in the collection, attributed to Raphael,  could fetch up to $2 million.  </P> <P> Manila claims that the art collection was paid for with money plundered from  the Philippine treasury.  </P></p>

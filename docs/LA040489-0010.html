			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARK HARRISON; PARAPLEGIC ADVENTURER  </P> <P> Clark Harrison, 64, a paraplegic adventurer who nine months ago crashed his  single-engine airplane into the wilds of Greenland but survived with only a cut  on his face. Harrison, a pilot, author, politician, banker and real estate  broker, had been paralyzed from the chest down by a sniper's bullet in Germany  during World War II. He used a wheelchair to travel around showing young people  with spinal cord injuries what they can do with their lives. He served as a  director of Shepherd Spinal Center, an Atlanta rehabilitation hospital for  paralyzing spinal disorders, since its founding in 1975. Harrison got his  pilot's license at age 55 and, at 60, flew a hand-controlled single-engine  plane solo to Anchorage, Alaska, from his home base to raise money for  Shepherd. He was trying to raise money for the Shepherd Center for Independent  Living when he attempted his solo trans-Atlantic flight last July to Germany,  where he had hoped to visit the battlefield in Stolberg where he was wounded.  But his plane ran out of gas over Greenland. In Atlanta on Tuesday of the  complications of flu.  </P></p>

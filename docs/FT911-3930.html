			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (8): Windows to rooms - Graphical User Interfaces SYSTEMS for managing large amounts of information are becoming increasingly important to business computer-users. For example, the concept of overlapping 'windows' on computer screens has become popular since its introduction a decade ago. In the US, the Xerox research centre at Palo Alto unveiled graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 10 years ago to replace command-driven interfaces which tend to restrict the working area of computer screens with control codes. The easier-to-use window-driven GUIs enable various sources of information and tools to be worked on in separate windows for a single project. When numerous projects are under way, it can be difficult and time-consuming to shuffle round a clutter of overlapping windows. Now Xerox has developed the 'Rooms' concept which takes the graphical user interface into a wholly new dimension. The system puts all the windows that are relevant for a single task into a separate information workspace (or room), with linking electronic doors that allow users to work on many projects at the same time. The system also allows users to collaborate with different sets of people for each project. Xerox's graphical user interface has always been object-orientated - unlike many of today's icon-driven interfaces - and is based around a concept of an electronic desktop. The rooms concept is based on research by cognitive psychologists and computer scientists at the Xerox PARC research centre. 'The system is based on the idea that personal computers are fine in their place, but what many workers and planners need to get projects under way is a large table - a place to spread out files and papers for easy access,' explains Mr Chris Lindesay, integrated systems manager at Rank Xerox. The new system allows users to co-ordinate desktops: 'With rooms, all you do is walk into your specific project office and you find it just as you last left it, with all your information close at hand,' says Mr Lindesay The concept, which is now at the advanced development stage, allows users to create a suite of rooms which can passed around, copied to disk or loaded on to other workstations. To assist users, an overview room is provided where users can see the layout of rooms on a single screen. The system, which Xerox is demonstrating at this years Which Computer? Show, supports the natural way people work, 'rather than forcing them to change what they do to suit the limitations imposed by screen-sizes and windowing systems,' says Mr Lindesay.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Many shopworkers face freeze on pay THOUSANDS of shopworkers face pay freezes in 13 retail companies this year, while other retailers are offering rises above the rate of inflation, according to IDS, an independent pay analysis body. Non-food companies such as Allied Maples and Foster Menswear will freeze pay this year. Others, including Habitat, House of Fraser and Robert Dyas will review their freezes in six months. Some employers who announced freezes for most of their staff have increased the wages of the lowest paid because of the rise in statutory rates set by the retail wages councils. However, some companies are paying rises above inflation. WH Smith and the Retail Book Association negotiated a deal under which staff will get a 5 per cent rise from February this year with a further 3 per cent from August. Marks and Spencer is to pay staff a cash bonus worth Pounds 5 a week to a third of its shopworkers and is introducing performance pay as a reward for the company's strength in the recession. The move is surprising because in 1990 the company paid staff a flat-rate rise of Pounds 31.50 to last for three years and three months.

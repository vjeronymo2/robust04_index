			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CMW Pounds 471,000 in the red THE RECESSION finally caught up with CMW Group, the USM-quoted architect, in the second quarter of the present year resulting in an interim pre-tax loss. The company, however, is attracting new commissions and hopes to be in profit in the second half. Turnover for the six months to May 31 fell 19 per cent to Pounds 2.17m for a loss of Pounds 471,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 252,000. The loss was after exceptional redundancy charges of Pounds 111,000 and interest costs of Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 181,000). The interim dividend is passed - 0.9p was paid previously. Mr Peter Denner, chairman, said the company had managed to avoid the worst effects of recession over the past two years. He added, however, that it had taken its toll in the second quarter. Losses were 5.91p (earnings 5.35p). Lower extraordinary costs of Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 508,000) left retained losses of Pounds 370,000 (Pounds 358,000).</p>

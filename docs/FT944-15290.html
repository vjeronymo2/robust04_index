			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Dying romance of the open road: The UK government's disenchantment with the 'great car economy' Glorious, stirring sight] The poetry of motion] The real way to travel] The only way to travel] Here today - in next week tomorrow] Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped - always somebody else's horizon] O bliss] O poop-poop] O my] O my] Few have been so stirred by the romance of the open road as Mr Toad, the hero of Kenneth Grahame's classic, The Wind in the Willows, on his first sight of a motor car. But 90 years on from Mr Toad's fictional adventures, this Elysian view of the car has dimmed as growing numbers of motorists take to the road. Official forecasts suggest that the number of cars on Britain's roads could double by 2025. While the car remains a potent symbol of freedom, its economic and environmental costs are being weighed more carefully by the government. This represents a change for the Conservative government. In 1979, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then the newly-elected prime minister, urged that nothing should come in the way of 'the great car economy'. Last week, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new UK transport secretary, struck a different note in his address to the Tory party conference. He caught the headlines with a strong environmental attack on vehicle pollution, announcing tougher exhaust standards and roadside tests designed to take the worst polluting vehicles off the road. 'I aim to get rid of these belching monsters once and for all,' he told delegates. Signs that the environmental arguments are beginning to count for more in UK transport policy have become apparent since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 when the UK committed itself to producing a detailed environmental strategy. A recent environment department discussion paper, Improving Air Quality, identified the car as the number one source of pollution. 'In some areas of the UK, even where there is no significant industrial activity, high levels of air pollution can occur,' the discussion paper stated. 'In these areas, largely due to motor vehicle emissions, World Health Organisation guidelines (on pollution levels) are often exceeded.' The department concluded that the growing evidence of links between poor air quality and serious medical conditions such as asthma, the incidence of which is increasing particularly among children, demanded careful attention. Further support for the environmental arguments against the car is expected next week when the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution announces the findings of a study into the environmental impact of Britain's traffic. The 300-page report, the result of nearly two years' work by a 16-strong team of scientists and environmental experts, will make some 100 recommendations on how to deal with transport problems. There will be a strong emphasis in the report on tax measures to curb car use, with a doubling of the price of petrol over the next 10 years singled out as one desirable aim. The government is already committed to increasing fuel duty by at least 5 per cent a year and is expected to raise it by considerably more in the November Budget. The aim of the report, according to Sir John Houghton, commission chairman, 'is not to clobber the car but to give much more serious consideration to environmental factors'. Air pollution is not the only environmental influence at work on transport policy. The visual impact of roads in ancient towns and the countryside gobbled up by tarmac have prompted a rethink. Increasing environmental pressures were explicitly acknowledged last March when the government dropped or froze a third of the road schemes planned for the next 10 years after a review of the Pounds 23bn roads programme. And pressure to reduce the roads programme further is likely to grow when the government publishes a new study, by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, a government advisory body. This is believed to conclude - against the transport department's usual assumption - that new roads generate extra traffic and fuel congestion. The new environmental emphasis in transport policy reflects the broadening coalition against road-building. When the groups ranged against the government's roads programme comprised environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, they were dismissed as 'single issue' lobbyists. But increasingly, more establishment groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have raised their voice against an unbridled expansion of road transport. And Tory backbench MPs with constituencies threatened by new road-building have added their voices to the cause. As many as 35 Conservative MPs hold marginal seats that would be affected by proposed trunk road schemes, according to Friends of the Earth. Financial pressures, too, are coming to bear on the road programme as the government seeks cuts in expenditure to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement. One consequence of this tighter financial regime is a rethink of the way roads are financed. With the exception of a small number of bridges and tunnels which charge tolls, driving on Britain's roads has been free at the point of use. By introducing tolls on motorways, the government would raise funds to improve the network and make drivers reconsider the attractions of public transport. The government is assessing proposals for a system of electronic tolls and is also looking at 'congestion charging' - making motorists pay for driving in towns. But it will be some years before tolling can produce a new source of income for roads. Meanwhile the relatively poor state of the public transport network makes it harder to reduce dependence on the private car. Spending in the UK on rail is among the lowest in Europe, at Dollars 8 per head of population compared with Dollars 49 in France, according to a recent study by consultants Steer, Davies &amp; Gleave. The government hopes to attract private finance to back public transport projects, but so far with little success. Environmental groups remain suspicious of the government's intentions. 'We don't see any sense of urgency about questions such as traffic growth,' said Ms Lynn Sloman, assistant director of Transport 2000, which lobbies for public transport. As for Dr Mawhinney's stirring speech at last week's party conference, anti-road lobbyists point out that the roadside clampdown on polluters will last just two months and involves no new money. Dr Mawhinney says that there is no unanimity about what constitutes an environmental transport policy. For instance, many people in towns and villages bisected by a busy road want a bypass but this worries environmental campaigners concerned at the loss of open countryside. And forcing motorists to pay the full cost of transport pollution and accidents - estimated at between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a year - would severely damage the economy by putting up transport costs. It would also disadvantage country dwellers who are more likely to vote Conservative than those who live in cities. Dr Mawhinney says his role is to balance the conflicting voices. But it is clear that, for a mix of environmental and financial reasons, the balance of argument has swung decisively towards the environmental lobby.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Moussa Kraouche, spokesman of the Algerian </F> Fraternity in France, by Ivan Rioufol; place and date not given:  "Low Profile for Islamists in France" -- first paragraph is LE  FIGARO introduction]    [Text] Moussa Kraouche, aged 34, is the spokesman for the  Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF), an organization which has  close ties with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). He denies  that his organization is involved in any way, either directly or  indirectly, with the secret terrorist network attributed to the  FIS, which was recently broken up in Lille. Moussa Kraouche had  been called in for questioning and detained during the round-up  of Islamists last November. The police maintained that, in his  home, they had found documents originating, in particular, from  the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). However, as a result of the  dubious origin of one of these documents, it was impossible to  establish any links between the FAF and the GIA .    [Rioufol] Do you know the two suspected FIS sympathizers who  were arrested in Lille?    [Kraouche] No. However, it is too early to say whether or  not they are members of the FIS. I cannot help noticing that,  depending on what suits the media, either all Algerians belong  to the FIS or the FIS is portrayed as a minority group. There  is no evidence to support the allegation that these two persons  are even FIS sympathizers. If ever that proved to be the case,  then they would have to answer to the legal authorities for  their acts.    [Rioufol] The FIS is accused of running secret terrorist  networks in France.    [Kraouche] I officially refute such a claim, which was  merely  made to frighten public opinion! We condemn any illegal action  undertaken on French soil or elsewhere. The line followed by  the Algerian Fraternity in France is one that is governed by  legality.    [Rioufol] That may be, but the Algerian Fraternity in France  has very close links with the FIS.    [Kraouche] Admittedly, we do sympathize with the aims of the  FIS, which is an organization that is not officially recognized  in France.    [Rioufol] But the FIS has been directly implicated in  terrorist attacks committed in Algeria.    [Kraouche] You cannot describe them as terrorist actions!  Terrorism merely exists when perpetrated against a legitimate  state. In Algeria, it is popular resistance which is mounting  against an illegitimate, illegal military dictatorship. No  terrorist actions are being committed in Algeria.    [Rioufol] How can you say that? Only recently, two young  girls were killed because they were not wearing the Muslim veil.    [Kraouche] Two veiled young girls were also killed. In any  event, these acts have nothing to do with the Islamists. People  are not killed for not wearing a veil. Furthermore, the Koran  preaches: "No religious constraint." We are against the murder  of innocent people or foreigners in Algeria. Not everything can  be blamed on the FIS! It is provocation!    [Rioufol] Are you trying to tell us that these acts are  provocations perpetrated by the present government?    [Kraouche] Most certainly! The military security forces play  a very important role there. They have released 10,000  prisoners convicted under common law so that they can  incarcerate Islamists. The people they released are individuals  who are prepared to commit criminal acts. The violence in  Algeria is not the work of Islamists, but of the junta and those  who support it, like Said Sadi. That is a very serious matter.    [Rioufol] Do you support what is currently happening in  Algeria?    [Kraouche] Not everything, no. I support the legal struggle  by the Algerian people to regain their dignity and victory,  which was snatched away from them during the last general  election.    [Rioufol] Do you have links with the Armed Islamic Group?    [Kraouche] We have no links with the GIA, nor with any other  armed group. In France we are a legal association with the  specific mission to inform people about what is going on. Our  objective is to disclose the repression under which the Algerian  people is suffering.    [Rioufol] If the FIS comes to power in Algeria, do you think  there is reason to fear a clash within the Muslim community  living in France?    [Kraouche] The Muslim community in France wants a rapid  solution that would stop the bloodshed. If the FIS were to come  to power tomorrow, then we can assure you that everything will  proceed peacefully. There is no cause for concern. It is the  differences existing within Algerian society that lend it its  richness.    [Rioufol] Soothing words, but at the moment a very large  number of Algerian intellectuals are leaving their homeland  where they are being physically threatened.    [Kraouche] It is not soothing. In Algeria the military junta  has constantly repressed the people.</p>

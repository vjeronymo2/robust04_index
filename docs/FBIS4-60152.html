			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman of our country's Foreign Ministry  condemned the Zionist enemy's aggressionist and terrorist action  in kidnapping the leader of the Lebanese Believers' Resistance  Movement, calling it a violation of the independence and  territorial integrity of Lebanon.    He said: The reaction of America and other protectors of the  Zionist regime clearly shows the level of adherence of those  countries to international laws and the fight against state  terrorism.    He added: The kidnapping of Mr. Mustapha al-Dirani by the  Zionist regime's commandos and other terrorist actions of that  regime inside and outside occupied Palestine and within the  sovereign bounds of other countries demonstrate the true meaning  of the peace and coexistence between the Zionist regime and Arab  countries which America pursues.    He added: This is a warning to those who think by  surrendering to the wishes of the Zionist regime peace and  security would be maintained in the region.</p>

At 0930 local time, a ceremony to mark the start of  official broadcasting was held at the Anhui theater. The  inauguration ceremony was broadcast live by the radio station  using the medium- wave and FM frequencies, 864 KHz and 89.5 MHz,  respectively.    The Anhui Economic Radio Station started its trial operation  on 1 June 1993. Since then, adhering to the principles of  serving economic construction and enterprises in urban and rural  areas, and providing guidance for daily life, the station has  been broadcasting its programs using commercial advertisements  and other means such as direct advertising by the host and  direct participation by the audience, winning acclaim from  audiences in and outside the province.    Since it started official operation, the station has  adjusted  its programs to add new ones. Its daily broadcasting time will  be extended from 10 hours to 14 hours.</p>

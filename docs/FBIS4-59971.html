			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Damascus--Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has praised President Hafiz al-Asad's  patriotic and pan-Arab stands toward Arab causes, his defense of  Arab legitimate rights, and his adherence to the just and  comprehensive peace march. In a statement to SANA upon his  departure to Cairo today, accompanied by the Arab League  delegation, he said: I have had the honor to meet with President  Hafiz al-Asad during my visit to Damascus to attend the 26th  round of the Joint Arab Action Higher Coordination Committee. I  briefed the president on the positive results of the committee's  meetings in terms of strengthening cooperation and joint Arab  action.    'Abd-al-Majid said: It was a good opportunity to hear the  president's directives and opinions on the various Arab issues,  particularly the Yemeni situation. The meeting was also a good  opportunity to hear the president's views in this regard and to  express my appreciation for the president's intensive efforts  and endeavors in defending legitimate Arab rights and adhering  to the just and comprehensive peace march in accordance with  international legitimacy, the UN Security Council resolutions,  and the land-for- peace principle.    Alluding to the results of the Arab League's Higher  Coordination Committee meetings over which he presided,  'Abd-al-Majid said: They were fruitful. Recommendations and  resolutions were reached connected with all issues on the  agenda. The results were positive and effective in terms of  strengthening the march of joint Arab action in all domains at  the present stage. [passage omitted].</p>

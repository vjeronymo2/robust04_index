			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PEACE: CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY'  </P> <P> Your editorial of Dec. 14 remarked upon the results of a study indicating that  the Los Angeles area can survive economically even if military spending is cut  back significantly. That Los Angeles could prosper as something other than a  center of military production is no surprise to the members of Jobs With Peace  who, in 1984, won the ballot initiative that forced Los Angeles to authorize  the study. Long-term prosperity not only can be based on non-military commerce,  it must be.  </P> <P> Now that military spending and tax cuts for the wealthy have exhausted the  nation's financial resources, Los Angeles will be forced to build a peacetime  economic base. Perhaps the Proposition X study, opposed by The Times and many  others in the city's leadership, will provide guidance as to how this can be  done.  </P> <P> RICHARD DAWSON  </P> <P> Member, Jobs With Peace  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

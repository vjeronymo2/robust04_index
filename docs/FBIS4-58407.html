			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Jordan  was not boycotting Middle East multilateral peace [talks] but  rather lowering the level of participation in the talks. Dr.  Al-Majali said the decision will continue until the situation on  the ground changes with regards to Western interception of  al-'Aqabah-bound vessels.    The prime minister told The News at Ten that Jordan would  attend tomorrow's signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, adding  that the agreement was not coordinated with Jordan.    [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] We have told our foreign  minister [title as heard] and our ambassador in Egypt to attend  the meeting, which is going to take place tomorrow.    [Correspondent al-Sha'ir] Did the PLO coordinate with Jordan  with respect to the signing tomorrow?    [Al-Majali] Not really. We did not receive anything from  the PLO side, but we received from Egypt an invitation to  attend, and we hope that it will be a very successful one.    [Al-Sha'ir] Jordan is going to send an observer to Doha for  the multilateral talks. Does this mean that Jordan still is  going to avoid the peace process?    [Al-Majali] Don't use the word observer. He is not an  observer; he is a member of the delegation, but he is a single  person to attend, and he will be attending, and in fact he has  been there for a few days to talk even preliminarily before the  general meeting. But he is not going to participate in the same  way like in the old days because, still, we are not sure whether  the issue of al-'Aqabah has been settled completely. Still, I  think, it is in its final stages, so everything will be okay  after that.    [Al-Sha'ir] So, until a decision is taken, Jordan...    [Al-Majali, interrupting] We are just joining. We are  attending. We are not boycotting. We're just lowering the  level of the participation itself, which is because of the  economic reasons. Multilateral is for economic reasons. We  cannot be punished economically and in the same time attend  something in the economic side and in the regional side. [end  recording]    Dr. Al-Majali was speaking after a meeting with Egyptian  journalists visiting Amman to cover Thursday's meetings of the  Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee. The prime minister  expressed hope that the meeting will be a basic tool to  reestablish Arab solidarity and upgrade coordination between  Cairo and Amman. Dr. al-Majali called for a grace period in  discussing Arab differences, and allowing time to heal existing  rifts.    He told the Egyptian journalists that while Jordan  recognizes  the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian  people, it does not want any agreement by the PLO to have  negative consequences on Jordan.</p>

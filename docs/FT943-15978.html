			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gomez to be reconfirmed as Thomson president The French government yesterday in effect reconfirmed Mr Alain Gomez as president of Thomson, the electronics group, making him the longest-serving current head of a French state-owned company. However, Mr Gomez will have to accept Thomson-CSF's share in the operating losses and bad-debt provisions of Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank. Thomson-CSF, the group's defence electronics arm, has a 21 per cent stake in the bank. Mr Gomez is due to announce Thomson-CSF's 1993 results today. These have been delayed because Thomson-CSF has had to take its FFr1.4bn (Dollars 250bn) share of Credit Lyonnais losses and assess what provisions to make to cover possible losses on the bank's property loans. The latter have been hived off into a special company, with possible losses up to FFr12.3bn to be covered by the state, and thereafter by Thomson-CSF up to FFr1.8bn. According to some reports yesterday, Thomson-CSF is to provide for its entire FFr1.8bn liability in its 1993 accounts. This would increase its loss to FFr2.3bn and Thomson's group loss to FFr3bn. Mr Gomez's willingness to let Thomson stand guarantee for Credit Lyonnais's bad debts as well as to help absorb its loss is said to have induced Prime Minster Edouard Balladur to keep him on. Mr Gomez has headed Thomson since 1982. To clarify the legal doubt over whether he could serve any longer, the government is passing a parliamentary amendment. Yesterday the government renominated Mr Gomez to the Thomson board, and is expected shortly to make a Cabinet announcement extending his term as company president. However, the industry and defence ministers want Mr Gomez, a socialist appointee, replaced, and may yet get their way if the group is privatised next year.</p>

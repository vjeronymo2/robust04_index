			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pricing puts value of Pounds 45m on Amey Shares in Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction companies and the sixth biggest roadbuilder, were priced at 161p yesterday valuing the group at Pounds 45m. It is coming to market via a placing of 8.07m shares - representing 28.9 per cent of the enlarged capital - with institutional investors. This will raise Pounds 10m of new money for the company and Pounds 3m for existing holders. Existing holders had hoped to raise Pounds 10m but scaled back their share sale in the light of market conditions. The Pounds 3m will be split equally between Close Brothers, which held a 25 per cent stake on behalf of some 30 investment institutions, and Amey's existing directors and managers. Mr Neil Ashley, chairman, said 'It has always been our intention to seek a listing for Amey at this stage of the group's development. We are delighted, in current market conditions, to have achieved our objective of raising Pounds 10m of new money in order to strengthen the capital base of the company and fund its future development.' The company, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction group, was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989. Amey was then sold by Hanson for Pounds 6.5m to a management group led by Mr Ashley. Amey reported pre-tax profits on its continuing businesses of Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.4m) last year on group sales of Pounds 210m (Pounds 162.5m). The issue is sponsored by Barings and James Capel will act as broker. Dealings are due to begin on June 10.</p>

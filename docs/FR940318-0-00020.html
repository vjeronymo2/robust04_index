			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Loans on multifamily properties with a small number of units are already covered under the existing risk-based capital regulation and will continue to be covered under either the grandfathering provision or the new rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS has determined that this final rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final multifamily rule is effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  without the 30-day delay of effective date provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. The delayed effective date requirement may be waived for ``good cause.'' The OTS has determined that good cause exists to waive the delayed effective date requirement since the rule relieves a restriction on savings associations by permitting them to utilize a lower risk weight for eligible multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such loans in calculations of their risk-based capital ratios. This effective date will enable savings associations to use the reduced risk weight for multifamily housing loans in their Thrift Financial Report for the quarter ending March 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of today's amendments affects a credit risk-weight category at section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C), a section also amended by Interest Rate Risk. 58 FR 45813 (August 31, 1993). The Interest Rate Risk amendments to 567.6 were originally to become effective on July 1, 1994, when a savings association would first have been required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its risk-based capital requirement. To simplify reporting requirements, the agency is changing the effective date of those amendments to September 30, 1994. OTS is therefore publishing on an interim basis section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) as it will be in effect from March 18, 1994 through September 29, 1994. This reflects today's multifamily amendment to this section, but not the change that the interest rate risk amendments will make to that section. Section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) as it will be in effect on and after September 30, 1994 follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a conforming amendment is being made to section 567.7(a) to change the date the deduction of an institution's interest rate risk component becomes effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Mmm - Dance Michael Clark's identity is that of the naughty boy of British dance. His generally youthful public is eager for the trappings of rudery, the zany dress and the occasional flash of bottom or dildo, with which he has cocked various snooks at establishment dance. A cross between Tyl Eulenspiegel and Arthur Rimbaud, anarchic clown and boy genius, this persona is now both unwise and constraining for a man of 30 who seeks, I suppose, to be taken seriously, and who is unquestionably a dancer of prodigious if ill-served gifts. His new show - one can't call it a dance-work - is Mmm, a mutation of the Modern Masterpiece which started out a few months ago. It uses Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Not the ideal score for a choreographer whose earlier productions have been short-breathed and disjointed, and cursed with the need to live up to its creator's irreverent and titillating reputation. Clark has already worked on the score in New York, in a joint venture with Stephen Petronio. This new version is, alas, still decked with those trappings of Clark-shock which so effectively hinder it from proper development - and serious consideration. Clark again adopts his role as dance's alternative comedian, obliging his audience with smut, juvenile irreverence. Thus the incidentals of tickets, leaflet, tee-shirt and badge emblazoned with a roughly gynaecological drawing. Thus the appearance of Clark's mother, a vulnerable figure as she manifests herself, topless, in the cause of her son's art. Thus, too, the appearance of Leigh Bowery - onlie begetter of the frightful costuming - shrouded in white and identified for us by the C-word writ large, though from his lumbering and blubbery appearance he is more like Moby Dick. And hence the ear-shattering racket by the Sex Pistols as prelude to Sacre, which is also amplified to brutish levels. The resultant performance is inconsiderable, though it does indicate that Clark is seeking to provide sustained dance interest. The evening begins with a magnificent double solo for Clark and his new colleague, the very gifted Joanne Barrett. Clark's dancing in this brief section is purer, more potent, more exquisite in articulation than we have seen for years. Every gift is his, from purity of line to the most delicate and precise shaping of steps. Thereafter, gimmicks and what might best be known as dirty tricks, proliferate, until Sacre begins and Stravinsky serves as a vehicle on which Clark hitches a lift. With his companions Barrett, Julie Hood and Matthew Hawkins, he rides the score, marking its incidents with thin, piece-meal movement that wriggles about to the music without saying anything very pertinent until the danse sacrale. Here - and the music is cast-iron theatre - he devises a solo for Barrett that conveys the compulsive and convulsive nature of the sacrifice, which Barrett performs with superb control and force. Together with those moments when Clark dances, and eschews everything except his own radiant talent for movement, this is the justification for the evening. But we pay terribly for it in sitting through the din and the fatuities that surround these fascinating moments of true dance, true choreography. Clark, I venture to suggest, has paid even more. The Kings Cross Depot is a cavernous warehouse - its sightlines not of the best - to be found in the hinterland behind the railway station. It is not an area,in which I would chose to be after nightfall. Shareholders in Beck's Beer will doubtless be flocking to see how their money is being spent. Michael Clark Company is at The Kings Cross Depot, off York Way, London N 1, until June 28 The season is sponsored by Beck's</p>

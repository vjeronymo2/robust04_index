			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRANK ISRAEL'S TALK IS GLIMPSE INTO HIS 'STYLIST' ARCHITECTURE  </P> <P> "I never professed to be an originator," Los Angeles architect Frank Israel  told his audience at UC Irvine's Beckman Center on Wednesday night. "I'm more  of a stylist."  </P> <P> Indeed, as he showed slides of a number of the private homes he designed during  the past decade, his "stylist" profile was paramount. Here were lush sweeps of  color, sybaritic fountains and pools, amusing details and fanciful furniture  designs. Very often the project was a remodeling, a Cinderella transformation  of a building that was too ordinary, too decrepit or simply too small to  accommodate the Southern California lifestyle.  </P> <P> "The client is almost always the best critic," Israel said, joking that his  office staff says he "gives in too easily" to client demands. He maintains,  though, that "many times a client can inspire the most avant-garde solution."  </P> <P> Take the Hancock Park home of fashion designer Michele Lamy and her husband,  avant-garde film maker Richard Newton. They hated their Colonial-style  dwelling, bought only because it is near their daughter's school. Newton had  already made anarchic patterns on the lawn with a machete when Israel came in  for a consultation.  </P> <P> The couple wanted to build onto the front of the house, but Israel thought it  prudent to respect the setback of the neighboring houses, each with its tidy  handkerchief of lawn. The solution was a monumental "pavilion" built onto the  back of the house and overlooking the pool. Intended to "transform" but not  "upstage" the existing house, it nevertheless features a startling facade of  yellow and red pigmented stucco that abuts the white and blue clapboard of the  original structure.  </P> <P> It was so startling, in fact, that a neighbor threw rocks at Israel one day.  "She just hated the color," he said. "I don't want to offend people with my  work, but I don't believe in design controls."  </P> <P> Lamy and Newton, he added, are now contemplating redoing the house in a  Caribbean motif "with a thatched roof," a notion that drew hoots of laughter  from the audience.  </P> <P> Israel's sources -- or "references," as he repeatedly called them -- are the  airy houses of leading architect Rudolph Schindler, who was active in Southern  California during the '20s, '30s and '40s. (Schindler once said his houses  "combine the solidity of the cave with the lightweight character of a tent.")  </P> <P> In the Lamy-Newton house, the lavish use of glass creates "situations where  you're not sure whether you're inside or outside, in the old or the new house,"  Israel said.  </P> <P> Israel, a reedy 6-foot-3, was jokingly introduced by Newport Beach architect  Alex Caragonne as "Little Frank" to distinguish him from his better-known Los  Angeles colleague, "big" Frank Gehry. Israel, who is 45, is an associate  professor at the UCLA School of Architecture and  </P> <P> founder of Franklin D. Israel Design Associates in Beverly Hills. He was  recently appointed a director of the American School in Rome, where he studied  in the mid-'70s as the winner of the Prix de Rome. He was for a time an art  director at Paramount Pictures, and he has designed film production offices and  homes for a number of Hollywood folk.  </P> <P> Israel's remodeling of a Malibu condominium owned by director Robert Altman was  inspired by the client's desire for the openness of his New York City loft as  much as by Altman's desire to make the most of the innate qualities of the  beachfront site. Because the Coastal Commission forbade any changes to the  exterior, Israel was obliged to focus on the interior.  </P> <P> He opened it up, installing "a light scoop -- a periscope to the sun," redid  the floor in limestone, and he used lots of his favorite pale sea-green. A  pivoting transom in iridescent glass -- it reflects rainbow patterns on the  wall -- was a typical Israel touch. So was the bedroom, designed to suggest the  odd experience of "sleeping under the hull of a ship." A spiraling banister on  the stairway imitates the curve of a Nautilus shell.  </P> <P> During the question-and-answer period after the presentation, Israel was asked  whether it isn't easier just to build a new house rather than attempt to revamp  an existing one. "It costs as much to save as to tear down," he acknowledged.  </P> <P> Then there's the other phenomenon that seems to accompany remodeling. "A lot of  my clients are getting divorced," he said. "During a period of three years, I  went through five divorces. . . . (Some people) feel they can save their  marriage if they remodel their house. . . . But we got a lot of work out of  it."  </P> <P> Israel's talk was the last lecture in "California and Beyond: the State of  Design in the '90s," an architecture and design series sponsored by Newport  Harbor Art Museum's member group, the Forum.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / National Mutual offshoot is fined Pounds 45,000 by Lautro NM FINANCIAL Management, the UK life insurance division of Australia-based National Mutual, has been fined Pounds 45,000 by regulators for failing to vet its sales staff properly and for failing to insure that 'best advice' was given to clients. NMFM will also have to pay the costs of the investigation and pay compensation to investors who have been sold unsuitable products. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, said yesterday that its compliance staff initially uncovered deficiencies in NMFM's procedures for vetting sales staff during a visit in December 1990. In May last year Lautro conducted a further visit and found there were still deficiencies and that moreover, there was insufficient information in company files for regulators to see whether best advice had been given. Under Lautro rules sales agents must conduct a 'fact-find' on each prospective customer to discover his financial position, needs and goals. Without this information sales agents cannot properly advise a client about the product most appropriate to his needs. This may lead to mis-selling of unsuitable products which are likely to be cancelled by clients in the first few years, leading to a loss of most of the premiums paid. NMFM said that since that visit it had improved its vetting procedures and had reviewed policies sold to customers where insufficient fact-finds were recorded. It said that compensation required to be paid in only one case.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Bad weather forces fall in Cuban exodus Thunder and lightning yesterday achieved what President Bill Clinton could not - halt the tide of Cubans attempting to flee the island by boat. Bad weather in the Straits of Florida forced the first substantial drop in the number of refugees since the US administration announced it would no longer allow Cubans entry to the US and would take them for detention at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Coast Guard reported 1,670 people were picked up on Thursday but only 378 people were picked up between midnight Thursday and mid-afternoon yesterday. In the five days before Thursday, more than 2,500 people had been found daily. As rain and high seas continued through yesterday, concerns grew over the numbers of people who may have died in the tropical thunder-storm. In South Florida, callers to local radio stations said they had seen small boats and rafts washed ashore with no apparent survivors. The Coast Guard acknowledged that there had been some fatalities, but said that there was no way of keeping track of the numbers lost at sea. One official went on to say that bad weather was making the rescue operation more difficult. 'Even on a calm day it is difficult to pick people up off unstable rafts - in rough weather it is more dangerous,' the official said. Finding people was an increasing problem: 'It is much more difficult to spot rafters because they're not visible due to the high waves, fog and rain.' In Washington, President Clinton yesterday met his foreign policy advisers to discuss ways of preventing people from trying to flee the island and measures to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, broke off his holiday in Florida to attend the White House session on the Cuba problem. Defence officials expected to move between 7,000 and 9,000 extra soldiers to the Guantanamo base to help the 3,000 already there building the refugee camps. Mr Dennis Boxx, the Pentagon spokesman, estimated it would cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to set up expanded camps for the Cubans assuming the numbers do not exceed 45,000. The Pentagon predicts it will cost about Dollars 20m a month to run the camps. Meanwhile, a Florida boat owner was detained by the Coast Guard for allegedly trying to smuggle nine Cubans across the 90-mile stretch between Cuba and Florida.

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Esso cuts petrol by 4.5p a gallon ESSO is cutting the maximum pump price for petrol by 4.5p a gallon (1p a litre) from the start of business today. The cut follows BP's announcement on Friday that it would reduce its maximum price by 6p a gallon from yesterday. Esso's new maximum prices will be four-star 258.7p a gallon (56.9p a litre), unleaded 235.9p a gallon (51.9p a litre) and Superplus unleaded 254.1p a gallon (55.9p a litre). Shell is cutting 10p a gallon (2.2p a litre) from its wholesale diesel price. The cut will be applied at more than half of Shell's 2,400 service stations. The remainder are already selling below the new maximum price. Shell said it was the first oil company to announce a diesel price cut since the Budget when 12.2p a gallon was added to to the pump price of diesel.</p>

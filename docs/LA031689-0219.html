			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TEXACO MOVES TO DETER TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Texaco Inc., the nation's third largest oil company, said today its board of  directors adopted a new shareholder rights plan to deter possible hostile  takeover attempts.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Texaco shareholders will receive rights to purchase a new  series of junior preferred stock at the rate of one right for each share of  common stock held at the close of business April 3, the company said.  </P> <P> "The board of directors was concerned that, without a rights plan in place,  control of the company could be acquired in the open market without fair value  being offered to each and every Texaco shareholder," said President James  Kinnear.  </P> <P> New York financier Carl Icahn, who made a $60-a-share bid for the company last  year, owns about 42 million shares, or 17%, of Texaco's stock.  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Setback for Perez government THE forced resignation of a key Venezuelan official this week points to strong differences on economic policy among government agencies. Ms Gabriela Febres Cordero, head of the Venezuelan government's Foreign Trade Institute (ICE) resigned on Monday after she suggested in the press that problems in expanding Venezuela's non-traditional exports were due mainly to the lack of a coherent industrial policy. Ms Febres Cordero's departure means that the government of President Carlos Andres Perez has lost one of its most effective defenders of economic reform. One of the main goals of the Perez administration has been to boost non-traditional exports in an economy dominated by the state-owned petroleum industry. Non-petroleum exports have tapered off in recent months, making it unlikely that the government can reach its goal of Dollars 4bn in non-traditional exports this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Former Nicaraguan  "contras" believe that the OAS can do nothing to guarantee their  physical well-being and therefore demanded that the U.S.  Government assume that responsibility.    The group of 17 former Nicaraguan "contras" who on Tuesday  occupied the headquarters of the International Commission of  Support and Verification of the OAS (CIAV-OAS) and six others  who requested political asylum at the Colombian Embassy in this  capital made that decision to protect their lives.    Leonardo Zeledon, alias "Chispero," told ACAN-EFE that "we  were forced to promote this action because after four years the  CIAV-OAS has been the only organization that has tried to  protect our lives." "Unfortunately, in four years the CIAV-OAS  has been unable to guarantee our lives because the government  does not establish conditions for that," added "Chispero," a  crippled individual who directs the occupation from a wheelchair.    "The North Americans armed us for war and later disarmed us  for peace, but now that we are persecuted, jailed, and murdered  and are jobless, nobody does anything for us," the crippled  leader explained. "The United States must demand that our lives  be respected," he insisted. "Chispero" asserted that clearly  the former Nicaraguan Resistance "cannot offer more lives" and  urged the U.S. Government to protect their lives.    The Managua Government has remained silent on the CIAV-OAS  occupation, although it was learned Government Minister Alfredo  Mendieta talked over the telephone with CIAV Coordinator Sergio  Camarena. Details of the conversation between the minister and  the CIAV official are not known.    The former contra leader, who during the civil war was  personnel chief of the "San Jacinto" Task Force," one of the  battalions of the defunct "contras," warned that the occupation  is "peaceful but indefinite." "Before, the CIAV-OAS was a  shadow protecting the demobilized, but now it only overshadows  the dead," the crippled leader stated.    "Chispero" said the government pledged to support the return  of the demobilized to civilian life and it has not complied. He  added it cannot guarantee recontras the means to support  themselves with land to produce, work, and education. He  admitted that the six demobilized individuals who sought refuge  at the Colombian Embassy are part of a "struggle and liberty"  plan that will be implemented day after day nationally, with  progressive actions he did not detail.    "Chispero" reported he is a member of the Nicaraguan  Resistance Superior Council, which is also trying to unite all  former "contra" trends and protect the demobilized. In  addition, the Nicaraguan Resistance Superior Council follows up  on the agreements the government has allegedly failed to comply  with on the delivery of land, work, and education for the former  contras' return to civilian productive, social, and political  life.    According to "Chispero," approximately 50 men who took up  arms under Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and who had  demobilized, returned to the mountains in northern Nicaragua  bearing their weapons to protect their lives. "The 184,000  families that the CIAV-OAS repatriated are not doing anything,  and it is best that they be removed from here and sent wherever  they want so they cannot be hunted down like dogs," said  "Chispero" in one of the hallways of the CIAV-OAS headquarters.    Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal called  on  the six former "contras" occupying the Colombian Embassy to  leave that mission and "make use of legal procedures to demand  their claims." "In our country there are no persons who are  persecuted, nor will there be, for political reasons by the  administration of Violeta Chamorro," the foreign minister  declared.    The facilities of the Embassies of Venezuela and Italy, the  United Nations, as well as the cathedrals in Managua and Esteli,  were also occupied weeks ago by groups of former Sandinist  soldiers pressuring for solutions to their problems.</p>

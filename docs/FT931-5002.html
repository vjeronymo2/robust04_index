			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Afghans wrangle as peace accord is signed: The prospects for a lasting settlement AFGHANISTAN'S rival mujahideen leaders flew to Saudi Arabia yesterday to offer prayers at Mecca after signing a peace accord in Pakistan over the week-end. But western diplomats said the agreement provides no guarantees that Afghanistan can finally overcome the bloody rivalries which have plagued it during 14 years of civil war. Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the guerrilla leader whose troops have killed at least 1,000 people and injured another 6,000 in rocket attacks on Kabul this year, was appointed prime minister. Western diplomats were concerned about the precedent set for other guerrilla leaders by the appointment of Mr Hekmatyar. 'If you fight and kill, you win, is the basic message here. I fear the day when others will try to follow that,' said one. President Burhanuddin Rabbani remains head of state until the middle of 1994 under the agreement. But the two men were wrangling until the last minute over the assignment of ministerial positions. Mr Hekmatyar insisted on the exclusion of the defence minister, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, from the cabinet on the grounds that both the president and the defence minister should not come from the same party, because this would tilt the balance in favour of one group. Mr Rabbani forcefully resisted. Under the accord, the cabinet is to be decided within two weeks in consultations between the president and prime minister, and all parties will be represented on a defence council. But Mr Hekmatyar said within minutes of the signing: 'It is my prerogative as prime minister to choose the defence minister.' The two-week delay was an attempt to buy time in the hope of an agreement being reached later, one senior official said. 'It was also a face-saving solution for Pakistan which would have been embarrassed if the talks had collapsed.' The agreement includes a provision to set up a military commission which would take over heavy arms from different groups and create a national army. The Afghan leaders agreed to seek help from the Saudi Arabia-based Organisation of Islamic Conference in monitoring the ceasefire. General Rashid Dostum, the powerful Uzbek whose troops control large parts of northern Afghanistan, is excluded from the agreement, providing another reason for concern. 'He will only become more of a threat to Kabul if he is joined by Masood in the event that Hekmatyar succeeds in removing him,' said one senior diplomat. Residents of Kabul yesterday welcomed the truce, although three people were killed and 25 injured as government troops exchanged rocket and artillery fire with the minority Hezb-i-Wahdat party, which had ratified the agreement. There are no plans yet to resume United Nations aid operations after the withdrawal of UN inter-national staff in January when three workers and an international consultant were killed by gunmen near the eastern city of Jalalabad. A UN appeal for Dollars 138m (Pounds 97m) in humanitarian assistance, launched early this year, has so far only received commitments of Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m. Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary-general's personal representative on Afghanistan, said in an interview yesterday: 'We have not received encouraging pledges from too many governments yet. That is something that has worried me for some time now.' Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, described the weekend agreement as an important breakthrough and said: 'We pray that, as a result of this agreement, there will now be harmony, peace and understanding.' But Pakistani officials said it was now up to the Afghans to honour the agreement. One said: 'You can take a horse to the water tank but can you make it drink?'</p>

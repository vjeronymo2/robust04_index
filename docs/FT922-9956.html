			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: STET shares continue to fall on IRI plan to dilute stake further SHARES in STET, the company which controls Italy's state-owned telecommunications activities, continued to plummet yesterday following the announcement that the IRI state holding group planned a further dilution of its stake. Ordinary shares in STET plunged by L122 to L1,899, while savings stock fell by L95 to L1,770 as dealers responded to IRI's plan, announced last week, to sell off more of its holding. Under the complex proposal, IRI's stake could fall to just 1 per cent of STET's non-voting savings shares. However, state control will be guaranteed as IRI's holding of ordinary shares in STET will not fall below 53 per cent. IRI now owns around 69 per cent of STET's ordinary stock and 30 per cent of its savings shares, if all outstanding warrants are exercised. The deal, scheduled for June, involves the sale of 350m ordinary shares and of warrants to acquire a further 175m ordinary shares and 350m savings shares. Existing shareholders will be offered 'packets' of 1,000 ordinary shares and 50 A warrants, each of which will be valid to buy a further 10 ordinary shares, as well as 100 B warrants, giving the right to buy 10 savings shares. No terms for the deal have been disclosed. Although attractive in principle, the part-privatisation has been attacked by dealers on the grounds that it comes too soon after a string of money-raising ventures by IRI, notably on the telecommunications side. Last June, IRI raised around Dollars 275m by reducing its holding of STET savings shares. The market's hostility has been reinforced by the gloom on the Milan bourse, which has been beset by general political uncertainties and a deepening local corruption scandal. 'The market is in no mood for any capital raising ventures at present", said one broker.</p>

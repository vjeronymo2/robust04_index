			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks carry lower provisions Clydesdale Bank, Scotland's third largest clearing bank, increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 110.7m in the year to September 30. The result, another record for the Glasgow-based institution, benefited from a Pounds 16.8m reduction to Pounds 21.5m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Operating profit before charging for bad debts was Pounds 132.2m (Pounds 127.6m). Mr Frank Cicutto, who became chief executive in January on the death of Mr Charles Love, said corporate lending fell because companies were reducing borrowing and accelerating repayments. Mortgage lending increased 14 per cent and now represented 35 per cent of the total lending. Yorkshire Bank which, like Clydesdale, is owned by National Australia Bank, reported a smaller rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 137.3m (Pounds 131.7m), though it too benefited from a sharp fall in provisions to Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 68.4m). Net interest income fell by just over Pounds 20m to Pounds 256.3m, though Mr Tom Gallagher, chief executive, said this largely reflected a change in accounting for loans made before 1991. There was, however, a more encouraging rise in non-interest income to Pounds 122.3m (106.7m). An increase in operating expenses to Pounds 198.7m (Pounds 182.8m) - mostly from investment in projects such as moving processing out of branches - affected Yorkshire's cost-income ratio, but at 52.5 per cent it is still one of the better examples in the sector. During the year Clydesdale largely completed a major reorganisation of its branch network, removing processing work from its 350 branches and creating three processing centres. Because of investment in reorganisation, Clydesdale's cost income ratio fell only marginally from 60.8 per cent to 60.3 per cent, having been 64 per cent two years ago. Total assets were Pounds 6.0bn (Pounds 5.56bn).</p>

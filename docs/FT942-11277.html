			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Love's Labour's Lost As a director Ian Judge is good with lost boys. I remember a haunting Peter Pan at the Shaw Festival in Canada, where the twilit gleam of Kensington loomed dream-like through the excitement of Never Land, and the everyday reality of the nursery was glimpsed in forest and pirate lair. His updated Love's Labour's Lost for the RSC, first seen at Stratford in October, has arrived at the Barbican and, placing the action in another Never Never Land, hints that these golden lads too belong to a doomed generation. The setting is late Edwardian Oxbridge. Distant spires dream; in a neighbouring quad Lord Fancourt Babberley is almost certainly impersonating his chum Charley's aunt from Brazil. More immediately the King of Navarre and his earnest fellow-students (as it were a Rupert Brooke reading party) make their rash vow to forswear such mundane pleasures as female company. The breaking of that vow and the blossoming of love are depicted gravely, in a production that takes the play more seriously than usual. If the dramatic pulse seems initially sluggish, the idyllic mood is cumulative, and Judge brilliantly makes sense of that awkward conclusion when the happy ending is postponed after death has suddenly cast its shadow over the high spirits. John Gunter's sets give us high-backed pub settles festooned with victorious oars and college photographs. The page-boy Moth (Christopher Luscombe) is here a choral scholar; his master, Don Armado, would today be a TV pundit. A whiskery Daniel Massey blends Bernard Shaw with Lytton Strachey and makes a good case for Shakespeare's atrociously facetious word-play being the forerunner of Oxford linguistic philosophy. Berowne, part cynic, part romantic, is the most interesting of the men. If Jeremy Northam lacks the dazzling ebullience with which Roger Rees skimmed the language on this stage some years ago, he has the intensity the production requires, a fit mate for Abigail McKern's pointed Rosaline. Unexaggerated comedy marks the amateur theatricals. The women have the grace not to join in the men's sneers; but start the laughter at one of the play's most touching moments, when haughty Don Armado confesses he has no shirt. Above all, the production triumphs in avoiding familiar traps: mummerset rustics (Costard is a smart young butcher's lad; Jaquenetta does a final number in exotic plumes), and it speeds through the flowery verbosity inspired by the fashionable euphuisms. The wistful palm-court gaiety of Nigel Hess's score is countered by hints of future shock with mock-Muscovite masquers who look like Rasputin. The spires finally disappear from a bleak horizon that we know contains Paschendael and the Somme; and afternoons will never be so golden again.</p>

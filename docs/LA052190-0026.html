			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA DIVISION II SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD WINS THIRD CROWN  </P> <P> It took four games and 10 hours to accomplish, but Cal State Bakersfield won  its third consecutive NCAA Division II softball title Sunday at Emerson Park in  Midland, Mich.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners defeated California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State  Northridge, 6-2, in the title game after beating the Lady Matadors, 1-0, in the  first championship game of the double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> Northridge (51-21) had scored three runs in the seventh inning to beat  Bakersfield, 3-2, earlier in the day.  </P> <P> That meant the Roadrunners (44-11) had to defeat Bloomsburg (Pa.) University,  4-0, to get another opportunity at playing Northridge.  </P> <P> Freshman Cathy Lewis (16-5) got credit for Bakersfield's two victories over  Northridge.  </P> <P> The left-hander pitched a three-hitter in the first game and allowed one hit in  3 1/3 innings of relief in the title game.  </P> <P> In the first game, Lisa Uranday singled in Michelle Gerry with one out in the  seventh inning in the 1-0 victory over Northridge.  </P> <P> In the title game, Northridge third baseman Krista Miller's two-out throwing  error in the first inning led to four unearned runs.

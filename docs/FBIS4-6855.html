			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The business community  welcomed the election Monday [25 April] of Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata as Japan's new prime minister.    Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Japan's top automaker Toyota  Motor Corp., said he expects Hata, with deep perspectives and  rich experience in administration, to demonstrate his leadership.    Yasuo Shingu, chairman of Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd.,  expressed hope that the Hata government will take quick action  in dealing with pending problems.    Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers  Association, urged the government to carry the fiscal 1994  budget through the Diet as soon as possible in view of the slow  recovery in the domestic economy.    Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the government should try to  cut expenditures and abolish or amend the consumption tax to  create new sources for public welfare funds.    Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, expressed hope that the government will pave the  way for a smooth settlement of external trade problems ahead of  a summit of the Group of Seven nations to be held in Naples,  Italy this July.    Katsuhiro Utada, vice chairman of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), described Hata as the right  person to tackle the major domestic and international issues  facing Japan.    Utada cited the issues as an early enactment of the 1994  state budget pending before the Diet and resumption of  negotiations for a new trade framework between Japan and the  United States.    Utada, honorary chairman of Ajinomoto Co., said the urgent  task facing the ruling coalition is to stabilize the political  situation and Hata is the most suitable person for the mission.</p>

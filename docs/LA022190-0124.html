			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HUGE LOTTO JACKPOT DRAWS THRONGS  </P> <P> Jack Kleimeyer didn't seem deterred by the 1-in-14-million odds against his  winning today's expected $60-million Lotto jackpot.  </P> <P> He bought one ticket.  </P> <P> "I could win as easy with one as 100 (tickets)," the 56-year-old Irvine man  said. "I'm confident."  </P> <P> It seems that a number of players were confident their picks would win the  jackpot, which officials say could be a record if ticket sales continue at  Tuesday's pace.  </P> <P> Ed Meyers, 23, a clerk at Rolf's Wines &amp; Spirits in Irvine, said that by 2  p.m. Tuesday, the store had sold 5,720 tickets, more than double the number  sold the same day last week.  </P> <P> "A lot of these people will tell you they're playing to support the schools,"  Meyers said. "I don't believe it. It's far from an altruistic society."  </P> <P> At Rolf's, a counter is set aside to sell lottery tickets, and they sold fast  Tuesday as customers bought five, 10 or 20 tickets at a time.  </P> <P> "I've been playing since the lottery started," said Robert Lambert, a  maintenance technician at Pacific Bell. "I'm due, I'm due!"  </P> <P> Ticket sales for Sunday and Monday broke records, despite the holiday and  storms that caused poor road conditions in parts of the state, said Joanne  McNabb, a spokesman for the California Lottery. "There were a lot of sales  early Sunday," she said. "We figured they were golfers."  </P> <P> Ticket sales Tuesday seemed destined for the record books as well. About 1  million tickets were sold from 5 to 8 a.m. Tuesday, McNabb said. By 2 p.m., 8  1/2 million tickets had been sold, well above the average Tuesday sales of 3  million.  </P> <P> Lotto tickets are $1 each. The deadline for buying tickets is 7:45 tonight at  businesses throughout the state.  </P> <P> "When it gets big like this, it becomes a kind of social event," McNabb said.  "Everyone's talking about it when you go out to dinner. . . . It's sort of like  the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards." The previous biggest jackpot was $61.98  million, drawn Oct. 29, 1988.  </P> <P> Rosemary Webster, a systems analyst from El Toro, bought 10 tickets at  Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine, even though she didn't think she'd win.  </P> <P> "If you don't buy . . . then for sure you won't win," she said. "Somebody's  gotta win."DANICA KIRKA  </P></p>

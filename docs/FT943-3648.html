			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Turn up for the book The turn in interest rates in the UK has been received rather differently from that in the US. When the Federal Reserve moved in February, bond and equity markets tumbled. Yesterday UK equities dipped only slightly, while gilts jumped by nearly a point at the long end. Of course, the markets have had plenty of time to position themselves for a rise in base rates. But the reaction suggests that the UK authorities may have managed a pre-emptive strike which will enhance their anti-inflation credibility in the short term. That does not mean, though, that they have also secured a soft landing. Recent data on housing, the retail trade and the motor industry suggest the consumer side of the recovery may have already tapered off. But the economy is still growing at close to 4 per cent, so the output gap is closing. That alone might warrant some monetary action, even without yesterday's evidence of rising wholesale prices. The markets would be deluding themselves, however, if they thought that one half-point rate rise would be sufficient to halt this trend. If they wish to appear consistent, the authorities must tighten policy until the growth rate slows. The implication for equities is not encouraging. Earnings are unlikely to keep up this year's cracking pace in 1995, especially after a further increase in taxes. Gilts ought, by contrast, to have room to advance. But they remain at the mercy of sentiment in the international bond market. The Bank of England has yet to announce an auction for September. It must hope that the positive mood will last long enough to get a conventional sale away. Now that base rates are rising, it could not sell any more floating rate debt without serious loss of face.</p>

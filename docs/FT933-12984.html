			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Second-quarter drop at Reebok REEBOK International, the sports shoe manufacturer, yesterday reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 41.03m, or 46 cents a share, compared with Dollars 45.8m, or 49 cents, a year earlier, on sales which dropped from Dollars 702m to Dollars 658m, writes Martin Dickson. The results were in line with its recent warning of lower-than-expected profits, due to weak economies, a new pricing policy and a lack of product in the key basketball market.</p>

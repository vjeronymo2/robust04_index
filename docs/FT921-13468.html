			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Diesel cleans up its act Until recently I had not driven a diesel car in earnest since the launch of Peugeot's 405 diesel range in the late 1980s. In the past few weeks, however, acquaintance has been renewed with several diesels - prompting the immediate question, when it comes to the workhorse saloon and estate car sector at least, of why most people would ever want to drive anything else? And why, if governments are as committed to reducing urban pollution as they claim, are there not greater financial incentives to promote the use of cars which are more economical and environmentally 'cleaner' than their petrol-powered counterparts? Diesel-powered engines seem to run forever on a tankful - on last week's 405 Peugeot turbodiesel (the same engine as fitted to Citroens and Rover 400 cars) the gauge was still trying to cling to the half-full mark after nearly 400 miles. Performance of all the latest generation of high-speed car diesels is broadly similar. Performance-wise, the Peugeot was substantially perkier than the family two-litre petrol Montego. The old perception that diesels are necessarily slow, dirty and smelly is obsolete (but nevertheless still widespread). Best of all, in precisely those areas where petrol cars' consumption is at its worst, and emissions of exhaust pollutants most concentrated - in congested urban areas - the diesel is at its most effective. Petrol cars scraping 25 miles per gallon around town have diesel equivalents travelling half as far again in such conditions, while in terms of exhaust emissions the diesel is cleaner than even catalyst-equipped petrol cars. To manufacturers' disappointment, the Gulf war and the sight of all those burning oil wells did not give diesel vehicles a fierce kick-start. But judging by a rise in UK sales throughout the post-Gulf war period, awareness that the diesel has a lot going for it seems to be taking root. Joe Gormezano, partner with consultants Knibb Gormezano, which recently completed a substantial study of the European industry and prospects, suggests that the revival now being witnessed will continue to strengthen. The study concludes that it will be based mainly upon: Increasing concern about exhaust emissions from petrol engines. EC legislation aimed at harmonising fuel prices. Technical advances which are rapidly increasing its acceptability to consumers previously deterred by lack of performance. Starting in October, all new petrol-engined cars in the EC will have to be fitted with catalytic converters. This will encourage more diesel sales, particularly in the small car sector, predicts Gormezano, because 'the introduction of three-way catalysts will have a proportionately greater adverse effect on the cost of small petrol-powered cars. It will also adversely affect the fuel economy of petrol-engined cars in general'. Perhaps most significantly, the diesel is also seen as the main beneficiary of the harmonisation of fuel prices within the EC single market. Under the latest EC proposals for the taxation of vehicle fuels from 1993, leaded fuel would be subject to a recommended minimum tax of Ecu 0.49 (28p) per litre, compared with Ecu 0.44 for unleaded and only Ecu 0.27 for diesel. In the end, however, the future fate of diesel cars will depend on the extent of the research effort which continues to be applied to it. On that basis, things looks ever brighter. Germany, the EC's motor industry power house, is making intensive efforts to develop new generations of more powerful, quieter and 'smokeless' diesels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  leaders failed at a summit here early Saturday [25 June] to  nominate the next president of the European Commission, an EU  source said.    The source said the leaders would meet again later Saturday  on the second day of the summit to continue debating the choice  of a replacement for Jacques Delors, who will retire as the EU's  chief executive on January 5.    The official candidates are Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene, his Dutch counterpart, Ruud Lubbers, and the EU's  British trade commissioner, Leon Brittan.</p>

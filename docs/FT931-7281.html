			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Impressions de Pelleas / Review of Peter Brook's Debussy at Glasgow's Tramway Pelleas et Melisande was once believed to be the quintessence of a certain type of operatic Frenchness, impossible to rend from gauzy stage settings and 'impressionistic' musical readings, improperly uttered in any language other than the original. In recent decades, as Debussy's opera has found its widely accepted place among the essential masterpieces of the medium, the process of translating it is no longer deemed either impossible or improper. In this country Pelleas has had its score theatrically examined under probing new lights, its play re-located, and its Maeterlinck text successfully rendered in English. Each important stage in the process has brought gain and also loss: this is always the way with essential masterpieces. The latest is marked by Peter Brook. His Impressions de Pelleas was first played at the end of last year, in his Paris theatre, the Bouffes du Nord. It then set off on a European tour which this week reached the Tramway Theatre, Glasgow (a performing space favoured by Brook, where previously his Mahabharata and Tempete were likewise given their only British showings). The translation process is comparable to the one worked by Brook on Carmen a decade ago. It involves a single setting (designed by Chloe Obolensky); an unbroken long (100 minutes) act fashioned out of Debussy's five, with two scenes cut and many nips and tucks (some of them puzzling) effected elsewhere; multiple casting of principal roles; and removal of all small ones. The main innovation is that the 'scoring' here, by Marius Consant, is a reduction for two pianos - one on stage, one echoing it from the side. The role of the first piano is extended, visually at least. For Impressions de Pelleas is a Debussy re-location with a difference - to a turn-of-the-century drawing room out of Matisse, complete with ochre-red walls, goldfish bowl, orientally patterned carpet and bright chair-cloths; only two front-stage pools of water suggest any external scenic elements. At the start the drama is (as it were) announced as a play-reading for friends grouped round the piano; out of this a 'real' performance develops, which at the end gently subsides into its domestic pre-condition. So smooth is the connecting of these dramatic lines newly interlaced with those basic to the opera that the occasional moment of melodrama - Pelleas's death, fussily handled - stands out the more starkly. From all this Brook gains much that is poetically reverberant for his Pelleas reading. It is partly physical: while the Tramway may not permit the close focus of the (smaller) Bouffes du Nord theatre, the siting of Obolensky's spare drawing-room properties in the midst of this wonderfully rough, untamed theatre space achieves a quietly forceful new grip on the opera's domestic intimacy and its other-worldliness, its modulations of darkness and light - and, indeed, on the extraordinary, unrepeatable meshing of all those states and conditions. But mainly it is the style of dramatic enactment - candid, serene, physically restrained yet emotionally intense - that restores something of the Pelleas mystery sacrificed in too many recent 'new looks' at the opera. Brook understands that a stripping-away of this sort can elicit a magical new set of images, signs and symbols to play alongside and against those already built into the text - a flutter of cloth replacing the games with Melisande's hair, a darkly lit dialogue around the piano in lieu of the cavern scene, little Yniold observing everything from beside his chair, a dead hand trailing in a pool of water. Because the staging is for the most part so exactly shaped and aimed, a meaningful new Pelleas experience stirs luminously beneath the old. The main loss is, of course, the orchestra, that containing vessel of Debussyan colours, thoughts and feelings - although, once mental adjustments have been made and preconceptions thrown aside, the constant evocation of the world of Debussy melodies is itself a source of fascinating new insights. Also, the very sureness of the domestic framing removes from the opera that imaginative largeness of canvas that makes it 'about' rather more than just a family tragedy. But in Tuesday's opening performance the most significant disappointment - the only one, in truth - was the discrepancy between the acting level and the vocal. In the first cast the complete Debussyan balance of word, note and gesture was achieved only by Roger Soyer's distinguished Arkel and the pure, shining Melisande of the Korean soprano Jungwon Park (a slight, beautiful figure of oriental apartness - Brook's alternating Melisandes are Chinese and Japanese). The others, notably Jean-Francois Lapointe's youthfully handsome Pelleas and Vincent le Texier's too youthfully handsome Golaud, tended to blur their musical lines.

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: James Wilkes' chairman to quit board MR STEPHEN Hinchliffe yesterday resigned as chairman of James Wilkes, the engineering group which is fighting a hostile Pounds 35.8m bid from Petrocon, the engineering and surveying group. He will receive termination payments of about Pounds 533,000 and has approached the company with a view to buying some Wilkes assets including Beauchief Hall, the head office in Sheffield, and the helicopter owning subsidiary. Mr Arthur Watt, the group managing director who takes over as chairman, said that if the board accepts Mr Hinchliffe's proposals the group's debt and overheads would be substantially reduced. On Friday Mr Hinchliffe was ousted from the board of Lynx Holdings, the leisure and computer services group where he was chairman, in an institutional coup triggered by the perception that head office spending was out of control. Mr Watt said the new board had different ideas about head office costs. 'The helicopter division is for sale, head office will be moved and any excesses will not be continued,' he said. Petrocon immediately criticised the severence payment. 'In a desperate effort to escape Petrocon's offers, Wilkes has been forced to jettison its chairman and some of its extravagancies,' it said. Mr Hinchliffe's departure in no way reduced the blame for the demise of the company's fortunes from co-directors he leaves behind, the bidder added. More than 28 per cent of Wilkes shareholders have already accepted the Petrocon offer, which is thought to lie behind Mr Hinchliffe's decision to quitleave the board.</p>

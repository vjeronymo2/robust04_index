			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Cook to spell out proposals for health LABOUR will set out this week its alternative to the government's fund-holding scheme for GP's as part of a package of proposals for modifying  -but not reversing - the government's health service reforms. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, will set out Labour's plans later this week after a further attack today on the government for 'privatising' the National Health Service. Under Labour's plans hospitals which have converted to trust status would be returned to the control of local health authorities. An incoming government would also introduce a scheme of incentive payments for hospitals that increase efficiency and treat more patients. A senior party official accepted yesterday that the long-awaited policy package would 'not tear up' the changes to the NHS made by the government - including the creation of trusts and GP fundholding. Nevertheless, they represented 'pretty substantial revisions' aimed at improving patient care. Labour will stress the choice between tax cuts under the Conservatives or investment in the health service and education under Labour. Last night Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, said Labour had 'tried to produce policies which look and sound different but to achieve the same ends' as the government. He said they would 'impose a totally unnecessary upheaval on the NHS just at the time when the new system is starting to deliver real improvements'. Labour is expected to say how GPs would be given opportunities to participate in decision-making at a local level but would no longer be able to buy individual treatments for their patients. The Liberal Democrats will unveil their health policy today, including proposals for abolishing the fund-holding scheme while still giving GPs some freedom in choosing where patients should be treated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OAU representative in South Africa Sam Ebok </F> by correspondent Thandeka Xhobule; place and date not given; on  the "Agenda" program with introduction by announcer Freek  Robinson--recorded]    [Text] [Robinson] South Africa's entry into the OAU will  mean a great deal to that body, as Mr. Sam Ebok, representative  of the Organization of African Unity in South Africa, explained  to Thandeka Xhobule.    [Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have  confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting  of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that  on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the  Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or  less attained its mandate having contributed to the  decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to  the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it  means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of  nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look  forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic  emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the  political liberation.    [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the  continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts  of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South  Africa playing?    [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over  the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans  resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the  doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved  through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we  came here about two years ago we never thought that the  elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we  never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So  one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which  South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience  in conflict resolutions.    [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both  for  the OAU and for South Africa?    [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has  been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some  leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country  technologically and even politically. And so those experiences  are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization,  as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa,  I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state  -- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative  terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a  position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive  experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be  able to interact with the rest of the continent because South  Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a  member of any other international community. So for South  Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It  can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate  entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.</p>

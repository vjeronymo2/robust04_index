			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TALMI TAKES COMMAND AT CONCERT OF NOTE  </P> <P> Sporting his new title and a broad smile notably absent from his sober  publicity photos, music director designate Yoav Talmi returned to the San Diego  Symphony over the weekend. On Saturday night, the Israeli conductor exuded an  extra measure of confidence, although in five previous visits he surely has  never appeared obsequious. The orchestra's recently announced choice of Talmi,  after a two-year search for a music director, has clearly bolstered his morale  and his command of the podium.  </P> <P> The program was a Mozart and Mahler combination plate, evidently one of Talmi's  favorite recipes, since he will open the orchestra's 1989-90 season with the  same pair of composers. His affinity for and appreciation of Mahler's First  Symphony ("Titan") was evident at every turn. He allowed the episodic work to  unfold generously, never forcing the pace but carefully shaping each movement.  Only in the middle of the finale did he momentarily lose the tension and focus  that underlies Mahler's exotic tonal tapestry.  </P> <P> In the second movement, he demanded a Landler defined by unrelenting  sharp-edged rhythms, and the orchestra responded with rhythmic precision and  the appropriate piquant colors that made the entire section sparkle. In both of  the middle movements, Talmi kept the melodies shimmering above finely tuned  accompaniments.  </P> <P> Talmi wisely saved the major decibels for the thunderous climax of the last  movement, which displayed the orchestra's more resonant forte of the season.  Although the horns, expanded to eight for this symphony given to stentorian  outbursts, acquitted their tasks honorably, the trumpets under the brilliant  leadership of principal Calvin Price proved to be the thoroughbreds of the  Mahler brass.  </P> <P> Talmi's Mozart was less successful than his Mahler, but it was not all his  fault. Mozart's C Major Oboe Concerto, K. 271k is routine in the extreme,  especially compared to the composer's deservedly better-known Clarinet  Concerto, K. 622. And, although Allan Vogel is one of the most elegant oboe  virtuosos in captivity, he played below his own high standards Saturday night.  Dropping a few notes along the way is no crime, but he seemed hemmed in by the  opening movement's busy coloratura nonsense, and his usual rich timbre sounded  on the anemic side. Fortunately his characteristic sonority returned in the  freedom of the cadenzas and in the concluding rondo. Talmi had reduced the  orchestra to a mere 35 players for this modest concerto, but even that was a  bit heavy for the delicate sound of the oboe.  </P> <P> Although Mozart's Overture to "The Abduction From the Seraglio" is one of the  composer's more foolproof overtures, Talmi and the orchestra gave this program  opener compelling energy and a sprightly sheen. The overture followed the  symphony's announcement of a gift of $500,000 from Judson and Rachel Grosvenor  to underwrite Talmi's next four years with the San Diego Symphony. Judson  Grosvenor is a member of the symphony's board of directors and serves on its  executive committee. Now that Talmi and the orchestra are starting their  honeymoon, it is no doubt reassuring for the orchestra to boast a modest dowry  in addition to its sizable debt.  </P></p>

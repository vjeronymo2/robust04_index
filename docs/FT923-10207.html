			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Maxwell fund ALMOST 20 per cent of the emergency fund to help the Maxwell pensioners has been paid out. Payments to cover pensions in August for members of the Headington pension plan and the Maxwell Communication works pensions scheme bring the total spent to more than Pounds 477,000. The Pounds 2.5m fund was set up in June as a temporary measure to help Maxwell pension schemes, which would otherwise have been unable to continue making payments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Somali National Alliance, SNA,  has said that these days armed terrorist groups are emerging.  The terrorists, which are supported and spearheaded by foreign  and Somali individuals, commit murders and kidnap innocent  people. The spokesman described the terrorist acts as  anti-human rights and anti-international terrorism laws. He  said the SNA was strongly opposed to any form of terrorism and  supported international agreements on terrorism and banditry.    The spokesman went on to say that the SNA was making  comprehensive investigations to bring to justice those  responsible for the banditry and kidnappings which had been  committed in the country this year. In the investigations, the  SNA had already got answers to several terrorist incidents and  the identities of those responsible had been submitted to  international organizations dealing with the fight against  banditry and terrorism. The SNA spokesman said the Somali  people had just adopted the course of unity and coexistence. He  finally called on peace-loving Somali people to jointly counter  those opposed to peace who were busy committing terrorism to  harm peaceful coexistence.</p>

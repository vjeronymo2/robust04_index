			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Fiat on course for its biggest loss - Other companies Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, will announce the biggest loss in its history on Thursday. It is likely to report a net loss for 1993 of between L1,800bn (Dollars 1.1bn) and L2,100bn, and there is little prospect of a return to net profit before 1995. The market has already taken account of the bad news - heralded in September when the group announced a L966bn plunge into the red for the first half - and is speculating on an end to the crisis. Spurred on by faint signs of recovery in the automotive market, and by early success of the Punto, Fiat shares have been among the best performers on a buoyant Milan stock market.</p>

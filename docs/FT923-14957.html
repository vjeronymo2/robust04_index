			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Phantoms and liability VICTIMS of 'phantom withdrawals' from cash dispenser machines may find that their liability is not automatically restricted to Pounds 50 as they were led to believe by the Code of Banking Practice. The code appears to state this clearly, but it may be more cryptic. Cardholders could be at the mercy of legalistic quibbling and ad hoc inter-ombudsmen arrangements. The main problem is that the code does not specify whether the Pounds 50 limit is a maximum or a limit applying to each unauthorised transaction. 'It is something we must think about,' said Jane Woodhead, a building society ombudsman. 'We can't decide in advance. The most you can say is it is possible the limit could apply per transaction.' She explained that under the Consumer Credit Act, the deciding factor would be whether the card had been in the holder's possession between transactions. The banks are divided on the limit. Barclays and National Westminster said they thought the Pounds 50 applied per account not per transaction. Lloyds said that in the exceptional case of someone losing a card which then came back into their possession, the liability could be Pounds 50 per transaction. Midland Bank saw the Pounds 50 limit as a maximum but said each case would be treated on its merits. The bank would be bound by the ombudsman's decisions if these came down on the side of a limit per transaction. Chris Eadie, deputy banking ombudsman, said that while Pounds 50 could be the maximum liability for a series of unauthorised withdrawals, it might also apply several times if the series were broken by the customer using the card legitimately. The Pounds 50 limit does not apply in cases where the bank (or building society) can prove that the customer acted fraudulently or grossly negligently. But Stephen Edell, one of the building society ombudsmen, notes there is no authority in law on what 'gross negligence' means, apart from a 19th century definition that it is 'negligence with a vituperative epithet.' 'The banking ombudsman and we will have to decide about this as cases arise,' said Edell. Woodhead suggested the requirement to prove gross negligence - however defined - was easier on customers than simple negligence would have been.</p>

Occasion was the 2d  International Symposium on `Herbisides in War, the Long-Term  Effects on Man and Nature' held here from 15-19 November by the  National Committee on the Consequences of Chemical Warfare in  Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of  Science Technology and Environment.    During the symposium, more than 200 Vietnamese and foreign  participants discussed problems such as dioxin in human  organism, soil composition, vegetal organism and its long-term  effects on the environment. It was reported that US defoliants  known as Agent Orange had caused long term, dangerous effects on  the environment and millions of people in Vietnam. Over the  past years, the country has done much to solve problems caused  by the US toxic chemicals, providing initial medical care to the  victims. Reforestation has been promoted nationwide  particularly in areas destroyed by the US defoliants to restore  the environment to normal conditions.</p>

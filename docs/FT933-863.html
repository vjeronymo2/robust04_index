			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Mainstream Madonna - Pop Madonna has turned pro. Six years ago in London she revelled in her naughtiness, as she stripped the imagination with her virgin/whore routine, tossing her knickers at the audience with the elan of a convert to excess. Three years later she was the cruel mistress, despising her fans for the prurience she had exploited. Now, Madonna is the detached entertainer, putting on a show. The shadow of Las Vegas fell across the Wembley stage. With The Girlie Show, which opened a global tour on Saturday, Madonna boldly adds herself to the rota of show biz greats. This is mainstream spectacle, with a few shocks but none of the schlock which was Madonna's ribald gesture to the world.' It opens reassuringly with a topless dancer pirouetting down a long silver pole. It continues predictably with Madonna, clad in a handful of black sequins, ascending from the depths to a revolving circle where she whips herself into a quick orgasm with 'Erotica'. Wanting playmates she collects a couple of male dancers from the catwalk, strips them, and drags them down to hell, vividly conveyed in a burst of flames. You stifle a yawn, realise your blood pressure has fallen if anything, and wait for the dead donkey. But Madonna is, as ever, the tease. That's the last of decadence, of the bad old days. From now on its an all-singing, all-dancing sequence of routines, bursting with energy, if sometimes flagging in imagination. Circus music and a clown provide the less than stunning motif as Madonna runs through the songs from her turkey of a latest album 'Erotica', plus a few sure-fire standards. Dressed now by Dolce &amp; Gabbana she has foresworn fashion excessories in favour of striped T-shirts and torn jeans. This is Madonna, the worker. When she does harangue the audience it is not to savage their bodies but to get some appreciation. 'We are working our butts off up here.' At 34 time is catching up with Madonna and she accepts the fact by going historical. She conjures up Marlene Dietrich, in top hat and tails, and sings a Teutonic version of 'Like a Wirgin'. She shows her responsibility by performing solo the ritualistic Aids ballad 'In this life'. She has stopped inhabiting Planet Madonna and joined the entertainment Establishment. Of course the need to provoke still surfaces. Seconds after coming over serious about Aids she has her male dancers humping each other furiously while she rubs herself, purringly, against the thighs of one of her girls. And when she falls on to her knees to thank God for holding off the rain she can't help adding 'I don't get on my knees very often: ask my boy friends'. But the essence of this enjoyable, and well received, show is of Madonna dressed like a Russian admiral, commanding her troupers through 'Holiday'; or descending on a silver globe to lead the team into 'Express Yourself', which climaxes with a cosy love-in, a rip off from Hair; or the finale, at which the 10 dancers and invisible but excellent band are introduced in a vigorously choreographed vote of thanks. This is Madonna wearing the mask of professionalism. It may be less exhilarating than the old devil-raiser but it guarantees a much longer career.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Danger in delay It is Mr John Major, not Mr Norman Lamont, who should have been grilled by the Treasury select committee yesterday. For the economic strategy that collapsed on September 16 was the prime minister's before it was the chancellor's. Both were wedded to maintaining the exchange rate with the D-Mark, but it was Mr Major's repeated public oaths of eternal fidelity to a magic number that made a voluntary sterling devaluation politically unthinkable. The chancellor could not make pre-emptive use of the flexibility designed into the exchange rate mechanism even if he had had the prescience to do so. The prime minister's pride was the one excuse Mr Lamont could not allow himself in his televised self-defence. As the fits-and-starts search for a believable new strategy proceeds we are back to a further chapter in the same old story. It is once again Mr Major's weak political position that lies at the heart of the problem. Nobody who attended the Conservative party conference last week can have any doubt that the average Tory would rather see a return to higher rates of inflation than endure a further period of recession. The small businessmen who march behind the Conservative banner want interest rates sharply down at once, even if that means the abandonment of monetary policies aimed at holding the underlying rate of inflation to between 1 and 4 per cent. The prime minister and the chancellor are doubtless sincere when they say that keeping inflation low remains their top priority, but their supporters are clearly unwilling to take more pain. The markets are aware of this. That is why the events of Black Wednesday took place. What remains to be seen is whether Mr Lamont's current strategy, which is to read the newspapers in the morning and then decide what each new day may bring, will carry conviction. Yesterday he would not admit to any reason why it should not. As he reminded the committee, he has not so far strayed from the path of monetary rectitude. True, but 'leave it to me' is no longer good enough. This is a circular argument. If the individual upon whose judgment everything hangs has the markets' confidence, his judgment will be effective. If not, not. But luck does come into it. The markets can be moved by a variety of exogenous forces. If there are positive upwards movements in sterling and on the stock exchanges, for whatever reason, that will be counted in the chancellor's favour. If sellers predominate, Mr Lamont's tenure of office will be brought to an early end. Fate will roll his dice. A strong prime minister, confident of his own position and secure in the unity of his party, would not find it difficult to devise a better system for measuring both the performance of his chancellor and the progress of the economy. He could give responsibility for controlling inflation to an independent Bank of England. He could introduce genuine accountability, by setting out precise measures of performance and obliging the Treasury to report to parliament at regular intervals. Neither option has even been discussed. When I put the question to members of the cabinet in Brighton last week they all replied that the subject had not come up. The remaining option is to bring in a new chancellor, one whose credibility has not been destroyed by events. In more settled times, the prime minister would simply move Mr Lamont to another department - the Home Office, perhaps  -as part of a general reshuffle. For a while at least the government would look fresh. Mr Major is, however, trying to maintain a fragile union of, shall we say, rightwing nationalists and British Christian Democrats. He needs to watch the balance between these two parties in his administration as closely as he would similar partners in any continental coalition. The short list of potential replacements for Mr Lamont is composed of names that would upset the Westminster coalition. Mr Michael Howard, who, as is proper for an environment secretary, is busying himself with the promotion of 'Helping the Earth' week, is known to regard even the distant prospect of re-entry to the ERM with hostility. Mr Michael Portillo, the young chief secretary to the Treasury, is of a like persuasion; anyhow, his proper promotion, which could be sky-high, lies in a more distant future. Three other potential chancellors - Messrs Kenneth Clarke, Michael Heseltine and John MacGregor - are all solidly pro-ERM. None of the above say they want the job; all are straightening their ties. Meanwhile Mr Lamont has managed to acquire a reputation for being both in favour of the ERM and against it, which gives him a short-term political advantage at the cost of the last shreds of his reputation. If Mr Major was not so petrified at the prospect of further upsets within his party he would cut through all this. The longer he waits, the more he risks the humiliation of having the decision taken for him by events.</p>

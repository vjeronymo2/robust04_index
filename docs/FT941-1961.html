			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Thirsty for a potion: The Hungarian parliament yesterday voted to apply for EU entry Wave after wave of applicant countries comes crashing on to the shores of the European Union. The European Free Trade Association wave has just broken, but behind it the central European wave already looms high and menacing. Mr Peter Boross, the Hungarian prime minister, faces a general election on May 8. No one in Budapest doubts that his desire to file an EU membership application in April is closely related to this fact. Mr Boross's conservative nationalist party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, which has governed Hungary for the last four years, is struggling to climb back from fourth place in recent opinion polls, which give the socialist (formerly communist) party a commanding lead. Economically, Hungary's recovery from post-communist depression has begun: industrial production grew by four per cent in 1993, after falling steeply in each of the three previous years. But GDP still registered a slight drop, thanks to a collapse in agricultural output; and there is a long way to go to get back to 1989 levels. Most Hungarians compare their present circumstances unfavourably with those they enjoyed under 'goulash communism' in the 1980s, even though few imagine that it is possible to go back to that phase, during which a totalitarian system was being gradually and hesitantly relaxed. The socialists themselves accept that the transition to market-driven capitalism is now irreversible. But they offer to manage the transition better and to protect the weak against its worst effects. Such promises may be worthless, but many voters want to believe them, or at least to see what a change of government will bring. Mr Boross's only hope of winning back his party's supporters lies in convincing them that the long-term strategy of his predecessor Jozsef Antall (who died in December) is still on track. That strategy aimed to make Hungary a fully western country, a member of the EU and Nato, by the end of the century. On Nato, the government is making the best of the half-success achieved at the summit in January, when Nato promised to admit new members in the future but avoided saying who or when. On the EU the position is slightly clearer, since last June's Copenhagen summit explicitly offered the prospect of full membership to those central and east European countries that have association agreements. Since February, Hungary has such an agreement fully in force. Filing a membership application now will probably not affect the final outcome, or even the timetable of negotiations, which will be determined by arguments among the EU's existing members; but symbolically it will be an important milestone on the road. Opposition parties are irritated by the government's willingness to exploit this symbolism for electoral purposes, but none of them would dream of opposing the strategy. There is an all-party consensus on EU membership, but few Hungarians of any party seem to have thought out the full implications, or to have followed the arguments within the EU about the direction it should take. Federal or confederal, deep or shallow: it makes no difference. Hungary must be in. An economic rationale for this attitude can be given: as a small country on the edge of a large economic bloc, Hungary needs to be inside rather than outside. But it is clear that that is not the main reason. What Hungarians want above all is security. Security from what? Russia? From their more immediate neighbours? From themselves? Put any of these threats to them in specific terms and they will tend to play it down. The Russian threat is in the background, but for Hungary, much more than for Poland, it is now reasonably remote. The suggestion that Hungary could be drawn into Balkan conflicts, by concern for the Hungarian minorities in Serbia and Romania, is indignantly rejected; as is any questioning of the stability or permanence of Hungary's internal democracy. All these are spectres which haunt the Hungarian soul in the dark hours of night, even though in daylight they may seem far-fetched (and anyway they should be kept out of sight for fear of scaring off investors). Or rather they are different shapes assumed by a single, more permanent spectre that lurks just below the surface of Hungary's collective psyche - a spectre called 'the tragic past'; a history of war, defeat and conquest punctuated by brief moments of glory. That of course is something Hungary has in common with the rest of central Europe, indeed with Europe as a whole. But it is something western Europe is seen as having escaped from since 1945 - give or take a few nasty local exceptions like Northern Ireland. If western Europe has escaped, central Europeans tend to assume that it must have done so by taking magic potions. A range of bottles is on show in the west European pharmacist's window, and central Europe is determined to try them all. Some, labelled Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Council of Europe, North Atlantic Co-operation Council, it has already swallowed. They taste disappointingly bland, and the latest to be pushed across the counter at Nato's January summit, labelled 'Partnership for Peace', smells rather similar. But there are two bottles in the back of the shop, with very high price tags, which the chemist seems curiously reluctant to dispense. One is Nato, and the other has just been re-labelled 'EU'. They, surely, contain the real stuff. At any rate, central Europeans will not be content until they have tried them out.</p>

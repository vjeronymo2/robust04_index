			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Referendum keeps Paris bourse on its toes - Stockbrokers would rather not predict the trend between now and September 20 Only a few weeks ago when Paris stockbrokers were winding down for the start of the long French holidays, they were talking in terms of a sleepy summer on the stock market with the CAC-40 index hovering around 2,000 before rallying after the autumn rentree. Instead, the summer has been anything but sleepy. The Paris stock market has been hit by a series of shocks ranging from the prospect of a 'No' vote in next month's Maastricht referendum, to this week's turmoil on the currency markets and the threat of another war against Iraq. The CAC-40 index has slid during the summer. Last Monday, it fell to a new low for the year by breaking below 1,700 to close at 1,689.71. The index fell to 1,667.72 on Tuesday, when news broke of the first opinion poll showing that a majority of the French would vote against ratifying the Maastricht treaty in the September 20 referendum. The index has also been weighed down by the decline in the dollar. The stock market stabilised on Wednesday and rallied on Thursday when Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, ruled out a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The CAC-40 index ended the week 3.2 per cent lower at 1,687.53. 'We've seen a very slippery slide this summer,' says Mr Simon Hopkins, a broker with James Capel in Paris. 'For the next few weeks the stock market will continue to be dominated by the referendum and the value of the dollar. It's very difficult to predict what will happen between now and September 20.' The consensus among analysts is that, if the referendum result is 'Yes', the bourse will almost certainly rally. James Capel estimates that the CAC-40 index could rise as high as 1,850, providing there is no bad news on currencies or interest rates. If the result is 'No', the fate of the French market, and other European markets, would, as one Paris analyst puts it, 'be too ghastly to contemplate'. In the meantime, the CAC-40 index will fluctuate with the polls, although there is some evidence that it is becoming more resilient to them. The market fell sharply on Tuesday when the first poll showing a majority for the anti-Maastricht lobby was released. But news on Wednesday of a second poll indicating a negative outcome had little impact. The other main influence will be exchange rates. Mr Sapin was emphatic on Thursday that France would resist an ERM realignment and that it was sticking to its franc fort policy. If the franc did move, said Mr Sapin, it would be up, not down. In the past the French government has raised interest rates to support the franc, as it did last autumn after attempting unsuccessfully to hold French rates below those of Germany. It would be reluctant to raise interest rates again, given that the high cost of borrowing - with bank base rates of 9.85 per cent and an annual inflation rate of 3 per cent - is one of the main causes of sluggish corporate and consumer expenditure. Most analysts suspect that, barring a negative referendum result, France ought to be able to avoid a realignment or a rise in interest rates. 'It really is too soon to start talking in crisis terms,' says Mr Bernard Godement, economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris. 'At the moment we don't envisage any major changes for the franc, or for interest rates.' If Mr Godement is right, and France can avoid realignment, the dollar's decline could still indirectly affect the economy by putting pressure on French exports which have been compensating for the dull domestic market. This could pose problems for some sectors, notably drinks, cosmetics and luxury goods, which have already been hit by the slowdown in the Japanese market. Mr Sapin said on Thursday that France was still on course to surpass its original growth target of 2 per cent this year. But the threat of a fall in exports, combined with the lacklustre series of first-half figures released by French companies in recent weeks, has contributed to the gloomy mood of the market. A number of France's biggest industrial groups - Lafarge Coppee and Bouygues in construction, Peugeot in cars, Thomson-CSF in electronics and L'Air Liquide in gases - have announced flat or falling sales in real terms for the first half. Some companies' shares have been hit hard. Euro Disney has plunged over the summer on speculation about low attendance figures and continuing losses at its theme park outside Paris. Total has also fallen, as brokers downgraded their profit forecasts for the oil group. However, the French economy is still sound on fundamentals, in 'excellent shape', as a recent report from the Morgan Grenfell economics team in London concluded. It is already fulfilling 'all conditions to take part in European Monetary Union, while most other EC countries would be more than happy to meet these conditions by 1996'. Without the referendum most analysts had expected the underlying strength of France's economy - and its slow, if steady recovery - to boost the stock market this autumn. Instead, the course of the CAC-40 index over the next month or so will be dictated by politics rather than economics. After the referendum, or so they hope, the economic agenda will be in the ascendant for the few months before politics resurface ahead of next spring's National Assembly elections.</p>

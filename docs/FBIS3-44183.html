PAC and IFP Presidents Clarence Makwetu and  Mangosuthu Buthelezi met in Johannesburg on Thursday morning and  discussed the ballot system and violence.    "The PAC and the IFP decided to contact the Democratic  Party,  Dikwankwetla Party and others in favour of the two-ballot system  to develop joint strategies to ensure that the fraudulent  undemocratic one-ballot system does not take place," PAC  President Clarence Makwetu told a press conference afterwards.    PAC Political Secretary Jaki Seroke said later the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the Conservative Party  might also be approached.    Mr Makwetu and Mr Buthelezi agreed violence could jeopardise  the elections and suggested meetings between them and the  African National Congress [ANC]. "Joint activities between the  PAC, the IFP and the ANC is the route along which the solution  should be found," Mr Makwetu said.    Mr Buthelezi said the PAC last year offered to mediate  between the ANC and the IFP, but the ANC had rejected the offer.</p>

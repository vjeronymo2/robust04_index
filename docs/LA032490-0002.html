			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG LEAKS IN THE EXPLOSIVE FILE;  </P> <P> TERRORISTS NOW ON THE DEFENSIVE -- FOR A CHANGE  </P> <P> Semtex is an odorless, pliable, enormously potent explosive, virtually  undetectable by conventional airport-screening devices or sniffer dogs. A mere  200 grams of the chemical -- about 7 ounces -- is enough to blow an airliner  out of the sky. Tragically, it's been used to do just that.  </P> <P> Residues of Semtex were found in the wreckage of a French UTA DC-10 that  exploded over Niger in 1989, killing 170 people. Security experts say Semtex  destroyed Pan Am's Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270  people. Czechoslovakia is the sole manufacturer of Semtex. In the 1980s, its  Communist regime sold Libya 1,000 tons of the stuff. Dictator Moammar Kadafi  didn't buy all that Semtex to blast tree stumps out of the desert. Instead,  Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist President Vaclav Havel now confirms, Kadafi  gave much of it to terrorists. Hundreds of innocent people died as a direct  result.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia is now out of the Semtex exporting business, but, unhappily,  terrorists aren't out of Semtex. Havel calculates that there is enough in  hostile hands to present a threat for decades to come. This is only one of  probably many revelations about the extent of past Communist links with  terrorism that can be expected to see the light of day as Communist rule in  much of Eastern Europe comes to an end.  </P> <P> The files of the security and intelligence services of East Germany,  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- assuming they aren't destroyed -- could  prove to be especially revealing. All of these countries are known to have  given training and equipment to terrorists and facilitated their clandestine  travel. In some cases it's clear that Communist secret services worked  intimately with other regimes to provide such aid. East Germany's notorious  Stasi, for example, is believed to have cooperated closely with Syria to aid  terrorist activities in Western Europe. What's emerging as the East European  world changes is the good chance that a bonanza of information and insights  about terrorism could soon become available, even as the networks that  terrorists could once count on in these countries are shut down. The bad guys,  for a change, would be going on the defensive.  </P></p>

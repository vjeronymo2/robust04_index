			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHEN RADIO STATIONS CHANGE THEIR TUNE  </P> <P> Let me start by saying that I regularly read and enjoy (Joseph Bell's) columns.  (Not everyone in Orange County is a conservative.)  </P> <P> Your March 22 column on the demise of KFAC and the changes at KKGO hit a  particularly sensitive nerve, hence this rare letter. Radio station programmers  around here are beginning to act like auto designers in Detroit. They don't  listen to their consumers; rather, they put out what they think we'll like and  what they think will make oodles of money from them.  </P> <P> I used to have three well-used buttons on my car radio, each set at a favorite  station. Until recently. One was on KEDG because they played the best of the  new rock music, as opposed to dance or rap music. One was on KFAC, for the  classical music. And one was on KKGO, for jazz of the older variety.  </P> <P> Life was wonderful for a while. I could listen to some good new rock music, and  when traffic was bad and I didn't want to get into an overly aggressive mood, I  could listen to classical or some smooth jazz and drift along our freeways.  </P> <P> But then KEDG dropped an amazingly fine rock music format and became one of  those Muzak style light rock stations. KFAC, of course, became the zillionth  rock station on the dial (as you so aptly put it). And KKGO, in attempting to  fill the classical vacuum, dropped jazz.  </P> <P> Now I have only the classical music, which I can't always get here in south  Orange County. KUSC isn't often receivable here in swallow country, either. The  management at KKGO has tried to convert people to an AM jazz outlet, but you  can't get that down here, and it's not a nice clean stereo signal when you  can't receive it successfully. KLON in Long Beach is no alternative, since its  signal is so weak. And KSBR at Saddleback College tends to play more fusion and  New Wave music than what I consider to be real jazz.  </P> <P> I think you're right. Perhaps we should all volunteer to pay $100 a year for a  new jazz outlet as well as a classical one. I'd gladly pay $300 a year to have  my three old stations back. Is this progress? How'd you like to start a new  station here in Orange County?  </P> <P> Don Allen,  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

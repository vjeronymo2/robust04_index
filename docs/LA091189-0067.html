			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION ON THE MOVE;  </P> <P> IN-CAR VIDEO SCREEN SMALL BUT CRITICS QUESTION SAFETY  </P> <P> In the near future, motorists may see something entirely new when they look at  their windshields -- a television show that appears to float above the road. It  may sound farfetched, but Jay Schiffman, an electrical engineer at Auto Vision  Associates in Ferndale, Mich., has recently received a patent for a device that  could make it possible.  </P> <P> Called AutoVision, the video system consists of a tiny mirror positioned on the  windshield above the driver's line of sight to reflect the picture shown by a  small projector located near the dome light. "The whole thing depends on the  size, position, and the shape of the mirror," Schiffman said. "It is small  enough to see around, mounted high enough on the windshield to see under, and  the curve of its surface creates the illusion that the television image is  hovering about 15 feet in front of the car."  </P> <P> Beyond the feasibility of the technology, the obvious question of the safety of  a car TV is already being debated by experts. The consensus so far is that the  device appears to be safe but is not without potential dangers.  </P> <P> Its safety hinges on the optical illusion it creates, called a "virtual image"  by psychologists, which makes AutoVision's TV image seem to be just another  part of the landscape. It is as if a small piece of the scenery had been cut  out and a television screen put in its place. The illusion also makes the  picture seem much larger than it actually is, allowing the driver to watch the  screen comfortably without it monopolizing his attention.  </P> <P> In addition to whatever else the driver wishes to view, a small video camera  mounted near AutoVision's projection unit is pointed at the dashboard and feeds  the projector. The device is used to display a picture of the dashboard onto  the screen. By selecting this option, drivers can check their speed, adjust the  air conditioning, or even tune the radio without taking their eyes off the  road. This type of readout, known as a "head-up display," has been used on jet  fighters for over 30 years, and is claimed to make the operation of supersonic  aircraft safer by allowing pilots to check their instruments while still  watching where they are going.  </P> <P> People who have tested AutoVision say the matchbook-size mirror blocks far less  of the windshield than the sun visor and is no more distracting than the  overhead signs on a highway. However, the real magic of this invention may be  the fact that it concentrates driver attention on the road ahead. "The view of  the road surrounding the television image always remains in focus," the  inventor said, "and a driver whose interest is captured by what is going on in  front of the car is not likely to let his eyes wander off the road."  </P> <P> The panel of independent psychologists and traffic safety specialists now  evaluating the device for AutoVision generally agree that there is little  danger in having the mirror on the windshield. However, some members of the  group have stressed the need for further research on what images should be  shown and under what conditions the device should be used.  </P> <P> "I would have no objection to using this device to display a picture of the  dashboard," said Dr. Herschel Leibowitz, an experimental psychologist at  Pennsylvania State University, who has tested AutoVision. "I can even see how  the television function might be beneficial in stimulating drivers who are  bored and in danger of falling asleep. However, misuse might be dangerous,  especially if the driver was drinking, or was distracted in heavy traffic or  with pedestrians present."  </P> <P> The objection that watching television while driving will distract drivers and  delay their reactions is the most common criticism of AutoVision. But Schiffman  said, "We have been testing AutoVision for several years, and over 200 people  have driven the prototype cars a total of 175,000 miles without a single  incident. Our experience and research have shown that when a person watching  AutoVision sees a potential hazard in the same visual area as the screen, he  automatically shifts his attention to the problem. The first call of mankind is  to preserve its own skin. It is a natural reaction."  </P> <P> A driver can watch AutoVision and drive at the same time because most of the  information needed to follow a television program comes from the audio portion  of the broadcast. "You do a sort of time sharing, and actually look at the  screen only a small fraction of the time," explains the inventor. "But even  when you glance at the picture to fill in some details, everything on the road  ahead remains in full view and completely in focus."  </P> <P> The idea for AutoVision first came to Schiffman while he was doing research on  head-up display units designed for aircraft. In order to discover how these  displays might be distracting to pilots, he installed one in a panel truck and  began driving with it. "The electronics for that first unit took up almost the  entire back of the truck, and while the research I wanted to do was never  funded, I did discover that if I put the right type of image in the right  location, I could safely drive while watching television."  </P> <P> As his work progressed, and with the advent of transistors and printed  circuits, Schiffman reduced the dimensions of the projection unit to the size  of a book.  </P> <P> He also developed other types of head-up displays, such as the Bendix Blind  Landing System (to which he holds the patent), a device that allows pilots  flying in fog to see an electronically generated image of the runway they are  approaching. But even with this impressive background, he had to work at  convincing scientists, traffic officials and investors that his invention was  practical. "Most of them found the idea of AutoVision hard to believe, but when  I got them in a car and let them drive with it, they immediately saw its  possibilities."  </P> <P> Schiffman believes that the story of AutoVision could very well parallel that  of the car radio. In 1929, Bill Lear (later of jet aircraft fame) presented his  boss, Paul Galvin, with the first radio designed for use in an automobile.  Galvin's immediate response was, "They'll never be allowed in cars. There will  be laws against them." But Lear was determined, and despite predictions from  traffic authorities in Washington that there would be nationwide bans on car  radios, his invention was a success and formed the basis of what would later  become the Motorola Corp. Some cities actually did pass laws against using  radios while driving, but every one of these laws was eventually repealed, and  today 95% of all cars are equipped with a radio.  </P> <P> With 300 million motor vehicles now operating worldwide and 30 million new cars  being built each year, the economic possibilities for AutoVision are enormous.  </P> <P> "If the safety issues are resolved, the market for AutoVision should be similar  to the one for car stereo systems," said Ron Pherigo of the American  Electronics Assn. But others fear that this is another multibillion-dollar  industry that could be lost if the fear of liability suits forces the  technology overseas, to Europe or Japan, where few laws exist that would limit  the use of the device.  </P> <P> The safety consultants and traffic officials who have begun to evaluate  AutoVision believe that some form of the apparatus could be used in cars in the  near future. But no one is sure exactly what we will see when we look at that  tiny screen. Some recommend that video cameras be used to televise the blind  spots between a car's mirrors, while others suggest that maps could be  projected on the screen and the car's location plotted by satellite.  </P> <P> "I can imagine it being used as an entertainment device, but with carefully  defined programming," said Prof. D. Alfred Owens, a psychologist specializing  in human perception and traffic safety at Franklin and Marshall College. "This  device provides an opportunity to develop an entirely new mode of broadcasting  that considers the driver's situation and actually enhances driver attention."  </P> <P> If the television option is proved safe for widespread use, proponents say,  AutoVision will change the way we experience driving. It can make extended  trips seem shorter, calm people caught in traffic jams and even keep drivers  alert during long, boring trips.  </P> <P> "Everything we need to know about this device can be researched," Owens said.  "In fact, if you will pardon the pun, this new technology is going to drive us  to learn more about how humans operate automobiles."  </P></p>

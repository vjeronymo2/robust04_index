			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ACTIVE selling in stock index futures as dealers reflected on political developments in the UK sent the June FT-SE 100 contract into retreat, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract had a quiet start at 2,873, but a sell order within the first hour of business which was said to have come from UBS sent it falling to 2,868. Having been a strong performer for most of this week, June was now trading at a discount to cash and that fall also pulled the underlying cash market lower. Sellers continued to emerge for most of the morning, with some of the large US securities houses reported to have been among them, and the day's low of 2,852 was reached shortly after 11am. When the selling began to dry up, the June contract recovered to trade at parity at midsession. It was a firm gilts sector that traders looked to in the afternoon and that sentiment helped the contract claw back some of the earlier decline. June finished at 2,858, a 3-point discount to the underlying cash market, with turnover coming to 7,868 lots. In traded options, volume was down from Wednesday's hefty total. It reached 25,098 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 5,862 of that total and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 640 lots. Blue Circle was the busiest stock option, with a day's total of 2,648 contracts. It was followed by BTR at 1,431 lots.</p>

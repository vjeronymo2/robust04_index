			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LA FOLLETTE FAILS TO OUST WRIGHT FROM PANEL  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) said Monday after a meeting  of Republican lawmakers that she was unable to muster the votes necessary to  replace Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) on the powerful Assembly  Rules Committee.  </P> <P> La Follette described the situation as a standoff, with another meeting of the  Assembly Republican Caucus planned later this week or next to discuss the  issue. In the meantime, several GOP members are expected to continue to  pressure Wright to resign her committee seat, La Follette said. So far, Wright  has refused.  </P> <P> The 33-member GOP caucus last week narrowly voted to rescind Wright's  appointment to the committee because she had failed to follow the caucus  position to support a dissident Democrat, who last month challenged Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco).  </P> <P> Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run) said only about 20 of the GOP lawmakers  showed up for Monday's meeting. Statham said that if he were in Wright's shoes,  "I wouldn't let people push me around."  </P> <P> Wright did not attend the latest party caucus. Wright said she saw "no reason  for me to be there. I don't need any more Cathie bashing." She added that she  hopes her critics drop their challenge.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonin Rasek: "The Czech Army Has Been in </F> Existence for One Year"]    [Text] The Army of the Czech Republic is assessing the  first year of its existence. At the same time, however, it  cannot ignore the three preceding years. That adds up to four  years of transformation, reorganization, and redeployments. The  deployment of the Czechoslovak Army, in accordance with the  adopted defense doctrine, represented the most dynamic move in  its 75-year history. It was immediately followed by an  unprecedented step: the division of the Army into two  independent ones, and that in just a few months. It was not an  easy step for a federally organized, trained, and thinking  institution and its members. Nevertheless, the Army managed to  complete the task, not only in a respectable, but also in a  professional manner.  <H5>  Two Favorable Premises </H5>   The Czech Army is no longer the target of criticism it was  in  the first post-November years. It has two strong premises for  its further development: a new concept and an approved budget.    Moreover, the new concept of the Army is linked to a  relatively well thought out organizational structure. The Army  consists of two ground forces formations (with the command in  Tabor and Olomouc), a tactical air force formation, an air  defense formation, a rapid deployment brigade, and a logistics  formation. The strength of the Army is to be gradually reduced  to 65,000 men. It seems that in many respects the internal  structure of the Defense Ministry also corresponds to the  findings of modern theories of organization and management and  the experience of the armies of advanced democratic countries.  A certain excess in the strength of the logistics units is,  however, somewhat surprising (particularly if the low budget for  this sphere is considered) when the strategic and social  management branches seem to be lacking. Nor should the size of  the Defense Ministry and its directly subordinate bodies remain  outside future consideration.    A budget in the amount of 27 billion korunas -- or  approximately 2.7 percent of the gross national product -- was  approved for the Army. While this amount does not exceed 3  percent, it is in harmony with the neighbors and advanced  democratic countries. It must be noted, however, that in the  comparison with the armies of the Western countries, we are  comparing the incomparable on the absolute scale. Their budget  is actually several times higher, just as is their gross  national product. Nevertheless, we can only afford to  distribute what we have. Internal destabilization of the  country can be just as great a danger as an external threat.  Moreover, many prominent officials are inclined to further  reduce the Army budget in favor of the Interior Ministry because  the crime situation is the most criticized sphere of the state  executives' operation. After all, it cannot be overlooked that  many citizens doubt the need for an army in general.    Considering the actual external security risks and dangers,  doing without the Army would be conceivable. Are we able,  however, to predict security development on a long-term or even  a shorter-term basis? Unfortunately, that is not possible in a  dynamically developing world and Europe. A combat-ready army,  then, certainly cannot be built from one day to the next. It  takes long years.    Given this situation, the responsible bodies and the  citizens  will demand that the Army's budget be used as effectively as  possible, and that it is reflected in the level of security and  defense, in the standard of training and discipline.  <H5>  The Criterion Will Always Be the Results </H5>   If fundamental, even if minimum, there are prerequisites for  the future of the Army and they must be applied. Because of  existing and expected risks, it seems that the formation of the  rapid deployment brigade has a certain priority. At the same  time, it will be a criterion for the command's ability to  gradually professionalize the troops.    Why is it a criterion? It is nothing new that professional  soldiers, objectively considered, have suffered social  insecurity for several years. It is objective because they  first served the totalitarian regime and, moreover, the Army has  traditionally considered the military profession to be a  life-long career. That completely contradicts, however, the  demands of military service and the experience of Western  democratic armies. Therefore the transformation of the Army  meant not only parting with those who seriously discredited  themselves under the past regime, but also the gradual creation  and implementation of a new service concept.    A certain personnel crisis in the Army is testified to by  the  statement by Defense Minister Baudys, for instance, in  connection with the possible filling of vacancies in the NATO  command in Brussels: Finding 30 to 40 able officers is a  tremendous problem.    The interest of young people in serving in the rapid  deployment brigade will show whether the social insecurity of  active duty soldiers has also affected the general atmosphere  about interest in the military profession. It is possible to  observe a rather uncontrolled process insofar as Army personnel  management is concerned, whereby those who should stay leave,  and those who should leave, particularly the older ones, remain.  This situation is certainly not helped by incessant  deliberation over which current benefits the professional  soldiers should lose. If we want to plan a professional army  for the future, we must expect it to cost something, and this  does not mean only direct expenditures on the Army, but also  rewarding those who served in the Army (a professional in the  U.S. Army, for instance, receives altogether more after his  transfer to the reserves than the pay he drew as an active duty  soldier).    The future of the Army of the Czech Republic is tied to the  development of NATO. This approach dominated the post-November  developments, and was reinforced more recently. NATO itself,  however, is searching for a profile and a new concept. It  certainly needs time for that. Nevertheless, due to dynamic  development in the postcommunist countries, time is a scarce  commodity. One of the reasons is the uneven progress of the  democratization process in these countries. It is precisely  because of this dynamics that some politicians, military  experts, and journalists considered the January Summit on the  issue of new membership premature.    Nevertheless, it took place, and that is a certain promise  for the future because the Partnership for Peace plan has  accepted, more or less emphatically, all relevant countries.    Because of its relatively better political and economical  situation, our republic attempted to get preferential treatment  in joining NATO. That testifies to a certain not very faithful  reflection of the existing situation. NATO, and particularly  the United States, probably do not differ on this; they prefer a  more coordinated approach of the Visegrad Four member countries.  <H5>  Relations With NATO </H5>   Therefore we were lined up from the start on the same level  with the others. The military aspects of approaching NATO can  play a more important part here, and the other countries have  apparently done better in the overall transformation of the  Army. Moreover, in counterpoint to us, they began to join  together, as demonstrated by a statement made by Polish  President Walesa during the Warsaw visit by Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky immediately after the talks in Prague:  Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia will find a common language. If  other countries in this part of Europe do not wish to follow the  same route at this time, they will learn later that cooperation  is advantageous.    We have certainly progressed in recent years in our  relationship with NATO -- in our mutual relations, exchanges,  the training of our soldiers at military schools in NATO  countries, etc. Nevertheless, NATO members do not focus only on  how membership would guarantee our security, but consider also  the contribution to the European Community. Therefore, they are  interested in the state of the armies of the former Warsaw Pact,  the quality of their training and arms, discipline, and, above  all, the reliability and quality of the leadership. At the  center of attention is, above all, the extent of civilian  control of the Army and who is entrusted with the Army command  (which is why we observed a certain anxiety in the West  regarding changes at the Polish Ministry of Defense etc.).  Similar critical reactions also appear in our media.    If the Czech Army is to guarantee the security, defense, and  sovereignty of the state, and thereby also democratic  development, it has a long way to go, particularly with respect  to internal democratic transformation.</p>

This was disclosed by Geng Zhaojie, general manager of the  China No. 1 Automotive Group, who is attending the ongoing  session of the National People's Congress.    "Red Flag" was first designed and produced in 1958 by the  No.1 automotive plant in Changchun in northeast China's Jilin  Province.    Some years ago, the plant stopped producing the oversized,  heavy limousine.    Designing of a new model began in 1991 and was completed  last  year, Geng said.    The new "Red Flag" is smaller than the old model, with two  rows of seats instead of three, as was the case with the old  model. Its body is shorter with an engine less than half the  size of that for the old "Red Flag."    The new model is also more fuel efficient with a high speed.  The new "Red Flag" will be cheaper than "Audi," a German car  being made by the same plant, Geng said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The police have accused the ANC [African National  Congress] of making a political issue of the raid on the ANC's  office at Woodstock in Cape Town.    A police spokesman, General Leon Mellett, said it was a pity  that the ANC had tried to politicize an incident in which the  police were pursuing a criminal suspect. He said the suspect  was being sought in connection with three murders, eight  attempted murders, and the possession of explosives and unlawful  firearms. The raid was carried out in response to information  that the man had been involved in a shooting with three  policemen in Khayelitsha. General Mellett said the ANC should  say why it had hindered the police in their search of the  building.</p>

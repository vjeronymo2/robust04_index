			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent begins to recover from sharp declines The rise in German January M3 data took the markets by surprise, although a figure of around 13 per cent had been estimated by some economists, writes Our Markets Staff. The opinion among strategists yesterday regarding the fallout in equity prices was that traders had made an instinctive and uninformed reaction to the M3 figures based on the view that they suggested, at first glance, that inflation was on the rise again in Europe. However, Mr Richard Taylor of NatWest Securities said that the fundamental picture remained unaltered: inflation was not a worry in Europe and interest rates would continue to decline. This view was repeated by Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs who said that while short term volatility might well continue, on a 12 to 18-month view equities would continue to perform well. Mr Anthony Thomas at Kleinwort Benson responded to present turmoil by reducing exposure to France and Belgium, two interest rate-sensitive markets, and increasing weightings in the more defensive and dollar sensitive Switzerland and the Netherlands. 'We would accept that the domestic fundamentals remain positive, but would not be in a hurry to buy as the upheavals in the US have some way to go,' he said. Mr Thomas remained very positive on Italy, as a political reform play, and on Sweden and Finland, for their cyclical companies which are on attractive ratings with good earnings visibility. FRANKFURT was buffeted from the start as the market reacted nervously to the M3 data and to overhanging worries that metal workers would vote to take strike action today. The Dax index finished the official session down 46.72 at 2,020.33, but off a low of 1,992.70, while the March Dax futures plummeted 58.5 to 2,004.5. With Wall Street's opening, post-bourse activity was also frenetic, with a further decline to the 2,000 level seen before a push upwards occurred in the last hour on some encouraging US data, leaving a 2,018.68 close. Turnover was DM8.2bn. There were suggestions late yesterday that the Bundesbank could well make a cut in interest rates at its regular council meeting today. Among the day's fallers, Hoechst lost DM10.70 to DM292.50, Daimler DM16.50 to DM778.50, Deutsche Bank DM20.50 to DM781.00 and Dresdner Bank DM15.70 to DM401.00. Thyssen managed to resist the steep declines felt elsewhere, losing DM1 to DM252, helped by news that the government had given the go ahead for the Transrapid high-speed rail link between Hamburg and Berlin. ZURICH saw further foreign selling which left the SMI index 80.8 lower at 2,766.6, for a cumulative fall of 5.6 per cent this week and 15.3 per cent since the market peaked on January 31. Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that foreigner sellers were picking up currency gains along with accumulated profits on shares that they sold. He added that domestic institutions were beginning to return as selective buyers as prices dipped. Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers down SFr38 to SFr1,262, taking the cumulative loss since last Friday's results to SFr12.6 per cent. CS Holding dipped SFr19 to SFr616 as investors awaited tomorrow's figures from Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank. Investors marked Roche certificates SFr250 to SFr6,650, registering disappointment that the shares had not managed to hold above the SFr7,000 level on Tuesday. Among speculative issues, Motor Colombus shed SFr145 or 9.9 per cent to SFr1,400. PARIS recovered some of its early falls as domestic institutions were seen re-entering the market. The CAC-40 index, having been off some 4 per cent during the session, picked up to close the day down 38.46 at 2,144.66. Turnover was FFr8bn. Investors were watching UAP, soon to be privatised, the shares slipping FFr5.80 to FFr186.70. The government said that privatisation would not be affected by the recent volatility in the markets. Among other newly privatised companies, Rhone-Poulenc lost FFr4.50 to FFr133.20, after a low of FFr128.30, Elf Aquitaine FFr5.90 to FFr400.60 and BNP 80 centimes to FFr263.20. AMSTERDAM's losses accelerated during the day, the AEX index closing down 8.67 at 407.27. Philips fell Fl 1.50 or more than 3 per cent to Fl 46.00 ahead of today's results, while DSM dropped Fl 3.10 to FL 107.60, also with results pending today. Akzo Nobel slipped Fl 7.00 to Fl 203.60. BolsWessanen shed Fl 1.10 to Fl 42.20 after reporting a 26 per cent decline in 1993 profits. MILAN picked up from its lowest levels leaving the Comit index to finish 9.89 lower at 639.35. BCI held its loss to just L9 at L6,017 in response to news last on Tuesday that its sell-out privatisation had closed three days early. But Ambrovento fell L206 or 4.2 per cent to L4,713 in a correction after recent strong gains which followed its 1993 figures. Domestic selling of some of the traditionally foreign favourites left Olivetti L43 at L2,290 and Sip L90 down at L3,957. Fiat dipped L59 to L4,633, helped by rumours that sales figures for its new Punto model were positive. MADRID picked up from intraday lows which left the general index down 7.52 at 325.16. Telefonica lost Pta55 or 2.9 per cent to Pta1,835 as investors continued to look unvarourably on its Dollars 2bn foreign venture in Peru.

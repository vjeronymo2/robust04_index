			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / SA right affirms hard line: Efforts to avert election boycott make no progress The murder of 15 African National Congress election campaigners at the weekend cast a shadow over preparations for South Africa's first all-race poll, while constitutional negotiations aimed at averting a right-wing election boycott appeared to have foundered. An important session of multi-party constitutional talks will go ahead today to pass final amendments to the 1993 constitution in an effort to accommodate the right wing by strengthening the powers of regional governments and creating the possibility of an Afrikaner homeland after the elections. The African National Congress is to hold last-minute meetings with two of the three members of the right-wing Freedom Alliance - the government of the black homeland of Bophuthatswana and the Afrikaner Volksfront - before today's session, but negotiators were not optimistic. They said it appeared that the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi would not accept the amendments, and prospects for persuading the other two groups to contest elections were also slim, though some moderate members of each group might split from their hardline leaders. This would weaken the right politically, but might not substantially affect right-wing opposition to elections. The risks of failure were highlighted when two 12-year-olds, 10 teenagers and three young adults were shot and stabbed to death on Saturday before an ANC voter-education drive in the rural Natal village of Creighton. Local ANC chairman Harry Gwala blamed supporters of Chief Buthelezi, who is campaigning for a boycott of the election. In a fighting speech yesterday to some 20,000 supporters the chief told his supporters they might have to die for their beliefs. He vowed never to submit to ANC dominance, saying an ANC government would oppress his people more cruelly than the white apartheid government had done. 'It is far more noble to resist evil and die if necessary for what you believe in than to live in chains,' he said. Chief Buthelezi is not alone in his opposition. Mr Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, warned in an address on Saturday that he would accept nothing less than self-determination for his Batswana tribe. 'If this means an intensification of the long-running campaign to. . . topple my government then we will fight fire with fire,' he said. Mr Mangope and Chief Buthelezi have joined forces in the Freedom Alliance with white conservatives including former army chief Constand Viljoen's Afrikaner Volksfront. The Afrikaans newspaper Rapport said yesterday it had documents detailing AVF plans for a civil war if the election goes ahead, although the AVF said these were not genuine.</p>

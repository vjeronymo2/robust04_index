			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A REASONABLE PLAN FOR MASS TRANSIT IN COUNTY  </P> <P> In regard to the editorial on Jan. 8, here we go again, another new study on  "the rail system" or better named "how to sell a sales tax increase"! It is a  shame that these two issues cannot be separated so we can get into the 21st  Century with some reasonable plan for mass transit.  </P> <P> Here are some of the issues that need to be addressed in the "study." Is the  Pacific Electric right of way the best route? Will it serve the public and get  them where they want to go, and is there a large enough adjacent population for  it to be effective?  </P> <P> Are there better alternatives, such as: the Amtrak lines that have track and  stations in place (50% of the county's population lives within 1 1/2 miles of  this line)? Or down the 22 Freeway to the San Gabriel River to the Century or  91 freeways (this line could be built as a monorail with park-and-ride lots  that could be constructed for rail, bus and car-pooling), or along the 5  Freeway? The use of the Pacific Electric right of way for rail transportation  would disrupt existing streets.  </P> <P> Disruption of the Garden Grove residential neighborhoods would occur. Just  because Orange County might want the Pacific Electric line, does Los Angeles  County have the same interest? If the line is developed underground, the costs  escalate dramatically. If it stays at grade or is elevated, there will be an  impact on the adjacent homes.  </P> <P> I rode the Red Car to work in the 1950s. I understand it sounds like a good  idea to reconstruct it, but we will soon be in the 21st Century, and there must  be a better solution than turning the clock back to the turn of this century.  Most all the points cited above have been addressed in past studies. Let's not  make this into another study to sit on someone's shelf like the jail or airport  studies. Let's not waste $500 million to $1 billion just to sell the sales tax.  Let's pick a system to serve the people and move into the 21st Century.  </P> <P> RAYMOND T. LITTRELL  </P> <P> Councilman,  </P> <P> City of Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Budget package close to being passed PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's budget package headed yesterday for final passage after the House and the Senate agreed to reconcile their different versions of the bill. This paved the way for voting on the broad framework of Mr Clinton's budget proposals before Congress breaks up this weekend for the Easter recess. However, some members of Congress said the budget could unravel in the summer when a more detailed bill will be drawn up, because of President Clinton's controversial decision to remove a provision to end government subsidies to ranchers and mining companies in the West. This followed pressure on the White House by western senators who lobbied against a planned increase in fees for the exploitation of federal lands in the west to something approaching market levels. The plan would have raised fees charged to ranchers who graze their cattle on federal lands, and charged royalties from companies for minerals extracted from government lands. Administration officials say the fees and royalties will still be imposed in a separate initiative, but some congressmen were furious at the climbdown, and said the move would encourage other lobbyists to pick away at the bill. 'This is a fundamental mistake by the administration,' said Congressman George Miller, chairman of the House of Representatives Natural Resources committee. Congressional aides say the climbdown contradicts Mr Clinton's plea to members of congress to take his plan as a whole. The detailed budget reconciliation bill, which will flesh out the budget resolution bill, in the summer, was always expected to be a hard fight, as Congress's enthusiasm for deficit reduction came face to face with the realities of cutting individual, favourite programmes. The success of the western senators may mean members are less willing to submerge their local concerns.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Court rejects appeal to reverse Israeli expulsion of Palestinians ISRAEL'S High Court last night rejected appeals to force the government to reverse its expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon as the army again threatened to open fire if the deportees made further attempts to return to Israeli-held territory. A seven-judge panel ruled against petitions from civil rights lawyers that Israel had a responsibility to take back the alleged Islamic fundamentalist militants because Lebanon had refused to accept them, and because their lives were in danger as they were stranded in no-man's land between Israeli and Lebanese forces. The decision was not a surprise. But Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said it was a further 'heavy blow' to Middle East peace talks which the Palestinians say they will boycott until the deportations are reversed. Mr Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian president, said he regretted the deportations but said the peace talks should continue. In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said he would send Mr James Jonah, an under-secretary general from Sierre Leone, to Israel for talks with the government. The deportees yesterday returned to the makeshift camp they set up soon after they were expelled last Thursday. Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, the army chief of staff, told the High Court they could face warning shots if they tried to return to Israeli lines. Extra Israeli troops were sent to the area and the road to Israeli-occupied areas of south Lebanon was mined and blocked. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, told a meeting of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee that he had authorised the use of live fire, which reporters at the scene said injured at least two of the deportees. 'To the best of my knowledge, not one person was hurt,' Mr Rabin asserted. The prime minister will today come under pressure from government ministers to take balancing measures to offset the damage to Middle East peace talks caused by the deportations row. A meeting of senior Labour party figures will hear calls for Mr Rabin to open an unprecedented direct dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Rabin is unlikely to sanction talks with officials from the PLO's Tunis headquarters but he might consider talks with Mr Faisal Husseini, the senior PLO-associated figure in the occupied territories who has been barred by Israel from attending the peace talks.</p>

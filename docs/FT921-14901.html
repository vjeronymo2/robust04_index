			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind dismisses fears over rail links - Transport A FRESH row over British Rail blew up in the Commons yesterday as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, denounced a report saying dozens of towns and cities might lose InterCity rail links after privatisation as 'bogus'. The report, which had been seen by Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, was said to have been an internal BR document. Mr Wilson reiterated yesterday that he had no doubt as to its authenticity. Mr Rifkind accused the Labour spokesman of passing the document to the press and raised the question of whether or not the Opposition was aware that it was not genuine. 'What the public would like to know is whether the Opposition . . . were aware this was . . . something prepared no doubt for political purposes,' he said. In a personal letter to Mr Wilson, Mr Rifkind referred to remarks made by Sir Bob Reid, the BR chairman, in a separate letter. He quoted Sir Bob as saying: 'This is not a British Railways document. Nor, can I assure you, has a document of this sort been commissioned by the board.' Mr Rifkind concluded: 'It therefore appears that this whole story was based on a bogus document.' The government is pressing for improved safety standards on ferry services, which have been internationally approved, to be implemented more quickly, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, shipping minister, said yesterday. He gave a warning that Britain might consider unilateral action if international agreement on speeding up the process could not be reached.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Egypt presses Israelis on talks ISRAEL announced a concession on Middle East peace talks last night after a visit at short notice by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel had agreed that Palestinians from outside the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip could take part in regional talks that run in parallel to the main peace negotiations. But the Palestinians must not be members of the Palestine National Council or from East Jerusalem, Mr Peres added. The shift was seen as a gesture towards improving the atmosphere at the bilateral negotiations under way for almost a year between Israel and, respectively, Syria, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon. On his return to Cairo Mr Moussa said he expected the Israeli team negotiating self-rule with the Palestinians to be given new orders to push the talks forward. Mr Moussa apparently made an effort to persuade Israeli leaders to make commitments to withdraw from occupied Arab lands as a way to ensure progress at the peace negotiations, which are due to resume in Washington later this month. 'We are trying to build confidence,' Mr Moussa said.</p>

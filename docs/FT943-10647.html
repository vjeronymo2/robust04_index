Of the extra DM10bn, over DM6.6bn will be used as subsidies, financial incentives and support for the privatised sector and other investment projects. The remaining DM3.4bn will be allocated to the Treuhand privatisation agency. However, Mr Echternach warned that overall public subsidies next year would decline by 10 per cent to DM19bn.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Life Style postpones float in weak market The tumbling stock market claimed another new issue victim yesterday when the flotation of Life Style Care, the nursing home group, was postponed. Albert E Sharp, the company's sponsor, had been marketing the shares to institutions for a couple of weeks and the issue was set to be priced next week. 'The reaction from institutions was very positive but in view of the incredibly volatile market conditions it was decided it was not the right climate to go ahead,' the company said. Several new issues were pulled last week and sponsors are now looking hard at some companies in their pipelines. 'I would be very surprised if all ours went ahead on schedule,' said one corporate broker. Life Style Care, which has 14 homes with 564 beds, was planning a Pounds 10m share placing which would have valued it at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m. The family of Mr Ramesh Sachdev, the founder, which owns 85 per cent of the equity, was looking to sell about Pounds 2m worth of shares with the rest of the money going to the company to pay off borrowings. Life Style Care, which specialises in caring for the elderly mentally infirm, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m on turnover of Pounds 5.3m in the year to last June.</p>

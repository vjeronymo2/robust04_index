			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Labour tax proposals seen as an employment levy and likely to hit property prices and feed inflation (2) Sir, The effect of the proposal by Labour to raise income tax at the top marginal rate to 50 per cent and to impose national insurance on above average earners will be dramatic. Domestic property values will fall, as home buyers would not be able to service such high mortgages. The take-up of services such as private education, medical insurance and pensions would be reduced. Sales of cars, consumer goods and holidays would fall, affecting other sectors of the economy. In order to ameliorate the effect of such dramatic reductions in post-tax incomes, employers would have to concede inflationary pay rises. By way of example, if a married man's salary of Pounds 59,736 rose to Pounds 76,234, his post-tax income would increase by only Pounds 1,257. Mr Kinnock would therefore need almost all the salary rise which would come with his elevation to prime minister, to compensate him for the increase in taxes which his chancellor would impose. The salaries quoted are those for the leader of the opposition and for the prime minister. Gerard Tyler, 25 Midhurst Avenue, Muswell Hill, London N10</p>

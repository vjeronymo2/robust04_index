			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Spirits help Allied-Lyons advance Allied-Lyons, the UK-based drinks, food and retailing group which is paying Pounds 740m for control of the Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks producer, yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 606m. The figure, struck after Pounds 26m of additional pension costs, compares with Pounds 505m the previous year when profits were reduced by Pounds 64m of restructuring charges. Currency movements added Pounds 6m. Excluding the charges, pre-tax profits increased by 9 per cent in the year to March 5 on turnover up 4.9 per cent at Pounds 5.53bn. Earnings per share benefited from a lower tax charge and advanced 25.1 per cent to 36.7p. A final dividend of 14.9p raises the total from 21p to 22.2p, but the shares closed 4p lower at 559p. Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the year was one of 'solid performance in still tough market conditions' and added that the current year 'has started satisfactorily'. Gains in spirits and retailing, which contribute 80 per cent of group trading profit, offset a weak performance by the Carlsberg-Tetley brewing joint venture formed in December 1992. Overall trading profits increased by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 821m, reflecting the absence of restructuring costs. By far the biggest contributor was the Hiram Walker spirits division, which raised its profits by 5.1 per cent to Pounds 434m and widened its margins. In Scotch whisky, Ballantine's, the group's most important brand, maintained overall volumes with gains in duty-free sales, Greece and eastern Europe, offsetting lower volumes in Spain, France and Germany, while Teacher's volumes rose by 13 per cent. Beefeater gin continued to grow in Spain, duty free and in the UK where sales were up 25 per cent, but US volumes were affected by destocking and its total volumes were marginally lower. From today the Spanish group Domecq, which sells 19m cases of spirits and 5m of wine, will become part of the division. Retailing profits increased 7.2 per cent to Pounds 209m, with the group's pub companies which generate about 70 per cent of sector profits, increasing their contribution despite a reduction in average pub numbers by 403 to 4,279. Trading profits from the brewing division, which now includes the Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture, the group's Dutch Brewery and a 22.5 per cent stake in Britannia Soft Drinks, increased from Pounds 91m to Pounds 96m. However, Mr Peter Macfarlane, finance director, cautioned that like-for-like earnings from the joint brewing venture fell by 14 per cent. In the food manufacturing division Lyons' trading profits were slightly ahead at Pounds 87m (Pounds 86m). Lex, Page 22</p>

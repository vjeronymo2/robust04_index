			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SYMPHONY FLAILS MOZART UNDER GUEST CONDUCTOR  </P> <P> Contrasted with the elation of last week's San Diego Symphony performances  under music director-designate Yoav Talmi, the ethos of Thursday's symphony  concert was dispirited to say the least. Guest conductor Reinhard Peters, the  Berlin Philharmonic's permanent guest conductor, started the program  inauspiciously with a testy, unrefined reading of Mozart's "Jupiter Symphony."  Although Mozart is not the local orchestra's strong suit, it has seldom treated  poor old Amadeus with such careless, unsympathetic playing. Peters slashed away  as if he were beating a foe into submission, turning the usually sunny work  into a dour exercise.  </P> <P> Following the Mozart symphony with Chopin's First Piano Concerto may not have  been a programming stroke of genius, but at least it brought Cuban pianist  Juana Zayas into the picture. Her brilliant grasp of the concerto and her  refined sense of style exorcised the negative karma from Symphony Hall.  Especially in the concerto's shimmering middle movement, she waxed poetic  without a hint of indulgence. Her execution of a true Chopin rubato was  exemplary, as were her phrasing and articulation. She made the rondo dance with  the clarity of her rhythmic ideas. Fortunately, the orchestra managed to absorb  a modicum of her generous spirit in its accompanying role.  </P> <P> The longish first half was followed by Hindemith's symphonic extracts from his  opera "Mathis der Maler." Peters seemed much more comfortable with this  colorful orchestral showpiece, although his podium style still bristled with  busy, exaggerated movements. Most compelling was the orchestra's dramatic final  movement, "The Temptation of St. Anthony." Peters demanded bold declamation,  and the orchestra responded eagerly, especially the brass choirs, whose  burnished flourishes had the unwavering strength of a mighty cathedral organ.  </P> <P> Peters' interpretation of the opening movement, "Angelic Concert," lacked the  ethereal edge, that sense of awe the composer meant to instill as he depicted a  mystical panel from Matthias Grunewald's Isenheim altarpiece. These jaunty  angels sounded more like gamboling nymphs. Nevertheless, the orchestra pulled  together and redeemed the sins of the first half.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jordanian newspapers have for the second  day continued to extensively highlight various local, Arab, and  world reactions to the 25 February massacre at the Hebron  Ibrahimi Mosque. Statements made by various Jordanian and  Palestinian parties and organizations are either reported or  published in full. Condemnation of the massacre is overwhelming  and most published statements call on the Palestinians and Arabs  to pull out of the Arab-Israeli talks. Some call for jihad and  revival of armed struggle while others call for retribution and  revenge.    A statement by the "popular and political key figures" in  the  al-Tafilah Governorate, published as an advertisement on page 38  of the 27 February issue of Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic and signed  by four Jordanian parties and six al-Tafilah unions and  societies reads in part:    "At a time when the Arab regimes and the leadership  dominating the PLO are bargaining over Palestine, presenting it  to the Jews as an easy morsel through the conferences of  capitulation, the ugliest of crimes of murder, imprisonment,  banishment, and displacement are being perpetrated against our  people and brothers in Palestine.    "The crime perpetrated by the spiteful Zionist gangs against  the sons of our people in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, in  which approximately 400 Muslims were martyred or wounded,  confirms the criminal nature of these gangs -- the sons of  monkeys and pigs. In the name of the popular figures and  political parties in the al-Tafilah Governorate, which rejected  and continue to reject the policies of capitulation to the  Zionist entity, demand an end to the current negotiations with  the enemy on all levels and the adoption of jihad and struggle  for the liberation of Arab Palestine."    The advertisement is signed by the Islamic Action Front, the  Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian People's  Democratic Party, the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  al-Tafilah Cultural and Sports Club, al-Tafilah branch of the  Engineers Union, al-Tafilah Charity Society, al-Harith  Bin-'Umayr al-Azdi Society, al-Tafilah branch of the Jordanian  Red Crescent Society, and al-Tafilah branch of the National  Union of Jordanian Youth.    A statement by the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, published  within a report on other reactions on page 12 of the 27 February  issue of Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic says: "We in the Muslim  Brotherhood emphasize that the Hebron massacre, along with the  outcome of negotiations in Cairo and Taba where there is full  capitulation to the Zionists, confirm the course in which our  movement has always believed; namely, the escalation of armed  struggle and all forms of resistance against occupation as the  only option for the restoration of the usurped rights. Hence,  we call on the PLO and all the Arab states, particularly Jordan,  to immediately withdraw from the negotiations. We call on the  PLO to return to the option of resistance and armed struggle and  abandon the course of negotiations and concessions which left  nothing else to cede and which will open the door for the  Zionists to enter our Arab capitals to consecrate the state of  usurpation that is dominating the entire region.    While urging the masses of our Palestinian people and their  struggling forces, headed by the Islamic Resistance Movement,  Hamas, and its mujahid battalions to burn the ground under the  feet of the occupiers, we stress the need for the solidarity of  all sectors of our people and nation outside with their brother  mujahidin on the land of al-Isra' [Palestine]. We also call on  all popular, Islamic, and national bodies in the Islamic states  to express their indignation and denunciation of the appalling  crime. We also call for a continuous drive to raise funds for  the mujahidin in the territories to be undertaken by the Islamic  movements and popular forces in these states."    A statement by the Jordanian Democratic Arab Islamic  Movement  Party, published within the same report, but on page 13 of the  same issue of AL-DUSTUR calls for suspending negotiations with  "the Zionist enemy" and for holding an Arab summit conference in  Mecca during the next hajj season to boost Arab ties and draw up  a unified Arab strategy to extend unlimited support for the  people in the occupied territories and "reactivate national  struggle and jihad against the usurping enemy there."    A boxed statement published on page 15 of the 27 February  AL-DUSTUR reads as follows: "Urgent Appeal to Our Mujahid  Battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and to All Armed Groups of  All Palestinian Factions: Hamas calls on its jihad  battalions--the heroic battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and  all armed and military groups of the Palestinian factions to  reply and in the strongest possible manner to the ugly massacre  and avenge our righteous martyrs.    "Let all operating units in the mujahid al-Qassam battalions  and all struggling groups be placed on maximum alert and a state  of emergency be declared. Let urgent military plans be drawn up  to strike at the Zionist targets, the occupation troops, and the  hordes of settlers.    "Let today and all coming days be days of violent revenge  and  decisive reply to the ugly crime.    "God is greater than the machinations of the aggressor.    "Friday, 15 Ramadan 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 25  February  1994.    "The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Palestine, the  Information Bureau."</p>

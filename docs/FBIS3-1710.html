He stressed: The favorable factors -- right time,  geographical proximity, and harmonious relations between the two  peoples -- have brought China and Japan closely together.  China-Japan friendship is an irresistible historical tide.  China's development needs Japan's capital and technology, and  Japan's economic revitalization needs China's market and  resources. Only by strengthening our cooperation can our two  countries achieve our respective prosperity. When our two  countries proceed with our mutually beneficial cooperation on an  equal footing, we must resolve existing problems through mutual  understanding and friendly consultations so we can continue to  promote Sino-Japanese good neighborly relations and friendship.    Speaking at a breakfast given in his honor by Sanwa Group in  Osaka on 28 February, Zhu Rongji said: The economy of Japan's  Kansai areas is full of vitality. This has everything to do  with the continual development of cooperation with China. I  hope people in Kansai's economic circles will continue to take  the lead in developing China-Japan economic cooperation and  trade.

Kenji Kawakatsu, president of Sanwa Bank, and persons in  charge of a dozen or so other mainstay businesses of the Sanwa  group, repeatedly hailed the successes China has achieved in  reform and opening up.</p>

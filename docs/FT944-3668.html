			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat in global phone plan The owners of Inmarsat, the London-based satellite communications organisation, have approved plans to develop a Dollars 2.6bn worldwide mobile phone service. Inmarsat, which pioneered maritime voice and data services in the early 1980s, is owned by leading telecommunications organisations in some 75 countries, most of them state monopolies. Last week's decision, therefore, implies approval from a broad spectrum of governments. Finance still has to be found for the project. Each owner has until December 16 to decide whether to put up a share of the Dollars 1bn for the first phase. Inmarsat is in competition with other consortia. The most advanced is Iridium, in which Motorola, the US company, is the principal partner. It has completed its funding. Globalstar is being developed by Loral, the US defence group. A newcomer is Odyssey, which takes in TRW, the US aerospace manufacturer and Teleglobe, a Canadian telecoms services provider.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: New Seat head to take 'tough decisions' VOLKSWAGEN yesterday appointed Mr Juan Llorens, a well-known Spanish auto executive, to head Seat, its troubled Spanish car producer. He warned that he would take 'tough and unpopular' decisions to return the company to profits after estimated losses this year of Pta100bn (Dollars 738m). Mr Llorens, 56, is the chairman the Spanish Automakers Federation. He was deputy chairman of Enasa, a state-owned truck producer that was sold to Fiat, as well as board member of Seat between 1982 and 1986, the date when VW acquired the car manufacturer from INI, Spain's state holding company. He replaces Mr Juan Antonio Alvarez who resigned as Seat's chairman at the end of September when VW rejected his plans to slim the Spanish company's labour force by 5,000 jobs. VW has drawn up a viability plan for its Spanish subsidiary which foresees the closure of Seat's 40-year-old plant in Barcelona's Zona Franca area and the switch of its production to a new manufacturing plant. Seat is planning to shed 9,000 jobs. Mr Llorens said that Seat will 'continue as a separate company and not just as a factory'. This pledge addressed fears in Spain that the German group would absorb Seat outright, close down its trade mark and its design centre and use the Spanish company's remaining labour force to merely assemble VW vehicles. VW is hoping that as many as 2,000 Seat employees that are due to be made redundant will be rehired by the Spanish company's suppliers. Unions have opposed any closure of the Zona Franca factory in Barcelona and have imposed an overtime ban in Martorell, the new production base opened this year, and at Pamplona, Seat's third plant. Half-day protest strikes against VW's viability plans took place last week and a 24-hour stoppage is planned for next week.</p>

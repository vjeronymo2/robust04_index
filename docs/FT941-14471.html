			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Personal View: Why the west must plug Russia's gap In spite of the soothing voices of the experts, it is time to start panicking about Russia. There is still time to stop the fascists from taking power. But if they do, the west will, at the very least, have to engage in an extremely expensive policy of containment. Just as a botched peace after the first world war led to the second, so a botched peace after the cold war will lead to a second cold war, unless Russia's transition to a reasonably prosperous and stable society is managed successfully. It is thus of vital western strategic interest to help Russians achieve this transition. The first thing to be done is to take western management of assistance to Russia out of the hands of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The international financial organisations can continue providing technical support for the reforms, but the key decisions must be political - it is unfair to ask international bureaucrats, however talented, to make decisions requiring them to bend, if not violate, the operating procedures of their institutions. Aid for Russia is politically motivated, and there should be little pretence it is otherwise. It should be large scale, of the order of Dollars 30bn a year for about five years, so that Russian voters will be clear that, if they vote in a fascist or nationalist-communist government, they will lose this aid and cause themselves significant economic loss. The aid should be in the form of grants - to avoid nationalist claims that Russia could improve its situation by repudiating its debt. Finally, it should be carefully politically targeted. The west as a whole can afford such expenditure, which amounts to some 7 per cent of total western defence expenditure, or one-fifth of 1 per cent of total western gross domestic product. It works out at about Dollars 50 (Pounds 30) per person a year. It is not true that such aid can make no difference to the situation in Russia. At the current exchange rate, Dollars 30bn would increase Russia's GDP by some 12 per cent. Russian healthcare expenditure totals about 3 per cent of GDP, while remaining social expenditure accounts for about 9 per cent. A priority must be to improve the living standards of Russia's officer class, which voted massively for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrat leader. Every married officer should be guaranteed a flat within five years. At present there are cases of full colonels with families living in squalid two-room accommodation inside hospitals. With 250,000 commissioned officers in the army, the programme would cost less than Dollars 10bn. A second vital western interest is to reduce the dangers of conflict on Russia's borders. This requires the economic, though not military, strengthening of Ukraine. The economic situation there is worse than in Russia, and economic and political collapse, which could suck in even a moderate Russian government, is a present danger. Ukraine claims to need some Dollars 7.5bn worth of Russian oil and gas a year. Financing much of this would strengthen Ukraine and help Russia economically. A similar situation, though on a smaller scale, holds in the Baltics. But the most important thing is to control Russia's inflation. For political reasons, though, this must be achieved with less structural change at the beginning of the stabilisation than has occurred in central Europe. Inflation must be controlled, because at 20 per cent a month it is politically disastrous for the incumbent government. Since prices do not rise uniformly, large changes in relative prices and incomes cause acute anxiety. High inflation was a big reason for the large vote for the authoritarian parties in Russia. Moreover, it is unimaginable that the kind of investment in new ventures which Russia needs if the economy is to improve will be forthcoming in such a chaotic environment. Unfortunately, Russia cannot learn to live with inflation through widespread indexation, as some other countries have, because of the huge amount of expenditure financed by the inflation tax (the cost of inflation to those holding money). This is some 25 per cent of GDP. Widespread indexation would eliminate the tax base of the inflation tax, accelerating inflation to astronomical levels. The solution is for western aid to fill the gap. Only in this way can Russia achieve the politically necessary reduction in inflation while avoiding the politically perilous structural shock which would otherwise result from the required massive cutting of subsidies to state enterprises.

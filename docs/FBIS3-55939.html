Bureaucracy is terrible.  Bureaucracy is essential. It recognizes no state boundaries,  has no fear of time, and is absolutely devoid of complexes. We  are afraid of it and curse it, we struggle and write pamphlets  against it, but we cannot do without it.    However, we have come to terms with the fact that the  bureaucrat, like any person, has his own interests and that he  very naturally directs his energies first and foremost into  defending and implementing his own tasks, and not, as we would  like, our tasks. It is here precisely that the nub of the  problem lies: The state and bureaucracy -- which is an integral  part of it -- are created to act on our interests, but the  personal and corporate interests of the people constituting the  state machine prevent this. It is impossible to eliminate this  contradiction. It can only be reduced to a greater or lesser  extent and, in as much as it is possible, made to benefit the  public. Agreed, this is not simple. But in order to do this it  is necessary to first of all to attempt to understand what  bureaucracy is, what its interests are, and how it acts on them.    Bureaucracy's chief resource is power. In the hands of an  official this resource is converted into other forms of capital.  But the most important law governing power is the urge of a  person or institution possessing power to increase it. Another  law may be added to this one, which can be called the "law of  conservation of power." According to it, officials acquire  power only at the expense of others.    In a democratic state -- consequently in Russia also -- the  people are the source of power. In any case this is what is  written in our Constitution. As a consequence of elections,  part of this power is vested in elected politicians -- deputies,  presidents, governors etc. The chosen politicians depend on the  people directly through the process of the elections, their  policies are for the most part public and kept in the sights of  the mass media. All this limits their power, restrains in some  measure their urge to increase it, and forces them to fit their  personal interests in with those of the voters.    However, public politicians' power is exercised with the  help  of the apparatus. Meaning that part of the power is transferred  to it. Officials in the apparatus are appointed, which means  that they depend on those who appoint them and have to work to  promote the interests, in addition to themselves, of those  politicians who appoint them. By now we have moved quite a long  way away from the public interest. Moreover the apparatus'  power is less public and therefore all the greater. It is  interesting that from the very first months of the Russian  Supreme Soviet's existence the habit developed of appointing  deputies to positions in the apparatus. This was particularly  widely practised last year. Once a deputy had become an  official he defended the corporate interest of his organ of  power and forgot about the voters.    Public politicians make up other organs of power (the  courts,  the executive branch of power, etc.) and transfer part of their  power to them. The latter, in turn, form their own apparatuses  giving rise to an army of state bureaucrats.    This is amazing. Every politician and department thinks that  by increasing their apparatus, the politician's or department's  power will also increase. But the opposite happens. A  politician's power is limited by other politicians' power and  powers. The power of a department (or branch of power) is  limited by other departments' power and powers. Therefore, a  politician's or department leader's power passes to his  apparatus without a change in the total amount of power.    An unjustified increase in the apparatus' size leads to  control over it being lost, which increases its power at the  expense of public politicians. As a result the power of the  people, which has temporally been transferred to public  politicians by elections, is concentrated in the hands of the  bureaucracy. This process may result in the usurpation of the  power of the people.    Our Russian bureaucracy has two aspects. Its first aspect is  the section of the old nomenklatura bureaucracy, which is  regenerating itself. It cannot get enough of adapting, usurping  power for itself, hiding its power, and strengthening it. It  religiously guards its corporate interests, makes its own  "rules," and inculcates them in its new recruits, corrupting  them with the advantages gained through keeping to them. This  bureaucracy knows how to be effective when defending its own  interests or when it has been given no way out and has been  forced to work in the interests of others, even those of the  public.    The second aspect of Russian bureaucracy is represented by  the new politicians who appeared at the end of the 1980's as a  result of the first open elections. The majority of them are  not politicians (in the Soviet meaning of the word) nor are they  officials. They are average-grade professionals from other  fields of endeavor. Having unexpectedly gotten into politics,  they brought with them a conviction that there are areas of  human endeavor that anybody can fathom if they add politics to  pedagogy and medicine.    An absence of professionalism may not be very significant  when coordinating public interests, which is usually what takes  place in legislative representative bodies. But in any other  area of power, especially in area of implementing practical  policy -- and the apparatus needs to handle this in particular  -- professionalism is essential.    For historical reasons, many recently recruited politicians  have lately been filling positions as officials in the  apparatus. Skipping the professional training essential to climb  the professional ladder, they have moved into important  positions. They have brought the hullabaloo of political  squabbles to the quiet corridors of power, turning the offices  of members of the apparatus into party headquarters. To  counterbalance this, similar processes have been taking place in  other offices where other officials, instead of performing their  state duties, have been carrying out political tasks to redress  the balance. The apparatus has been politicized right through.  It has begun to live for and tear itself apart over political  passions and has not only stopped working to carry out its "job  description" but also even to promote its corporate interests,  and by so doing has weakened the state power.    Politicians holding posts as officials have not become  officials and have not ceased to be politicians. Meaning that  they have used their power as members of the apparatus at every  opportunity to resolve their own personal political problems.  They have been able to do this all the more effectively because  the apparatus' power is for the most part hidden from outsiders  and is shameless in its choice of methods.    The overall result is that our bureaucracy with its two  aspects is extremely ineffective at carrying out socially  necessary and state tasks. Reforming it is a necessary  condition for survival. It is encouraging that we heard at the  Russian president's press conference evidence that these  problems are understood. Evidence not only of the intention to  reform the administration and government by reducing its staff,  but also of the establishment of a lasting dialogue between  those holding power and society, of the necessity of pursuing  public policies. Both are extremely important as they prevent  the bureaucracy from going unchecked and strengthening beyond  all bounds. No less important is a reliance on professionalism  in appointments which should reduce the proportion of  politicized personnel in the bureaucracy and their pernicious  effect on it.    The only problem, however consistent the Russian president  is  in putting his intentions into effect, is whether he has  sufficient power to reform the apparatus using the apparatus  itself when there is opposition from within it.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / New deal talks at Lloyd's likely The ruling council of Lloyd's of London is likely to discuss next month the possibility of a fresh out-of-court deal between lossmaking members and professional agencies they are suing, Mr Peter Middleton, the insurance market's chief executive, said yesterday. He reiterated that he and Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, were prepared to try to forge a new settlement offer - providing all sides believed it worthwhile. But he warned: 'The amount of court activity at the moment, involving Names and underwriters, suggests that we have not got that agreement at the moment.' His comments came amid speculation that Lloyd's leaders are stepping up the pressure on groups representing Names and the 'errors and omissions' insurers - out of whose funds successful claims for negligence would be paid  -to start discussions. One possibility being floated is of separate agreements being struck with different groups of Names. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule next week on whether the E&amp;O insurers should be forced to disclose how much cover was bought by the Lloyd's members and managing agencies facing legal action. Figures on the E&amp;O 'pot', which some estimates put at more than Pounds 1bn, give an idea of the maximum size of a new out-of-court settlement.</p>

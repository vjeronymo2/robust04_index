			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Lex Service spends Pounds 20m to boost Hyundai sales Lex Service, the UK's biggest vehicle distribution group, is spending Pounds 20m to carve out a larger slice of the UK car market for Hyundai, the South Korean car import franchise it controls in partnership with IM Group, a Japanese vehicle importer. Lex, which took over the Hyundai business late last year after losing its long-standing Volvo import franchise, has made a first-half loss of Pounds 800,000 on the South Korean franchise and expects to break even at best for the year as a whole. It has decided, however, to spend Pounds 20m to increase sales and strengthen the 170-strong dealer network on the basis of a new model programme and expansion plans by Hyundai, South Korea's biggest vehicle maker. Hyundai, whose output will this year exceed 1m vehicles for the first time, has said it intends to be a 2m-plus producer - and to join the world's top 10 vehicle makers - by the end of the decade. It is spending more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) on expanding capacity at three of its four plants. The Lex investment comes as Daewoo, another of South Korea's four main vehicle makers, is making final preparations for the launch of its vehicles in the UK at the start of next year. Kia, a third, is selling about 4,000 cars a year. Like Hyundai, each has ambitious plans for expansion and new models. The rapid expansion of the South Korean motor industry is causing concern to parts of the UK motor trade and industry, with some seeing parallels with the earlier development of the Japanese industry. In January the Lex/IM venture will start selling the Accent. Hyundai has spent Dollars 438m on bringing this small car to production to replace Excel models. A medium-size saloon, coupe and a multi-purpose vehicle are scheduled to form part of an expanding range in coming years. Mr Chon Sung Won, Hyundai's president, said the models would help to double Hyundai's European car sales to nearly 190,000 by the end of the decade. Last year 9,189 Hyundai vehicles were sold in the UK, down from a peak of more than 11,000 at the end of the 1980s. Sales and marketing activities this year have already paid off, in sales if not financial terms. The 9,320 vehicles sold in the eight months to the end of August represented a 30.6 per cent rise from the same period a year ago. Mr David Walker, managing director of the UK importer, said sales for the full year should be a record 13,000 to 13,500, with further steady increases later. He refused to predict what share Hyundai might eventually take in the UK market. Under a deal reached late last year Lex acquired a 50.1 per cent stake in Hyundai Cars (UK), with IM - which took on the Hyundai franchise in 1982 - holding the rest. The joint company has a three-year rolling contract with Hyundai.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / People: Electronic switches Lindsay Kennedy, formerly director of Comshare's US VAR channel operation, has been appointed UK md of TELEPARTNER INTERNATIONAL. ***** John Ferguson, formerly manager of NCR's UK product support centre, has been appointed divisional director, systems services. ***** Vincent De Gennaro, formerly sales and marketing director for Sybase Software UK, has been appointed md of SYBASE UK Ltd. ***** Matthew Wallis has been appointed UK general manager of MOTOROLA COMPUTER GROUP; he moves from Pyramid Technology. ***** Archie Thomas, formerly president of Altos Computer in Europe, has been appointed vice-president for European operations for WALL DATA. ***** Alan Barr, formerly sales director of General DataComm, has been appointed sale director, UK and Ireland for MOTOROLA CODEX. ***** Richard Bridge has been appointed director of product development for Modern Security Systems. ***** Chris Brooker, formerly systems director Europe of Unilever's Elizabeth Arden division, has been appointed UK systems director of NOBLE LOWNDES. ***** Aegis, the media buying company which has recently gone through a number of upheavals, has finally got a new finance director - Michel Lefebvre (left) - six months after the previous incumbent, Charles Stern, left to join United Newspapers. The interregnum has witnessed some of Aegis's darkest hours - the enforced departure of its chairman and chief executive, Peter Scott, a Pounds 20m rights issue which failed to interest the City, and a share price which has nosedived. Lefebvre, 45, who will join Aegis's board, will take up his new post on November 1. He holds degrees in civil engineering, and law and economics and is something of a polyglot, speaking English and Italian besides his native French. Formerly finance director of two divisions of Groupe Valeo, the auto parts manufacturer, Lefebvre has also done stints with Olivetti, Bendix and CII-Honeywell Bull. He joins Aegis at an interesting stage of its development. Aegis has just relocated the majority of its managerial functions from London to Paris, where he will be based. One of Lefebvre's main tasks will be to merge the financial management and reporting of Aegis, the holding company, with those of the operating companies in the Carat network throughout Europe.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts cuts losses BRISTOL SCOTTS unveiled preliminary figures for 1991 showing a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 770,000 to Pounds 562,000. The leisure and property group also revealed the agreed acquisition of the outstanding 87.6 per cent of Mount Street Fine Wine Company, a wholesaler and retailer of fine wine. Some 37 per cent of its trade is with Bristol Scotts. Terms of the offer are 645 Bristol shares for every 1,000 Mount Street, which puts a value of 60p on the shares and Pounds 822,000 on the whole capital. There is a cash alternative of 50p. Draft accounts showed that Mount Street incurred increased losses of Pounds 236,000 (Pounds 65,000) in the year to March 31. Bristol Scotts' turnover fell to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 13m) and trading profit to Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 1.21m), but a doubled contribution from profit on sale of investments and other income, and reduced interest charges enabled the loss to be cut. Losses per share were 4.69p (11.73p).</p>

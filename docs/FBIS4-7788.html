			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Neither Military Bases Nor Accession"] </F>   [Text] "Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] wishes to join the program `Partnership for  Peace,' since under the conditions of historical passion and  grand appetites that have been ruling the Balkans, and Macedonia  being a small country, it sees its security in this NATO  program," said President Gligorov in his interview for Belgrade  weekly EKONOMSKA POLITIKA. In his interview, Mr. Gligorov speaks  extensively also of the Greek embargo, pointing out that its aim  is for Macedonia to accept the conditions given by Athens, which  leads to identity loss of a nation and to destabilization of the  region. He rejects the thesis that the Americans want Macedonian  military bases to be given up to them in compensation for $1  million. He also decidedly rejects the thesis that Washington  requests Macedonia to join any of the state creation that are  being formed on the territory of former Yugoslavia.</p>

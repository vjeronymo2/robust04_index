			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: BMW paid Honda Pounds 200m for Rover stake BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, has paid Honda Pounds 200m (Dollars 310m) for the Japanese carmaker's 20 per cent stake in Rover, bringing the total cost of its takeover earlier this year of the leading UK car producer to Pounds 1bn. Details of the financial transactions between BMW and Honda were revealed for the first time yesterday with the publication of the Japanese carmaker's first-quarter results. It was also disclosed that Honda paid BMW Pounds 74m to buy back the 20 per cent stake that Rover previously owned in Honda of the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's UK assembly plant in Swindon. According to the Honda figures, the net cost to BMW of unravelling the cross-shareholdings between Rover and Honda totalled Pounds 126m. The one-off gains from the Rover transactions helped to more than double Honda pre-tax profits in the first quarter (April to June) of its 1994-95 financial year to Y32.2bn (Dollars 327m) from Y15.3bn a year earlier including a Y14.6bn gain from the Rover deal. Net profit almost quadrupled to Y23.1bn from Y6.1bn, including a Y12.8bn gain from the sale of the Rover hold-ing. Honda's operating profit for the quarter increased by 15.8 per cent to Y25.8bn from Y22.3bn a year earlier. Cost-cutting efforts saved Honda Y19.5bn, but the yen's strength against the dollar reduced operating income by Y26.5bn. Honda turnover for the three months to the end of June rose by 5.8 per cent to Y973.1bn from Y919.6bn in the corresponding period a year ago. The group's results were supported by a strong performance in the US, where its car sales volume (the Honda and Acura brands) has risen by 15.1 per cent in the first seven months this year.</p>

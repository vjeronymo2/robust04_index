			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / US slowdown in orders fuels Wall St fears THE US Commerce Department yesterday reported a 3.7 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods between February and March, fuelling anxiety on Wall Street that the pace of US economic recovery is slowing. The figures unsettled investors because they follow a string of weaker than expected statistics, including sharp declines in retail sales and housing starts last month and flat industrial production. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 15.40 points at 3413.77. The decline in orders was the largest in 15 months and broadly based - affecting transport, primary metals, industrial machinery and electrical equipment. However, the series is notoriously volatile. Orders rose 2.2 per cent in February and by 3.5 per cent in the first quarter as a whole relative to the fourth quarter of last year, which saw a robust expansion of orders. Many forecasters have shaved their projections for the first quarter to show growth at an annual rate of about 2.5 per cent, sharply lower than the 4.7 per cent annual rate registered in the fourth quarter of last year. A pick up towards 3 per cent, however, is widely expected later in the year. 'The figures are consistent with a recent pattern of slower industrial growth that reflects more than bad weather,' said Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The group projects growth of just over 2.0 per cent in the first quarter. Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said he had cut his growth forecast sharply partly because of the adverse impact on the economy of the more rapid decline in defence procurement ordered by the Clinton administration to make room for higher civilian spending. The slow pace of job creation has also contributed to weaker consumer confidence than envisaged at the end of last year when spirits were temporarily lifted by President Clinton's election victory.</p>

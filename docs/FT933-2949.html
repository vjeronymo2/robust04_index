			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: An anxious 'Romeo and Juliet' Romeo and Juliet opens the autumn season at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre with Coward's Blithe Spirit and Pinter's Old Times to come before the year's end. The Rep under Bill Alexander is allowing drama to bear its part alongside dance and contemporary music in Birmingham's rejuvenated arts. A solid Romeo and Juliet directed by Gwenda Hughes consolidates the company's gains over the last six months: this is dependable without being inspired, but fresh enough not to be predictable. The production's greatest asset is Robert Jones's wonderful static set of sumptuous blue hangings fretted with gold, as if Romeo had died and Juliet had indeed cut him into little stars. The hangings fall from a Hawksmoor ceiling frame which moves down to create the claustrophobic interiors in which most of the action takes place. The floor is blue and gold, and pillars lead the eye to the mural of Verona at the back of the stage. But the scope of the set strains the action by spreading it out. The strength of last year's RSC Romeo was that it created intimate spaces on a large stage. Here, Hughes likes to keep distance between characters, and this slows both the verse and the action, with mid-line pauses while actors cross the spaces between them. The two hour's traffic promised by the prologue is more like an M40 jam tailing back three and a half hours, even in this lightly cut version of the 1595 text. The verse speaking, too, needs to be more natural and less deliberate. There is a tendency to reach for the excitement and pace that the verse gives naturally. This straining means that lines are artificially raised at the end. Statements sound like questions: 'Love goes towards love as schoolboys from their books?' and 'I am fortune's fool?' Imagine the effect in everyday life: 'Good evening? I'm you're captain for this flight?' The principals have yet to centre themselves in the parts. Josette Bushell-Mingo is a strong, versatile actress whose talents are confined rather than concentrated by playing Juliet; and Damian Lewis' Romeo lacks the intense assertiveness of a man possessed by passion. Their love is still searching for sweetness and quietness, and has about it an anxiety which typifies the production. Elsewhere, Mark Jax's Mercutio gives away his 'Queen Mab' speech by depending on the reactions of his on-stage listeners and meandering downstage, dissipating the energies of the verse. But the production finds a lasting image of Romeo and Juliet curled together in death, like casual sleepers. Over their bodies, the handshake between Montague and Capulet had particular poignancy in this week of handshakes. Until October 9 (021 236 4455)</p>

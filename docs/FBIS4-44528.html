			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cui Jinghua (1508 0079 5478): "Results of a </F> First-Quarter Spot-Check by the State Technology Supervision  Administration Show That the Quality of Agricultural Materials  Is of Concern"]    [Text] The State Technology Supervision Administration  announced on 25 April 1994 the results of a state-supervised  spot check during the first quarter of 10 categories of  agricultural materials and products in 22 provinces  (municipalities). The spot check showed that China's current  agricultural-production situation is of concern, with a quite  severe product-quality problem.    This spot check involved 353 products in 10 categories, such  as seeds, pesticides, and farm machinery parts, produced by 216  enterprises, with 157 products being up to standard, for a  sampling up-to-standard rate of 44.5 percent. This included  up-to-standard rates of 92.6 for long-effective phosphorus  agricultural chemicals, 88.95 percent for pesticides  (herbicides), such as buta-weed-amine, 81.9 percent for  three-wheeled farm-use transportation vehicles, 64.3 percent for  upright slush and sewage pumps, 57.7 percent for triazole-ketone  pesticide, 56.3 percent for cotton seeds, 42.9 percent for  fungus-clearing pesticides, 42.1 percent for rotocultivator  curved-blade paddy-field harrows, 35 percent for  bromide-cyanogen ammonia-ester milk-oil, and 2.8 percent for  corn seeds.    This shows that seed quality was most severe, with only 30  of  156 corn and cotton seed samples from 89 sales units in seven  provinces being up to standard, for a sampling up-to-standard  rate of 19.2 percent. Of 108 corn-seed samples, 88 hybrid seeds  did not have a purity of the (minimum) national standard of  grade two, with only three of 20 self-crossed seed samples being  up to standard as to purity; 19 of 48 cotton-seed samples did  not reach purity criteria. In the two provinces of Shanxi and  Henan, not even one of 42 samples from 18 enterprises were up to  standard, with the "Nongda 60" seeds from a seed company in the  southern suburbs of Taiyuan, Shanxi not meeting standards for  all four inspection targets.</p>

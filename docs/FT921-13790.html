			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Cheney rejects new campaign against Iraq SAUDI ARABIA is urging the US to organise a large covert campaign to help Kurdish and Shia rebels overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, according to US newspaper reports. The New York Times said Saudi Arabia wanted to provide air support as well as missiles and arms to help rebels against Mr Saddam's helicopters and tanks. Mr Richard Cheney, US secretary of defence, yesterday described the report as 'overblown,' arguing that Mr Saddam, although still in power, no longer posed much of a threat to his neighbours or to the world. 'How many American lives is toppling Saddam Hussein worth? My answer to that is not very damn many,' he said in a television interview, adding he believed the Iraqi leader would eventually be ousted. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, added: 'So long as we maintain the sanction as we have and as our allies have and as the UN has, I do not think he's a danger outside his country.' But other Bush administration officials have sought to step up support for the Iraqi opposition, in a debate that has intensified with the anniversary of Operation Desert Storm. President George Bush's political opponents have seized on Mr Saddam's continuing grip on power to criticise his proudest foreign policy achievement, at the time when his prospects of re-election have begun to be shaken by the US recession. General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is reported to have argued that increased US intervention could only be successful if it involved at least as large a ground force as that used in Desert Storm. Saudi officials, according to the New York Times, believe the allies would not have to commit ground troops, but could limit their role to supplying missiles and munitions to the rebels and providing air cover against the helicopters and armoured units of Mr Saddam's Republican Guard.</p>

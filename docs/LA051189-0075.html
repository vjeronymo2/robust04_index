			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $86 MILLION FOR CHAIRMAN'S COLLECTION;  </P> <P> SUITS OPPOSE USE OF OXY FUNDS FOR BUILDING HAMMER MUSEUM  </P> <P> Several Occidental Petroleum Corp. shareholders are seeking to block the oil  giant's plan to spend at least $86 million on a Westwood museum to house  Chairman Armand Hammer's art collection.  </P> <P> One of a pair of lawsuits asks for a preliminary injunction that could  immediately stop Oxy's corporate gifts to the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and  Cultural Center, which is under construction on a site next to Occidental's  headquarters. The museum is expected to house Hammer's extensive collection of  paintings and lithographs on completion in the fall of 1990.  </P> <P> Both suits claim that Occidental's gifts are a waste of corporate assets and  glorify the 90-year-old Hammer without significant benefit to the company.  "You've heard of the poison pill, the white knight and the golden parachute.  We're calling this the golden casket," said an attorney for one of the  plaintiffs.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said: "I would refer  you to Page 13 of our proxy statement of April 25, which states that a special  committee of Occidental's board of directors, consisting entirely of outside,  disinterested directors, approved the charitable contributions for the funding  of the museum."  </P> <P> Bruce Kauffman, a Philadelphia attorney who advised the directors in approving  the contributions, said he saw little chance that the suits would block the  gifts. "The company meticulously followed the Delaware business judgment rule"  approving the gifts, Kauffman said.  </P> <P> The suits were filed in Chancery Court in Delaware, where Occidental is  incorporated. Hammer, Occidental and the company's directors were named as  defendants.  </P> <P> In proxy materials related to Occidental's May 26 annual shareholders' meeting,  the company said it planned to spend about $50 million, rather than an  initially budgeted $30 million, to build and help maintain the museum.  </P> <P> In addition, Occidental has already allocated $36 million for an annuity that  will provide payments to the institution over 30 years. The company's  first-quarter earnings of $67 million, or 24 cents a share, were reduced by  about $24 million, or 8 cents a share, to reflect the after-tax costs of the  annuity.  </P> <P> The proxy said Occidental will also give the museum an option to purchase its  own complex and the Occidental headquarters building in 30 years for their  future estimated fair market value of $55 million, which will be provided by a  lump-sum payment from the annuity.  </P> <P> According to one of the suits, however, Occidental doesn't currently own the  property and plans to purchase it under an option later this year for $55  million -- exactly the amount the museum can pay for it in 30 years.  </P> <P> An Occidental attorney said the future value was determined by an independent  appraiser. The attorney said the property wasn't expected to appreciate,  despite the boom in California real estate, because the existing Occidental  headquarters is "quite old" already and could be expected to deteriorate with  time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trustee Files Suit  </P> <P> The attorney said the gifts had been approved by the outside directors but  wouldn't be finalized for weeks or even months, because the company is  completing documents and waiting for approval from the Internal Revenue  Service.  </P> <P> The first of the the two suits was filed May 2 by Alan R. Kahn, a New York  securities dealer and investment adviser, as trustee for an estate that owns  700 Occidental shares. Kahn declined to comment on the suit. One of his  attorneys said no hearing was yet scheduled on the request for a preliminary  injunction.  </P> <P> Plaintiffs in the second suit, which was filed on Tuesday, were Joseph Sullivan  and Alan I. Brody. William Prickett, a Wilmington attorney representing the  pair, described Sullivan and Brody as "average shareholders," but declined  further comment.  </P> <P> Occidental has revealed plans to spend $375,000 on a new book about Hammer and  has previously made gifts to pet charities of the executive, such as the Armand  Hammer United World College of the American West.  </P> <P> But the $86-million-plus museum gift apparently angered some shareholders  because of its sheer size.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deal Fell Through  </P> <P> Large American corporations have tended to give between 1% and 2% of their  annual pretax income to charity, according to annual studies conducted by the  New York-based Conference Board. Occidental had $574 million in pretax income  in 1988.  </P> <P> Hammer conceived the idea of building the museum after backing out of a promise  to give his art collection -- which he has claimed to be worth $400 million --  to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The county museum's directors had  balked at demands by the executive that the collection be kept intact forever  and that it be hung on a single floor that would be named for Hammer and  supervised not by the museum staff, but by the Armand Hammer Foundation.  </P> <P> In its proxy statement, Occidental said it expected to receive "appropriate  public acknowledgement" in return for its gift.  </P> <P> But one of the suits alleges that "the contributions to the Hammer Museum . . .  serve no business purpose or corporate interest, and constitute gifts to  defendant Hammer."  </P></p>

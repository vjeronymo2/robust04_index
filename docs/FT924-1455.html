			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Gaidar given advisory position PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, striving to keep Russia on the free-market road, has given his sacked reform chief Yegor Gaidar a new advisory role and told the new prime minister to form a cabinet by next Tuesday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Yeltsin's press office said Mr Gaidar, replaced as premier three days ago by the more conservative Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, had been appointed a presidential adviser on economic policy. A separate presidential order set a Tuesday deadline for Mr Chernomyrdin, previously deputy prime minister in charge of fuel and energy, to form his new government.</p>

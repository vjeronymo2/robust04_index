			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Paving a path to lasting peace THE meeting in Rabat yesterday between King Hassan of Morocco and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was less surprising than it might seem. In July 1986, when most of the Arab world would not acknowledge Israel's right to exist, King Hassan received Mr Shimon Peres, then Israeli premier, whom he had met more discreetly on a number of occasions. Mr Rabin said he had paid a secret visit to Morocco in October 1976, while Mr Peres had paid two secret visits to the king in 1978 and March 1981, before paying him a public visit, as Israeli prime minister, in 1986. 'We consulted with the king on how to help the atmosphere in the Arab world and the many problems which lie ahead,' Mr Rabin said. Before that, Israeli officials slipped into Morocco repeatedly to prepare for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977. The protection given Jewish subjects runs deep in Morocco and King Hassan has more than once reminded his Arab peers that no law forbids a man to talk to his enemies. When asked when Morocco would recognise Israel officially, Mr Rabin said that 'the very kindness, warmness of the king's reception and his readiness to assist speak for themselves.' The king enjoys good relations with most Middle East leaders, including Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. Over the past decade the monarch has successfully steered his country towards economic reform and has sought to tie it more closely to Europe. When the king applied for Moroccan membership of the EC in 1987 his request prompted incredulity and scorn. But last winter the EC agreed to a Moroccan request to negotiate what promises to be one of the closest partnership treaties covering free trade and political co-operation between the Community and a non-EC country. Yesterday the EC bureau in Rabat said the Community had allocated Ecu80m (Pounds 61.28m) to Morocco to finance state education and health projects for the poor. The king has long argued that talks between the PLO and Israel are crucial to lasting peace in the Middle East. If the peace drive gains momentum and Morocco's negotiations with the EC bear fruit, King Hassan will have provided a bridge between east and west.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Isuzu turns in pre-tax loss of Y36bn for year ISUZU, the Japanese vehicle manufacturer which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors of the US, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Y35bn (Dollars 282m) in the year to October, largely due to declining automobile sales in Japan. The financial pressures on Isuzu, which has made a loss for three years, recently forced it to announce it was withdrawing from car manufacturing to concentrate on vans and commercial vehicles. It has formed an alliance with Honda of Japan, which will supply it with cars, while Isuzu will supply Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu has also formed important alliances with other automotive companies covering for the joint supply of components. Isuzu's pre-tax loss last year was down from the Y54bn in 1991. The company's sales rose by 3.7 per cent to Y1,580bn. Overseas sales accounted for 51 per cent of its turnover.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: Taurus the octopus - The progress of the London Stock Exchange's paperless settlement system Cranking up the biggest technology project to hit the City since Big Bang was never going to be easy. Taurus, the long-awaited paperless settlement system that is meant to make it cheaper and safer to deal in the London stock market, is several weeks into testing. Like an electronic octopus, its tentacles have begun to spread around the City, reaching out towards the 280 or so financial institutions which will eventually be linked into the system. The process is likely to be a protracted one. This week, the institutions which will be tied electronically to Taurus - registrars, brokers, market makers, custodians, large investors - were told that the testing will last until at least the end of this year. This pushes back the live date for the project by another six months to the spring of 1994. Each delay - there have been several since Taurus' first aborted target date of October 1990 - puts up the costs for London's securities industry. The official cost/benefit analysis for Taurus, produced by the London Stock Exchange several years ago, looks increasingly out of date as delays add to the development costs of brokers and others, as well as the Exchange itself. The cost to the Exchange was last put at about Pounds 80m, though the latest delay will push it higher. Each delay also pushes further away the day when stamp duty - the 0.5 per cent turnover tax on stock market trading - is finally abolished, adding a further cost to all investors. The sheer scale and complexity of the project accounts for the latest lengthening of the timetable. It has been urged on the Stock Exchange by participants in the system, who wanted more time for testing before the system was brought into operation. As John Watson, the Exchange's Taurus project director, warned when testing began last autumn: 'We're not just implementing one system in one organisation. There's still a huge undertaking we have ahead of us.' Taurus is being introduced in three phases, with each phase subjected to three separate test cycles. The first phase - the part of the software which deals with the basic settlement function, involving the exchange of stock for cash - was delivered last autumn, together with the communications package which had taken far longer to develop than expected. The second and third elements are due this spring. The most complex part of the system will be the last to arrive. Known as the benefits package, this deals with situations like takeovers, rights issues and other events which affect shareholders' rights and benefits. Mike Jones, a director of Capel Cure Myers, a nationwide private client stockbroker, says that the element dealing with benefits is likely to be the most difficult to implement: 'They account for about 30 per cent of the code, and 80 per cent of the problems in any stockbroking package.' Each part of the Taurus system is first put through 'entry testing'. This involves financial institutions hooking up to the central computer and putting their own systems through their paces on a simulation package. In the second stage - known as participant testing - the Stock Exchange's own system swings into operation, interacting directly with other participants. This second stage was reached this week, the first big test for the Exchange's own development work. Stage three of the tests has been urged on the Exchange by Taurus participants. They felt that it was not enough to interact individually with the Exchange through their own electronic link, but wanted to make sure that all the pieces of the jigsaw fitted into place: in other words, if one broker instructed the central computer to send shares to another, would the second broker actually receive them on time? This extra phase of testing, known as 'many-to-many testing', will involve groups of participants banding together and conducting trials between themselves, through the central computer, to make sure all the pieces fit together. It is this many-to-many phase of the final part of the system, the benefits package, that accounts for the latest delay. A single test cycle will take several weeks: events like rights issues and takeovers work to specific timetables, allowing time for investors to receive information and make decisions about whether or not to accept an offer. A series of these test cycles is expected to take up the last four or five months of the year. This latest delay is causing less unease around the City than previous setbacks. Putting the system through its paces was always expected to be a convoluted process, and there is general support for the Stock Exchange's measured approach. 'They have given themselves a more realistic timing,' says Alison Renison, in charge of Taurus development at Barclays. The extension of the testing timetable has come at a sensitive moment, though. With the main season for corporate annual general meetings about to get under way, the Stock Exchange had hoped to persuade more companies to pass the necessary changes to their articles of association to allow them to scrap their share certificates and move on to Taurus. Despite a steady trickle of companies taking this step over the past year, most have delayed, preferring to hold off until Taurus finally seems a reality. The latest news could take the sense of urgency out of the project, encouraging companies to put off the amendment until next year's AGM. That could push up the cost of Taurus still further. During its first months, the new electronic settlement system will run in parallel to the existing paper-based arrangements. The duplication will add to costs for registrars, brokers and the exchange itself, warns Watson.</p>

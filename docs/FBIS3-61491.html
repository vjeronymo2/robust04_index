Kukoleva, Central </F> Aerological Observatory; UDC  (551.510.534:551.510.52).001.572+551.513]    [Abstract] Empirical models of the vertical distribution of  ozone in the altitude range 10-32 km have been published, but  data on tropospheric ozone are lacking and data from the  existing ozonometric network are inadequate for constructing  zonal, global or regional models. However, data from the world  ozonometric network were used in constructing models of the  partial pressure of ozone in the troposphere for 35 stations.  The data taken into account included the mean climatic  distribution of the wind, climatic characteristics of the  tropopause and location of the principal jet stream zones over  the northern hemisphere. The seasonal variation of ozone partial  pressure was determined for the 300- and 500-gpa surfaces for  different points in the hemisphere. These data revealed that the  classical seasonal variation of tropospheric ozone density with  a summer maximum and a winter minimum is not always observed.  The constructed models of the vertical distribution for these  stations show that the accepted seasonal variation of ozone  density occurs only in regions not subject to the influence of  jet streams. In the latter, however, the ozone maximum, as in  the lower stratosphere, is in the spring. It can be postulated  that under definite synoptic conditions a considerable quantity  of ozone is pumped into the troposphere from the stratosphere.  Figures 3; references: 6 Russian.</p>

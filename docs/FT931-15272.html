			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T steps up dispute with MCI AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph has broadened its technology patents dispute with MCI Communications by filing a patent infringement suit against the rival telecommunications company, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The AT&amp;T suit follows MCI's earlier action seeking a court ruling that certain AT&amp;T patents were not enforceable. AT&amp;T said it had been negotiating with MCI since 1988, seeking a two per cent royalty on some of the patents. These cover 800 (toll-free) service enhancements, credit card processing and verification techniques, and techniques for controlling toll-fraud abuse and branding several types of telephone calls with an audible company slogan. AT&amp;T is seeking royalties and damages for MCI's allegedly unauthorised use of patented technologies over the past five years, as well as prospective future use. 'We simply will not allow MCI to continue to get a free ride on our Dollars 3bn annual investment in research and development,' said Ms Judith Maynes, a lawyer for AT&amp;T. The dispute first surfaced after MCI announced an alliance with Stentor, the Canadian telecommunications consortium, in November. AT&amp;T informed MCI and Stentor that their proposed use of MCI's intelligent network technology in Canada would infringe upon AT&amp;T patents.</p>

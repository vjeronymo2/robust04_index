			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Joint approach urged in policy FRANCE should set up a national security council in which its Socialist president and its new conservative government could jointly run the country's foreign and defence policy, an influential Gaullist adviser suggested yesterday. Mr Pierre Lelouche, foreign affairs adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac and now an RPR deputy, wrote in Liberation newspaper yesterday that joint decision-making in such a council could avoid possible paralysis of French policy on issues such as defence, the European Community and the Gatt trade talks, where President Mitterrand and the right had differences of view. Mr Mitterrand has made it clear he will exercise the influence allowed him by the constitution in foreign and defence policy. However cohabitation - the term used to describe periods in which France is governed by a president and prime minister of opposing parties - has got off to a smooth start. Mr Mitterrand last night approved the cabinet nominees of the new premier, Mr Edouard Balladur of the RPR, in record time. Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, who was Mr Mitterrand's chief of staff at the Elysee in the last cohabitation government of 1986-88, yesterday warned the new government against the temptation to 'hide things' from the president. A new computer network linking the Elysee to the Quai d'Orsay's diplomatic cable traffic would make concealment harder now. Interest rates in the French franc money market fell sharply yesterday amid growing speculation that the Bank of France may cut the country's official interest rates this week, writes James Blitz. One-month French franc interest rates fell more than a full percentage point from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent. Three-month interest rates fell from 11.00 per cent to below 10 per cent.</p>

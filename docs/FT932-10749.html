			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / M0 slowdown shows fragility of recovery THE RATE of growth in money in circulation fell last month, underlining the fragile nature of any upturn, according to figures from the Bank of England released yesterday. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, grew in the year to last month by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent, after year-on-year growth of 4.9 per cent in March. This was the first fall in the year-on-year increase in M0 since December, when this figure fell to 2.8 per cent from 3.0 per cent the previous month. The figure for April is, however, much higher than the comparable numbers for much of last year. It signifies a general buoyancy in retail spending compared with early in the recession. Mr Don Smith, an economist at Midland Global Markets, said the M0 figures indicated consumer spending might be increasing at a slightly lower rate than had previously been thought. Separately, the Bank said that non-UK institutions bought Pounds 1.1bn worth of gilts in March, the highest monthly figure since July 1987. Total gilt sales were Pounds 2.7bn. In February, foreigners bought Pounds 1bn worth of gilts. The figures for overseas purchases in February and March augur reasonably well for the Bank, which in the next year must sell large volumes of gilts to foreigners to fund the large fiscal deficit for 1993-94, expected by the Treasury to reach Pounds 50bn. The longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights turning-points in economic activity about 11 months in advance, has flattened in recent months, after rising strongly towards the end of last year. The Central Statistical Office said the rise in optimism recorded in the April Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey had offset a fall in share prices. The coincident index, which moves in line with the business cycle, has resumed its rise following some hesitation last autumn. It shows provisionally that the trough of the recession was in spring last year. The office said the rise in the shorter leading index, indicating turning points about four months in advance, reflected the results of the CBI survey which showed higher reported new orders and expectations of less destocking.</p>

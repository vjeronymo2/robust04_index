			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Next step for Renault-Volvo Volvo and Renault are like two lovers who cancelled their wedding on the eve of the ceremony. Now they have to pick up the pieces of their broken relationship and see what can be salvaged. This will not be easy. There are bruised feelings on both sides. Jilted Renault doubts whether it can trust its Swedish partner. Volvo, on the other hand, is still fearful of being swamped by the French state-owned company. But the future need not be as dire as predicted by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's ex-chairman and the driving force behind the failed union. In his resignation statement last week, he said the existing alliance between the two companies would certainly be dismantled. Sensibly, both Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, and Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, have avoided such cataclysmic talk. Both say they wish to keep the alliance, which consists of a network of cross-shareholdings and joint projects, alive. The French government also says it continues to believe a full merger is desirable, while some Swedish shareholders who opposed the union do not rule out the possibility of it being revived at a later date. The current priority is to cool passions and to take a hard look at what is in the best interests of both companies. That is also essential if the French and Swedish establishments are to learn the wider lesson from the break-up: the importance of keeping politics out of business. On the French side, this means understanding the legitimacy of Swedish concerns about merging with Renault while it is still state-owned. Until Renault is privatised, it is impossible for Volvo shareholders to know whether they were being offered fair value for their shares. The French government's insistence on maintaining a golden share in Renault also raises concerns that political interference would continue even after privatisation. In the coming years, other state-owned or privatised companies will wish to form international alliances or mergers. If such arrangements are to flourish, Paris will need to convince outsiders that the days of political interference are over. In Sweden, there is a similar need to disentangle politics from business. Legitimate concerns over the financial side of the deal were swept up in a wider debate about Sweden's future in Europe. Volvo may now be tempted to think that it can go it alone or that its alliance with Renault can continue indefinitely as it is. This is self-delusion. Without a partner to share research and development costs and to gain economies of scale, Volvo's car division has a bleak future. The same goes for Renault's truck operations. But without trust and a shared sense of direction, no alliance can prosper. The only practical alternatives are a complete divorce, which would free both companies to seek other partners, or a renewed effort at matrimony. After last week's dramatic events, it is hard to believe that marriage is still an option. It certainly could not be contemplated until after Renault's privatisation. But, if both parties could keep politics out of business, a union would remain the best way forward.</p>

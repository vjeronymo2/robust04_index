			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Former Medeva directors join lossmaking Hewitt Shares in Hewitt Group rose 60p to 158p yesterday after the lossmaking industrial ceramics company appointed two former Medeva directors to the board. Hewitt also announced a rescue rights issue to raise a maximum of Pounds 4.3m as the company revealed that its accounts to December 31 would breach its banking convenants. The company, which reported Pounds 2.34 pre-tax losses at the half-year stage, named Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith as non-executive deputy chairman and Mr David Lees as chief executive. Nine months ago, Mr Gowrie-Smith resigned as managing director of Medeva, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals group which he founded. Mr Lees also resigned as finance director. 'We are very excited to be involved with such a promising company which has good potential,' Mr Gowrie-Smith said. 'It is not commonly appreciated that David and I spent years developing an industrial and engineering group, so for us it is like returning to our roots after so many years devoted solely to the pharmaceutical sector.' Hewitt proposes a 1-for-1 rights issue of 3.39m shares at 68p to raise about Pounds 2m after expenses. If the issue is fully subscribed, the company plans additional equity capital to raise a further Pounds 2.3m. The company also proposes to allocate three warrants attached to every 10 rights shares. The warrants can be exercised six months after issue at 68p a share. The rights issue is underwritten by brokers Hichens Harrison, and Summervale, which is controlled by Mr Gowrie-Smith's family. Summervale will be left with a minimum stake of 33 per cent and a maximum of 45 per cent. The cash raised will be used to repay borrowings and fund working capital. Losses on Hewitt's German activities resulted in a Pounds 2m write-down of assets and other costs at the interim stage. The rights issue is subject to an extraordinary meeting on January 10, and dealing is expected to begin the following day.</p>

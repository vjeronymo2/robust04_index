			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN SLAYING OF BANK PATRON  </P> <P> The last of four men accused of killing a man at a Northridge automated teller  machine last year pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Marty Louis Mares, 22, of Granada Hills faces 15 years to life in state prison  for the March 21, 1989, shooting death of 29-year-old Aslam Hasham, who was  robbed and gunned down after he withdrew money from the automatic teller  machine at Tampa Avenue and Nordhoff Street.  </P> <P> Mares also pleaded guilty to one count of robbery.  </P> <P> Investigators believe Mares was the lookout for three friends who also were  responsible for similar holdups elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Elisaia Reupena, 28, of Sherman Oaks and Steven B. Rice, 20, of Granada Hills  were sentenced last year to life in prison after they pleaded guilty to  Hasham's slaying and to charges of robbery and kidnaping in two other ATM  crimes.  </P> <P> Reupena shot Hasham as the victim struggled with his attackers, but Reupena was  shot in the leg during the struggle. His subsequent arrest at a Torrance  hospital led to the other three defendants.  </P> <P> An 18-year-old youth -- 17 at the time of the slaying -- was sent to the  California Youth Authority after he admitted playing a role in the shooting and  the two other ATM crimes. He can be held in the Youth Authority until he is 25.  </P> <P> Mares was scheduled to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge and could  have faced the death penalty if convicted.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Richman said prosecutors allowed Mares to plead to the  lesser charge because he had no prior criminal record, was not involved in the  other crimes and served only as a lookout during the attack on Hasham.  </P> <P> He will be sentenced Nov. 19 in San Fernando Superior Court.  </P></p>

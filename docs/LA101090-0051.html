Orfield, who set a  sentencing hearing for Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the district attorney's office will not oppose a request  that Underwood be sentenced to one year in custody. However, Underwood may face  an additional sentence because she is scheduled to go on trial for another  grand theft charge on Oct. 26.  </P> <P> Underwood admitted to stealing from a couple who employed her as a home  health-care nurse in their Encinitas home during April. Underwood stole credit  cards in order to make unauthorized purchases, according to Deputy Dist. Atty.  Mary E. Grove.  </P></p>

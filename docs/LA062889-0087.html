			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY HEIR TESTIFIES MILKEN HELPED HIM GET FINANCING FOR BID  </P> <P> Roy E. Disney revealed in testimony Tuesday that "junk bond" king Michael  Milken helped put together financing for a hostile takeover of Walt Disney Co.  that the Disney heir was considering in 1984.  </P> <P> The son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney said he decided not to pursue the  acquisition mainly because the estimated $2.5-billion cost would have meant  selling parts of the historic firm. He further testified that he allowed Milken  to take the plan elsewhere. Shortly afterward, corporate raider Saul P.  Steinberg mounted a bid for the company with the aid of Milken and Drexel  Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> The testimony came in the trial of a class-action lawsuit by Disney  shareholders alleging that the company, its directors and Steinberg breached  their fiduciary duty when the film and theme park company bought Steinberg's  11% stake at above-market prices. The alleged "greenmail" payment resulted in a  $59-million profit for Steinberg. Shortly after the transaction, Disney, who  had resigned from the board earlier that year, rejoined the company as a vice  chairman.  </P> <P> Disney, the first witness in the trial, disclosed behind-the-scenes events that  were the subject of much conjecture in June, 1984.  </P> <P> Among other things, Disney also divulged that:  </P> <P> * He wrote the board a resignation letter in March, 1984, saying he had "deep  and unreconcilable philosophical differences" with the management team led by  Ronald W. Miller, a son-in-law of the late Walt Disney.  </P> <P> * He sent a $350-million offer to Steinberg to buy the film business from Walt  Disney Co. if Steinberg succeeded in acquiring the company. Nevertheless, he  said he objected to the buyout of Steinberg as "outrageous."  </P> <P> * As the board was preparing to respond to Steinberg's announced offer, it  turned down an 11th-hour suggestion by Roy E. Disney for a leveraged buyout by  Disney family members, including Miller.  </P> <P> Roy E. Disney's testimony also indicated that, without firing a shot himself in  the takeover battle or risking his fortune, he attained power in Walt Disney  Co., helped oust the old management and elect a new management team headed by  Michael D. Eisner in September, 1984. Within two years, the company's stock  price had increased several hundred percent, the jury was told. Disney conceded  that he had been hesitant to mount a takeover himself because he would have had  to borrow heavily to increase his holding in the company.  </P> <P> J. Michael Hennigan, attorney for the shareholders, brought out that the  witness had strenuously opposed a major Disney acquisition by the Miller  management in fighting Steinberg.  </P> <P> Roy E. Disney said he still does not think the swapping of new Disney stock for  Arvida Corp., a Florida real estate concern, was good for the company's  stockholders.  </P> <P> He also gave all credit to the Eisner team for the firm's success, rather than  the farsightedness attributed to old management by defense lawyers in opening  statements.  </P> <P> Under questioning by another plaintiffs' lawyer, William Lerach, the witness  said he thought the buyout of Steinberg was unfair to stockholders and caused  the market price of Disney stock to plunge afterward.  </P> <P> However, he told defense attorney Michael Diamond that he viewed Steinberg's  offer as inadequate. He confirmed that he bought large amounts of Disney stock  after the price fell June 12 because the long-term value was "clearly" greater  than the market price.  </P></p>

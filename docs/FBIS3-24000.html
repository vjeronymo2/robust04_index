			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Gonchar (chairman of the Federation </F> Council Committee for the Budget, Financial, Currency, and  Credit Regulation, Monetary Emission, Tax Policy, and Customs  Regulation) by Vladimir Kuzmishchev; place and date not given:  "Nikolay Gonchar: No Alternative to Unification"]    [Text]    [Kuzmishchev] Nikolay Nikolayevich, I recently heard that  you are calling for economic reunification with Ukraine in  connection with the situation in the Crimea. To be honest my  first thought is God forbid. Loss-making mines in the Donbass,  exhausted mines in the Krivoy Rog area, the mighty defense  industry in Dnepropetrovsk in need of restructuring. We just  won't be able to cope....    [Gonchar] Imagine that a third of the modules are removed  from your computer here and you are asked: How are we to get it  to work? Simple. You either replace the parts that have been  removed with some new components, which is a costly, awkward,  and exacting business. Or you put back the old ones. Then you  can use the computer.    [Kuzmishchev] That is debatable. It transpires that Ukraine  produced 18 percent of the former Union's GNP. Some went on  reproduction and on intrarepublic deliveries, some to Central  Asia, Georgia, and the Baltic. And, no matter how you look at  it, Russia's dependency on Ukraine was minimal. But Ukraine  experienced maximum dependency on Russia, as the last few years  have shown.    [Gonchar] Now let us give the people of Tyumen a say from  these positions. They say that the whole Russian economy has  been shored up and still is being shored up with their  petrodollars and gas dollars, and you can wash your hands of and  forget the rest. Let them survive on their own. It will end up  with neither one thing nor the other. The system can be  restructured or, to continue the computer analogy, a new program  loaded. But why destroy things?    [Kuzmishchev] But political realities must be taken into  consideration....    [Gonchar] The former political system turned out to be  fiction. If it could collapse because of a conflict between two  leaders, it did not exist. I suggest that we evaluate reality.  The reality is that borders which were established in an  extremely arbitrary manner in the past (everyone was after all  convinced that they were a formality) suddenly proved real. So  far only economically, but the logic of confrontation is not  always the logic of common sense. It dictates its own laws.  Border guards carrying assault rifles have already appeared.  The absurd thing is that a person's membership of a particular  nation is only decided by geographical latitude and longitude....    [Kuzmishchev] You have been able to say things to me a  journalist that you cannot say as a politician. Having traveled  the entire length and breadth of Left Bank Ukraine I was never  able to understand how the thinking, lifestyle, psychology, or,  as people are now saying, the mentality of a peasant, a miner,  an engineer in those areas differs from the mentality of someone  from Tula, Saratov, Omsk, or Minsk, say. There has never been a  language barrier. It was harder for me to understand, say, what  a coastal dweller from Arkhangelsk was saying than a peasant  from Kharkov. According to Dal [19th century Russian  ethnographer] a person belongs to the nationality in whose  language he thinks. Second, what have the millions of Russians  who came from Russia to Ukraine or to Kazakhstan on an institute  placement or in response to the authorities' appeal done to hurt  us? By political realities I meant the situation today.    [Gonchar] The saying that politics is economics in a  concentrated form is more appropriate today than ever. Economic  integration represents the means of survival for us. There is a  cheap work force in Ukraine. Tell me please how we will be able  to stem the flow of people from there who are desperate to come  to our country to work? They are even willing to take half pay,  but what are we to do with our own people? This threatens a  social explosion. Now let us take the situation in the Crimea.  The recently elected president Yu. Meshkov was the leader of  the "Russia" bloc, A fairly eloquent name. Their objective is  to leave the economic wreckage of Ukraine and form a single  economic area with Russia and other states. Russia now seems to  be accommodating that aspiration. But there are many problems  here. We do not after all even share borders. Electricity comes  from Ukraine as does the water for agricultural irrigation, and  so on. The Crimea is greatly indebted to Ukraine. What will  happen to Left Bank Ukraine where there are similar pro-Russian  sentiments? But no one there is advocating the revival of the  Soviet and Socialist Union. It is a question of economic  integration.    [Kuzmishchev] The chain reaction will hit Kazakhstan next.  Whereas the breakup of the Union caused a series of wars in  outlying regions, the breakup of Ukraine and Kazakhstan would  mean....    [Gonchar] There are plenty of politicians in Ukraine and our  country who would not be averse to playing that card. Both in  order to remain in big-league politics and in order to reach new  heights. Suppose someone in Ukraine wanted to postpone  parliamentary and presidential elections. Is the possible  deterioration of the situation in the Crimea not an excuse for  those politicians? And aren't our radicals even better?    [Kuzmishchev] But doesn't integration involve a partial loss  of sovereignty for states with a weaker economy?    [Gonchar] Sovereignty is not the aim, but the means of  attaining contemporary civilization and a high standard of  living. People in Ukraine were convinced that autonomy is the  way to success. Now the result is clear. No one on the  long-established Western market is waiting for us or for them.  Look how quick they were to reach agreement with us and drive  down prices of aluminum and oil. We thought that we would  inundate the West with these goods and take off like the Arab  Emirates did in the past. That is not the case. Besides, it  is offensive if you have high technologies to place the emphasis  on raw materials when all countries are trying to sell finished  output. But for the time being we are prepared to trade  finished output mainly among ourselves....    [Kuzmishchev] But how specifically are the first steps to be  taken? How long has there been talk of creating a ruble zone at  the highest level and it has all been to no avail....    [Gonchar] The key issue here is the number of money supply  centers. Needless to say, Russia will never agree to there  being several points deciding the money supply. There must only  be one of these points. Europe has already reached that  conclusion -- a currency institution has been set up there and  it will have a single currency. Why are our politicians  opposing proposals dictated by life itself? Remember the  advertisement that begins with the words: "Ladies and  Gentlemen, you have 30 seconds to think about it...." There are  no deals that are any easier or granders han those involved in  playing with exchange rate differences and brokering currency  transfers. This is a colossal network and can produce billions  out of thin air. On the one hand, these billions affect prime  cost and thus bring soaring prices and inflation, on the other,  they require political protection and lobbying for their  interests. I therefore propose that, if the politicians do not  reach agreement, let the peoples reach agreement. The  politicians must be presented with the fait accompli of the  peoples having reached agreement. Let us hold a referendum.  With one sole question: Is it necessary to create a single  economic area?    [Kuzmishchev] The population of Ukraine will probably vote  "for," but Russia is another matter. What a hullabaloo there  has been over the creation of a single monetary system with  Belarus. But here, after all, the scale is far greater. And the  political forces of those opposed are far more aggressive. It  will be enough for someone in Russia say that this will whip up  inflation, and then....    [Gonchar] If you so desire, shortcomings can be found,  exaggerated, and dreamed up in any plan, any idea. Let us first  grasp what is meant by "unification" [obyedineniye] or the  creation of a "single economic area," the specific steps  involved.    There are of course plenty of people in our country, in  Ukraine, and in Kazakhstan whose political career is based on  the policy of separation [razyedininiye]. Many people are only  interested in nationalist hysteria so that they can come to  power. Some individuals have already succeeded, but the parade  of sovereignty indisputably had adverse consequences for most of  the population. At the same time we have enough sober  politicians who are capable of telling people that economic  integration by no means signifies that Russia will include  Ukraine in its budget and exchange rubles for coupons on a 1:1  basis.    [Kuzmishchev] What does it mean then?    [Gonchar] Primarily that the economic and legal barriers  should be taken down and the duties removed. And private  capital given the freedom to invest money in the Ukrainian  economy.    [Kuzmishchev] But, as Marx said, capital is not sentimental,  it goes where there is the greatest profit. It is hard in  Russia to force someone to invest in production in conditions of  inflation, never mind in Ukraine.    [Gonchar] A contentious issue. Even from the purely  economic viewpoint. You only have to remember Ukraine's mighty  oil refining industry, which is driving down our monopolists'  prices. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the Ukrainian  economy can name straight off several sectors in which it is  profitable to invest capital. That is not the point.  Entrepreneurs are primarily interested in political stability  and legal protection. Russian firms, say, are willing to refine  oil in Ukraine, but what guarantee is there that Ukraine won't  appropriate the oil tomorrow? There must be seamless  [skvoznoye] legislation on property.    [Kuzmishchev] Common legislation.    (Gonchar] No. Ukrainian and Russian legislation. The main  thing is that the laws should not contradict one another. In a  word, there must be an incentive for a change of legislation.  If you want to employ an incentive, then think it through.  Capital, I repeat, goes where there is greater social and  political stability. If we squabble, there will be no capital.  That is, the economic motor is cranked into action via  politics. And, on the contrary, every stage of political  rapprochement must have legal and political backup. Let us give  Russian and Ukrainian capital a chance to work together. If it  is just a question of Russian capital, there is one system of  taxation, if it is just Ukrainian, then another applies. But if  it is a joint project, there must be lenient taxes to provide  incentives. It is not important what language people speak. Or  what they wear. They will be united by profit and a common  cause. When people come along and undermine the common cause  out of personal interest, Russian businessmen will tell their  Ukrainian colleagues: The plan will collapse if this idiot  forces the situation. Would you be so kind as to have it out  with him. Give money to his election rival, give money to the  party that backs integrationist processes and we will deal with  our Russian loonies. People of the same blood must be united  by common interests.    [Kuzmishchev] Do you think that this is the most pressing  problem now?    [Gonchar] Why has the rich United States suddenly taken the  initiative and started strengthening the economy of Mexico?  Mexicans were dying to get across the border, so economic  potential had to be created there. The situation is far more  acute in our country. Things are so bad in Ukraine that an  explosion may be about to occur. We are hoping in vain that the  debris will only fly inward. There is no alternative to  economic integration. People in the Crimea have realized that  and are clearing the way. The others are only hampered by the  fact that some politicians in both capitals are afraid to  acknowledge their mistakes, which have brought national tragedy.</p>

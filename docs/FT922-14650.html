			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Madrid gives green light to Repsol bond THE SPANISH government has given the green light for a convertible bond offering worth between Pta25bn (Dollars 240m) and Pta50bn in Repsol, its oil, gas and chemicals group. Company officials said the offering would be made in Spain, to small shareholders, next month. At yesterday's share prices the maximum offering of Pta50bn would cut the state's stake in Repsol by 5.9 per cent, to 60.6 per cent, although the Cabinet yesterday authorised a limit of 8.33 per cent in any reduction of the state's holding. Company officials said at least Pta25bn in three-year convertible bonds would be offered next month, but the full Pta50bn could be tapped if the market proved enthusiastic. In 1989, the state sold off 26.5 per cent of Repsol, to raise Dollars 1.3bn in the country's largest flotation. It is highly likely that after the summer, the government will make another large convertible bond issue, this time to institutions in Spain and abroad. It is possible that this issue could reduce the state's stake in Repsol to below 50 per cent. For that to happen, though, parliament needs to revoke or change a law which forces the state to control at least 50 per cent of Campsa, the monopoly fuel distributor in Spain. This control is exercised through Repsol, which has more than 65 per cent of Campsa. Parliament is expected to pass new legislation before the summer recess. Given the state of the world's stock markets, Repsol is being much more cautious about the second round of privatisation. Late last year an international stock placement was being projected. In fact, while Madrid has decided to press carefully ahead with Repsol, it has shelved plans to float about 20 per cent of Banco Exterior, its large commercial bank, and is no longer thinking of a further placement of stock in Endesa, its profitable electricity utility.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar result boosts shares Shares in Caterpillar, the US heavy plant and machinery maker, continued their upward surge yesterday as the company reported another quarter of strong recovery. They added Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 96 5/8 by midday. Fourth-quarter losses of Dollars 2m the previous year turned into after-tax profits of Dollars 148m this time, or Dollars 119m after an extraordinary loss of Dollars 29m for the early retirement of some high interest rate debt. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.46 before the extraordinary item and Dollars 1.17 after it, compared with a loss per share of 2 cents last time. Caterpillar's share price has nearly doubled over the last year in response to the sharp recovery in the company's financial performance. Its profits are strongly linked to the economic cycle because its equipment sells best when public and private sectors are spending on construction and expansion. The biggest single factor behind the latest quarter's turnround was a 16 per cent increase in turnover to Dollars 3.2bn, with three-quarters of the increase coming from higher physical sales and the other quarter from better prices. Nearly all the improvement took place in the US, where economic growth stimulated demand. Volumes outside the US were more or less flat. For the year as a whole, Caterpillar recorded a 14 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 11.2bn, with higher demand from US industry more than offsetting moderate declines in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Net profits were Dollars 681m excluding the fourth-quarter's extraordinary loss of Dollars 29m. Last year the company lost Dollars 218m, or Dollars 2.4bn after a Dollars 2.2bn charge for accounting changes. Higher demand world-wide is expected to bring further profits growth this year.</p>

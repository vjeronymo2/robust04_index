Vasilyev, chief of Weapon Training </F> and Combat Vehicle Driving Department of Ground Troops Main  Combat Training Directorate, and Colonel V. Shevchuk, deputy  department chief]    [Text] Fire effectiveness often has a greater influence on  the outcome of a battle than the number and outfitting of  troops. Under difficult situational conditions fire often is not  only the swiftest, but also the only means of altering a  situation in one's favor. In connection with the increased role  of fire in modern combined-arms battle, the importance of weapon  training also is growing. Firm skills in functioning at the  weapons, preempting the enemy in opening fire, and hitting the  target with the first round are developed in the process of  weapon training. In addition, commanders master the art of fire  control in the most diverse situations which form on the  battlefield.    The existing level of weapon training today causes certain  concern, since many specialists believe it does not meet the  demands being placed on it. Over the past five years the state  of personnel training in a number of units and formations has  not exceeded the "satisfactory" mark, and problems which have  built up during these years are being solved late and not always  fully. The shortage of personnel in subunits, the increased  number of details and fatigue duties, and the performance of  other measures unusual for the army entailed a disruption of  scheduled classes and drills, which of course was not slow in  telling on the quality of the training process as a whole.    Meanwhile, there is a way out even from that seemingly very  complicated situation. In our view, thorough planning which  takes into account practical reality, constant improvement in  the quality of weapon training classes, their integration with  other subjects, wide use of training equipment, and officers'  high proficiency in weapon and methods consitute that very  reserve by which it is possible to achieve a good subunit  training level in short time periods. And this has been proven.  For example, the subordinates of Captain V. Anufriyev (Volga  Military District) performed an exercise for an outstanding  grade in a performance evaluation class. Twelve of the 17  persons who fired received the highest mark. As noted in the  critique, the thorough planning of weapon training served as a  guarantee of quality performance of its tasks in the subunit. At  the same time, although this planning does have certain  features, it is not an independent process, but an inalienable  part of the planning of combat training as a whole.    Combat training experience shows that where commanders give  serious attention to and take a personal part in planning, then  classes are held in prescribed time periods and with appropriate  quality. Just what must be done to improve planning quality?  Inasmuch as inspection results in the troops show that some  officers experience certain difficulties here, it makes sense to  take a look at the commander's work in more detail.    We should begin with a study of guidance documents. It is  important to determine the time periods for familiarizing  subordinates with them and make changes to commander training  and combat training programs suggested by the leadership. Then  we must answer a few questions, and specifically, when and to  what extent to plan weapon drills and exercises in firing all  kinds of weapons and throwing hand grenades; when to hold fire  control drills; what questions should be included in the  schedule of officer and NCO assemblies; when to hold methods  conferences and meetings to exchange experience of the best  gunnery specialists; what training films to show trainees; when  to plan contests for title of best specialist, crew and platoon  and when to hold classes for improving or confirming a class  rating; in what time periods to organize training for mastering  techniques and methods of employing all squad weapons in modern  battle; what amount of combat training vehicles to allocate for  performing gunnery exercises; how to distribute ammunition,  simulation devices and vehicle resources and in what amounts; in  what time periods to hold demonstration and instructional  methods classes and on what topic; when to hold performance  evaluation classes to determine the level of weapon proficiency;  and what measures to provide for to ensure safety precautions in  classes. And all these questions should be resolved taking  account of trainee categories.    Additionally the following are determined in the course of  studying and clarifying initial data: The quality of program  fulfillment; the status of weapon proficiency of officers and  subunits, again by categories of servicemen taking into account  data from the latest performance evaluation classes and the  end-of-training-period performance evaluation; the training  facility capabilities; and the tasking function and strength  level of units and subunits. A graphically formalized decision  reflecting the measures enumerated and the time periods in which  they are to be accomplished should be the result of a  commander's work of planning weapon training. In addition, the  rehearsal of topics, conduct of weapon drills, and performance  of gunnery and fire control exercises must be tied in closely in  content and sequence with tactical training and with time  periods for teamwork training of subunits.    In our view, such a work sequence of a commander at any  level  will make it possible to take the fullest account of conditions  under which classes will be held in subunits and will ensure  quality performance of training tasks.    Combat training programs of motorized rifle and tank  subunits  set aside 256 hours per year for the activities enumerated,  consituting 25 percent of total training time. Of this, up to 10  percent is allocated for theoretical classes and 90 percent for  weapon drills and firing. In following a methods sequence and  systematic conduct of drills and firing, all this will permit  maintaining and upgrading the level of servicemen's weapon  proficiency if they are not used to perform any kind of  activities to the detriment of combat training.    It would appear that the contract system of Armed Forces  manpower acquisition will require an increased number of  training days and consequently also hours for weapon training.  Training in combat units will be presented in the form of  individual and group training. During individual training  specialists improve personal skills in actions at the weapons  and in conducting fire, and in group training they participate  in squad (crew) and platoon teamwork training. Time periods of a  particular kind of training must be precisely distributed in the  programs. The following is the basis of individual training in  the U.S. Army: Weapon training 216 hours (37.5 percent),  physical training 128 hours, airborne training 108 hours.  Subunit teamwork training includes performance of integrated  training missions, where 192 hours are set aside for weapon  training.    It is common knowledge that weapon drills and firing  exercises are the basic method of achieving high firing results.  At ranges and in fighting vehicle gunnery training facilities  the soldiers gain, reinforce and improve knowledge and skills in  functioning at the weapons; reconnoitering targets; determining  their nature, importance and distances; giving target  designations; firing against different targets day and night by  all methods; and remedying stoppages.    Research here and abroad shows that the number and duration  of drills and firings should be within certain limits. Thus, if  they are conducted too often and for too long a time, people  become fatigued and apathy appears as a result. Their further  continuation is only a vain waste of material resources and  time. The optimum, practically tested option is three weapon  drills and firings per week (one of them at night) lasting no  more than 3 hours. Thus, 12 weapon drills and firings may be  held in a month, and it is advisable to rehearse the practice  and test firing exercises day and night at least once.    Consequently, the gap between practical classes should not  exceed three days. But combat training programs provide that the  cumulative number of weapon drills and firings is at least eight  per month, with up to a four-day break allowed between them, and  even longer for subunits working eight training days.  Preparatory measures (before the beginning of winter and summer  training periods) interrupt the training process by another one  and one-half to two months, which of course has a very negative  effect on preparedness of gun crew members. These measures are  dictated above all by the existing manpower acquisition system  and by the scope of administrative-economic functions assigned  to each military unit. The Ground Troops Main Combat Training  Directorate is forced simply to determine the minimum  permissible number of weapon drills and firings to maintain the  minimum skills necessary in soldiers' performance of functional  duties. But with the transition to an 18-month term of service  and to contract service, such an approach to determining the  scope of servicemen's knowledge, abilities and skills will  hardly prove acceptable.    The procedure and content of personnel training in skillful,  effective use of authorized weapons and hand grenades in battle  are spelled out by the Gunnery Course. Motorized rifle and tank  subunits have been guided for eight years in weapon training by  the unified "Kurs strelb KS SO, BM i T SV-84" [1984 Ground  Troops Small Arms, Fighting Vehicle and Tank Gunnery Course]. Of  course, in these years it has become somewhat outdated and no  longer fully meets the requirements for training servicemen.  Recently the Ground Troops Main Combat Training Directorate  together with academies and military schools began work on a  Gunnery Course which takes account of changes in manpower  acquisition and in the procedure for performance of duty, and  also the conditions under which subunits will have to perform  actual combat and training missions.[.sup]1[/]    Officers from the troops often ask the question: why is so  little ammunition issued for mastering gunnery? And they compare  ammunition issue standards for combat training in armies of NATO  countries and of Russia. We are speaking chiefly only about  weapon training without taking into account ammunition  expenditure in exercises.    Unfortunately the comparisons in fact are clearly not in our  favor. According to foreign press data, NATO armies allocate an  average of 50-60 rounds per tank, 2-3 missiles per ATGM  launcher, 4 grenades per antitank grenade launcher, and 60  cartridges per IFV per year. Moreover, the bulk of exercises are  performed with all types of authorized ammunition in the  vehicle's basic unit of fire.    We cannot allow ourselves anything of the sort because of  certain economic difficulties, and the training content has no  exercises using all types of ammunition. There is no question  that this is a substantial drawback in training tankers. At the  same time, standards for issuing material resources for combat  training also are being reduced in NATO armies. While up to 110  rounds were issued per tank per year back in the 1970's, their  number now has been cut almost in half and the cost of  ammunition has grown considerably. Several years ago the cost of  one artillery round for the standardized 105-mm gun of M60A1,  Leopard 1, AMX-30 and other tanks was figured at $200-300. One  round from the Leopard 2 and M1 tanks costs taxpayers  $1,200-2,000. Therefore a new criterion for evaluating training  quality--cost-effectiveness--has moved to the foreground abroad.  And the "range rounds" that are lacking are fully compensated  for by the most modern simulators.    Attaining high results in gunnery training using only costly  combat and combat-training vehicles is unjustified. Training  equipment capabilities must be fully used to train specialists  in the troops and military educational institutions. It permits  holding classes under field conditions and in training  classrooms more clearly and understandably, monitoring  subordinates' actions, identifying mistakes promptly,  determining the reasons and seeing to their elimination.  Supplementary simulator drills shorten breaks between practical  classes and help preserve and improve acquired skills. In  addition, with a limitation on fuel and lubricant deliveries and  a reduction in numbers and size of training ranges, the training  equipment relieves the acuteness of many problems.    The troops have several types of training equipment as of  today (Table 1). Unfortunately, some already are obsolete and  need replacing with more modern models. Production of such  articles has been stopped, and a new generation of simulators  with their principle of operation based on personal computers  has begun to come into units. But here, too, we observe a  multitude of unresolved problems, about which, by the way,  VOYENNYY VESTNIK carried on a detailed discussion last year and  the year before last.

Boldface indicates training equipment removed from production.      On the whole, however, the concept of developing and  building  a training equipment system for weapon training has changed  substantially (Table 2). Only three types remain from the past  diversity of simulators: Training equipment intended for basic  training of gun crew members (mock fighting compartments of  simulated vehicles with an automated training system); classroom  simulators for improving skills in functioning at the weapons  and in firing (TKNT-4U and TKNO-9 integrated tank and IFV  commander and gunner simulators); and field simulators (Geofil,  Konotop, Zaplatka) for performing Gunnery Course exercises.

Range equipment of  troop firing ranges, moving-target gunnery ranges, and fighting  vehicle gunnery training facilities support only individual  training. This does not allow creating a varied target  situation, let alone registering exercise parameters and trainee  actions. For example, there are no laterally moving targets for  firing a gun with a subcaliber tube. There also are none for  firing the authorized round. Moving targets displace only at  identical speed. It is possible to register hits only on four  targets, and the time for firing each round is not noted. Group  training of crew, squad and platoon is limited for these reasons  and is insufficiently effective. During a training period there  is one squad and platoon field firing in motorized rifle  subunits and only a platoon field firing in tank companies.    Such training practice does not produce the desired results  in live-fire exercises because there is no system for group  training in conducting fire as crews, squads and platoons in  weapon training classes. On the other hand, in the majority of  cases moving-target gunnery ranges, fighting vehicle gunnery  training facilities and troop firing ranges are set up on  unsuitable land, because of which it is impossible to take full  advantage of all combat qualities of new models of weapons and  equipment when they become operational.    Another problem arises here--upkeep and servicing of  training  facility installations. For example, soldiers must be diverted  on the eve of classes to clear moving-target roads and restore  targets and equipment. But the fact is, we have begun shifting  to contract service. It is apropos to ask who will perform the  preparatory work. The question of tables of organization and  technical outfitting of ranges, training fields and simulator  complexes continues to be very problematical. It will become  essentially impossible to use so-called non-TOE specialists from  combat units to service training equipment. It is fully obvious  that sooner or later it will be necessary to resolve this  long-standing problem.    It is no secret that whatever the level of officers' weapon  proficiency, that is the quality of the personnel's weapon  training. Therefore special attention must constantly be devoted  to the training of officers, especially platoon and company  commanders, for only a well trained commander is capable of  really teaching his subordinates something.    It must be admitted that here, too, not everything is well.  Despite a sufficient amount of allocated ammunition,  preparedness of platoon and company level officers leaves much  to be desired. Evidently considering the experience gained in  schools to be sufficient, some scorn preparatory exercises and,  taking advantage of the connivance of senior officers, also  often avoid performing practice and even test firings. And  superiors in turn check officers' preparedness only occasionally  and do not analyze their state of training. As a result, concern  for professional suitability becomes the lot of the officers  themselves.    Requirements of prewar courses, where officer weapon  training  was placed at the proper level, are instructive in this respect.  In particular, at that time it was prescribed that command  personnel (up to and including the regimental commander)  personally master weapons in the subunit and unit inventory.  Each year all command personnel were graded in firing any model  of small arm.    The problem of officer professionalism probably lies deeper.  We believe that military school programs do not provide  necessary skills for graduates to train subordinates. The fact  is, the basis of training always was considered to be the  teacher's graphic example in performing a particular procedure,  and the system of commanders' methods training that is in effect  is aimed at upgrading their skills. But the question arises:  What is there to upgrade if they do not have them?    One would like to believe that the questions raised and  suggestions expressed will be of certain interest to the  readers, although, of course, they are not indisputable.  Therefore we invite officers to express their opinions on the  topic broached. Many problems have piled up and we all have to  solve them.  Footnotes    1. Dear readers!

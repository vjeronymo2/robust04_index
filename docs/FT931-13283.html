			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / EC trade supremo has to hit the ground running: Sir Leon Brittan talks to Andrew Gowers and Ian Hargreaves Queen's Counsel, former British cabinet minister and erstwhile European trust-buster - knows what it means to hit the ground running. But even by his standards, the initiation to his new job as EC commissioner for external economic affairs has set a demanding pace. On January 2, four days before he formally took over the post, he found himself closeted all day with the seasoned US trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, discussing an unfamiliar and highly technical subject: the prospects for a deal in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. As power switched from President George Bush to his successor, Sir Leon has been plugging away to ensure that the trade talks do not get lost among competing priorities for the new administration. Also, as the European Commission attempts to regain its bearings after the tumult of the last 12 months, he has been labouring to carve out a fiefdom to replace his previous stronghold at the head of the competition directorate. In the US at least, he appears to be making headway. On Friday, within hours of the swearing-in of the new US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, contacts had been opened to arrange a visit by Sir Leon to Washington. If as he hopes a meeting can be fixed this week, it will be an important sign that the momentum has not completely gone out of the Uruguay Round. The European Commission vice-president is in no doubt as to where the onus for success or failure now lies. Indeed, he seems relieved that the Community is no longer in the dock as it was over agriculture last autumn. 'Everything depends on the attitude of the US administration,' he says. 'What we have to establish is how high a priority it is for (President Bill) Clinton. We just don't know.' Sir Leon insists that the negotiations have not been marking time this month, despite another clutch of missed deadlines. The EC and US now have a clearer understanding, he says, of what sort of deal they will be able to strike on market access, notably concerning tariffs on textiles. In the end, the talks that continued in Geneva right up to Mr Clinton's inauguration were scuppered by the lack of time and by the ebbing authority of the outgoing administration. It has not been easy for outsiders to predict the new team's stance towards the Gatt talks, and formulation of a coherent US policy may still have to await the outcome of Washington turf battles - - Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, Mr Robert Rubin, director of the National Economic Council, and Ms Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, all have claims to expertise in the trade area. But Sir Leon suspects that as the dust settles, Mr Clinton's approach will turn out to differ little from that of his predecessor. 'Nothing has happened so far to lead me to think they will take a fundamentally different view' from the Bush administration, he says. 'If that is correct, and they give it adequate priority, it should be possible, with difficulty for all, to reach agreement this year.' Even that heavily qualified prediction will strike many observers, weary of years of mistaken optimism over the Uruguay Round, as unrealistic. For one thing, the negotiators do not have all year; in theory at least, they are working to a deadline of March 2, the date on which the congressional 'fast-track' authority under which the US administration is negotiating expires. The reality, as Sir Leon knows, is not quite so clear-cut. Mr Clinton could go to Congress in March with a very general statement of intent to reach a Gatt deal, while still negotiating with the EC and other contracting parties. Congress would then have 90 days to approve. Though the commissioner does not say so himself, playing it long like this could have an extra advantage: it would mean that the EC itself would not have to pronounce on a Uruguay Round deal until after the French legislative elections in late March. At that point France, which threatened to veto the EC-US deal on agriculture at the end of last year, might be able to take a more relaxed view of the overall Gatt package. Could internal divisions within the Community or the Commission destroy this delicate timetable? Sir Leon does not seem concerned. He notes that Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the Commission, was party to an EC-US statement in December urging completion of the round by January 15 and that 'not one voice has been raised, within or outside the Commission' against his energetic pursuit of further talks. Sir Leon clearly wants to use his new post - with its weighty portfolio covering trade relations with other industrial countries, anti-dumping policy and, crucially, aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - to set the tone for a more outward-looking European Commission. On eastern Europe, for example, he wants to make a strong push to get EC governments to accelerate the improvement of market access for central European countries' products, including some categories that have hitherto been regarded as too domestically sensitive for liberalisation. 'There is no better way of helping the countries of central and eastern Europe than expanding trade opportunities,' he says, a tune which he will probably be heard playing with great frequency this year. But what of the new Commission itself? Three weeks into its term, it is attracting mixed notices. There have been reports of friction - not least between Sir Leon and Mr Hans van den Broek, who has responsibility for the EC's external political relations and enlargement. There are also suggestions that the new team may slacken off in its enforcement of the single market and competition policy, and mutterings that the Commission is chastened and demoralised after having been used by member states as a whipping boy last year. Sir Leon dismisses such talk. He says that what some see as new-found timidity on the part of the Commission reflects the Community's desire to apply 'subsidiarity' - to take decisions and implement them at the appropriate level - and in the case of the single market, a sensible period of stock-taking. On external policy, he sees no reason why he should not be able to work closely and constructively with his fellow liberal Mr Van den Broek. Whether the Commission as a whole is more or less economically liberal than its predecessor is, he insists, 'much too early to say. We haven't had any votes yet, and that's what sorts things out.' Nevertheless, even Sir Leon cannot quite disguise the overall political uncertainty that pervades the Brussels executive these days. This Commission is, after all, appointed only for two years; it may lose Mr Delors to French politics before the end of 1994; and the jockeying is already under way as to who will succeed him. Might Sir Leon be a candidate, as is being mooted privately within the British government? He laughs, and will say only: 'I think that that is not a question that has arisen at the moment.'  ---------------------------------------------     THE SIZE OF THE EC TELEPHONE MARKET  --------------------------------------------- Total revenue 1990 (Ecu m)  --------------------------------------------- Germany                     21,227 UK                          18,671 France                      17,988 Italy                       14,537 Spain                        6,225 Netherlands                  4,193 Belgium                      2,371 Denmark                      2,113 Ireland                        987 Portugal                       970 Greece                         153 Luxembourg                     153  --------------------------------------------- Source: European Committee  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> OZONE LEVELS DOUBLED IN 100 YEARS, EXPERTS SAY  </P> <P> The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more  than doubled in the last 100 years, and it will likely rise at an even faster  rate in the next 30 years, researchers said last week.  </P> <P> Researchers from Britain's Harwell Laboratory said recent measurements of  ground-level ozone indicate that levels of the gas are, on the average, twice  as high as recorded by French researchers in Paris in the late 1800s.  </P> <P> When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's  ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. But  when found near ground level, the highly corrosive form of oxygen can cause  respiratory distress.  </P> <P> Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is formed through complex  reactions with nitrogen oxide and other chemicals found in automobile and  industrial emissions containing nitrogen oxide.  </P> <P> Based on projected increases in nitrogen oxide emissions, researchers said  their computer simulations show that between now and 2020, concentrations of  ground-level or, "tropospheric," ozone will rise "at a rate faster than during  the past 100 years." In fact, the study, in the journal Nature, found the  increase in tropospheric ozone during the next 30 years could equal that for  the entire last century.  </P></p>

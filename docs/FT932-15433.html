			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / No farewell to arms yet: Europe When the cold war collapsed, the two superpowers marked the revolution in world history by agreeing deep cuts in their nuclear weapons, in the two Start treaties of 1991 and 1992. If these are ratified and implemented, the US and Russia should reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals from around 11,000-12,000 warheads to some 3,000-3,500 by the year 2003. Of course, even 3,000 warheads would be more than enough to blow the world to smithereens. Nevertheless, it really seemed as though the nuclear shadow might be receding. Some people even leaped to the extravagant conclusion that nuclear arms control had gone about as far as it could go. It has not taken long for such euphoria to look crassly premature. For one thing, the Start treaties may themselves be capsized in the back-wash of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. For another, North Korea, which has certainly not recognised the end of the cold war, has decided to make its own bit of history, by walking out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Start treaties are in jeopardy, because Ukraine appears to be drawing back from earlier undertakings to become a non-nuclear state, and it has not yet committed itself to surrender to Russia the inter-continental missiles and bombers which belonged to the former Soviet Union and were based in Ukrainian territory. Ukraine's strategic motives are not entirely clear. It may believe that this arsenal of 176 ICBMs and 34 bombers could give them an ultimate security guarantee amid the manifold uncertainties of the region. On the other hand, it may just be holding on its nuclear weaponry as a bargaining chip, either to exchange against foreign financial aid, or to secure some form of security guarantee from the west. Either way, Ukraine is playing ducks and drakes with the fragile structures of arms control. It is hanging back on the ratification of the 1991 Start-1 nuclear weapons treaty; and so long as Ukraine fails to ratify Start-1, Start-2 cannot be ratified, and will obviously not be implemented. Moreover, Ukraine is delaying signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is the bedrock of the international nuclear arms control regime. The purpose of this treaty, signed in 1968, was to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons, by having two categories of signatories - a handful of states with nuclear weapons which would undertake not to supply them to other countries, and a large number of non-nuclear states, which would undertake to remain so. Ukraine's delay in signing the NPT may well be an indication that it has not yet decided whether to claim the status of a nuclear-weapon state. But its hesitations can hardly fail to threaten the credibility of the arms control regimes. Some observers fear that Ukraine's example could have a knock-on effect on Kazakhstan, which also inherited ICBM nuclear missiles from the Soviet Union, and might be induced to follow Ukraine's example. The North Korean case is the other side of the coin. It joined the NPT in 1985 as a non-nuclear-weapon state, and as such is subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But it seems that North Korea may have been working on a nuclear bomb project on the sly. The US had suspected this for some time. The IAEA started detecting disturbing evidence last autumn, and earlier this year demanded to inspect secret facilities in Yongbyon. The North Koreans staged an indignant refusal, and then announced they were walking out of the NPT (as they are entitled to do). The IAEA has denounced the North Koreans, and has reported them to the United Nations Security Council. But it is unlikely the council will be able to settle the issue. For one thing, the Chinese (who have their own reasons for resisting UN interference in the internal affairs of member states) will almost certainly veto sanctions. In any case, sanctions are unlikely to have much effect on the closed regime of North Korea. Over the years the NPT has had more than its share of success. Most UN members are members. After long resistance, France and China have finally signed up as weapon states. South Africa has signed up as a non-weapon state after secretly developing, and then secretly abandoning, a nuclear weapon programme. The problem is that the North Korean case shows clearly the imperfections of the NPT as a bulwark against the spread of nuclear arms. Iraq is a treaty signatory, and certainly had (and indeed may still have) a secret nuclear weapons programme. Iran is a signatory, and probably it has nuclear ambitions too. Moreover, the discipline of the NPT seems likely to decline in future. First, nuclear technology will become increasingly accessible to any country which can muster the economic and scientific resources. Second, there is a danger that Soviet nuclear weapons will be sold secretly to developing countries. There are reports that at least one weapon has already been sold to Iran. Third, the end of the cold war means that the restraining effect of the superpower confrontation has been withdrawn, and so regional conflicts become more likely. The real test of the NPT is how long it can survive as a treaty dividing the world into the haves and the have-nots. As the price for their self-denial, the have-nots have put a number of demands to the nuclear states, including a ban on testing and deep cuts in arsenals. These conditions will be put to the test in 1995, when the treaty formally expires. If the signatories do not decide to extend it, we could be in for the kind of nuclear arms race which the superpowers have just given up.</p>

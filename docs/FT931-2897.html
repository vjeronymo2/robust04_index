			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit National records 9% rise CREDIT National, the French corporate banking group, saw net profits rise by 9.1 per cent to FFr585.9m (Dollars 103.6m) in 1992 from FFr537.2m in 1991, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. In spite of having to increase provisions - mainly because of the need to make write-downs on its property portfolio and investments - the group managed a healthy 15 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr725m. Net banking income was stable at FFr2.38bn.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Governor warns of inflation 'false dawn' MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday warned against premature optimism about next week's expected sharp fall in inflation. 'There are inevitably false dawns in the battle against inflation,' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said at the University of Exeter. The headline rate, as measured by the retail prices index, is expected to fall next Friday to around 6.2 per cent in April from 8.2 per cent. The financial markets have already begun to anticipate that its publication will serve as a trigger for the Bank to cut the bank base rate below 12 per cent. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said underlying inflationary pressures remained stubborn in spite of the predicted RPI fall, which he said would reveal 'no more' than the effect of last year's imposition of the community charge dropping out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent interest-rate reductions. In addition, difficulties in measuring inflation accurately provided policymakers with an incentive to be cautious about easing monetary policy on the basis of the RPI alone. The RPI had failed to reflect the sharp rise in house prices in late 1988 and early 1989, then had failed to come down as prices responded to the tightening of monetary policy. The governor urged policymakers to look at a broad range of official indicators.</p>

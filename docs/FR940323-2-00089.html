			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects supported under SPRANS are expected to be part of community-wide, comprehensive initiatives, to reflect appropriate coordination of primary care and public health activities, and to target HRSA resources effectively to fill gaps in the Nation's health system for at-risk mothers and children. This applies especially to projects in the 15 communities in the Nation which have received grants from HRSA under the Healthy Start initiative. Grantees in these communities providing services related to activities of a Healthy Start program are expected to coordinate their projects with the Healthy Start program efforts. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen Area Indian Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County, IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

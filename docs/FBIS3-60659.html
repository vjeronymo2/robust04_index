			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressler And All That"] </F>   [Text] The reported U.S. move to repeal the Pressler  amendment is the latest indication of changing American  diplomacy towards South Asia. Ms. Robin Raphel's absurd remarks  on Kashmir, questioning the Instrument of Accession; Mr. Warren  Christopher's letter of appreciation to the Prime Minister on  the peaceful solution of the Hazratbal crisis; and now the move  to scrap the Pressler amendment, paradoxically, are all part of  a change. The Pressler amendment came into effect on October 1,  1990 mainly to chastise the countries of South Asia which were  refusing to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and surrender  the right to acquire nuclear weapons. In Pakistan's case, the  punishment was to cut off military and economic aid to which  that country had got so accustomed that its elite could not do  without it. The amendment has been a major irritant between  Islamabad and Washington. Amending this amendment would give Mr.  Clinton freedom to resume aid to Pakistan. It would give an  instant reward to premier Benazir Bhutto, currently America's  favourite among Pak leaders. However, by implication this move  is more anti-Indian than pro-Pakistan. It carries strong  implications for India. The stated purpose of the U.S.  decision, the Americans say, is not to allow Pakistan to go  nuclear but encourage it to look for a more "equitable and  non-discriminatory" application of punitive measures against  nuclear threshold countries. Another justification provided is  that the Pressler law "no longer serves U.S. nonproliferation  objectives in South Asia." It is a well-known fact that New  Delhi and Washington are not on the same wavelength on the NPT.  While the U.S. wants India to sign the NPT on the dotted lines,  India regards the treaty as unacceptable because it is  discriminatory. Pakistan has expressed its willingness to sign  the NPT, provided the U.S. forces India to submit on the NPT.  The idea is to give currency to propaganda that India does not  want a nuclear-free South Asia. The pro-Pakistani lobby in the  U.S. has been arguing that Pressler's restrictions target  Pakistan alone and no other country. Pakistan's ruling elite  wants Pressler employed against India, although this country has  no military nuclear programme. It appears that Mr. Clinton has  accepted this convoluted logic. It is rightly apprehended that  the new law, when approved by the U.S. Congress, can be used to  deny American aid to India. And correspondingly aid can be  resumed to Pakistan. India's political leaders have so long  been passive on this issue that it is probably futile for them  to say anything different from the mantra they have repeated  these last 30 years. Our so-called open option policy should be  made really open. Ms. Bhutto's assertion that Pakistan's  nuclear programme cannot be capped and Mr. Clinton's move to  scrap the Pressler amendment should persuade India to undertake  an in-depth review of the whole issue.</p>

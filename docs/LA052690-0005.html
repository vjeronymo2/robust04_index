			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN SLAYING OF DRIVER AFTER TRAFFIC DISPUTE  </P> <P> Howard F. Barton Jr. pleaded not guilty Friday to a charge that he murdered  Marco Sanchez on Feb. 22. after a traffic dispute involving Sanchez and  Barton's daughter.  </P> <P> Barton, a Pacific Beach real estate broker and a La Jolla resident, said, "That  is absolutely correct," when Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez asked him if  he had entered a not-guilty plea.  </P> <P> Rodriguez set Barton's trial for Aug. 15.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Rodriguez denied a motion by defense attorney Clyde  Munsell to release Barton on bail. Barton's $500,000 bail was revoked May 14 by  Municipal Judge Rafael Arreola after a preliminary hearing. At the end of the  hearing, Arreola called Barton a danger to the public, ordered him to stand  trial on the murder charge and revoked his bail. Barton has been in County Jail  downtown ever since.  </P> <P> On Friday, Munsell asked Rodriguez to authorize an evidentiary hearing so  Munsell could argue again that Barton had a right to be freed on bail while  awaiting trial. Rodriguez refused and advised Munsell to appeal to the 4th  District Court of Appeal if he believes Barton should be released on bail.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL STUDENTS OFTEN ABUSED, SURVEYS FIND;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: VERBAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MISTREATMENT MAY TURN THEM INTO LESS CARING  DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS SAY.  </P> <P> Medical students, who can best serve their future patients if they become  humane and caring physicians, frequently suffer severe verbal, psychological or  even physical abuse from their superiors that warps their professional  development, according to two pioneering surveys of students being published  today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> The separate surveys of about 500 students, conducted at the University of  Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and the University of South Florida  College of Medicine in Tampa, document an "obvious" problem that needs to be  solved, according to Dr. DeWitt C. Baldwin Jr., director of the American  Medical Assn.'s division of medical education research. Baldwin said the  findings are buttressed by similar data collected on another 700 students in  yet-to-be-published surveys at 10 other medical schools.  </P> <P> "The physician who has been treated in this manner may well carry over those  attitudes and behaviors to their patients and students," said Baldwin, who was  a co-author of the Florida study.  </P> <P> Publication of the studies comes at a critical time for the nation's 126  medical schools. Over the last decade, the annual number of applicants for  approximately 17,000 first-year slots has plummeted from 36,727 in 1981 to  26,915 in 1989, according to the Assn. of American Medical Colleges.  </P> <P> The decline in applicants has been attributed to many factors. These range from  the dehumanizing aspects of medical school and residency training to limits on  fees, fear of malpractice suits and a widespread perception of public  disenchantment with the profession.  </P> <P> "If we want to attract well-adjusted and talented young people to medical  school, we can ill afford to have an environment that is perceived by some to  be aversive, hostile or abusive," wrote the University of South Florida  research team, which was led by psychiatry professors K. Harnett Sheehan and  Dr. David W. Sheehan.  </P> <P> The conventional wisdom about medical education has been that regimentation and  discipline are more likely to produce good physicians than a "kinder, gentler"  learning environment. Many medical students, however, do not share this  perspective, the new studies reveal.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the 431 Colorado students who responded anonymously to a 1985  questionnaire said they had been abused at some time during medical school,  with two-thirds describing an experience that was of "major importance and very  upsetting." One-sixth of those reporting abuse said that the most serious  episode would "always affect them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Florida Survey  </P> <P> At the University of South Florida, one-third of the 75 third-year medical  students surveyed in 1988 indicated that they "had considered dropping out of  medical school," and one-fourth claimed they would have "chosen a different  profession if they had known in advance about the extent of mistreatment they  would experience." The third year is traditionally considered the most  stressful because students are intensively immersed for the first time in the  pressure-filled world of hospital practice.  </P> <P> One Florida student reported "he had been kicked in the testicular region by an  attending physician and required medical attention for his injury."  </P> <P> One Colorado student being instructed in eye diagnosis techniques balked at  examining a classmate in "obvious pain" from a corneal abrasion accidentally  inflicted by another student. "When I explained this to the supervising  physician, he said, 'Oh good, this gives us an opportunity to learn how to  force a patient to cooperate even if they are in pain.' "  </P> <P> Another Colorado student was hit so hard on the knuckles with a surgical  instrument by an attending surgeon while being taught to suture that "after the  operation, my knuckles were bleeding, and I now have a scar on the back of my  right hand."  </P> <P> Authors of the studies acknowledged that such instances of physical abuse are  extreme, and that the surveys may be biased because they are based on the  students' subjective judgments about past events. But they said medical school  faculty and administrators are unlikely to take the problem seriously unless  egregious cases are widely publicized. In addition, they said the perception of  significant abuse could not be explained away.  </P> <P> When asked about the studies, Dr. August Swanson, a vice-president of the  American Assn. of Medical Colleges in Washington, agreed the percentages  "reflected a problem" but added that "exactly how pervasive it might be is open  to investigation."  </P> <P> Caroline Reich, a fourth-year medical student at Emory University in Atlanta  and president of a group of medical students that advises the medical colleges  association, said the articles "ring very true."  </P> <P> The authors called for medical schools to take remedial steps, some of which  the Colorado and Florida schools have already taken, such as educational  campaigns and the establishment of grievance committees, disciplinary  procedures and confidential counseling programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Out in the Open  </P> <P> Baldwin said that in most instances medical students now believe that "it won't  do any good (to report abuse), and 'I would probably get screwed if I did.' "  </P> <P> Dr. Henry K. Silver, the principal author of the Colorado study, said, "Just  bringing (abusive behavior) out in the open will make a difference."  </P> <P> But Dr. Martin Pops, dean of students at UCLA Medical School, cautioned that  "what one student would interpret as abuse, other students wouldn't." He said  it is his impression that medical student abuse is "not a major problem" at  UCLA.  </P> <P> The new studies are based on carefully designed surveys, and in this respect  differ from anecdotal reports of medical student mistreatment and other  information sources, such as Dr. Samuel Shem's satiric 1978 novel "The House of  God," anthropologist and physician Dr. Melvin Konner's 1987 book "Becoming a  Doctor," and the television series "St. Elsewhere," which was aired from 1982  to 1988.  </P> <P> Authors of the medical school studies said no comparable surveys have been  conducted at law, dental or veterinary schools, but they speculated that  similar problems may exist in other professions. The only other groups that  have been "systematically studied as victims of abuse are children and battered  wives," the University of South Florida's David Sheehan said.  </P> <P> Abuse was defined in the Colorado study as "harmful, injurious or offensive"  treatment, in particular "unnecessary or avoidable acts or words of a negative  nature." Both studies differentiated between experiences that might be  considered unavoidable parts of the education process, such as long hours and  sleep deprivation, and other episodes, such as sexual harassment, verbal  humiliation and unjustifiable threats of failing grades or "ruining" careers.  </P> <P> Baldwin, of the American Medical Assn., said he has coordinated similar surveys  within the last several years at 10 other "representative" medical schools; he  declined to name the institutions and said there are no plans to identify the  schools. The results, which are being prepared for publication, "are  essentially the same," he said.  </P></p>

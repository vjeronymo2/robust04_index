			<p>BFN     [Text] The government announced on 23 May a decision to  ban exports to and merchant trade with Haiti by revising part of  the Foreign Exchange Control Order and the Export Trade Control  Order. The measure has been taken in line with a full-scale UN  embargo against Haiti to oust the country's military government  from power.    Japan will start an import embargo against Haiti on 27 May  after revising the orders on 24 May.    The government's newly decided economic sanctions against  Haiti comprise: 1) a ban on the export of all cargoes to Haiti,  and 2) a ban on merchant trade with Haiti.    Japan made the announcement following the UN Security  Council's decision to impose a full-scale embargo against Haiti  to urge the Haiti military government to step down and restore  civilian rule.    Japanese exports to Haiti in 1993 were worth about 600  million yen.</p>

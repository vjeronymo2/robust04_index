			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Kandir] </F>   [Text] Vice President Albert Gore made a proposal for a  presidential summit conference of the Americas' democratic  countries during 1994 after the U.S. Congress approved NAFTA.  The conference will be a first step for eventual and future  hemispheric integration.    Many people see Gore's proposal as a mere word game. These  people argue that the proposal was too vague and did not define  a schedule or procedures. They also stress the improbability of  NAFTA's extension, at least not to the point of accommodating a  free trade zone covering the three Americas, and note the  resistance of some American economic sectors that are very  sensitive to broader integration.    These are all valuable arguments, but the question is, what  are the practical implications? Should Brazil echo Gore's  proposal or should we pretend not to have heard anything? The  answer depends on people's position as to whether hemispheric  integration on Brazil's long-term horizon is in the country's  strategic interest.    We should not take too long to answer this question, even if  it is only because U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  will come to the country soon, and we must suppose that Gore's  proposal will be one of the topics on his agenda.    In my opinion, there are more than enough arguments to urge  Brazil to give clear signals about its interest in this  integration. Besides, we cannot overlook the new market's trade  potential. NAFTA, in its present form, has a joint GDP of $6.5  trillion. When extended it will have a joint GDP of nearly $7.3  trillion, and will be bigger than the EEC ($5.8 trillion), and  practically equal to the GDP of all the other countries in the  world together ($7.6 trillion, excluding EEC countries).    This does not mean Brazil should abandon its  multilateralism,  which was reinforced by the Uruguay Round of talks and the  efforts to create Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. If  Brazil looks the other way at Gore's proposal, it will be  turning its back on a market that is 12 times larger than  Mercosur without holding links to any bloc of any importance at  a time when we still do not know which model will prevail in  international economic relations in the long run.    The risk of this lack of participation is aggravated by the  notorious fact that some or our neighbors, including and above  all Argentina, our main Mercosur partner, aspire to join NAFTA  and are taking steps in that direction.    Turning our back on eventual hemispheric integration is not  advisable for a country that needs and is making every effort to  attract productive investments. From the point of view of  investors, a refusal to work for integration would increase  risks at the time of investing resources in Brazil because it  will reinforce the threat of commercial isolation in case  multilateral relations deteriorate and economic blocs become  fortresses closed to the outside (a risk we cannot rule out in  any way, particularly in the case of the European bloc, because  of a complicated integration process, and possible steps  backward in the former Soviet Union).    It is obvious that the search for accelerated integration at  any cost is silly and harmful to national interests. It probably  will result in the destruction of entire Brazilian industries  that today are in no condition to compete with U.S.  manufacturing production.    But today's decisions will condition the future and it is  necessary to look at the problem from a dynamic perspective. If  our house is cleaned up this year and the process of  constitutional revision ends with positive results, the country  will have everything to start an age of sustained growth as of  1995. And growth and the possibilities of improving Brazil's  social problems will increase if the country improves its  prospects for joining other dynamic and broadened markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stoyan Tsvetkov: "Racist and Gypsies"] </F>   [Text] Pretenders of Hitler and Mussolini's dark glory  have appeared in Bulgaria.    The extravagant Father Georgi Gelemenov, leader of one of  the  dozens of phantom parties who owes his popularity only to his  scandalous statements and unexpected political turns, has  declared a war on the Gypsies.    Naturally, the Gypsies also declared a war on the  racist-Christian Democrat. Ethnic tension in Plovdiv and other  cities is increasing. Without underestimating the power of the  authorities or overestimating the possibilities of the  "skinheads," there is no guarantee that bloody ethnic clashes  will not take place in Bulgaria in 1994.    There is, however, two sides to the coin. By their  inactivity in anything related to resolving the Gypsies' social  problems, the state institutions are facilitating the growth of  the crime rate among them and the emergence of racist moods  among a part of the Bulgarian society. This is a fertile soil  for the growth of political adventurists of the ilk of the  aforementioned priest.    One way or another, Bulgaria is not immune to the xenophobia  virus. This allows other interested groups to implement their  political ambitions under the noble slogan of fighting against  chauvinism and racism.</p>

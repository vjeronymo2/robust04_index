			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian gold output slumps by 5 tonnes BRAZILIAN GOLD output slumped to 32 tonnes in the first half of this year from 37 tonnes in the corresponding period of 1991, according to figures released by the National Gold Association (Anoro). Production for the year is expected to reach 70 tonnes, down from 78 tonnes in 1991, said Mr Nathan Blanche, Anoro's president. Production is divided in roughly equal shares between independent 'garimpo' extraction and industrial operations, estimated Mr Blanche. Brazilian output has declined dramatically in recent years, mostly because of lower 'garimpo' output. Mr Blanche believes that lower gold prices, higher fuel costs, and a tighter margin between the black market 'parallel' dollar, used by 'garimpeiros', and the commercial rate of exchange have reduced profitability for freelance miners. Industrial output is actually increasing, albeit slowly. In 1990, it accounted for just 35.3 per cent of national output. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled Brazilian mining giant, hopes to boost its gold output of 7.1 tonnes last year to nearly 12 by the end of the year. Brazilian investment in research and prospecting for all minerals may reach only Dollars 40m this year, one-third of what was spent in the quest for new deposits in 1988, according the Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais, a state-owned prospecting firm. Constitutional limitations prohibiting majority ownership of mining concerns by multinationals contributed significantly to lower investment, said Mr Blanche.</p>

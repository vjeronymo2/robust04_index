			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly  Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee has in effect  cancelled a plan to send a fact-finding team to Russia to look  into the human rights conditions of North Korean loggers in  Siberia.    The committee initially planned to send four of its  legislators to Moscow and Khabarovsk to observe loggers'  conditions before a special assembly sitting opens in May.    "The dispatch of a fact-finding team is not always needed in  determining the conditions of North Korean loggers there," Kang  Sin- che, chairman of the committee's ad hoc committee on North  Korean loggers, said on Tuesday.    He said Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visits Moscow in the  immediate future and there have been other frequent contacts  between the two countries over the diplomatic channel.    Kang said he was withholding the dispatch. But, the plan  seems to have been scrapped altogether.    "At the moment, we have no plan to send a survey team to  Russia," an official of the Foreign Affairs and Unification  Committee said.</p>

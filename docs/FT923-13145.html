			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays above 17,000 in spite of profit-taking PROFIT-TAKING after Monday's strong gains depressed share prices in thin trading yesterday, but the Nikkei average managed to remain above the 17,000 mark, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 137.10 down at 17,064.63. The index reached a high of 17,258.73 in the morning session on small-lot buying, falling to the day's low of 16,961.76 in the afternoon. Turnover picked up slightly to 200m shares from 193m. Daily average volume for the first half of this year has fallen to 263m shares, down about 75 per cent from its peak of 1bn shares in 1988. Declines led advances by 543 to 345, with 199 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.80 to 1,294.15, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 2.30 to 1,020.63. Share prices moved in parallel to the futures market, which fluctuated on short-term trading by institutional investors. Traders said institutions were selling the futures contracts short and buying back at lower levels. 'Some domestic institutions are taking profits on small-lot purchases made at lower levels, but other than that, there is not much incentive to do anything,' commented Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Late afternoon reports that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had commented that a further easing in monetary policy was unnecessary prompted light selling. Traders, however, were comforted by the fact that the Nikkei was well supported around 17,000. Toshiba, the most active stock of the day, ended Y1 easier at Y665. It initially rose on reports of the company's joint development of advanced semiconductor devices with International Business Machines, of the US, and Siemens, of Germany, but later retreated on profit-taking. Nippon Credit Bank weakened Y120 to Y5,380 on reports of large outstanding bad debt at its non-bank financial affiliates. Other banking issues were unaffected by the news: Sumitomo Bank firmed Y10 to Y1,400. Electric furnace steel makers were higher on hopes that inventory adjustment for H-shaped beams was under progress. Tokyo Steel gained Y30 to Y3,140 on speculation that the company may revise its earnings estimates upwards for the current year. Toa Steel was also actively traded but closed unchanged at Y1,230. Oil issues lost ground on fears that weakening demand for oil products as a result of the economic slowdown would lead to lower profits. Showa Shell Sekiyu, a leading oil refiner, fell Y50 to Y1,140. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 67.36 to 19,531.81 in volume of 9.1m shares. Roundup SPECULATION in Seoul and Bangkok, and improving economic fundamentals in New Zealand, produced the leading gains in the region yesterday. SEOUL staged a rebound after a two-week downtrend, on speculation that the government would bring in measures to boost the market. The composite index rose 14.54 to 527.08 and, while turnover remained slow, it recovered from Won107.4bn to Won136.2bn. Big manufacturing stocks led the recovery after their fall to 1992 lows. Yukong, the country's largest oil company, advanced by its upper limit of Won1,000 to Won23,100. NEW ZEALAND moved on an inflation rate of just 1.0 per cent for the 12 months to June 30, which extended the decline in domestic bond yields and left the NZSE-40 index 15.73 higher at 1,582.08 in turnover up from NZDollars 22.1m to NZDollars 39.3m. Lower bond yields created buying interest in high-yielding stocks such as Telecom, the national telephone company, which rose 8 cents to NZDollars 2.20 in heavy volume. Brokers linked the renewed activity in the stock to buying from the US, where Telecom is traded in ADR form. BANGKOK speculators flocked into the market in the afternoon in search of finance and property issues. The SET index gained 7.41 to 741.87 in turnover of Bt6.29bn. Hemaraj Land and Development, which made its market debut on Friday, hit its 10 per cent upper limit with a rise of Bt10 to Bt119 in turnover of Bt537.6m. HONG KONG registered its third consecutive rise in active trading, although its final gain was of token quality after an afternoon wave of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 11.34 higher at 6,097.19 in turnover up from HKDollars 3.635bn to HKDollars 3.74bn. Follow-through buying of HSBC and Cathay Pacific led the market up, the former climbing 50 cents to HKDollars 52.50 after Monday's HKDollars 3 spurt, and Cathay by a further 40 cents to HKDollars 13.00.</p>

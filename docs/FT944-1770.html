			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Call for school science reforms Reforms of science teaching up to the age of 16 have failed to expand the numbers taking the science A-level qualifications needed for university, says a report published today. Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of the University of Manchester say in a report for the Engineering Council that the gap between the new GCSE exams - taken at 16 - and A-levels has contributed to the fall in the proportion of sixth-form students studying science. The new arrangements for GCSE, which were introduced to implement the national curriculum for England and Wales, allow for 'double-science' entries. In these pupils study all three science subjects in the time normally allotted to two subjects. This was thought necessary to allow enough time in school timetables for the other subjects made compulsory under the curriculum. This option has grown swiftly in popularity and now accounts for 82 per cent of all GCSE entries compared with 22.3 per cent in 1989. The proportion of 16-year-olds attempting any science subject has also risen and last year stood at 83 per cent, a rise of 30 percentage points in four years. A-level science, which is still separated into specialist subjects, has shown sharp falls in applications, however, with falls of 18.7 per cent in physics and 8.1 per cent in chemistry over the same period. The authors of the report suggest that A-levels should be reformed so that five rather than three subjects become the norm. This would make it easier to take two sciences as part of a broad curriculum, as is now possible at GCSE. A-level syllabuses would also start where GCSE ended. They say separate recording of performance in biology, chemistry and physics as part of the double-award GCSE would make it much easier for sixth-form teachers to bridge the gap.

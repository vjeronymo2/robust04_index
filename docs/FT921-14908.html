			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Ford workers told to raise productivity WORKERS at Ford's Fiesta production plant at Dagenham have been told that productivity must improve sharply if the plant is to be sure of having a role in building the present model's successor. Ford denied last night that it had issued an ultimatum to the Dagenham workforce, but acknowledged that a series of targets had been set for improving the plant's performance. If these were not met, the 'ultimate sanction is that the business can be lost', Ford said. According to a confidential internal Ford memo, the 7,000 workers employed on Fiesta production at Dagenham required 52.2 hours to build a car in 1990. That compares with 33.3 at Ford's Valencia plant in Spain and only 29.9 hours at its Cologne plant in Germany. Dagenham's figure for 1991 was forecast to improve to 40 hours per car, compared with only marginal improvements at Valencia and Cologne. However, Dagenham is understood to have achieved only about 46 hours per car, resulting in the setting of performance targets for this year in a series of briefings to employees by Ford's vice-president of manufacturing, Mr Albert Caspers. Although wages rates are lower than in the continental plants, Ford's UK labour and overhead costs are substantially higher, the company maintains. Ford's present Fiesta model is only two years old and is unlikely to be replaced before the mid 1990s. Nevertheless, it has been indicated to Dagenham employees that fundamental decisions about how production of the replacement will be distributed are likely to be taken within the next 12 months. In spite of the productivity gap, Ford has been relatively complimentary about the improvements already achieved at the plant since Sierra production was withdrawn and it began producing only Fiestas two years ago. In 1989, for example, it was taking Dagenham 59.4 hours per car. The improvement has been sufficient for Ford to have resumed signficant exports to the Continent. About half Dagenham's total output of 223,000 Fiestas was exported last year.</p>

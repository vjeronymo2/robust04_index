			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Record declines to Pounds 1.25m Pre-tax profits at Record Holdings, the maker of hand and bench tools, plunged from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 1.25m in 1992. Group turnover increased to Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 26m) with exports up more than a quarter, while UK sales declined to Pounds 16m, against Pounds 16.2m. Redundancy costs increased sharply from Pounds 132,000 to Pounds 891,000 as the group lost more than 100 employees. It made an exceptional provision of Pounds 395,000 against the cost of transferring plant from Warrington to Sheffield, which was partly offset by Pounds 134,000 exceptional profits (losses Pounds 189,000) on disposal of property in Canada. The board proposes to hold the final dividend at 2.45p maintaining the total for the year at 3.6p uncovered by earnings per share of 2.2p, compared with 6.9p last time.</p>

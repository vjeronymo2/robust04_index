			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Improved margins help boost Haeco The Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of the Swire Pacific Group, has reported a 15 per cent increase in profits, to HKDollars 447m (USDollars 57.8m) for calendar 1993 from HKDollars 387.9m the previous year. It attributed the rise to improved margins. Profits rose on the back of good use of facilities, boosted productivity and stringent cost controls, the company said. Line maintenance revenues improved as Haeco took in hand a 12 per cent bigger slice of aircraft movements at the colony's Kai Tak airport. Concerns over the high level of inflation in the colony, of around 8.5 per cent, have prompted the drive for enhanced productivity. Earnings per share rose to HKDollars 2.41, against HKDollars 2.09 in 1992. Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 71 cents, up from 64 cents the previous year. The results were in line with market expectations. The company said it was continuing talks with the Provisional Airport Authority over a licence to operate maintenance facilities at the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. At the same time, it is anticipating that volumes at Kai Tak will continue to rise and expects to be able to secure healthy levels of work this year.</p>

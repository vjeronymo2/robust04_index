			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN SEEKS TO BETTER ACCURACY OF STATISTICS  </P> <P> The production of Britain's economic statistics, notorious for major errors  over the past year, is being reorganized, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  said.  </P> <P> Much information has been misleading. In the third quarter of last year, when  the government was raising interest rates to cool an expanding economy, the  gross domestic product figures showed a sharp fall in the value of goods and  services.  </P> <P> The reorganization will give a bigger role to an enlarged Central Statistical  Office. The agency will report to Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (9): Corporate dilemmas / Jonathan Schwarz discusses the agonising choice of a headquarters The internationalisation of business has meant that multinational companies have needed to establish regional headquarters for coordinating and supervising their activity in a number of countries. The emergence of regional trading blocks such as the EU and more latterly the EEA, Nafta as well as other regional free trade areas has focused attention increasingly on centralisation of management activities within those areas. Headquarters locations are chosen for a variety of reasons apart from the tax rules. These will include the qualify of life for senior executives, proximity to markets, communications and quality of local labour sources. Many countries offer incentives and tailor their tax rules to attract headquarters operations on the basis that they create employment, particularly in services, and may encourage other local investment. Headquarters operations comprise a wide range of activities. Traditionally, this has included the provision of head office services to members of a multinational group including administration and financing, accounting, lobbying, marketing and advertising. Increasingly in regional trading blocks, the functions are often expanded beyond group financing and administration to group procurement and purchasing of raw material and selling to multinational customers. Within Europe, a number of countries have vied with each other to attract headquarters operations. A number of countries including France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK have all offered so-called 'cost plus' arrangements. In essence, this means tax authorities have been prepared to apply transfer pricing rules on the provision of group administrative services on the basis of a profit mark-up element charged over the cost of providing the services to group companies. The attraction of such arrangements for multinational companies is that they bring certainty to the overall tax position of the group by agreeing in advance the contribution of those activities to the group as a whole. The manner in which the arrangements are provided varies enormously. The UK, for example, which attracts the highest number of headquarters operations in Europe, has no formal rulings process. Others, such as the Belgium Coordination Centre, have a formal legal basis. Similarly, although the cost plus arrangement is widely used, the actual application varies from country to country. The profit mark-up may range anywhere between 5 and and 30 per cent. The costs which are to be included and excluded also vary from one country to another. Similarly, all activities are not viewed in the same way by all tax authorities. Activities which relate directly to the business of the multinational company itself such as group purchasing or selling will probably be most closely scrutinised. A second important headquarters function is that of group holding company. In Europe, this market has historically been dominated by the Netherlands with other countries such as Luxembourg or Austria playing a very much secondary role. The passing of the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive has however opened up the playing field considerably. The Directive requires EU member states to eliminate withholding tax on dividends to parent companies in other EU member states. It also requires member states where parent companies are located effectively to eliminate double taxation on these distributions by either exempting them from tax or giving credit for corporate income tax paid by the subsidiary. The impact of this Directive and amendments that have been made in several member states offer a wider variety of choice to the multinational company in choosing a European group holding company location. Although the UK attracts a significant number of administrative headquarters operations, the impact of Advance Corporation Tax previously placed the UK off-limits as a holding company location. The introduction of an International Headquarters Company Regime in the 1994 Finance Act is a move towards attracting such companies. An International Headquarters Company is one that is essentially foreign owned. No ACT is payable on dividends paid to its foreign parent company out of dividends received from its own foreign subsidiaries. The new regime falls short of the ideal requirements for an international holding company, but is widely regarded as a step in the right direction. Other centralised activities such as group financing or licensing operations are highly sensitive to the tax environment. Since they are not dependent for their operations on a physical establishment, these operations are carried out in many cases away from the headquarters in locations such as the Netherlands or the Irish Dublin Docks area. No single country fulfils all the wishes of a typical multinational group and therefore the various activities are spread among a number of countries. Personal taxation of executives forms a crucial element in the package to attract international headquarters operations. Again a number of countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands offer attractive tax regimes aimed at foreign executives on secondment. This is an area where the UK has traditionally held the lead. Its long established system of taxing non-domiciled individuals is regarded as one of the central features in maintaining London's preeminence as an international financial centre.</p>

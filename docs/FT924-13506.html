			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Coal - a private industry alternative to closure and pointing finger of blame Sir, I was extremely angered by your editorial on the coal mine closures. Your assertion that the finger of blame points 'most obviously at the NUM and its leader, Arthur Scargill' would be treated with contempt in our part of Britain. South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire are to lose nine out of 10 of their collieries, and I can assure you the man in the street is pointing his finger not at Arthur Scargill but at John Major. Those with more knowledge of the energy scene are also pointing their fingers at the privatised electricity industry and its regulator, Professor Littlechild, whose incompetence will result in more expensive gas-fired electricity replacing coal-fired power. Ian Rutledge, Sheffield Energy &amp; Resources Information Services, 103 Carter Knowle Road, Sheffield S7 2DY</p>

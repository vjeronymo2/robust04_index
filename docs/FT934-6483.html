			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn fails to please Disappointment over the dividend payout at Thorn EMI sent the shares tumbling and prompted a series of downgrades and some cautious pronouncements from leisure sector analysts. First-half results were at the lower end of market forecasts, although there were some bright spots, particularly in the music division. However, the impressive, albeit patchy, results were accompanied by an unchanged dividend, prompting worries over the short term outlook for the stock. One analyst commented: 'The company has sent a very confusing message to investors - reasonable results and a disappointing dividend. People are worried about the near term news flow.' This includes official inquiries into compact disc prices in the UK and US, potentially harmful legislation in the US over Thorn's rental business and continuing losses at its unwanted defence business. 'Thorn is next year's story,' said Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, who cited flat full year earnings and the looming uncertainties as reasons for marking the shares a hold. They closed a hefty 35 down at 914p, although analysts pointed out that the stock had had a good run. Market forecasts for the year came back to a range of Pounds 338m to Pounds 348m.</p>

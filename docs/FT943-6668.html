			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul tries to make up ground lost by lira - John Murray-Brown on the return of confidence to the Turkish market in the wake of currency jitters After running out of steam in the first quarter, in the wake of the currency jitters in January, Turkey's stock exchange shows signs of gaining a second wind. It is probably to early to claim the worst is past, but there is evidence of confidence returning. This week, in the latest indication of the firmer grip on the helm, the authorities moved decisively to stem a possible run on the currency, while the index held steady, after making good gains in local currency terms in recent months. The Istanbul composite index is up by more than 50 per cent in local currency terms since early June. It closed yesterday 609, or 2.3 per cent, higher at 26,251, compared with 16,807 on June 6. However, with the lira losing close to 50 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year, the picture is different for foreign investors. A week ago, the IFC's Turkey index showed a fall in dollar terms of nearly 38 per cent this year. The decline was 63.3 per cent early in June and there is a general expectation that share prices in dollar terms will end the current year lower than in 1993. Nevertheless, the recent trend is up, and the exchange received a further impetus yesterday, this time of a technological nature, as Turk Radyo ve Televizyon TRT, the state run television company inaugurated its teletext market coverage. The innovation will give a big boost to the market and particularly to retail investors who, in the absence of big Turkish institutions, still account for the largest part of demand. Coupled with planned moves to bring all share transactions to a screen based system by mid-October, some brokers believe Istanbul is due for a further rally. The market is certainly due for a change of fortune. With the first signs of the collapse of the currency in January, domestic demand dried up. The market has since suffered from competition from high interest rates as the government sought to finance the budget by domestic borrowing. After Turkey's credit rating had been downgraded repeatedly, the decision to turn to the International Monetary Fund was unavoidable. Today some of the elements in the stabilisation package are falling into place. Officials point to the drop in annual inflation, which slowed from 115 per cent in June to 109 per cent last month. As a result, companies say they are better able to plan production schedules. The monetary environment certainly looks more robust. Even after the hiccups this week, the lira has stabilised at around the TL32,000 to the dollar level, compared with more than TL42,000 in late April following the announcement of a major stabilisation package. Interest rates on government paper have eased to around 100 per cent a year, compared with rates of 400 per cent on the so-called 'super bond' issues in June. At a p/e ratio of close to 11 on 1994 earnings, Kaya Didman of Baring Securities in London says that the market is among the cheapest in the world. There are still some voices of caution. 'In investing, when you see everyone running to the same side of the boat at once, there has to be some concern,' says the head of research at one of Istanbul's largest brokers. Economists expect the true picture will only be apparent after the Fund's first review of progress on implementation of the standby agreement, expected in the second week in November. In recent weeks, the index has been pushed higher following some surprisingly good half year corporate results. In food and beverage sectors, companies such as Tat conserve, a fruit processing operator and the beer concerns, have outperformed the market. However the biggest surprises were in sectors like paper where both Kav Orman, a match maker, and the cardboard manufacturer Tire Kutsan showed healthy first half earnings, apparently taking advantage of stock build up before the crisis. Liquidity has traditionally been one of the market's major constraints. However, brokers anticipate that turnover will increase with moves to introduce on-screen trading. In the first tranche of 50 stocks - chosen as the least traded companies - volumes increased fourfold. A similar expansion of liquidity is expected in early October when the entire 162 traded stocks are incorporated into Elit, Istanbul's electronic Elit system. The broadcasting initiative, for the first time, will bring the market to Turkey's rural areas where officials say there is considerable untapped demand. Moreover, if teletext is also available on TRT's international transmissions, Turks in Germany and other European countries - who already provide some USDollars 4bn to bolster the country's balance of payments - may be persuaded to get the trading bug.</p>

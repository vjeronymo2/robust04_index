			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Fujitsu helps ICL network Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, has agreed to market PC local area network servers manufactured by ICL, the UK based computer group in which it has a controlling stake, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. The agreement paves the way for the introduction of ICL's multi-vendor PC local area network (LAN) server system to Japan, where networking has been relatively slow to take off. It has not been possible, for example, to link up a PC manufactured by NEC with one manufactured by Toshiba, while IBM compatible PCs are not widespread in Japan. Profits warning, Page 26</p>

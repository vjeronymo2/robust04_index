Ngoun Non, who was charged with libel after publishing  several articles alleging official corruption, was a senior  official in the cabinet of co-prime minister Prince Norodom  Ranariddh until he founded his newspaper at the beginning of  this month.    He was the first journalist to be arrested since last year's  departure of the United Nations Transitional Authority in  Cambodia.    He had been arrested while at the offices of his newspaper,  one of the most widely read in Cambodia with a circulation of  30,000, for failing to respond to two separate court summons.    The arrest came shortly after an assurance by King Norodom  Sihanouk that freedom of the press should be guaranteed in  Cambodia.    A new press law is being prepared by the government.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: AFRO-ACID ROCK FROM TRIBE AFTER TRIBE  </P> <P> "Afro-acid rock" sounds like something Hugh Masekela might have experimented  with in the late '60s, but actually it's the term the group Tribe After Tribe  uses to define its style. Led by South African expatriate Robbi Robb, the Los  Angeles-based power trio played the Shamrock on Friday as if the  east-of-Hollywood neighborhood bar was the Forum, inspiring at least one  onlooker to flick his Bic.  </P> <P> Tribe's fiery, psychedelic punk assault burns closer to Jane's Addiction than  township jive (though Robb did throw in a few Zulu kicks that should pose no  immediate threat to Johnny Clegg). With Robb swinging his right arm like Pete  Townshend's and wailing like a high-register Bono, this was a Tribe based more  in standard power rock 'n' roll than Soweto soul. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

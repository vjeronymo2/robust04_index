			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Factory gate prices ease interest rate pressures: Fall in cost of petrol helps figures The cost of goods leaving UK factories rose by less than expected last month, easing fears that inflation pressures will soon prompt a rise in interest rates. However, underlying price pressures in industry continue to grow, suggesting that fresh impetus for a rate rise will emerge in the months ahead. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the cost of goods produced by UK manufacturers for the home market rose by 0.1 per cent in October, compared with September, and 2.3 per cent in the year to October. The figures were flattered by a fall in petrol prices. Measured without the volatile sectors of food, drinks, tobacco and fuel, output prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the month. Nevertheless, the data were better than the City had expected and prompted some analysts to suggest that further rate rises are unlikely this month. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, are understood to have agreed to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.75 per cent. However, expectations of a rise in US interest rates fuelled speculation that a UK base rate rise might be imminent. The US federal open markets committee meets in Washington today, and is widely expected to raise rates by at least 0.5 per cent. It is thought that a meeting between Mr George and Mr Clarke would be required ahead of their next scheduled meeting on December 7 for the UK to follow any US lead immediately. However, most analysts believe that a UK interest rate rise is likely to be delayed until after the Budget on November 29. Yesterday's data painted a mixed picture. The price of fuels and materials purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in October, compared with September, the lowest monthly rise since January. Over the year to October, input prices rose by 6.9 per cent. The subdued rise in output prices indicates that most of the annual input price increase is still being absorbed by industry. But the Treasury expects that output prices will accelerate next year, and yesterday's data suggest that manufacturers in some sectors, such as plastics, are already passing input price increases on to customers. Measured on a three-monthly basis, output prices, excluding volatile elements, rose by 0.8 per cent in the three months to October, compared with 0.4 per cent in the three months to July. It remains uncertain whether retailers will be able to pass manufacturers' price increases on to consumers, given the fragile state of consumer confidence. A Confederation of British Industry survey yesterday showed that retailers reported a dip in annual sales volumes in October, for the first time since December 1992. Sales were well below expectations, after a relatively strong September. Official retail sales figures and and the retail prices index for October are due later this week.

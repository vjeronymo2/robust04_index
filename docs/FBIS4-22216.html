			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. Alyabyeva, under rubric "Politics": "LDPR: </F> Local Version"]    [Text] Many Chelyabinsk residents recalled the visit made  to our city in July 1991 by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who at that  time was pretender to the country's highest job -- the job of  president. The city dwellers, who for the most part leaned  "toward Yeltsin," met the candidate cautiously. At the ChTZ  [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant], where the meeting was held at an  open area near the main entrance, people were openly unfriendly.  In front of the rostrum from which the guest was speaking there  was active counteragitation. People went up and down the rows,  passing out a newspaper in which a well-known deputy of the  Russian parliament of the time had asserted that "Zhirinovskiy's  party is a bluff"...    But then one observed the complete manifestation of Vladimir  Volfovich's mastery at recruiting supporters for himself. He  unerringly guessed what it was specifically that the audience  was expecting from the visiting politician, and he formulated  its hopes as clear and specific goals that he and his party were  undertaking to achieve. The result? After the meeting,  Zhirinovskiy was surrounded by a dense crowd. People stretched  their hands out to him. People asked him for his autograph. And  they asked: how do we get into your party? Many were ready to  write an application on the spot... I myself was a witness to  all of this.    But no party cell was born in Chelyabinsk at that time. Nor  did it exist a year later. For all the variety of the political  palette of the oblast center, for a long time we did not have  any organized liberal democrats. Following the first party  congress, there were three more. Its managerial link, with its  permanent leader, underwent ideological demarcations. Party  rules were banned and were newly registered. And all of this was  without people from Chelyabinsk.    The "seeds sprouted" in the summer of 1993. And I think that  that was not accidental. The fourth LDPR congress was held in  the spring. Zhirinovskiy formulated his party's goal as follows:  "In a year and a half we will be in power." Without regional  support that goal obviously is unfeasible. That is why, it would  seem, in addition to the fixed attention that the LDPR is paying  to each specific category of Russians, an increased amount of  interest is being shown to the territories. If not material  support, the maximum amount of moral support is being given to  party members here.    Well, then, what about the Chelyabinsk organization? Who  among us has gone farther in following Zhirinovskiy's slogans  and has become part of his "hawkish" organization?    The best-known person is the leader of the local  "Zhirinovskiyites," Aleksey Yalovenko, a 43-year-old  entrepreneur with two higher educations, who has "knocked about  a bit" in production (Polet [Flight], the ChTZ), and who has  worked as an economist. In the autumn he fought for the mandate  of deputy to the State Duma in the Kalinin Electoral District.  In the list of candidates to that Duma from the LDPR, he was No.  136. He was insulted when, in a newspaper report, I equated that  place with the real rating of the Chelyabinsk organization in  the party.    When we were "ascertaining the relations" in the okrug  electoral commission, I asked Aleksey Yalovenko a question: was  he really counting of victory in that election? And the answer I  heard was: no, but their organization intended to make active  use of the campaign that had developed. They intended to use it  for propaganda and agitation work to benefit the LDPR and its  leader, Zhirinovskiy, as well as the local party organization.    Properly speaking, it was for that reason that his personal  agitational campaign was extremely modest against the background  of all the others.    (Incidentally, not many people know that something that was  supposed at that time to become a powerful reinforcement of the  young Chelyabinsk organization and its leader was a new  pre-election visit to the city by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The day  had already been set, and the auditorium for the meeting had  already been leased, but the party leader's plans changed...)    However, having given in the newspaper an announcement about  his party and his telephone numbers, Aleksey Fedorovich admits  that it a rare day or evening (he took the risk of giving his  home telephone number) that passes without having someone call  him. And they really say vile, insulting things to him. But,  according to him, the people who call most frequently are those  who share the LDPR slogans and who like Vladimir Volfovich's  appeals.    Well, then, what are we told by the results of the  elections,  of which we have actually had quite a few. Of those who chose  slogans which, as early as the period of the pre-election  campaign, were unambiguously branded as fascist ones. True,  after the leader of Russia's Choice was summoned to the Court of  Arbitration, comparisons of Zhirinovskiy with Hitler began to be  published more cautiously, and historical parallels with the  Weimar Republic proved to be more productive. But the ferocity  of the time frames proved in this situation to be more  beneficial for "Zhirinovskiy's party"...    The election ended, the Duma began working, and on the basis  of the mail and telephone calls to the editorial office one can  judge that interest toward the LDPR, including the interest on  the part of our fellow citizens, has not abated. So we decided  to took a good look at the local version of the liberal  democrats. With A. Yalovenko's permission I visited one of the  meetings of the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization.    What was immediately apparent, and even strikingly so, was  the discipline. Discipline like that could definitely not have  been encountered at every meeting of the CPSU with its  democratic centralism. Who was absent, for what reason, who had  failed to give notification, a rechecking of the list... There  were twice as many cell members as had gathered that day in the  recreation room of the ZhEK [housing operation office]. It  turned out that, because of the crowding, it was impossible for  everyone to fit into the one area at the same hour -- it was  necessary to hold the meeting in two sessions.    A. Yalovenko began to discuss his trip to Moscow, to the  party's Central Committee, and I looked around at those who had  gathered, among whom, incidentally, the roll call had revealed  two newcomers, who had come here for the first time with the  intention of becoming LDPR members. The overwhelming majority of  the audience consisted of men, mostly between the age of 30 and  40. It turned out later that the people were entrepreneurs,  employees, and laborers. The people who were absent were those  emotionally unbalanced individuals who had already become the  usual participants in many meetings of other public  organizations and parties. Evidently it was partially for that  reason that the meeting proceeded in a businesslike, successful  manner.    It was not until later, when I was standing at the bus stop,  that I put all my impressions together. Yes, they had been  people who had deliberately made their choice, who had come to  the party in order to work and who were ready to work. They are  the active opposition. Although I think that many of them, as  members of the opposition, began with the usual grumbling about  the messed-up production life, the production managers who had  gotten out of control, the "stall businessmen" who were charging  exorbitant prices... And the organization members themselves  said at their meeting that people in the oblast had voted more  eagerly for the LDPR in the areas of our industrial giants that  periodically send their work on unpaid furloughs or with miserly  payment for their forced days off. And I agree that these forced  days off, to a large extent, are recruiting new LDPR members.  And the headquarters of the local organization of that party in  Chelyabinsk is not just anywhere, but in Traktorzavodskiy  [Tractor Plant] Rayon: incidentally, Uraltrak has once again  sent its tractor workers out on a two-week "furlough"...    To tell the truth, when I looked at those people and  listened  to their statements, I thought: somehow Zhirinovskiy's cocky  statements -- those that assured the party the unflattering  comparison with fascism -- do not "stick" specifically to them.  For that reason I wanted to speak a bit with several party  members, and after the meeting I had the opportunity to do so.    It was difficult to argue. But, for example, it seems to me  that this is obvious: it is impossible to fit into a single  program a promise to mothers that their sons will not serve  outside the confines of Russia, that they will be returned from  hot spots, and the obviously imperial vision of the future  Russia -- as a minimum, the restoration of its borders as they  were in 1917. But what about the "leap to the south," which even  officially has been evaluated as an open appeal to war, for  which a criminal case has been initiated against Zhirinovskiy?  "Is it possible today to establish new boundaries without having  Russian soldiers finding themselves in the role of conquerors?"  I asked a woman who, it turned out, is a teacher who recently  retired. The answer I heard was, "The point is not that the  previous Russian territories will be won back, but that the  economic conditions will force them to seek an alliance with  Russia." "Well, then, what about the Russian soldier on the  shore of the Indian Ocean, which has never washed Russia?" I  asked her, giving an argument that, it would seem, is simply  impossible to challenge. "What are you talking about!" the  teacher said, giving me a surprised look. "That's simply an  allegory!"    I assume that, when she is all alone, that elderly woman and  teacher still experiences certain doubts about the  convincingness of her logic. But I deliberately quote this  dialogue, which convinced me that it is not very productive to  put the label of "fascists" on people so scathingly and  disdainfully. Incidentally, it is rather easy to be convinced  that the association of local liberal democrats has been born  and is definitely not sticking to the "geopolitical" strivings  of their scandalously well-known leader. The thing that has  united people and that is bringing new members to them is  primarily people's deep concerns about the real-life situation,  when enterprises are in a fever, when prices keep going higher  and higher, when crime is rampant, and the ruling politicians  try to convince people that this is the only possible course for  the country.    There is nothing surprising about the fact that people who  have lost their patience finally lose their hope of better times  and are inclined easily to believe those who are decisive and  energetic, who give simple recipes, infecting others with  confidence about implementing them: "Just give me the power!"  And when those decisive leaders mobilize that segment of our  passive voters who, so far, have failed to trust either the  creators of the present course or the opponents of that course,  the power actually will easily prove to be in their hands.    The wing of Zhirinovskiy's popularity, of course, has  overshadowed the LDPR organizations in the outlying areas. But  here -- and, once again, I am making my conclusion from what I  heard and saw at the meeting -- people are not planning to live  for this world alone. And even A. Yalovenko's statement to his  fellow party members sounds noticeably discordant: "Do not think  that the party is meetings and high-sounding statements. Our  party is serious. But do not expect any rapid success. It is a  year or two until that success, and no less than that. But today  we need planned, methodical work..."    It was precisely at that meeting that the first-priority  tasks were discussed. One of them is the creation of a  well-branched oblast organization. As of that moment, LDPR  organizations were in operation in Zlatoust, Bakal, Troitsk,  Miass, Sim, Magnitogorsk, and Kopeysk. In addition to  Chelyabinsk. But there are also LDPR members in other cities,  who entered the organization after addressing a statement  directly to the Central Committee. The meeting planned to  organize them also. And the task was posed not in general, but  was assigned to a specific individual.    Another task that was broadly discussed is the creation of a  youth organization. I really heard a lot about adolescents who  had been kicked out of clubhouses where the areas had been  handed over to other occupants! It would seem that the LDPR is  the organization that has hands long enough to reach them! In  any case there are people here who are ready to take that  specific job on their shoulders... Just as, incidentally, they  are ready to organize a volunteer people's druzhina  ("You can't fight crime with words; you have to help the  militia!").    Of course, the liberal democrats in Chelyabinsk intend to  fight at the election to the local agencies of power. And they  are seriously troubled by the equating of their party to a  fascist organization. They have even decided to devote the next  meeting to ideological questions, to analyze exactly what  fascism is, and why people are accusing the LDPR of being  fascist. They want to develop their own system of  counterarguments.    Who knows, but maybe these reflections, if they prove to be  as serious as the intention to improve Russian life, will yield  an expected result... Will the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization  then be able to further strengthen Zhirinovskiy's success?    Meanwhile, as has become known, Vladimir Volfovich himself  intends to make a visit to Chelyabinsk.</p>

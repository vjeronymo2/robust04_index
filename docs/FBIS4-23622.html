			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Reports from Angola this week have indicated an  intensification of fighting in the central highlands, especially  around the government-held city of Kuito and at UNITA [National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebel headquarters  in Huambo. Meanwhile, talks in Lusaka, Zambia, seem to go on  for ever. This week, the government offered UNITA a deal on  posts in a future administration, but it seems the offer didn't  include the governorship of Huambo, and UNITA has dug in its  heels. Heba Saleh spoke to Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge  Chikoty, currently in South Africa, and asked him whether the  intensification of the government's campaign against UNITA  reflected disillusionment with the talks.    [Begin recording] [Chikoty] I do not think that that is  correct. What has been happening is that there has been more  fighting in certain areas. You know, Kuito has been besieged  for almost two years now. This is the same situation in  Malanje. It is the same situation in many other areas. So,  there has always been intense fighting in Angola. What we think  is that maybe the government has now been responding a little  bit more adequately to some of UNITA's moves. So, you cannot  say....[changes thought] It is wrong to say that the government  has intensified its campaign against UNITA. It is UNITA that  has been in a campaign against the government for two years and  we all know that.    [Saleh] But has the government still got any faith in the  talks in Lusaka?    [Chikoty] Well, yes. We think that it all depends on UNITA  to react. You know, we have made a considerable offer. We  thought that the major problem until now was the fact we did not  have a large participation of UNITA in the previous offers.  Now, this has been done. So, we hope now that we shall be  getting very close to conclusion in the next few weeks. That is  what we think.    [Saleh] But I understand that UNITA has submitted certain  proposals to the government side and that the government has  rejected them?    [Chikoty] The problem is, you know, that we cannot play to a  vicious circle where every time we make an offer to UNITA, UNITA  will say: I am going to analyze that. Then they will choose a  few points and say: We don't agree with this. Well, for  example, we have offered a package, and I have heard that, well,  they have accepted it, but they have also said that they wanted,  for example, the province of Huambo as governor. So, in my  view, that is a rejection. That means that UNITA has rejected  the offer of the government. They either take the whole offer  that the government has made rather than discuss on the point.  We have made more than 200 offers to UNITA, if we take  everything into account -- that is the ministry positions, the  deputy ministry positions, the ambassadors, the deputy  governors, the governors, the municipal governors, the deputy  municipal governors, the communal governors. I mean, that is a  lot. How will they just single out one aspect.    [Saleh] Why can't you give them control of Huambo? Huambo is  very important to UNITA, and unless they regain control of  Huambo, the war is going to go on.    [Chikoty] Do you think that is what the problem is? They  have a vice governor there. They have a deputy municipal  governor. What UNITA wants is to find points of antagonism.  The other point is: We also don't think that after a party has  won an election, it is the one that lost who makes the rules.  In my view, the problem does not lie on one particular  province. The problem is that UNITA is having a problem of  accommodating itself within a democratic situation whereby  everybody else will have to be equal. That is the problem.  That is what we have to look at. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Britannia improves to Pounds 28.5m ALTHOUGH it had to make heavier provisions in the first half of 1993, Britannia Building Society, the ninth largest in the UK, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 28.5m. Gross lending was 13 per cent up on the same period last year and ahead of expectations in volume and market share, said Mr John Heaps, managing director. Provisions for losses on loans and advances were up Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 21.8m, but were offset by an increase in net income from Pounds 83.3m to Pounds 100.2m, and a reduction of Pounds 2.5m in management expenses. Net income comprised Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 62.5m) net interest receivable and Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.8m) other income, including insurance sales and estate agency. Provisions for non-performing loans amounted to Pounds 34.1m, equivalent to 47.4 per cent of the total mortgage loss provision of Pounds 71.9m for 1992.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Damned lies and opinion polls: Dominic Lawson thinks he knows why pollsters got their election predictions wrong It is depressingly rare for any professional association to blame its own members for shortcomings: almost invariably, they are decreed to be the fault of the consumer, the general public. So hats off to the Market Research Society, which last week produced its inquest into the failure of its members, the opinion poll organisations, to predict the Conservative victory at the last general election. Indeed Dr David Butler, the group's chairman, in laying the blame on the pollsters, declared the failure 'the most spectacular in the history of British election surveys'. Ouch. The language of the report then becomes more technical as it seeks to find the precise reason for the grotesquely embarrassing error. It says it arose 'partly because quotas and weights did not reflect sufficiently accurately the social profile of the electorate and partly because the variables used as the basis of the quotas and in correlative weighting were not closely enough correlated with voting behaviour.' So there you have the answer, if you can understand it. What the Market Research Society categorically ruled out is the excuse which would not only have absolved them from blame, but which had also gained a certain amount of anecdotal credibility: viz, that a significant number of Tory voters lied about their intentions. Yet this still seems to me a distinct possibility. One looked a little foolish admitting, in the middle of the longest recession since the 1930s, that one would happily endorse the governing party. And voting Labour, for many people, has always had more of a feel-good factor: that is, one feels better about oneself. It is for this reason, I suspect, that in recent years polls always seem to indicate that the vast majority of people would rather pay more taxes in order to provide more funds for the National Health; but in general elections this is shown to be, largely, humbug - the majority of voters have not voted for the party which promises to carry out just such a policy, namely Labour. For similar reasons, and also, I must admit, out of a natural cynicism, I find it hard to believe a much reported poll which was published at the beginning of last week. The survey, produced by the polling group Mintel, said that eight out of 10 sons and daughters would rather their parents left them nothing, and spent their money instead on a more comfortable old age. A number of newspapers took this up, saying that this showed the essential goodness of the average British citizen. I simply do not believe it. I think that a large proportion of Mintel's sample of 1,335 adults were telling porkie pies. How many well-off families do you know that are not heaving with speculation about the financial benefits of the death of a rich parent or relative, and that do not tremble collectively at the thought that the rich old one might suddenly decide to blow it all on some folly? But, on the other hand, how many people do you know, who, confronted by one of Mintel's question-and-answer men, would look him in the eye and say: 'Yes, I would rather my old parents saved as much as possible so that I can have a large sum of money when they die'? Mori, one of the largest of our polling organisations, has reacted rapidly to the possibility of this sort of dishonesty at times of elections, even though the Market Research Society has officially cleared the general public of any habitual face-to-face dishonesty. In its recent poll of European election voting intentions in London, Mori experimented with a method which allowed those surveyed to write down their intentions without showing them to the pollster. Mori's resulting forecast turned out to be more accurate. This leaves one question unresolved. If the Market Research Society could reasonably have blamed the public for their embarrassment, why didn't they? And the reason is that if they were to admit that the public lies, who would ever again commission an opinion poll? Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Iran presses Gulf states for tough security pact Iran yesterday called for a 'defensive security' pact among Gulf countries, which would include an accord to curb the build-up of conventional arms in the region and the outlawing of weapons of mass destruction. The proposal, the most detailed Iran has yet put forward, came in a speech to the United Nations Disarmament Conference by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, foreign minister. However, it is likely to get a cool reception from Iran's Arab neighbours who distrust Tehran's brand of Islamic radicalism and its perceived ambitions for regional superpower status. Yesterday's initiative reflects Tehran's concern at its exclusion from existing Gulf security arrangements since the defeat of Iraq in 1991 and its desire to reduce US influence in the region. Iran, which has been seeking to rebuild its armed forces since the devastating eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, has viewed with disquiet the heavy armaments spending by Gulf states aimed at deterring Tehran's territorial claims and meeting any threat from Iraq. Mr Velayati said more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.8bn) worth of armaments was flowing into the Arab Gulf states, the highest rate of arms purchase in the world. 'Something must be done to stop this senseless arms race,' he said. The first step towards a defensive security pact would be the creation of a regional security forum where 'threat perceptions and security concerns' could be aired openly and confidence-building measures discussed. To pave the way for a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction all states in the region should renew their commitment to renouncing nuclear weapons, join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratify the United Nations convention which outlaws chemical weapons. More controversially, Mr Velayati urged 'regional provisions' to guard against cheating on nuclear, chemical and biological arms. On conventional arms, the proposal was more tentative. Mr Velayati said possible measures included an exchange of information on weapons stocks, agreement to cut military spending and a ceiling on arms imports.</p>

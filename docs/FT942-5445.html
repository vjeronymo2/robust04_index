			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hawtal Whiting to raise Pounds 5m Hawtal Whiting, the motor industry design and engineering consultancy, is to raise Pounds 5m through a rights issue to reduce borrowings and finance further expansion. The move was announced as it reported a return to profit after being badly hit by the world motor industry recession in 1992 which saw several rivals go into receivership. Turnover rose 23 per cent to Pounds 69.6m in 1993 on which pre-tax profit was Pounds 761,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.18m. Losses per share were cut to 2.2p (39.6p). Mr John Whitecross, chairman, forecast further growth in North America and maintained that European demand was recovering. However, he warned that east Asia business was 'less predictable'. The rights is on a 7-for-17 basis at 68p. There is also an already underwritten subscription for 3m preference shares with warrants.</p>

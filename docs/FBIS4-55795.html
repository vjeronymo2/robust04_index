			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev </F> in Sofia on 20 May -- recorded]    [Text] Dear compatriots: During the last few days a farce  has developed in Bulgaria that poses a threat to the foundations  of parliamentarianism. Guided by personal and party interests,  many deputies have involved themselves in lobbying machinations  and bargaining that are well on the way to finally destroying  the people's trust in the institutions of state. I do not have  the right to judge anyone, but I am convinced that democracy,  apart from merely being a form of procedure, also means a sense  of responsibility, which some people have forgotten. The  deepening political crisis has led to a complete paralysis of  state life. In my view, we can extract ourselves from this  situation only with the determination of all the responsible  political forces in the country.    This conviction led me to invite the chairmen of the  parliamentary groups to a meeting. Yesterday and today I held  talks with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov; with  Stefan Savov, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Union  of Democratic Forces [SDS]; with representatives of the NSD [New  Alliance for Democracy] and the Independence parliamentary  group, Georgi Kostov, Nikolay Vasilev, and Ivan Pushkarov; and  with Aleksandur Tomov, chairman of the GOR [Civic Alliance for  the Republic]. For reasons outside my control, no meetings took  place with Nora Ananieva, parliamentary group leader for the BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition, or with Ahmed  Dogan, leader of the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]  parliamentary group.    I will now propose to the nation what I proposed to the  politicians: the reaching of an agreement between the  parliamentary forces on early elections. The agreement should  define the following:    First, the exact date of the elections.    Second, it should guarantee the passing of laws that will  ensure the conclusion of the agreement on our foreign debt and  create conditions for carrying through real reforms.    Third, the agreement should lead to the formation of a  government that will enjoy the confidence of all the  parliamentary forces, guarantee responsible government in the  pre-election period, guarantee the fairness of the elections,  and continue the reforms that have begun.    If such an agreement is concluded and such a government  elected, I shall assume the obligation to entrust this  government with the additional task of carrying out the  functions of a caretaker government during the final two months  preceding the elections. I hope that this will put an end to  the dirty speculations concerning the role of a future caretaker  cabinet and will enable us to emerge from the crisis, because  what we are now putting at risk is not merely the instability of  one government or another, of some parliament or other, but  faith in parliamentarianism and democracy.    Dear compatriots, I want to believe that the parliamentary  forces will find the courage, responsibility, and goodwill to  conclude such an agreement on early elections, an agreement for  preserving democracy and parliamentarianism. However, at the  ballot box the decision lies with you.</p>

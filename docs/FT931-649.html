			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / 'Few' councils to be capped MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, yesterday said he would cap the spending of 'very few' local authorities in the first year of the new council tax, which starts this week. Only three councils have breached spending criteria set by his department, Mr Howard confirmed. An announcement on capping is expected next month. Speaking on BBC television, Mr Howard admitted that the new council tax, based on property values, would disadvantage those with higher-valued houses. 'There is no way in which you can introduce a system of paying for local services that is all advantage and no disadvantage,' he said. But he said the new tax - unlike its predecessor, the poll tax - was becoming accepted. The government had an election mandate to control all public spending - and therefore it was right for him to have capping powers, Mr Howard said. He added: 'We will actually have to cap very few local authorities indeed. . . This year, all but three local authorities have virtually kept within limits that we have set out.' The equivalent of seven out of 10 adults in London have been summonsed for non-ayment of the poll tax in the past three years, the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities says today.</p>

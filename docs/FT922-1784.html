			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lynx ousting cost Pounds 131,000 THE COST of the boardroom coup in February which ousted the chairman of Lynx Holdings, the Sheffield-based leisure and computer services company, was Pounds 131,000. That was the compensation plus associated costs paid to Mr Stephen Hinchcliffe and two other executive directors, Mr Andrew Hartley and Mr Chris Harrison, who resigned at the same time. The compensation was revealed when Lynx announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 291,000 for the six months to March 31, against profits of Pounds 105,000. The Pounds 131,000 compensation was taken as an exceptional charge. Since the end of the period the group had moved back into profit thanks to increased sales and reduced costs, particularly at its head office. The shares of this USM-quoted company rose 3p after announcement to close at 31p. In the first half turnover advanced by 83 per cent to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1.75m). Losses per share emerged at 2p (earnings 1.5p). The interim dividend is being halved to 0.25p (0.5p).</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Nissan Motor behind alleged Pounds 97m fraud, court told NISSAN MOTOR Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, was behind an alleged Pounds 97m tax fraud on the Inland Revenue, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC in his closing defence speech on behalf on Mr Michael Hunt, the director of British car importer Nissan UK. The prosecution alleges that Mr Hunt was part of a fraud in which Nissan UK executives conspired with shipping agents to overstate freight charges for transporting the cars in an attempt to avoid corporation tax. More than Pounds 200m was siphoned off and eventually laundered into two Swiss bank accounts, including one at Credit Suisse, it is alleged. Mr Hunt, who did not give evidence, denies the charges. A fraud on the Revenue had plainly taken place, Mr Sherrard said. However, the evidence showed there was a 'more than credible' case that it was the Japanese, rather than the British, company that was responsible. Documentary evidence of this was provided in a letter written in the early 1980s by Mr Seisaku Homma, then managing director of Nissan Motor Car Carrier (NMCC), the carmaker's transport division, Mr Sherrard said. The letter was written while the Dutch tax authorities were investigating Autocontex, one of the shipping agents allegedly involved in the fraud. In it, Mr Homma stated that all the money paid into the Credit Suisse account was used to settle NMCC's transport accounts. Mr Sherrard said the purpose of the Swiss bank account remained unknown. 'Were they assembling a corporate slush fund to buy their way into markets throughout the world? We don't know,' he told the jury. However, the fact was that the Japanese involvement in the fraud was real, he said. Mr Hunt had made diary entries about his meetings with his alleged co-conspirators, Mr Sherrard said. He would have been 'half-witted' to do that if he was part of a fraud. The Japanese, on the other hand, did not take any risks. Those that had given evidence had not been able to produce any documents worth talking about, Mr Sherrard said. The trial continues today.</p>

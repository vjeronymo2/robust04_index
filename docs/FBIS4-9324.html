			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb army  headquarters has denied a statement by a U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo to the effect that Bosnian Serb  forces had blocked a second convoy of peacekeepers for the  eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde immediately after it  had left Sarajevo on Sunday [25 April]. The French AFP news  agency quoted the statement on Sunday.    A protest note, which the Bosnian Serb army H.Q. has sent to  UNPROFOR commands in Zagreb and Kiseljak, says that UNPROFOR on  Sunday asked a permission for its convoy to pass through the  Bosnian Serb territory three times and the permissions were  invariably given them. The note quotes a statement by the  deputy chief of UNPROFOR command for Bosnia-Herzegovina to the  effect that the problem with the convoy was that it had not  started from Sarajevo, because some countries, which had given  their troops, did not agree to their leaving for Gorazde.    This was primarily France, the note states and adds that the  convoy was at the airport since early morning until the  afternoon, when its structure was finally changed. This can be  confirmed by Captain Drole, an officer in the headquarters of  Colonel Sonic, UNPROFOR chief of staff for Section Sarajevo,  says the statement.    The Bosnian Serb army H.Q. statement says that UNPROFOR  convoy, which should have left Sarajevo at 10 A.M. (0800 GMT),  should have consisted of 221 troops from the British, French and  Ukrainian contingents. However, the convoy, which entered the  Bosnian Serb territory at 5.05 P.M., consisted of British (117  members), Egyptian (51), Russian (20), Ukrainian (48), French  (5) and Nordic (3 members). The note explains that added to the  newly-formed convoy were some "new members," who had not been  discussed earlier in the day. They were military observers and  members of the UNPROFOR civilian affairs, UNPROFOR civilian  police and UNICEF.    We have allowed that too, and the newly-formed convoy  entered  the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic at 5.05 P.M. and set  out for Gorazde, says the protest note.</p>

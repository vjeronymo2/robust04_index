			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Regulator says no to BA-Qantas co-operation The Australian Trade Practices Commission, the country's competition watchdog, has barred British Airways and Qantas, the Australian carrier, from pooling resources on their Australia-to-Europe routes. In a draft ruling, the TPC said that the carriers were seeking authorisation of a wide-ranging open-ended agreement with detrimental anti-competitive effects, given that their combined market share on the routes was around 50 per cent. The two carriers announced earlier this year that they wanted to co-operate on the so-called 'Kangaroo' routes, but the move brought strong protests from consumer organisations and some rival airlines. They feared that a BA-Qantas agreement could herald higher prices and less competition. The move would have been the first significant operational change since British Airways became a minority shareholder in Qantas last year, acquiring a 25 per cent interest in the government-owned airline for ADollars 665m (USDollars 500m). It would have meant the end to around 50 years of competition on the Kangaroo routes, and the pooling of more than ADollars 1bn of annual revenues. Qantas argued that the move would allow cost savings estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars. The routes, although a significant part of Qantas' business accounting for about 25 per cent of its international capacity, have not been a big money-earner. Under the proposals, the two carriers would have split profits and revenue on the route from Australia through Singapore or Bangkok to Europe. Qantas would have cut services between Perth and Singapore from twice daily to once. BA would have made up this capacity loss, but would have pulled out of services to Adelaide. The TPC ruling has important political implications, given the Australian government's decision to float its remaining 75 per cent stake in Qantas early next year. The government has already shown it is willing to protect Qantas' short-term profitability, by rescinding an agreement with New Zealand that would have allowed Air New Zealand to fly Australian domestic routes. That decision caused a political row between the two countries. Legislation which could give more time for the flotation of the state's 75 per cent stake in Qantas was introduced yesterday. The bill extends a deadline of June 30 next year for the share offering, to the end of August.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Deputy Defense Minister Danuta Waniek </F> by Luiza Kowalska; place and date not given: "More Women Will  Also Have To Be Included in Polish Defense Ministry"]    [Text] [Kowalska] Have you had any prior contact with the  Army?    [Waniek] No. (After a moment). Oh, I am sorry--I did go  through military training at the university, and, while I was in  high school, I took a course entitled "Defensive Adaptation."  An excellent teacher happened to teach the class in my school,  and he was the one who shaped my sympathetic attitude toward the  Army.    [Kowalska] How do you intend to go about achieving authority  with the military cadre, which is so conservative that it  sometimes even has a hard time accepting the supervision of  civilian males?    [Waniek] I am not really sure about this whole conservatism  thing. I have been asked about this for several days now, but I  have to see for myself first whether the cadre is really that  conservative. Besides, our Army is making efforts to be  included in European structures. So it follows that the Army  must modernize its organizational structures, the same way it is  happening all over the world. More women will have to be  included in our Ministry of National Defense [MON].    [Kowalska] There are some who fear that your nomination may  make it difficult to make attempts to increase parliamentary  supervision over MON. Right now, the dispute is taking place in  the area of disciplinary internal regulations because the  military does not want a civilian supervisor to be able to  discipline it, even if the supervisor is a minister. What do  you think will be the reaction of a general with years of  experience when faced with the prospect of being disciplined by  a woman?    [Waniek] That is a very difficult problem. One must have an  understanding of the Army. I can understand the resistance,  even though I watched the dispute from a distance. Perhaps a  more comprehensive debate on the issue will allow both sides to  elaborate on their positions regarding Army issues. I have  always greatly respected those who serve in the Army because  they have devoted their entire professional lives to the  military. I have been in MON for three days, and it would be  hard to say that my whole life was associated with the Army, as  opposed to a majority of officers. So there must be a  difference between us. Of course, I am referring to the  advantage of a professional military.    [Kowalska] What is your assessment of the changes that are  taking place right now in MON, aimed at moving many powers from  the "civilian" sector to the General Staff?    [Waniek] One must somehow find a middle-of-the-road  solution. I do not think that the Army's isolation from the  environment in which it functions--which, after all, is a  civilian environment--could possibly be to anybody's advantage.  I think the trend to open armies up to the civilian world,  which has been observed throughout Europe and in Poland for four  years now, is probably the right trend. The Army will always  retain its specific nature, and I do not think anyone has to  fear its being otherwise. Taking up defensive positions is not  necessary. At the same time, I do not think a distortion of a  balance between MON's civilian and military employees should be  a danger right now.    [Kowalska] Minister Kolodziejczyk has admitted in the Sejm  that there have occurred cases in the Army of forcing soldiers  to perform religious practices. Being famous for your fights  for the state's philosophy-of-life neutrality, do you intend to  prevent such phenomena from occurring in the future?    [Waniek] These issues are within the powers of another  deputy minister and I have no intentions of interfering with his  powers. My views on these issues are well known. Field  ordinariates are in operation, but I think that availing oneself  of their presence should be voluntary. We have received reports  of soldiers being forced to take part in religious ceremonies  and that should, of course, be viewed negatively.    I would like some guarantees against such cases of coercion  to be included in a Charter of Soldier Rights. We plan to  prepare such a charter in connection with European and UN human  rights conventions. The military has up to now been functioning  primarily on the basis of order and discipline. Soldiers'  rights have always been regarded as being of the last order of  importance. If the MON leadership thinks that these  relationships can be changed, that is a very good trend. This  applies in particular to soldiers serving in the basic service,  for whom human rights in the Army will be of particular value.  Thanks to the Army, they will be able to understand what civic  rights are all about.    [Kowalska] The issue of your nomination was settled within a  matter of hours, which is in contrast to Zbigniew Siemiatkowski,  the previous candidate put forward by the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD]. How did that happen? Were you a less  controversial candidate?    [Waniek] They said on television that I was the most  controversial candidate of all those proposed to MON, the  Foreign Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. But I  think the issue is really about something else. The candidacy  of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, whom I respect and like very much,  emerged in the atmosphere of a public conflict between the SLD  and the Belweder. It was the same case with Professor Dariusz  Rosati, who was our candidate for the post of finance minister  and deputy prime minister. Both of these candidacies were  excellent, but they came about at the politically wrong time.    [Kowalska] What does the SLD gain by introducing you into a  ministry that is headed by a minister put forward by the  president?    [Waniek] One of the advantages is precisely the fact that an  SLD representative is included in a "presidential" ministry.  That was not so obvious not so long ago. We have been  implementing a plan of our Sejm deputies club--gradually, but  with obstacles--for the governing coalition to actively  participate in the activities of the three ministries, given  that the coalition is taking upon itself the responsibility for  the ministries' functioning. The situation up to now was  abnormal. There was talk of a coalition consisting of two  parties, but, actually, it was a trilateral SLD-Polish Peasant  Party-Belweder coalition.    [Kowalska] The range of your powers at MON is not too  comprehensive, and, most probably, few of the ministry's  decisions will be left entirely up to you. But, at the same  time, it is you who will have to stick your neck out for the  entire ministry in parliament.    [Waniek] I do not think it will be that bad. I can resist  attempts to shift the burden of someone else's decisions onto me.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Chuan (0719 1557) of Suzhou University and </F> responsible editor Zhu Shan (2612 3790): "Project 211--A  Foundation-Laying Project for China's Education Modernization"]    [Excerpts] A key proposal for higher-education development  made by the State Education Commission, "Project 211" (which  focuses on building about 100 institutions of higher education  plus a number of key specialty-course centers to meet the needs  of the 21st century) has been approved recently by the party  Central Committee and the State Council. The proposal has thus  become an official state project, and work has begun to put it  into practice. After all, the curtain has been formally raised  for this great trans-century education endeavor. Seeing this,  insightful people of all social sectors have unanimously  expressed the earnest hope that, with this project, China's  higher education will embark on a new course of development.  [passage omitted]    To build big-name universities up to the advanced world  level by implementing "Project 211," we should, first and  foremost, look into the standards and characteristics of the  world's first-rate big-name universities, get acquainted with  the basic practice of higher education in the world, and see how  we are lagging behind it. The following is a comparison of some  major aspects of our institutions with foreign universities,  especially big-name foreign universities:    1. Funds for running institutions. All big-name  universities in developed countries have ample operating funds.  Even at the present time when a Western economic recession is in  the offing, their operating funds are still way above ours. For  instances, operating funds for all big-name universities in the  United States are from $700 to $800 million a year. For such  schools as Stanford and Berkeley, the amount even exceeds $1  billion. In Japan, the University of Tokyo has an annual budget  of more than 100 billion yen. All these figures are exclusive of  private contributions. And whether they are public or private  universities, their education funds are, without exception,  supplied mainly by government appropriations. In our country,  the annual operating funds for the few big-name key universities  are only about 100 to 200 million yuan of renminbi. As to key  universities run by provinces, the operating funds are generally  between 10 and 20 million yuan. Now, all provinces and  municipalities have done their best to set aside funds for  "Project 211," but when the money is distributed among numerous  institutions, the amount that each one can get will be merely 20  to 30 million yuan a year. Of course, when comparing our  operating funds with those of our peers in developed countries,  we have to take account of the different price levels. On the  other hand, however, we should also consider the fact that a  sizable part of the operating funds for our universities are  disbursed as salaries for the large number of "administrative  personnel" who depend on salaries for their livelihood. Such  disbursement may cut the already-scanty "operating funds" to one  half.    2. Structure and scale. Most of the first-rate big-name  universities in the world are "giant universities." They have a  big structure with all kinds of specialty courses and are, in  particular, strong in fundamental disciplines. In general, each  university has over a dozen schools comprising 50-60  departments, and its full-time students may number tens of  thousands or even more than 100,000. The ratio between  undergraduate and graduate students is generally 1:1 or nearly  so. In Harvard University, the ratio has even reached 1:1.5.  Most of these universities have more than a dozen or even up to  100 well-equipped research institutes and laboratories plus  "research libraries" with 6-7 million volumes of books (the  Harvard libraries have as many as 11 million volumes). Compared  with them, most of our institutions of higher education are  smaller and less efficient. Only a few universities have more  than 10,000 full-time students. In our big-name key  universities, the ratio between undergraduate and graduate  students is generally 4:1 or 5:1. Besides, most of the  comprehensive universities which have undergone the 1952  campaign for adjustment of schools and departments are only  comprehensive in name but not in reality, not to mention those  specialty colleges, which concentrate on a single field of  study. Though some reforms toward "comprehensiveness" have been  carried out by certain universities in recent years, their newly  established schools and departments can in no way match the old  ones in quality.    3. Autonomy in running schools. In developed countries,  whether it is France whose higher education is under relatively  centralized management or countries like Britain and America  where universities enjoy "unparalleled freedom in the world,"  institutions of higher education are generally given varying  degrees of autonomy. This is a sacred and inviolable tradition  of Western higher education formed over the past 1,000 years.  Although the past few decades have seen an increasingly apparent  trend toward the "nationalization" of higher education in these  countries, the governments' role is to guide, rather than  control, the universities' operations by means of fund  appropriations or through other measures. In the university, the  president, as the highest executive, possesses the supreme  administrative power in reality as well as in name. In our  country, under the influence of the decades-old planned economic  system, institutions of higher education have, so far, been  unable to gain the status as independent legal entities.  Autonomy in running institutions is still very limited, and the  administrative power of university presidents is not  sufficiently protected. School affairs, big or small, are still  based on the "red-head documents" [government documents with  large characters printed in red for headings] issued by the  higher authorities. Without the most rudimentary autonomy, how  can our institutions operate successfully and play an  outstanding role in education?    4. Administrative system. In Western developed countries,  autonomy in operating institutions of higher education is  associated with the tradition of "professors running the  school." Organizations like professors' associations and  advisory councils represent the will of teachers at large and  stand for their rights and interests. According to the  prevailing international concept, "in an institution of higher  education experts and researchers are the kings," while the  president and all administrative functional departments are  merely spokesmen and executors for the teachers' will. In  contrast with this, our institutions of higher education have a  large administrative body, comparable in size to the faculty. It  has numerous departments, employs a large number of personnel,  and possesses enormous power, but its work efficiency is  low--this is rarely seen elsewhere in the world. Such a huge  administrative and logistic body not only takes up a large part  of the scanty education funds, but sometimes infringes upon the  faculty's rights and interests. In some schools, there has  appeared the weird phenomenon that those who do not teach and  engage in research work are controlling those who teach and  engage in research work. Seeing this, some insightful people in  the higher-education field have raised a cry of warning: Unless  we drastically streamline these administrative departments, trim  their personnel, develop automation of the administrative work,  socialize the logistic service, and give the teachers the status  as the masters of the institution, we will never be able to  build a first-rate world-renowned university.    5. Faculty. According to UNESCO's statistics, the  faculty-to-students ratio in institutions of higher education in  foreign countries was 1:11.1 in the early 1950's, 1:1.8 [as  published] in the early 1960's, and 1:13.5 in the 1970's. At  present, the ratio is generally maintained at 1:15. Even in  research-oriented universities such as Princeton, Stanford,  Cornell, and Cambridge, the ratio is about 1:10. Moreover, the  stringent screening and evaluation system and the effective  arrangement for the flow of teachers have ensured the salient  features of their faculty members such as having a sound  academic background and being younger in age. Compared with  them, the faculty-to-students ratio in our institutions, which  is generally 1:5 or 1:6, is too low. If the large numbers of  administrative and logistic personnel are counted as members of  the "faculty," the ratio will be even much lower. What is more,  the low faculty-to-students ratio is especially noticeable in  old key university. Apart from this, there are a host of  faculty-related problems, including overemphasis on seniority,  aging of teachers, lack of sound academic backgrounds,  appointment based on cronyism, and teachers working solely in  one department. All these have affected, in varying degrees, the  improvement of the faculty's overall quality.    6. Evaluation mechanism. In developed countries, with the  development of higher-education research, a quality-evaluation  system for institutions of higher education is becoming mature  and gradually institutionalized. The United States is the most  successful in this respect. It has six university accreditation  associations. Any institution of higher education, if not  accredited by the association, cannot be recognized as a  qualified institution, even though it has been approved by the  state government. In addition, there are some 150 organizations  for evaluating the quality of institutions or the specialty  courses offered by them. These organizations are responsible for  conducting periodical evaluation of institutions of higher  education. They also publish statements ranking the institutions  on the basis of their evaluation. Within institutions, it is  relatively common for teachers and students to evaluate each  other's performance. This is why some people say that American  universities are laden with evaluation within and without. It is  due to this evaluation that American universities are maintained  at their high level and encouraged to compete with one another  for prestige. In recent years, China has begun to pay attention  to evaluating its institutions of higher education. Evaluation  procedures have been adopted by certain pertinent departments  and put into practice in some universities on a trial basis.  However, such work is still in the experimental stage, and  neither the quality of the evaluation work nor the method  applied is satisfactory. In most cases, the work done to  appraise and compare the quality of institutions remains at the  "experience and impression" level and is far from "scientific."  Lacking a sound and strict means of evaluation, it is hard to  raise and control the quality of our institutions.    The operation of our institutions of higher education has  lagged behind the advanced world standards for quality and  efficiency. There are gaps in many areas, and some of the gaps  are quite wide. The above-cited are just a few big gaps. There  is still a long and hard way to go before we can narrow the gaps  and bring some of our institutions to a higher level through the  implementation of "Project 211." We should make an adequate  assessment of the situation and be fully prepared for the work  before us.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE futures were depressed by further heavy speculative selling in New York yesterday, which traders attributed to technical factors. The March position in London closed at Dollars 956 a tonne, down Dollars 19 on the day. COCOA futures were also down, but that was largely a reflection of sterling's strength against the US dollar and dealers said the market's mood remained basically 'constructive' after the comfortable absorption of about 40,000 tonnes of producer sales last week. At the London Metal Exchange the pound's firmness masked a modest rise in dollar prices for COPPER. LME NICKEL prices rose smartly from early lows, but the cash price still closed Dollars 42.50 down at Dollars 5,765 a tonne. Dealers said some support developed on the dip below Dollars 5,800 a tonne, and prices continued to advance on short-covering in after hours trading. There was little reaction in the gold market to news of the renewed allied attacks on Iraq and the London bullion market price closed just 30 US cents higher at Dollars 328.15 a troy ounce.

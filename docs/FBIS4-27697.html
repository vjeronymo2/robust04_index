			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, June 3 KYODO -- Vietnamese Communist Party  chief Do Muoi says Hanoi wants to have fully normalized ties  with the United States as early as possible but without any  linkage to human rights.    "As for when our relations with the United States can be  normalized, that is up to the American side," Muoi said in an  interview Thursday [2 June] night with KYODO NEWS SERVICE  President Yasuhiko Inukai. "The sooner the better."    Muoi, 77, noted that a U.S. Government delegation is  expected  to visit Hanoi shortly, though he did not suggest the level at  which it would be led.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord reportedly  plans a visit around the end of this month, which may be  followed in late July by a visit by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.    Muoi said that while Vietnam stands prepared to discuss  human  rights and various other issues with the U.S., it cannot accept  any linkage between human rights issues and overall bilateral  relations.    His remarks follow President Bill Clinton's decision to  extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status despite  domestic pressures to use trade as a leverage to force human  rights concessions.    Vietnam, which is reorienting its economy toward exports, is  reportedly one of only nine countries not accorded the  low-tariff status by Washington.    On Feb. 3, Clinton lifted the 19-year-old U.S. embargo  against Vietnam.    Last month, Vietnamese and U.S. diplomats exchanged  diplomatic notes on the opening of liaison offices in each  other's capitals as a step toward full diplomatic ties.    Turning to Vietnam's simmering row with China over  potentially oil-rich areas of the South China Sea, Muoi called  on Beijing to spell out more clearly its proposal for shelving  the disputes and participating in joint development.    He said that though the idea of joint development may merit  consideration, the issue of sovereignty must be resolved first.    Muoi called for a conference among all parties laying claim  to the contested areas of the South China Sea, which include  Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.    He said Vietnam prefers that the matter be settled through  peaceful dialogue.    Beijing and Hanoi are disputing ownership of the Spratly and  Paracel Islands and their adjacent areas, having skirmished at  sea over the sovereignty issue as recently as 1988.    Each country's awarding of oil exploration concessions to  foreign companies has raised the level of tension in recent  months.    Muoi suggested that China is violating Vietnamese  sovereignty  by drilling in an area which he said is "clearly part of  Vietnam's Continental Shelf."    Earlier this week, a U.S. energy company contracted by  Beijing began a physical seismic survey in an area only 350  kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh City.    Muoi also made a case for increasing in Japanese investment  in Vietnam, noting that investors could produce at low cost by  taking advantage of Vietnam's cheap labor.    He lamented that the level of Japanese direct investment  remains relatively small and noted that more of it goes to China  than to Vietnam.    With some 496 million dollars so far invested in 53  projects,  Japan trails in sixth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, South  Korea, Australia and Singapore as an investor in Vietnam.    Muoi said Vietnam holds high expectations of Japan as a  source of capital and technology needed to develop the country's  increasingly market-oriented economy.    He said he looks forward to an opportunity to visit Japan.    Muoi was named party general secretary in June 1991 after  having served as prime minister for three years.    The son of a farming family outside Hanoi, he became a party  member in 1939 at age 22.    He was jailed in the early 1940s by the French for  participating in the movement against colonial rule.    Elected a member of the party's decision-making Central  Committee in 1960, he was appointed vice premier in 1969 and  became a full member of the ruling Politburo in 1982.    In July 1988, while serving as vice chairman of the Council  of Ministers in charge of capital construction, industry and  material supply, he was elected by the National Assembly to  succeed the late Prime Minister Pham Hung.</p>

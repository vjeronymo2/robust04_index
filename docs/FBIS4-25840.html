			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Soul of the Nation, Pride of the </F> Times--on the Spirit of Lizhou People for Doing Arduous and  Pioneering Work"]    [Text] The item entitled: "`The Pearl of Taihang' Has  Become Even More Splendid--Linzhou People Have Completed Another  `Red Flag Canal' Project" carried in this paper today, records  and narrates the Linzhou people's inheriting and bringing  forward the fine tradition of working hard with perseverance in  pioneering and their feats in reaping a bumper harvest in both  the material and spiritual civilizations during the new  historical period of building the socialist market economic  structure. The article is exciting and enlightening.    The pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance is  the concrete embodiment of the traditional virtues of the  Chinese nation as well as the quintessence of the pioneering  spirit Comrade Jiang Zemin advocates during the new period. It  has crystallized the national soul and sparkles with the light  of the times. Materialist dialectics tells us that the basic  impetus pushing the development of things lies in their internal  movement of contradiction; the internal cause is the grounds for  change, whereas the external cause is the conditions for the  change. That being the case, the pioneering spirit of working  hard with perseverance is applicable not only to those areas  where the natural conditions are bad but also to other areas and  trades; it is applicable not only to past years wherein the  planned economy was mainly practiced but also today, when we are  developing the socialist market economy and conducting  modernization. True, the economic growth rate and the work  accomplishments of a locality or department depend on their  objective conditions. However, more importantly, they also  depend on the efforts of the cadres and masses in the locality  or department as to whether or not they boast the pioneering  spirit of working hard with perseverance and going all out to  make the country strong, as Linzhou's cadres and masses have  displayed. Should cadres and masses work in concert, engage in  their undertakings with one heart and soul, and follow the  example of Linzhou in building a new project akin to the "Red  Flag Canal" in reform, opening up, and economic development,  those places with poor natural conditions will also become  prosperous!    Currently, China is in a period in which the new structure  is  replacing the old, reform is in a stage of tackling bottlenecks  to resolve problems at deeper levels, and with greater scope in  economic construction undertakings, hence the tasks are more  arduous. This precisely calls for powerful political insurance  and spiritual pillars. Compared with the past, our material  conditions are now much better; however, should we be content  with things as they are, not seek to make progress, forget the  spirit of devotion, and give up the fine tradition of working  hard with perseverance, we will lose the powerful spiritual  impetus and we will bring extremely great losses to our cause.    To bring forth the pioneering spirit of working hard with  perseverance, party organizations at various levels must give  full play to the role of a fighting bastion and the broad party  members should play an exemplary role in taking the lead. For a  long time, the mayor of Linzhou has precisely persisted in  augmenting building party organizations at various levels, with  party members taking the lead in playing an exemplary role. For  the masses' common prosperity, Linzhou's Communists would rather  sacrifice their personal interests to lead the masses to work  hard in pioneering undertakings to strive for common prosperity.    We believe that, with such party organizations, and party  members, and people like those in Linzhou, the pioneering spirit  of working hard with perseverance will pass from one generation  to another and the socialist cause of reform and opening up will  develop vigorously, flourishing with each passing day.</p>

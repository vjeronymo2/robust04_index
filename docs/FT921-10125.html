			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Observer: Waiting on Despite all the fine talk about equal opportunity, women still stand a much better chance of making it to the top in Britain's civil service than in Big Business. Barbara Mills's switch from heading the Serious Fraud Office to being the director Of public prosecutions is just the latest example. By contrast, Anne Ferguson's appointment as a non-executive director of National Power is less of a breakthrough. Like Yve Newbold, Hanson's company secretary who has gone on to the BT board, the 49-year-old Ferguson has an impressive record. She has been responsible for modernising ICI's public persona. So her experience should certainly help to add force to what National Power surrealistically terms its 'invisible image'. Nevertheless, her appointment once again raises the question of why women are so rarely given executive directorships, as distinct from the non-executive variety. The response of Newbold and Ferguson, as loyal corporate types, is to say that it won't be long before ICI and Hanson appoint women to fully fledged directorships. But Observer is fast growing tired of waiting.</p>

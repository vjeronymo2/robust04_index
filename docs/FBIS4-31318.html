			<p>BFN     [Text] The trumped-up trial of the 13 Albanians who were  charged with impersonating leaders of the Defense Ministry  [words indistinct] of Kosova will resume on 20 June. The trial  began on 18 April but was postponed because of complaints by the  attorneys, who are demanding that the prosecutor and deputy  prosecutor of the Serb Prosecution Office for the Prishtina  region be removed from the trial.    The attorneys have confirmed that the trial will continue,  even though a request for defense has not been approved. The  attorneys of the accused have denied the charges and consider  the trial to be a politically trumped-up one against the  Albanians in Kosova.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Latin America The crisis in Mexico has underlined the risks of investing in Latin America as a whole. Most countries in the region remain dependent on foreign capital to compensate for their current-account deficits. That makes their markets peculiarly vulnerable to crises of investor confidence and for the foreseeable future the region will be dependent on the international markets. The sell-off by foreign investors in Mexico was prompted not only by attempts to avoid the peso's devaluation, but by their recognition of the impact of the crisis on corporate earnings. Companies' financial charges are likely to rise because of higher local interest rates. The increase in rates could lead to an appreciable slowdown in already hesitant economic growth. Worst of all, the peso's depreciation will significantly raise the cost of companies' dollar-denominated debt. Some banks could find themselves in serious difficulties. The Mexican crisis depressed the currencies of other Latin American countries without regard to their differing economic circumstances. Argentina, certainly, is struggling with difficulties similar to those in Mexico - a current-account deficit, political problems and an overvalued peso. The Mexican crisis may strengthen the Argentine government's resolve to support its currency, but that will be at the expense of higher interest rates and slower growth. Thus the Argentine market's 10 per cent fall in dollar terms last week may have been justified. But by contrast the 13 per cent fall in Brazil was bizarre. The country is running a current account surplus, its foreign reserves are far larger than Mexico's and the value of the new currency has only just been set. Chile's 5 per cent fall was also strange, given the country's large domestic savings base and relatively stable economy. In the longer term, the macroeconomic environment in Latin America remains more attractive than for many years. Command economics has been abandoned throughout the region, serious attempts are being made to control inflation and the political environment has become more stable. Given the continent's huge natural resources, the potential rewards remain considerable. Long-term, investors cannot afford to avoid emerging markets, in Asia, Latin America, or elsewhere - so long as the investment is made as part of a properly balanced portfolio. Economic growth rates in developing countries are set to outpace those of the developed world for the next two decades. Corporate earnings will prove highly geared to this growth, political risks notwithstanding. Moreover, the liquidity argument may again work in emerging markets' favour. The total invested in these markets is still small in absolute terms and it would only take a modest adjustment in fund managers' asset allocation models to give rise to further substantial flows into the developing markets. The next big buying opportunity is likely to come once investors become convinced that US interest rates are nearing their cyclical peak.</p>

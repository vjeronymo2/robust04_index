			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sex, sense and sensibilities - A look at the changes in social attitudes behind a rise in complaints about sexism Slapped wrists for UK advertisers accompanied the revelation this week that concern about sexist advertisements appears to be rising. According to the Advertising Standards Authority's annual report, complaints from the public about the portrayal of women climbed from 180 in 1992 to 536 last year, while the number of complaints that were upheld more than doubled from 52 to 111. There is a 'need for greater sensitivity over the use of sex and women in advertisements', the ASA warned. But are advertisers really getting worse in their treatment of sex and women? The indiscriminate use of semi-clad women draped across car bonnets, or pouting from double-glazing advertisements, for example, seems to be less common than it once was. An alternative explanation for the increase in complaints could be the sharpening of public sensibilities on such issues. According to Caroline Crawford, ASA head of media relations, a 1980 survey conducted by the authority showed that women were far more offended by the advertising of sanitary products than by the sexist advertising that was around at the time. A decade later, about one in three women 'felt a degree of animosity about the demeaning portrayal of women,' says Crawford. The figure for men (who by this date had also been included in the survey) was about one in five. 'Still the majority weren't that bothered, but those who were bothered were very bothered. It was an increasingly vocal group,' she says. The increased use of nudity in recent years may also be a factor. While not necessarily tasteless, sexist, or irrelevant to the product, it is still likely to offend a few people. The current Wonderbra poster campaign is hard to miss and has drawn about 30 complaints to the ASA so far. However, there are no plans to investigate, says Crawford. The posters are of 'a confident woman of the 1990s who is very aware of her sexuality and is certainly not a victim,' she says. Likewise, the recent Haagen-Dazs ads, which showed a couple in various states of undress enjoying ice cream, was considered by the ASA to be tastefully photographed and sensitively handled. Even, says Crawford, 'if it couldn't be said to be completely relevant' to the product, the treatment probably would not offend the majority of people. Rita Clifton, director of strategic planning at advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, agrees that nudity in advertising has increased: 'We're not as uptight about showing naked bodies - they are now an acceptable public currency for many. What is not acceptable any more - if indeed it ever was - is portraying a woman as a victim, a stupid partner or somehow not in control of her own destiny.' On the whole the ad industry has to toe the line. There are no inflexible rules - either for printed advertisements, governed by the ASA, or television commercials, supervised by the Independent Television Commission  -about which bits of the human body may or may not be shown. Instead, advertisers have a general duty not to cause offence; how that is interpreted in each case depends on the context, treatment and innuendo. For example, a lingerie advertisement from Scandinavian retailer Hennes, which showed no more cleavage than the Wonderbra advertisement, did fall foul of the ASA. The strapline on the poster read: 'What the au pair will be wearing this winter.' Says Crawford: 'Men wrote in and said 'I employ an au pair and I object to the implication that all an au pair is good for is to act as a man's plaything'.' What the public does object to, she adds, is 'inept and sexist innuendo' rather than sex itself. Humour may be the salvation of an advertisement, even if the context for nudity is questionable. The ITC let a Danepak bacon ad off the hook, in spite of complaints, because it was judged 'comic rather than voyeuristic'. The advertisement showed a family of nudists cooking bacon and giving thanks that the low-fat product was less likely to spit in the pan than other bacons. The trade press continues to present problems for the ASA, particularly those journals with a predominantly male readership. According to Crawford, there are still ads around with line drawings of buxom women and strap-lines which say, for example, 'Free sex' and then go on to say 'Now we've got your attention lads, come and buy our motorbikes.' The authority got into a scrap last year with a farming publication over an ad for paper sacks. A 'page three girl', says Crawford, was used, irrelevantly, to advertise the sacks. Two complaints, one from a man and one from a woman, were upheld. The publication and the company then started lobbying farmers and the ASA was accused of being a kill-joy and guilty of political correctness. 'You try explaining to a farmer the concept of sexism,' comments Crawford, who has some experience as a member of a farming family herself. Rita Clifton at Saatchi questions whether this kind of advertising actually works - whether it is aimed at men or women. 'Clearly, advertising needs to grab people's attention. The problem is that if you show a lithe 18-year-old in a jock strap, quite often that will be the only thing that's recalled by women,' she says. Unless the product and the figure are properly integrated, the product may go unnoticed. The mention of jock straps raises the question of whether men are these days as likely as women to be victims of sexist advertising. At the very least they may be the victims of stereotyping, as an article in the current issue of She magazine points out. Entitled 'Why the man-bashing has to stop', it lists the current advertising campaigns which portray men as 'ranging from dim and uncouth, to pushy and insensitive,' and argues that the campaigns have little appeal to women because 'women do not want to see old sexist values simply reversed'. There have been complaints about men and sex in ads - the ASA annual report, for example, details the case of the recent Britvic orange juice advertisement showing a man with wings holding a magic wand and wearing a posing pouch. The strapline read 'Somehow we manage to cram in 12 oranges'. There were 35 complaints that the ad was offensive but the ASA ruled that 'most readers would appreciate the humour of the image'. To date, however, Crawford cannot recall a complaint about men in ads having been upheld - perhaps that awaits yet another shift in public sensitivities.</p>

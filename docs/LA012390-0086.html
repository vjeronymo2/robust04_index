			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL OFFICIALS HOLD MAN AS CAMARENA CASE WITNESS  </P> <P> A man believed to be a Texas resident is being held by federal authorities in  Los Angeles as a "material witness" in the ongoing investigation of the  February, 1985, murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, The Times learned  Monday.  </P> <P> Jesse Najir Zuno is scheduled to have a bail hearing Friday before U.S.  District Judge Edward Rafeedie.  </P> <P> Najir Zuno is not related to Ruben Zuno Arce, a Mexican businessman, who is  scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20 on charges he helped organize plans to kidnap  and kill Camarena in Guadalajara, Mexico, nearly five years ago, according to  James Blancarte, one of Zuno Arce's defense lawyers. His client has pleaded not  guilty and vigorously denied any involvement in the Camarena murder.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano would say only that Najir Zuno was being  held and added that he "is not a defendant" at this point. Neither Medrano,  officials of the Drug Enforcement Agency nor defense lawyer David Reed of  Beverly Hills would say where Najir Zuno was arrested, but another source close  to the case said he had been taken into custody last week in El Paso.  </P> <P> Medrano said he could not say anything about Najir Zuno because government  papers submitted to the court can be read only by Judge Rafeedie.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Reed said he would not comment on anything regarding Najir Zuno,  other than to say, "I'm very troubled and concerned that information about him  being brought into court as a material witness was released."  </P> <P> Thus far, 16 people have been indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the  Camarena killing, which was recently the subject of an NBC television  miniseries. Three men were convicted and sentenced to prison after a 1988  trial. Federal law enforcement authorities have said that there will be more  indictments by Feb. 7, the fifth anniversary of the murder and the last date on  which charges can be filed under the federal statute of limitations.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christine McGourty, technology correspondent: </F> "Spy Camera System for Town Hit by IRA Bomb"]    [Text] In two weeks the first of 19 security cameras in a  &pound;305,000 surveillance system will be installed in  Warrington  town centre, site of the IRA terrorist bombing that killed two  children just over a year ago.    More than 20 similar town centre surveillance systems have  already been installed around the country.    Shoppers in Airdrie, Bedford, Canterbury, Coventry, Dover,  Gloucester, King's Lynn, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and  Northampton are familiar with them. Soon those in Ipswich,  Glasgow and the London borough of Merton will be too.    Inhabitants of Newbury, Berks, will have to wait a little  longer. Businesses there are proving slow to agree to share  the cost of the proposed 13-camera scheme with the district  council.    The installation cost is estimated at &pound;200,000 and  annual  running costs at &pound;100,000. The council has agreed to pay  half  but of 200 town centre businesses approached, only 60 have  agreed to provide funds.    Expansion of the surveillance systems in Glasgow and  Northampton are also faced with reluctant support from the  business community. The City Watch Association, which is  pioneering the 32-camera Glasgow project, raised only  &pound;250,000, half of what it hoped for.    Northampton borough council has spent about &pound;500,000  on  one of the largest surveillance schemes in the country, but has  raised only &pound;20,000 from businesses. It has 105 cameras in  use -- in the town centre, car parks, bus stations, the train  station and community centre.    The Home Office is meeting half of the total cost for  Warrington. Elsewhere, local authorities have to find the funds  themselves. A 20-camera system costs in the region of  &pound;300,000.    But the technology is improving and prices are coming down  --  one of the reasons behind the phenomenal expansion in town  centre surveillance schemes over the last 12 months.</p>

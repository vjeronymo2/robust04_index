			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 13 May (EFE) -- Allen Kilpatrick, Canadian  international trade vice minister, said here today that he  firmly supports Chile's entry into NAFTA.    Today Kilpatrick participated in the signing of a $20  million  loan agreement that will be used to finance the purchasing of  equipment for the new Panque Hydroelectric Power Plant that is  being built in southern Chile.    The Canadian official stressed that in his government's  opinion "there are no inadequacies whatsoever" preventing  Chile's incorporation into NAFTA, and that Ottawa has officially  communicated its favorable stance to Santiago.    Initial reports indicate that Chile's incorporation could be  "relatively quick" because only a few changes "of little  importance" would be necessary, Kilpatrick added.    The minister said Canadian participation in NAFTA was  positive, adding that even though the agreement was extended to  include Mexico in January 1994, trade between the two countries  had already started to increase.    Allen Kilpatrick emphasized the importance of Canadian  investments in Chile, which total $3 billion and are mainly  concentrated in the mining area. Kilpatrick added that current  studies contemplate additional investments of $1 billion in  Chile.</p>

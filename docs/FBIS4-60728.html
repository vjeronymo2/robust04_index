			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Ghafur, secretary general of the National Progressive  and Patriotic Front [NPPF], has stressed that the NPPF and its  parties support the unity of the Yemeni territory and people as  a pan-Arab achievement, not only for Yemen but also for the Arab  nation's masses.    In a statement to INA, 'Abd-al-Ghafur said the declaration  by  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist clique on setting up a  deformed secessionist entity has only revealed the dimensions of  the conspiracy and schemes hostile to both Yemeni unity and the  Arab nation's hopes.    He indicated that Arab Iraq stands against the enemies of  both the nation and its awakening. Iraq raised the slogans of  Arab unity, of the liberation of Palestine, and of independent  will. Iraq fought for these slogans in the historic and  immortal Mother of Battles.    'Abd-al-Ghafur added that the NPPF parties wish the Yemeni  people happiness and stability throughout their unified land.  He noted that the NPPF general secretariat salutes the concern  of the Yemeni people, national parties, and Armed Forces to  preserve Yemeni unity and to confront the secessionists and  their evil schemes. These schemes are implemented with support  from the enemies of the nation, the imperialists, Zionists, and  reactionaries, he added.</p>

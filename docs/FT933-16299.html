			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Haiti prepares for Aristide POLITICAL parties in Haiti will meet this week for a conference to prepare for the restoration of democracy, after exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and General Raoul Cedras, the army chief, signed an accord on Saturday night. The agreement, for which Mr Dante Caputo of Argentina was the United Nations mediator, provides for Father Aristide to return to Haiti by October 30. Gen Cedras is to retire from his position as head of the army and be succeeded by a nominee of the president. The latter will also name a new prime minister, to be confirmed by Haiti's parliament. Mr Caputo's 10-point plan also provides for the creation, with foreign assistance, of a new police force, a presidential amnesty for those involved in the 1991 coup by which Gen Cedras ousted the president, and suspension of the economic embargoes against Haiti by the UN and the Organisation of American States. The UN's imposition last week of an embargo on oil and arms shipments, as well a freeze on official financial assets, is thought to have been important in bringing Gen Cedras to the negotiating table. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday said the US might contribute forces to police the return to democracy in Haiti, but probably fewer than 1,000. Most of the forces would probably come from French-speaking countries, he said. US assistance is expected to top Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) over the next five years. Negotiations for Fr Aristide's return to Haiti have proved long and difficult, and the mercurial Roman Catholic priest has almost exhausted the patience of UN and US negotiators. After Gen Cedras had agreed to the deal on Saturday, it was some hours before the president also signed. The political impasse in Haiti has created strains in US policy, and the Clinton administration has exerted much pressure in recent weeks to bring about a settlement. President Bill Clinton said during his election campaign last year that he would reverse President Bush's policy of returning Haitian refugees to their impoverished land. This year, though, he felt compelled to retreat from his promise.</p>

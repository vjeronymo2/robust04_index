			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL PUTS WATTS REDEVELOPMENT ON  HOLD  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council officially put on hold Tuesday a $200-million  project to redevelop Watts, delaying plans to revitalize the economically  depressed community until residents' fears of losing their homes can be  allayed.  </P> <P> The council voted 11 to 0 without discussion to rescind its previous approval  of what would have been the city's biggest redevelopment project.  </P> <P> Instead, they voted to have the Community Redevelopment Agency, which would  carry out the project, and two citizens' advisory committees work over the next  six months to resolve the concerns of many Watts residents, who fear they would  be driven out by the sudden changes in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The proposed redevelopment project was to have been an expansion of a 107-acre  site that was established in 1968 along 103rd Street after the Watts riots 25  years ago exposed the area's blight.  </P></p>

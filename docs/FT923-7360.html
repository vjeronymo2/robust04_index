			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: US retailers post mixed results KMART, the large discount retailer, yesterday reported flat profits for the second quarter of 1992, and a small dip in earnings per share. But Toys 'R' Us, the New Jersey-based toy retailer, unveiled a 40 per cent improvement in after-tax profits in the same three months. The contrasting results come towards the end of the retail sector's reporting season, and underline the extent to which fortunes have been mixed during this period. Kmart said that after-tax profits in the three months to July 29 stood at Dollars 168m, compared with Dollars 163m a year earlier. Total operating income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 342m, but earnings per share slipped from 40 to 37 cents - reflecting the increased share capital following a PERCs offering in August 1991. Kmart said its general merchandise business was affected by consumer caution and the cool weather - which contrasted with the warm spell a year ago, and depressed clothing and garden sales. The general merchandise side saw a 2 per cent advance in comparable store sales, and total turnover was Dollars 6.46bn (Dollars 6.21bn). Operating profits advanced by 5.1 per cent to Dollars Dollars 301m. On the specialty stores side, five of the six chains fared well. However, PACE warehouse clubs suffered from the strains of a rapid expansion plan and lower-than-expected sales growth. Overall, the specialty retail business saw sales of Dollars 2.68bn (Dollars 2.2bn), and operating profits of Dollars 41m (Dollars 46m). Kmart now shows an after-tax profit of Dollars 284m in the first six months, against Dollars 270m, on sales of Dollars 17.4bn (Dollars 16bn). Toys 'R' Us, by contrast, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 32.7m, up from Dollars 23.4m, in the second quarter to August 1. Sales increased to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 1.06bn a year ago. The company said that US toy stores saw a comparable store sales increase of 6.3 per cent in the quarter, with strong advances in basic categories. The European stores also moved ahead sharply. The results bring Toys 'R' Us sales for the first half to Dollars 2.42bn, against Dollars 2.08bn a year ago, and after-tax profits to Dollars 61m, compared with Dollars 45.8m.</p>

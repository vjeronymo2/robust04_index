			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead THE SPOTLIGHT has gone off Retrovir, the anti-AIDS treatment, as far as followers of Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group which manufactures it, are concerned. The company is expected to say that profits from the drug have been broadly flat when it unveils results for the half-year to March on Thursday. Analysts will be looking for further signs that John Robb, the recently appointed chairman, is adopting a more commercial approach to running the company. Interim pre-tax profits should be no more than about Pounds 5m up on last time's Pounds 164.1m. The two Scottish clearing banks produce their results next Wednesday. Both are expected to display the impact of the recession in the form of mounting bad debts. Bank of Scotland's results will be for the year ending last February. Analysts are forecasting a decline of as much as a quarter from the previous year's Pounds 194m before tax. The Royal Bank of Scotland will be producing interim results for the six months to March, and these will show a similar fall. When Evered Bardon, the quarry products group, announces its 1990 results on Tuesday, it will be the last set of figures for the Evered group before the merger with Bardon early this year. Even so, historic comparisons will be difficult because of the rapid rate of acquisition in 1989 and early 1990. Thanks to the purchases, pre-tax profit is expected to have risen to Pounds 43m to Pounds 44m, compared with Pounds 39m in 1989.</p>

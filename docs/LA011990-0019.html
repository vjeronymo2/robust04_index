			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIING;  </P> <P> FOR ONCE, A CHANCE TO GO DOWN HILL FREE  </P> <P> Would-be skiers will have a chance to try the sport today for free.  </P> <P> The occasion is the fourth annual "National Learn to Ski Day," on which more  than 250 ski areas, including 14 in California, are offering first-time,  never-before-tried-it skiers a no-cost package that includes:  </P> <P>  -- A beginner group lesson.  </P> <P>  -- Rental skis, bindings, boots and poles.  </P> <P>  -- Tickets for beginner lifts.  </P> <P> Some restrictions apply, as they say in the airline business, and some resorts  required telephone reservations.  </P> <P> Four Southland areas are participating in the program -- Bear Mountain, Snow  Valley and Snow Summit, in the Big Bear Lake area, and Mountain High, near  Wrightwood. Snow Summit and Mountain High have already filled their quotas, but  Bear Mountain will accept the first 150 and Snow Valley the first 100 today.  </P> <P> Also participating are Mammoth Mountain, June Mountain, Iron Mountain, Heavenly  Valley, Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, Northstar-at-Tahoe, Boreal, Soda Springs  and Lassen Park.  </P> <P> Last year, according to the United Ski Industries Assn., more than 35,000  beginners took advantage of this offer.  </P> <P> The ratings game: Ski and Snow Country magazines have each come up with  ski-resort rankings this winter. Ski polled readers and the media, and included  all of North America, whereas Snow Country had Abby Rand analyze reader  responses to come up with separate lists for the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Some highlights:  </P> <P>  -- Ski's overall top 10 were, in order, Vail, Colo.; Whistler/Blackcomb, B.C.,  Canada; Deer Valley, Utah; Snowmass, Colo.; Aspen Mountain, Colo.; Sun Valley,  Ida.; Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Snowbird, Utah; Killington, Vt., and Mammoth  Mountain.  </P> <P>  -- Mammoth Mountain was Ski's No. 1-rated weekend destination in the West,  with Vail No. 2 and Squaw Valley No. 3.  </P> <P>  -- Snow Summit was Ski's top day-trip area in the West; Bear Mountain was No.  4, Mountain High No. 5 and Squaw Valley No. 6 (presumably as a day trip from  the Bay Area).  </P> <P>  -- Snow Country's overall top 10 U.S. resorts were, in order: Vail; Squaw  Valley; Mt. Bachelor, Ore.; Steamboat Springs, Colo.; Mammoth Mountain; a tie  between Snowmass and Jackson Hole; Park City, Utah; Winter Park, Colo.; a tie  among Beaver Creek, Colo.; Breckenridge, Colo.; Snowbird and Alta, Utah.  </P> <P> And for Nordic types, Cross Country Skier magazine provided regional ratings  from a panel of experts and listed these areas as having the best cross-country  ski trails in the West: Mt. Bachelor; Silver Star Mountain, B.C., Canada, and  Russian Jack Springs and Kincaid Park, Alaska.  </P> <P> Skiing Notes  </P> <P> Despite a serious lack of snow, the men on the World Cup circuit are racing at  Kitzbuhel, Austria, this weekend in the Hahnenkamm downhill and slalom, with  combined scoring included.

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: All change for Stockholm bourse - The proposal to end the exchange's monopoly SWEDEN'S centre-right coalition government has just announced it intends to abolish the securities trading monopoly held by the Stockholm bourse by the beginning of next year at the latest. A draft bill to be presented to parliament proposes the reform of the existing system of securities trading by allowing the creation of alternative markets to compete with the traditional stock exchange. Mr Bo Lundgren, the tax minister responsible for the bourse, said the change was aimed at improving the functioning of the market by ensuring optimal use of resources in the reallocation of savings into profitable industrial investments. The government plans to make two kinds of authorisation available in Sweden for trading in securities. The first would be the familiar one for the operation of the stock exchange. The Stockholm bourse is to be transformed into a limited liability company and the bourse's members and issuers will be free to subscribe for shares in the new company. The second form of authorisation will cover what the Swedish government calls 'recognised markets'. These would be less regulated and comprehensive and more flexible than the normal stock exchange and burdened with fewer legal obligations with an avoidance of cumbersome registration procedures. Access to the 'recognised markets' will be open not only to those already eligible for bourse membership but also others not authorised, such as insurance companies, mutual funds, industrial enterprises and portfolio managers, as long as they are deemed to have sufficient capital strength and are considered suitable to operate in trading. The legislation says each 'recognised market' would determine the conditions applicable to its trading such as the required amount of shares distributed, the minimum size of a company and the kind of information obligation required of the companies listed in the market. The Stockholm bourse is not opposed in principle to the end of its monopoly but it does object to any change that might damage its own activities through losing lucrative business to other markets. 'We strongly support free competition and we are happy to compete but we want to do so on a level playing field,' explains Mr Leif Vindervag, the head of research at the bourse. 'What we fear is that the recognised markets might offer a cheaper way of trading which could cream away many large companies. 'After all, we have comprehensive obligations to all listed companies, and must provide a similar service to small as well as large enterprises.' Mr Lundgren argues the proposed changes are required to adapt Sweden's stock exchange legislation to international standards and particularly to the relevant European Community rules, though the Stockholm bourse questions whether this is the real reason for the reform. The end of the monopoly is a crucial ingredient in the Swedish government's wider free market strategy, designed to encourage a greater volume of securities trading in Sweden and stimulate more liquidity in the market. Last December a 0.5 per cent turnover tax on share dealing was abolished, a move that has already brought back trading that went to London and other foreign markets. The government recently signalled its intention to end the restricted share system and ensure that, from next January, all shares are freely available for purchase by foreigners and Swedes alike, rather than the 30 per cent as at present. This spring the first of Sweden's large privatisations will take place and this is also expected to stimulate considerable bourse interest. Mr Vindervag estimates that those reforms could improve business turnover on the Stockholm bourse by more than 50 per cent this year. The bourse is more worried at the moment about the attractions for trading in Swedish securities in markets outside Sweden, rather than with any future competitive challenge within the country's own borders. Mr Bengt Ryden, the bourse head, plans to visit London next month to bang the drum for the Stockholm exchange to foreign investors.</p>

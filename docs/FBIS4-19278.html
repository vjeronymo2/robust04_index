			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irini Kakoulidou: "Greece Caught Unprepared"] </F>   [Text]  <H8>  Greek Governments Responsible for Greece'sInability To </H8> Serve as Link Between East and West    The relative advantage that Greece sought to secure by  participating in the trans-European networks of transportation,  telecommunications, and energy, seems at present almost  impossible to attain. It does not seem probable that Greece will  become a significant link between East and West -- and the  burden of responsibility for this state of affairs rests upon  the Greek side.    It took nothing less than last week's declaration by EC  delegate Mr. Matutes to the effect that the Commission is indeed  keen on the construction of an alternative road which will  bypass Egnatia Odhos, for Greek authorities to recognize the  construction of "our own" Egnatia Road as a most urgent matter.  So slow has the Greek side been in acting to obtain  incorporation of the Egnatia route into the trans-European  networks that its fate is still languishing in indecision. It  must also be noted that, in the context of discussions on this  subject by the "Christofersen team," other member nations are  strongly opposed to such an incorporation of the Egnatia.    The construction -- which many sources consider already  imminently probable -- of a "counter-Egnatia Road," will destroy  Egnatia's privilege of being the exclusive carrier of West-bound  goods from the East. The construction of a route connecting  Varna with Dirrachion, which all our northern neighbors are  energetically aiming for, will attract a significant percentage  of transport activity, thus turning Egnatia into a minor route  of minor significance. This is bound to happen even when  Egnatia's inclusion in the trans-European transport system is  fully assured.    In the race of the European nations to exploit the political  and economic opportunities now being created by the unification  of "Old Continent" networks, our country is unprepared and short  of breath. Nor is this inability to participate advantageously  in the trans-European networks limited to transportation. Having  been too slow to act, Greece is no longer capable of securing  the passage of basic telecommunications and energy lines through  its territory. In particular, any possibility for telephone  networks seems to be definitively lost, since the basic axis  linking East and West through the Balkans will have to pass  north of our border. Moreover, the country is facing a serious  danger of becoming marginalized with respect to energy networks  as well.    The responsibility for this emerging situation lies to a  very  large extent on the Greek side, not only because Greece acted  too slowly in regard to networks passing through it, but also,  and most significantly, because it did not prepare itself to  enter this united market. The previous government remained  unaware of how important the unification of trans-European  networks was for the political and economic life of Greece. It  therefore failed to cultivate its opportunities for  participation. The present government, likewise, seemed to be  taken by surprise at the rapidity of developments and our  neighbors' more fruitful efforts in this domain. It is accurate  to say that, since transportation, energy, and  telecommunications networks are the primary means for Greece to  preserve its ties with the other nations of the European Union,  our country has a vital interest in their development.    As has been mentioned, Greece's inadequate preparation for  participating in the trans-European networks is the primary  reason for its inability to develop the opportunity to its  advantage. The individual networks marked for inclusion in the  overall unification program of trans-European systems are  railways, roads, telecommunications, electricity, and natural  gas. To date, Greek efforts along any of these lines have given  only disappointing results.  <H5>  Natural Gas </H5>   The natural gas pipeline which meets the corresponding  Bulgarian one at the border is the only link presently projected  between our country and any other corresponding trans-European  network. An older proposal to provide Skopje with Russian  natural gas piped through Greece has now been abandoned: our  neighbor is in the process of finalizing the investments which  will allow it to import gas through Bulgaria.    The possibility of a link-up with Albania which would allow  it to get Russian gas through Greece remains viable. According  to reliable sources, such a link-up is still under  consideration, and the Community seems to be in favor of it. The  fact that southern Albania exhibits significant industrial  activity -- which in turn implies the presence of potential  consumers of gas -- makes it financially advantageous to provide  our neighbor with gas from Greece since costly investments to  construct conduits of great length within Albania would not be  necessary. Of course, if this proposal goes through, it will  require not only Greek investment capital to bring the pipeline  to the Greco-Albanian border, but also the modification of  energy-related policies to assure the consumption of natural gas  by large-scale consumers in northwestern Greece. Only in this  manner will the profitability of the project be safeguarded.  <H5>  Railroads </H5>   To truly implement the European Union, it is necessary to  connect the individual national railroads to form a single,  continuous, high-speed network, about 30,000 km long. (Speeds of  200-300 km/hr have already been achieved in many cases.)    Construction of this high-speed European network is neither  planned nor undertaken centrally. Instead, the national railroad  companies are individually responsible for the planning and  construction of each national network, to be carried out in  conformity with certain basic agreements applying to all.    Two Greek railroad lines have been incorporated into this  network: that of Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni (which includes  the detour Larissa-Volos), and that of Athens-Corinth-Patra. Any  activities undertaken to date in order to further the creation  of a Greek high-speed network have been woefully inadequate and  create a most disappointing picture of the Greek railroads.    This lackadaisical attitude towards the development of the  rail links in Greece is indeed nothing less than astonishing.  Especially so since the obstacles that non-EC countries at times  set up in order to hamper our transit to Europe present us with  a motivation for finding and using mixed transportation  solutions combining, for example, railway transport with boats  or trucks.    It is worth noting that in modern harbors, mixed transit of  this sort makes up the greater part of all transportation  activity. Available statistics indicate that it constitutes 40  percent of all movement at Le Havre, 60 percent at Hamburg, and  70 percent at Bremen.    An estimated 400,000 railroad cars go through the Straits of  Messina at Sicily every year, while in Denmark the Danlink line  -- a collaborative effort among Denmark, Sweden, and Germany --  moves a total of 2 million tons per year.  <H8>  A Hope for Greece: The Egnatia Road </H8>   The state of the highway network in Greece is characterized  by the inadequacy of the roads connecting western and  northwestern Greece with the eastern, central, and northern  parts of the country, by the seasonal interruptions of many  connections, and by the low level of safety on the roads.    In spite of these conditions, the percentage of  appropriations allocated for a number of years to both the  national and regional road systems has been desperately  inadequate. Characteristically, since the completion, in 1970,  of the national highways Athens-Thessaloniki,  Athens-Corinth-Patra, Andirrion-Ioannina, and of the northern  network of Crete, no projects of similar importance have been  accomplished. The subsequent works of Patra-Pirgos,  Thessaloniki-Kavala, and Corinth-Tripolis are not comparable to  the works of the 1970's. Aspirations concerning Greece's  participation in trans-European transport systems do not extend  beyond visions of the Egnatia Odhos, while hopes for road  improvement and the construction of basic highway networks are  left hanging upon the notorious "Delors II package."    The principal works projected by the Package are the  following:     -  The Egnatia Odhos which will consist of a  highway length of 400 km and will incorporate 200 km of existing  national roadways, bringing the total to 600 km.    -  The national  highway of Patra-Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni.    -  The road system  of northern Crete.    -  The western Mediterranean system of  Ioannina-Andirrio-Rio-Patra-Pirgos-Kalamata.    -  The system of  Corinth-Tripoli-Kalamata (constituting supplementary works).    Most of these projects are still only on paper. The section  from Yliki to Katerini, to which 460 billion drachmae had been  allotted, absorbed only 5 billion in 1993 -- an amount identical  to that absorbed by the section of the Egnatia Odhos from  Igoumenitsa to Kavala, which had had 500 billion allotted to it.  The section from Andirrio to Igoumenitsa -- which had been  budgeted at 120 billion -- absorbed last year only 2 billion  drachmae.  <H5>  The Delay </H5>   A 10-year delay in the construction of roads connecting  eastern with western Greece, and especially in the construction  of the Egnatia, is responsible for the serious inefficiency of  our transport networks connecting us to Europe. The situation is  much aggravated by the war in former Yugoslavia.  <H8>  Telecommunications Arc Beyond the Border </H8>   Forecasts concerning the possibility that Greece may  participate in trans-European telecommunications networks are  not encouraging. The hope that Greece might play the role of a  telecommunications link within the wider Balkans and the Middle  East seems altogether unrealizable. Recently it was learned that  the European Commission is studying an fiber optic system that  will connect Italy and Turkey by passing through Skopje and  Bulgaria. In this manner a "telecommunications arc" extending,  on the one hand, into the countries of the former Soviet Union,  and on the other, toward the Turco-Cypriot pseudonation, will be  created beyond our northern border.  <H5>  Electricity </H5>   The possibility of Greece connecting with European  electricity networks is gloomily slim. Of the three countries  with which we share a border to the north, Albania does not have  a connection with Europe to date, Greece's connection through  former Yugoslavia has been cut off because of the war, and a  connection through Bulgaria is not feasible due to the special  characteristics of its own grid. This means that at present,  Greece is completely cut off from the electricity networks of  West Europe. The problem becomes aggravated because of the  shortage of electric energy which Greece currently faces and  which, under certain circumstances, makes it mandatory to import  electricity.    The underwater cable which will link the Greek electricity  grid with Italy has been registered as one of the trans-European  networks. In spite of the initial optimism over this prospect,  however, the advantages of the connection appear to be extremely  limited. To begin with, the Community considers this investment  to be only part of a larger package which includes a similar  connection between Greece and Turkey, in anticipation of  Turkey's eventual participation in the unified electrical  networks of Europe. Acting as an intermediary between Turkey and  Europe could prove to be politically and financially  advantageous for our country, yet only on condition that this  tripartite connection of Turkey, Greece, and Italy be the  primary, if not the only, such connection.    It has recently been learned that a similar project to  connect Turkey with European sources of electrical energy by  going through our northern neighbors is now being worked out. In  the context of this project, an agreement to link Albania and  Italy by underwater cable has already been signed. This  investment, moreover, will cost much less than the corresponding  Greco-Italian cable, because of the shorter distance and the  shallower waters between those two countries. The new line under  consideration will connect Turkey with Italy by going through  Bulgaria-Skopje-Albania. Thus, even in the case of electrical  networks, Greece is being marginalized. And this marginalization  becomes more sharply felt thanks to the electrical shortage that  Greece faces at present. Put differently, the danger exists that  Greece will not only not function as the intermediary between  Italy and Turkey, but that the Greco-Turkish network will be  used only for importing electrical energy from our neighbor in  order to cover our own shortage. In a similar way the underwater  cable between Greece and Italy will probably be used by the  Public Power Corporation [DEH] for imports from the West  European countries.</p>

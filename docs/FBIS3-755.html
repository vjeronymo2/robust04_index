The African National  Congress [ANC] earlier asked an emergency meeting of the  management committee to replace Mr Mangope with a new  administration under the direction of the TEC and the South  African Government. A detailed proposal will be considered by  the TEC on Tuesday.    The management committee, after a five hour-meeting, stopped  short of calling for Mr Mangope's replacement. It decided to  send to Mmabatho a team consisting of among others ANC Secretary  General Cyril Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development Minister  Roelf Meyer. But the TEC will be hard pushed to resist an ANC  call for Mr Mangope to go.    The TEC team visiting Mmabatho was briefed to assess the  overall security situation, to consider practical steps to  ensure services were restored and to "decide on the spot on the  action to be taken in the light of President Lucas Mangope's  latest statement in which he has not responded in direct terms  to the call for free and fair elections and transitional steps  to be taken for the re- incorporation of Bophuthatswana into  South Africa".    Mr Mangope met Independent Electoral Commission chairman Mr  Justice Johann Kriegler on Friday night, but failed to give  guarantees on free political activity.    At a press conference after the management committee met, Mr  Ramaphosa said the management committee felt that Mr Mangope  needed to go much further in complying with a TEC resolution  last week to allow free and fair political activity. He said it  needed to be agreed that the TEC and the South African  Government should agree that the situation had deteriorated to  the extent that Mr Mangope could no longer exercise effective  control. He said action needed to be taken to replace Mr  Mangope with an administration set up by the TEC and the South  African Government.    Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Meyer met behind closed doors during the  management committee meeting. Mr Meyer went to the management  committee with specific proposals from President F W de Klerk  aimed at returning stability to the region and at ensuring free  and fair political activity.    The TEC took a resolution last week giving Mr Mangope a week  in which to ensure free political activity in the homeland,  failing which he would face a range of punitive financial and  diplomatic sanctions designed to ensure compliance.    The management committee meeting took place amid ANC  unhappiness with the manner in which Mr Mangope appeared to have  salvaged his position as head of state and then compound the  injury by not giving assurances to Mr Justice Kriegler.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: US Prudential prunes its Tokyo equity operation PRUDENTIAL Securities Japan, Tokyo arm of the US securities house, has realigned its Japanese equity operations as a result of the Tokyo stock market's weakness. Japanese equities will no longer be a strategic core of operations, Prudential said. It has reduced the number of staff by 40 to 100. Mr James Walsh, regional director of the Asia Pacific region, said the weakness of the Tokyo stock market represented a fundamental change of investment flows in Japan, and the financial services industry needed to undergo a long-term change. Trading volumes remained low and commissions at Japanese and foreign brokers alike had fallen steeply. Foreign houses were finding it increasingly difficult to justify the high costs of Tokyo operations, Prudential said. Prudential said it would continue to provide institutional clients with a Japanese equity service, while focusing on US equities and international bonds sales. It will retain its membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as the only non-Japanese member of the exchange's board.</p>

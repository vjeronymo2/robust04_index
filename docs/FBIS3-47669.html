			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The government's economic  pump-priming package will be unveiled next Monday [24 January]  at the earliest, Japan's top economic planner said Tuesday.    The seven ruling coalition parties are trying to coordinate  their views on "the one pending issue" in writing the package,  Economic Planning Agency [EPA] Director General Manae Kubota  told a regular press conference.    Kubota was referring to a dispute among the seven parties  over whether a consumption tax hike should be included in the  package to cover proposed income tax cuts.    The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest of the  seven, has been strongly opposed to raising the consumption tax  rate from the current 3 percent.    The coalition parties are prepared to "do all they can"  toward this weekend in order to prevent a further delay in  formation of economic steps, Kubota said.    She said a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to  finance the new economic package will be formulated along with  the announcement of the economic measures.</p>

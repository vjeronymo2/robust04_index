			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFOOTBALL / WEEK14;  </P> <P> THE OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> GAME OF THE DAY  </P> <P> New York Giants (9-4) at Denver (10-3), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 2.  </P> <P> This was shaping up as a possible Super Bowl preview until the Giants lost  their last two games and fell into a tie for the NFC East lead with  Philadelphia. The Giants beat Denver in the Super Bowl nearly three years ago  at Pasadena, 39-20, but the Broncos are a different team these days, with Bobby  Humphrey to go with John Elway on offense and a much stronger defense. The  Giants have gotten a lot of mileage from Ottis Anderson, but Phil Simms has  struggled with a knee injury. Lawrence Taylor, who played only a half last week  with a hairline fracture in his foot, has 12 sacks and should be up for the  chase against Elway.  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE GAMES  </P> <P> New Orleans (6-7) at Buffalo (8-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Bills have lost two of their last three but hold a one-game lead in the AFC  East because Miami has lost two in row. The Saints seemed headed for the  playoffs after overcoming a 1-4 start, but have lost two in a row. Buffalo  figures to muster more offense with Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas at chilly Rich  Stadium. Saint Coach Jim Mora replaced struggling quarterback Bobby Hebert last  week with John Fourcade, who may start. The Bills are 6-1 at home, the Saints  are 4-2 on the road.  </P> <P> Kansas City (6-6-1) at Green Bay (8-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 4.  </P> <P> These teams are the two biggest surprises in the NFL this season. The Packers  are tied with Minnesota atop the NFC Central and Kansas City still is in the  hunt for a wild-card berth. Green Bay has done it with quarterback Don  Majkowski, who leads the NFL with 3,719 yards and 24 touchdowns, and a defense  that has allowed 20 or fewer points in five of the last six games. The Chiefs  give the ball to Christian Okoye, who has 1,191 yards and 10 touchdowns, and  leave the rest to the NFL's No. 2-ranked defense. Of Green Bay's 13 games, 10  have been decided by four points or fewer. The Chiefs are 1-4-1 on the road,  the Packers are 7-1 at home.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay (5-8) at Houston (8-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Oilers lead Cleveland by half a game and Cincinnati by a game in the AFC  Central, but play the Bengals next week before finishing the season with  Cleveland. Houston has won three of four games, Warren Moon driving the Oilers  to Lorenzo White's winning touchdown with 21 seconds left last week at  Pittsburgh. Vinny Testaverde's nemesis, the interception, cropped up five times  last week in Tampa Bay's loss to Green Bay. Houston is 5-2 at home.  </P> <P> San Diego (4-9) at Washington (7-6), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Chargers are sticking with rookie Billy Joe Tolliver at quarterback, even  though he threw for two interceptions and was sacked five times by the New York  Jets last week. San Diego has some promise on offense with runner Marion Butts  and receiver Anthony Miller, but has scored more than 20 points just twice this  season. The Redskins, hanging in the playoff race, have won two straight games  impressively with Mark Rypien at quarterback.  </P> <P> AFC GAMES  </P> <P> Seattle (5-8) at Cincinnati (7-6), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> After having been benched for two games in favor of young Kelly Stouffer,  quarterback Dave Krieg led the Seahawks past Buffalo Monday night. The Bengals  are tied with the Raiders and Miami for the AFC's last playoff spot, but still  can win the title in the AFC Central. Cincinnati defeated Seattle last season  in the playoffs at Riverfront Stadium, 21-13. The Bengals rushed for 254 yards  in that game and will attack Seattle, ranked 24th against the run, with the  NFL's most productive ground game. James Brooks has gained 1,065 yards this  season.  </P> <P> Cleveland (7-5-1) at Indianapolis (6-7), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Bernie Kosar's sore elbow sent him to the bench early in the Browns' 21-0 loss  to Cincinnati last week and backup Mike Pagel could start against the Colts,  his former team. The Browns are 0-2-1 since ending a four-game winning streak.  The Colts probably lost out on the playoffs in a 22-10 defeat against New  England last week. Eric Dickerson has gained at least 1,000 yards for the  seventh consecutive season.  </P> <P> New England (5-8) at Miami (7-6), 5 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: ESPN  </P> <P> Miami's playoff chances have been jolted by consecutive losses to Pittsburgh  and Kansas City after the Dolphins had moved into a tie with Buffalo for the  AFC East lead. Marc Wilson, starting for the first time in two years, led the  Patriots past Indianapolis last week. Miami's Dan Marino has passed for 3,208  yards and 21 touchdowns. The Dolphins ended a seven-game losing streak against  the Patriots 12 weeks ago, 24-10.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh (6-7) at New York Jets (4-9), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Steelers, after consecutive wins over San Diego and Miami, probably lost  out on the playoffs last week in a last-minute loss to Houston. Quarterback  Bubby Brister is a real threat again with his injured knee mended. New York has  won two in a row for the first time this season, but it may be too late for  Coach Joe Walton. The Jets beat Pittsburgh last season, 24-20. New York is 1-5  at home.  </P> <P> NFC GAMES  </P> <P> Detroit (4-9) at Chicago (6-7), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> If the Bears can beat anybody, it may be the Lions, who have lost 10 in a row  to Chicago. Detroit, though, is improving by the week, having won three of its  last four games, against contenders Green Bay, Cleveland and New Orleans. The  Lions have played well lately with either Rodney Peete, who has a knee injury,  or Bob Gagliano at quarterback. Chicago has mostly struggled with Mike Tomczak  or Jim Harbaugh. The Bears beat the Lions 11 weeks ago, 47-27.  </P> <P> Atlanta (3-10) at Minnesota (8-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Vikings need this one with a Cleveland-Cincinnati finish in their battle  with Green Bay for the NFC Central title. Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller will  be chased by Minnesota's front four, which is after the NFL sack record. Keith  Millard has 16 sacks, Chris Doleman 14, Al Noga 9 1/2 and Henry Thomas eight.  Atlanta is 0-7 on the road, Minnesota is 6-0 at home.  </P> <P> Dallas (1-12) at Philadelphia (9-4), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Jimmy Johnson's Thanksgiving Day charges that Buddy Ryan is a bounty hunter  lend spice to this one. Troy Aikman threw for four touchdown passes last week  with little pass rush from the Rams, but Reggie White and the Eagles ought to  pressure him. Philadelphia has beaten Dallas four consecutive times, including  27-0 on Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> NOTE: All times Pacific. Standings, Page 20.  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Brewing side helps Molson out of red MOLSON, the diversified Canadian group, has returned to the black in the year to the end of March, buoyed by solid performances in its brewing and special chemicals businesses. The group reported a profit of CDollars 126.2m (USDollars 106.00), or CDollars 2.25 a share, for the year, against a loss of CDollars 39m, or 72 cents, after special charges a year earlier. Earnings for the 1991-1992 year were in line with analysts' forecasts. The 1990-1991 charges covered full provision for Molson's equity investment in Australian-based International Brewing Holdings, equal to CDollars 2.93 a share. Excluding the provision, the group realised a profit of CDollars 118.5m, or CDollars 2.21 a share. Revenues in the current year were CDollars 2.9bn against CDollars 2.5bn. Brewing and special chemicals provided the thrust in fiscal 1991-1992. The brewery business's operating profit rose 7 per cent to CDollars 172.8m, reflecting the effects of the rationalisation programme. The improvement came even though overall industry sales declined in Canada. Molson now has almost 52 per cent of the domestic market. US sales rose 2.1 per cent and accounted for 19 per cent of the US imported beer market. Divarsey, the speciality chemicals concern, saw operating profit jump 62 per cent to CDollars 75.5m on sales of CDollars 1.2bn. The upturn reflected the integration of DuBois Chemicals, acquired last April, and an improved market share in the US. Although sales at the building materials retailing subsidiary improved, operating profit dipped 28 per cent to CDollars 21m. The outlook is better for the current year.</p>

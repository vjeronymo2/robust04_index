			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Katsuhiko Iino; received via Nikkei Telecom </F> Database]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- A senior PRC Foreign Ministry  official on 25 December spoke about the Chinese Government's  overall diplomatic policies centering around those concerning  Asia. As for the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue, he gave an  optimistic assessment, saying: "In part, there are encouraging  signs. If all those concerned make efforts to continue  dialogue, an appropriate solution will be found eventually." In  explaining China's exports of oil to North Korea, he said,  "China and North Korea will in the future continue to further  normal economic trade relations, based on the principle of  equality and reciprocity." He thus hinted that China's policy  is to continue to export oil to North Korea in 1994 at least at  the level of that of 1993.    As far as the matter of exporting oil to North Korea is  concerned, a U.S. State Department spokesman recently talked  about the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea if  negotiations with that country fail. The PRC Foreign Ministry  official's remarks can be said to have confirmed China's stand  of not being willing to cooperate in an effort to ban oil  exports to North Korea. The official indicated that China is  urging North Korea to accept dialogue on the nuclear question,  for he said, "We have always said to all the people concerned  that what is needed is dialogue and not confrontation."    Asked about the economic situation of North Korea, the  official insisted, "China does not interfere in or comment on  the domestic affairs of any other nation," but he still assessed  the policy recently announced by North Korean President Kim  Il-song of "giving top priority to trade, agriculture, and light  industry" as being an "important strategic policy in the  economic sector." He welcomed the new policy, noting, "We hope  that North Korea will be successful in improving the national  economy and the living standards of the people by implementing  the new policy."    It is unusual for an official of China's responsible bodies  to comment specifically on North Korea's economic policy. The  Chinese Government appears to be positively accepting North  Korea's new policy of placing emphasis on opening up the country  and improving the people's living conditions.    When asked whether there was no possibility of resuming  negotiations with the United Kingdom over the Hong Kong  question, the official only criticized the United Kingdom and  noted that China will hasten with preparations for the return of  Hong Kong.</p>

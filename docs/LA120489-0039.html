			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Getty Sells Masterpieces: The J. Paul Getty Museum has sold 14 paintings worth  a total of $18.9 million at five sales in London in the past two weeks,  auctioneers said. The Getty works sold by Sotheby's were a mixed lot by  impressionist and 19th-Century artists. Only one failed to sell: a dreary brown  landscape by Edgar Degas. The top price was $6.8 million paid by the Japanese  conglomerate Aksa International for Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton  boy in a landscape. Other notable sales included $3 million for a picture of  the cliffs at Pourville in Normandy by Claude Monet, $3.6 million for a picture  of three ballet dancers by Degas and $3.4 million for a standing female nude by  Pierre Bonnard. The museum has sold paintings before and said it would use the  proceeds from the latest sales to acquire other works better suited to its  collection and to public display. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

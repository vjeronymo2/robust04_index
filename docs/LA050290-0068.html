			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OAK VIEW;  </P> <P> COMMENT SOUGHT ON PLANNED RESTAURANT  </P> <P> A controversial proposal to build a spaghetti house at the top of Arnaz Grade  on California 33 in Oak View faces public scrutiny today from Ojai Valley  residents concerned about increased traffic and air pollution.  </P> <P> The county Environmental Report Review Committee will hold a public hearing on  the proposed family-style restaurant with an entrance on a high-accident  section of California 33.  </P> <P> The hearing begins at 1:30 p.m. in Room 344 of the county government's Hall of  Administration.  </P> <P> The committee postponed the hearing last week after finding that a draft  environmental study failed to cite new restrictions on air pollution for new  development in Ojai Valley. The valley has the most restrictive air-quality  standards for new construction in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The Vince's Spaghetti House Inc. proposal is the first development to run up  against the tightened air-quality regulations that took effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> But LeRoy Andrews, architect of the proposed spaghetti house, said his client  John Cuccia and family, owners of the restaurant chain, should not have to meet  the stricter standards because they filed their application last June before  the new rules took effect.  </P> <P> "It's totally unfair," Andrews said Tuesday. He called the new hurdle "the  standard bureaucratic mess." THIA BELL  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 7 DIE IN INDIA NUPTIALS CASTE WAR  </P> <P> Seven people died and 50 were reported missing because a low-caste 15-year-old  bridegroom from India's Taj Mahal town of Agra wanted to ride to his wedding on  horseback, a local member of Parliament said today.  </P> <P> Police in Agra, 125 miles south of Delhi, said they had arrested 200 people and  were keeping four ghettos for Harijans -- the untouchables at the bottom of the  Hindu caste hierarchy -- under curfew after the wedding sparked a caste war.  </P> <P> Bridegroom Ram Deen, a Harijan, eventually rode to nearby Panwari village in a  police jeep to marry 13-year-old Mundra while the army fought back thousands of  enraged Jats, the caste of small landowners, in the village and police  confronted thousands of Agra Harijans just outside.  </P></p>

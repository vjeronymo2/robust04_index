			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Reichmanns to focus on property management CANADA'S Reichmann family is turning its energies to building a new property leasing and management company out of the ashes of Olympia &amp; York Developments, the developer which filed for bankruptcy protection last May. Under O&amp;Y's debt-restructuring proposals, the property management business will be rolled into a new company, Olympia &amp; York Properties (OYP). The creation of OYP depends on creditors' approval of the plan, which covers about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt. The Reichmanns are concentrating on retaining management contracts for buildings likely to be seized by creditors in the course of the restructuring. Mr Philip Reichmann, nephew of O&amp;Y founder Mr Paul Reichmann, recently persuaded creditors of First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's former Toronto flagship, to re-engage O&amp;Y as the building's operator, in spite of bids from other managers. About a dozen of O&amp;Y's 33 creditor groups have approved the restructuring proposals while four have rejected it. The remaining meetings, including a vote by unsecured creditors, are to take place over the next 10 days. The Reichmanns face an uphill struggle to regain management of some of O&amp;Y's most prestigious projects, including London's Canary Wharf. Details, Page 16</p>

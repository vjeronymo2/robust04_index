			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAC BELL, STRIKING UNION MAKE NO PROGRESS IN TALKS  </P> <P> No progress was reported Wednesday in informal talks in Oakland between Pacific  Bell and representatives of 42,000 striking telephone workers in the fourth day  of a work stoppage that also involves two regional telephone companies on the  East Coast.  </P> <P> As the strike continued, tensions were high outside phone company offices. In  one incident, a Communications Workers of America shop steward, Shari  Underwood, was treated for cuts and bruises and released from a Van Nuys  hospital Wednesday after being hit by a car while she picketed at a Pacific  Bell building on Van Nuys Boulevard. Union officials said they did not know the  identity of the driver of the car and police were unable to provide details. It  was not known if the incident was related to the strike.  </P> <P> And in New York and Massachusetts on Wednesday, police arrested 22 striking  telephone workers on suspicion of crimes ranging from disorderly conduct and  resisting arrest to failing to obey a policeman's order to move.  </P> <P> In Philadelphia, CWA officials said their negotiators were preparing a response  to a modified contract offer by Bell Atlantic, one of the struck companies.  Talks may resume today.  </P> <P> The two sides in the third strike, involving New York-based NYNEX Corp., which  serves the Northeast, have not talked since last Friday.  </P> <P> At issue in all three strikes are wages and company proposals to require  employees to pay for a greater share of health benefits.  </P> <P> The strikes, which began Sunday, involve 157,000 workers and affect phone  customers in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Workers at three other  regional phone companies are threatening to strike this weekend if contracts  are not signed.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the AFL-CIO Executive Council passed a resolution urging the  public, union members and their families "to advise the local subsidiaries of  Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis (the parent company of Pacific Bell)  that they will defer payment of their telephone bills until the strikes are  settled."  </P> <P> The council for the 15 million-member AFL-CIO supported the non-payment  strategy as a tactic to deal with the high degree of automation in the  telecommunications industry.  </P> <P> But regardless of automation, company managers filling in for striking  employees have been barely able to keep pace with the flood of  directory-assistance calls.  </P></p>

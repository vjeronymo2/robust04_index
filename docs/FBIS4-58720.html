			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-al-Adib [Salim al-Za'nun], acting  speaker of the National Council, received the delegation of the  UN fact-finding commission at his office yesterday afternoon .    After brother Abu-al-Adib reviewed the latest developments  of  the peace process in Gaza and Jericho, he said that despite the  commencement of the peace process and the achievement of the  peace agreement, the Israeli authorities were still imposing an  economic blockade and security cordon on the West Bank and  Jerusalem. Brother Abu-al-Adib stressed that the Palestinian  authority would be extremely eager to preserve human rights and  liberties there. He also stressed the need for the World Bank  and the donor countries to be committed to the support of the  Palestinian economy and the creation of job opportunities for  thousands of unemployed as a result of the occupation policies.    Brother Abu-al-Adib then listened to a briefing on the  fact-finding commission's task from its chairman, Stanley  Kalpage, the permanent representative of the Repubic of Sri  Lanka at the United Nations, who said that they were visiting  the countries neighboring Israel to investigate the Israeli  authorities' practices and its breaches of human rights. He  added that Israel was not cooperating with the commission and  would not allow it to enter Israel or the occupied Arab  territories to find out about the Israeli authorities treatment  of the Palestinian population there. It is to be recalled that  the commission today visited wounded from the Hebron massacre at  the Al-Husayn medical complex.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kunming, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Officials of the  World Health Organization (WHO) said the cooperation with the  Chinese Government in implementing the woman-child health care  and planned parenthood program in poverty-stricken areas is  "pleasing and fruitful".    One of the biggest cooperative programs between the Chinese  Government and international organizations ever, the program  started in 1990 has witnessed remarkable progress in improving  the health and nutrition of pregnant women and little children.    Some 120 million people, nearly one-ninth of the country's  population, in about 300 poverty-stricken counties all over  China have benefited from the program.    Official sources said that by the end of this year, the  death  rates of pregnant women and little children in those counties  will have been reduced by some 20 percent from rates in 1990.    A 1990 survey showed that the death rate for children in 108  of those 300 counties reached more than 68.02 per thousand, and  the maternal mortality rate was even higher in some half of the  project counties.    According to the survey, in those poor counties, pneumonia,  diarrhea and asphyxia are the main killers of little children,  while two-thirds of the pregnant women die of puerperal  infection and ante partum hemorrhage.    Scheduled to conclude in 1995, the program is aimed at  reducing death rates of mothers and children by improving and  expanding primary health care services in the remote and poor  districts.    With the help of the United Nations Children's Fund, the  United Nations Population Fund and the World Health  Organization, Chinese Governments at all levels have trained  more than 120,000 village and county doctors in the latest  practical methods of treating deadly diseases and in preventive  health care.    According to statistics offered by the Ministry of Public  Health, from 1990 to 1993, those international organizations  have invested some 24 million U.S. dollars to improve the  village and county health care centers as well as anti-epidemic  institutes in the 300 project counties.    Meanwhile, governments at all levels in those districts have  poured some 47 million yuan into buying medical instruments for  those grassroots health care centers.    Official sources said that at the beginning of this year,  the  international organizations had decided to prolong the program  for a few years more and had increased the number of the project  counties to 305.    Though China has a large population living in  poverty-stricken areas, officials from the international  organizations said that they believed that the program will be  able to realize its objective of `everyone enjoying free health  care from the year 2000' through continued hard work.</p>

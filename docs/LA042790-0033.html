			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL SYMPATHIZERS 'BITE BACK'  </P> <P> Please be assured that just because I care for the rights, protection and  welfare of animals does not mean I do not also care for the rights, protection  and welfare of those less fortunate of my own species.  </P> <P> I do, and so do all the persons in the animal arena I know personally.  </P> <P> Please, do not invalidate our efforts or demean them because animals are on our  agenda of most important societal concerns. It is not, after all, animal's  treatment of animals that is at question: It is man's behavior (or misbehavior)  that is the crux of our concern.  </P> <P> ELAINE LIVESEY-FASSEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

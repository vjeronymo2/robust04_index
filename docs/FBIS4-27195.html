			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The chief of the largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called Sunday [29 May]  on the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to  resign en masse before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven  (G-7) major industrial countries in Naples in July.    LDP President Yohei Kono said during a lecture in Niigata,  north of Tokyo, "what can the minority ruling government promise  at the G- 7 summit meeting? Can it carry out what it has  decided? We must consider whom we can dispatch to the  international community with responsibility."    Kono told reporters after the lecture that he supports an  early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap  general election, saying the current government does not reflect  the opinion of the people shown at the general election last  summer.    The president of the LDP, which was ousted from power for  the  first time in 38 years by the coalition last August, also said  his party and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ], the second largest opposition party which withdrew from  the ruling coalition in April, share the view that the minority  government should be replaced.    Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP said  Sunday it would be difficult for the LDP to form a coalition  government with the SDPJ as the majority of its members are  supported by labor unions.    "The majority of SDPJ members of parliament depend on labor  unions (for their seats)," Watanabe said during a Japan  Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television program. "So it is  practically impossible to form a coalition unless agreement is  reached with labor unions."    Watanabe, who heads the third largest LDP faction, said "it  is also wrong to think dividing the SDPJ would be easy" to form  a coalition with some SDPJ lawmakers.    The LDP's main support still lies among leading business  circles, while the SDPJ draws its strength from Japan's labor  unions.    On prospects for the timing of a general election, Watanabe  said it is reasonable that the next general election be held  under the new electoral system since only the passing of a bill  is needed for demarcating the boundaries of a new single-seat  electoral map.    Watanabe said, however, that Hata has "the arbitrary right  to  dissolve" the Diet, suggesting an election might be held under  the current multiseat system.    The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform  bills replacing the current multiseat system for the lower house  with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional  representation.    An independent panel of experts is currently dividing the  nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori showed understanding of  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for an agreement between  ruling and opposition parties to hold a general election under  the current system, delaying the introduction of the new  electoral system until the following general election.    Mori told a news conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido, in  northern  Japan, that "it is one idea that the leaders of responsible  parties gather and take such a measure (as Murayama offered),"  suggesting his willingness to cooperate with the SDPJ.    Mori also said the LDP should cope with a general election  under the current electoral system "if Hata dissolves (the Diet)  of his own accord."    Three senior LDP legislators said Sunday if the Hata cabinet  resigns en masse, the LDP may nominate a non-LDP candidate as  premier.    Former Construction Minister Taku Yamasaki, former Chief  Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and former Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the  suggestion on an Asahi TV program. The trio have created a new  policy study group.    Yamasaki said, "(the next government) will be a caretaker  cabinet until the next general election and will be a de facto  coalition cabinet of the LDP and the SDPJ. But it will be  difficult for a candidate from the two parties to assume the  premiership."    "Michio Watanabe will be a strong candidate (if he quits the  party and becomes an independent)," Yamasaki said.</p>

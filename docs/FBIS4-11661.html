			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 March  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Al-Azhar Defended; Mufti on Fatwas    2. Lawsuit Against Use of Satellite Dishes    3. Religious Seminar Stresses Islamic Values, Mosque's  Role    4. Attack Seen as Part of Scheme Against Islam    5. Relations With Non-Muslim Believers    6. Islamic Cultural Option Versus Western Culture    7. Dialogue in Islam    8. The Islamic Economic System  <H5>  AL-AZHAR DEFENDED; MUFTI ON FATWAS </H5>   In an approximately 400-word article on page 24, Chief  Editor  al-Sayyid 'Abd al-Ra'uf rebuts those who "ignorantly and  maliciously" accuse al-Azhar of being a "backward and  narrow-minded institution restricting the freedom of thought and  creativity." He maintains that al-Azhar, with its weight,  history, role, and status "will always remain too strong and  mighty for the weak ones to harm." Apart from being a beacon of  knowledge and learning, the writer says al-Azhar has all along  been the springboard for national struggle against foreign  occupation and aggression. Now, the writer argues, "the voice  of intelligence and moderation against extremism and terrorism  is unleashed from al-Azhar, and from there the voice of  knowledge and faith is unleashed to counter the attack that is  being launched against religion and its principles, values, and  symbols under the pretext of freedom of thought and creativity."    In a related 500-word article on page 10, columnist Majdi  Salim discusses how some people, against the law, are publicly  criticizing some judicial rulings in newspapers. He notes the  "clamor raised by some people against the ruling of the  Administrative Judiciary Court and the State Council giving  al-Azhar the legal right to review artistic works, whether  audio, visual, or printed, as far as religious matters are  concerned." The author comments: "The clamor against al-Azhar  and the law was raised in the name of freedom and liberty. Do  they know law better than the men of law, or are they-- to  achieve their objectives--ready to sacrifice even the laws that  protect them and the homeland?" Salim concludes: "At any rate,  it is not strange for this group, which is used to attacking  ethics and religious values, to throw the rules of the judiciary  overboard."    In a 120-word report by Mahmud 'Ushb on page one, Dr.  Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, the mufti of the republic, says any  capable Muslim can pass fatwas [religious rulings], but those  who do not have the right answers must not try to make fatwas.  The mufti is cited as saying that specialist ulema must be  consulted about fatwas and religious matters in movies and  television dramas. He says: "Religion is sacred and everybody  must be committed to its rules and act accordingly. Passing  fatwas without the required knowledge is a major sin."   <H5>    LAWSUIT AGAINST USE OF SATELLITE DISHES </H5>   A 150-word report on page three says that a young lawyer  from  Aswan has filed a lawsuit demanding that "all decisions allowing  citizens to possess satellite dishes be rescinded." In his  petition, the lawyer says that "explicit sex movies" available  on satellite television "violate Article 2 of the Constitution,  which states that Islam is the religion of the state. They also  violate Article 10, which stipulates that the state shall  guarantee protection of motherhood and childhood, care for the  young, and ensure the right conditions for the development of  their talents."  <H5>  RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ISLAMIC VALUES, MOSQUE'S ROLE </H5>   An approximately 2,000-word report by Ibrahim Nasr and  Mamduh  al- 'Ashri on page four gives an account of a religious seminar  arranged by the newspaper at a Cairo school. According to the  reporters, the ulema addressing the audience stressed the  importance of Islamic upbringing and noted the important role of  the mosque "not only as a place for worship, but also as a  comprehensive cultural and social establishment." The speakers  noted the organic bond between religion and culture.  <H5>  ATTACKS SEEN AS PART OF SCHEME AGAINST ISLAM </H5>   A 300-word article by Basyuni al-Hulwani on page six  discusses a television serial on the era of a Muslim caliph and  concludes that Muslims have historically been the target of  foreign hatred and conspiracies. He says: "History proves that  we have always been the target of ambitions often supported from  outside. The forces of evil, which do not want Islam to be  active, find local hands to implement their wishes. This is  what we are currently suffering from. Will we correctly read  what is happening and realize that the scheme against stability  in Egypt is part of a comprehensive scheme to attack Islam  throughout the world? And will we try to answer one question to  realize who is the real beneficiary from attempts to attack  Egypt? The question is: Who are the enemies of Islam?"  <H5>  RELATIONS WITH NON-MUSLIM BELIEVERS </H5>   An approximately 1,300 word article by Samir al-Hudaybi on  page six discusses Muslims' relations with "the people of the  book"; that is, followers of the other heavenly religions. The  writer begins by noting that one of the "harmful common beliefs  hindering an Islamic upsurge is that paradise is exclusively for  Muslims." The writer provides Koranic texts to make the point  that followers of the other heavenly religions are also  believers. He writes: "Belief is a human phenomenon in all  heavenly religions. Here, believers' hearts are full of virtue  and knowledge that there is a creator and a day of judgment.  But Islam is a way of life and the best of all religions; that  is, the best way of life, and Muslims are required to highlight  it and its virtues to the entire world." The writer concludes:  "God is the lord of all humans. All men are God's people; He  is more gracious to people than their fathers; He is absolute  justice, and no one will enter paradise except those who have  virtuous hearts that know no hatred and love others as they love  themselves."  <H5>  ISLAMIC CULTURAL OPTION VERSUS WESTERN CULTURE </H5>   An approximately 700-word article by Islamic writer Dr.  Muhammad 'Amarah on page seven discusses the Islamic cultural  project, analyzing the factors that make the Islamic option "the  only cultural alternative capable of competing with the Western  cultural option on an international level." The writer  maintains that Western culture, which rearranged its house after  the fall of the Marxist model, "does not want Islam, its nation,  and its culture to grow strong and independent." He explains:  "The strength, upsurge, and independence of this nation mean  the fall of the biggest spoils from the mouth of the `Western  lion,' a real earthquake in the international balance of power,  and the return of the Islamic culture's influence on the  deep-seated world cultures." The writer determines that "the  West, as history certifies, views the culture of Islam as the  first rival, the only competitor, and the main alternative to  its culture in the international cultural struggle."  <H5>  DIALOGUE IN ISLAM </H5>   Columnist Hamid Isma'il writes on page nine the 500-word  second part of an article headlined "Freedom of Thought in  Islam." He says the Koran urges meaningful dialogue and opposes  fanaticism. He notes how early Muslim jurisprudents discussed  their differences without any fanaticism or encroachment on the  rights of their opponents. They never allowed their differences  to develop into conflicts or splits. Isma'il concludes that  "tolerance and mutual respect characterized the general life of  our early jurisprudents, who fully understood the spirit of  Islam and its principles."  <H5>  THE ISLAMIC ECONOMIC SYSTEM </H5>   Page 10 contains an approximately 800-word report by Tariq  'Abdallah on an interview with Dr. Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam,  director of al-Azhar's Islamic Economy Center. 'Abd-al-Salam  stresses the importance of the Islamic economy in pushing the  economic and social life toward a comprehensive development. He  notes that current man-made economic systems are trying to deny  the existence of an Islamic economic system because of its  competitiveness, which no other economic system can match. He  argues: "The current dominance of certain economic systems is  only a mater of time; they will end like other ones, and nothing  will remain but the economic dealings imposed by Islam." "These  dealings," he adds, "are not a man-made theory, but ones imposed  by the book of God [Koran] and the Sunnah [sayings and deeds] of  his prophet."</p>

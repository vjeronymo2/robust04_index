			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities give ground as account opens TURNOVER in equities fell away in London yesterday as the new two-week trading account opened on a flat note. The FT-SE Index quickly lost the 2,700 mark and the downward trend steepened briefly after Wall Street opened lower when news of a sharp rise in the US Purchasing Management Index discouraged hopes of an early easing in Federal Reserve credit policy. Traders sounded unperturbed, however, by yesterday's loss of 10 points on the Footsie, about half of which reflected nothing more than ex dividend adjustments to a batch of leading blue chip stocks. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,697.6, with chart analysts suggesting that 2,675 could be the next testing level. The international scene remained quiet, with sterling showing little change against the D-mark. Multinational stocks moved in response to sector influences rather than wider currency implications. Seaq volume fell to 425.3m shares, compared to Friday's 520.7m. Yesterday's Seaq total was believed to include a programme trade carried out by a leading UK institutional broking house which, as has become the convention, made its move in the stock index futures market early in the trading session. The London market appeared to be moving into a period of relative calm. This week promises no scheduled important economic or company announcements, and traders believe that any further shocks from the Canary Wharf property collapse are largely discounted in the stock market. However, the dangers of further setbacks in property groups continued to hover over the sector and, also, to hold back those UK clearing banks known to be heavily exposed in London. Dealers reported some signs that fund managers were continuing to back away from the retailing and consumer stocks, which stood out in the market's post-election advance, and moving towards stocks considered to be 'safe earners', such as the utilities. US investors again sought out pharmaceutical stocks, reversing their policies of the earlier months of this year. But equity business was not heavy enough yesterday to provide a genuine test of institutional attitudes. At Nikko Europe, Mr Peter Thorne expressed a widely-held view in saying that he expects the London market to consolidate around its current level 'for the next few weeks'. He sees the short-term outlook as unsettled by worries over the pace of economic recovery, leaving the London market good value on a one-year view. However, in its latest broad-based review, James Capel Economics has trimmed back its growth forecast for the UK economy in 1992 from 1.9 per cent to 1.3 per cent. It comments that the fall in output in the first quarter of the year was larger than expected and that the early data for the second quarter has also been disappointing. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken also predicts further 'sideways movement' in equities, unless the Wall Street market shows a more positive sentiment. It believes that a shortage of stock in the market is beginning to be corrected.</p>

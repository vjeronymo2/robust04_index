			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Derek Hanekom, coordinator of the ANC's Land </F> and Regional Affairs Department, by correspondent Ferial  Hafferjee, on the "PM News Wrap" program -- recorded]    [Text] The African National Congress plans to introduce  land reform legislation within the first 100 days of the sitting  of the new parliament. Ferial Hafferjee reports:    [Begin recording] [Hafferjee] One of the biggest nettles an  ANC-led government will have to grasp, is land reform. Today  the ANC held a first post-election policy conference where it  recounted its land plans. Among these are ways to deal with  land restitution for those who lost their land through apartheid  policies, and with land redistribution necessary to correct the  imbalance, which still has over 80 percent of the land in the  hands of 13 percent of the population. Land restitution alone  is likely to see a million claims come before a land claims  court. Land redistribution is likely to be an even bigger  undertaking. What will it all cost? Well, the ANC didn't have  the figures with them today but they did say that there would be  two budgets, one for land restitution, which will last for three  years, and a separate budget for land reform and redistribution.  Derek Hanekom is the ANC's coordinator of land and agricultural  policy. Mr. Hanekom, the policies you've outlined today are not  new, but does the ANC say them with a new confidence, with your  hands on the reins of government and on the purse strings of  government?    [Hanekom] Well, of course we have a lot more confidence, not  that we ever really doubted that we would win these elections,  but it's a good feeling to know that the majority of people in  South Africa have come out in overwhelming support for us on the  basis of our policies, not on the basis of rhetoric, or symbols,  or anything like that. We want to address them in such a way  that they do not have a negative effect on the country's  economy, that people...[pauses] that they don't lead to social  instability or threaten people's property interests, etcetera.  It is very important for us to show to our electorate that we  are serious about our promises.    [Hafferjee] Could you just tell me in a nutshell how you are  going to deal with the two R's -- restitution and redistribution?    [Hanekom] The two major aspects of a land reform program in  South Africa, will, as you said, lie in a restitution program,  that means returning the land to those people who were forcibly  removed from their land, and other measures of redistribution.  On the restitution side we have announced today that we intend  setting up a land claims court and we also said today that it is  a concept which enjoys very wide support, that dealing with this  very sensitive issue through a court, is the only fair way of  dealing with it. We believe that there should be accompanying  land redistribution processes, which means that those people who  are excluded from the court process must also be able to gain  access to land. We are saying one of the measures which we  could introduce is to ensure that they are able to get...gain  access to finance for land purchase.    People who are prepared to buy land, but do not have the  means to do so, who cannot reasonably be expected to pay full  market value of their land because it will take them some time  before they can establish themselves properly on that land -- we  believe that they should be the beneficiaries of a state  assisted program. None of this, none of our land reform program  is based on expropriation or based on confiscation. [end  recording]</p>

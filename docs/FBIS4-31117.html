			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The presidium of the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] proposes [Chairman] Gyula Horn for prime minister. The  closed session of the party presidium, which ended not long ago,  will be followed by a meeting of the national executive and  tomorrow's congress, at which the final decision will be made on  the nomination of the prime minister. Kata Peli Nagy interviewed  Imre Szekeres, the party's executive deputy chairman.    [Begin recording] [Szekeres] The local [party] organizations  considered the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] a necessary  coalition partner and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]  a possible one. This stance has been confirmed by the presidium,  and today I will submit it to the national executive. [passage  omitted] The presidium has also confirmed that we propose Gyula  Horn as the MSZP's nomination for prime minister.    [Nagy] So there will be one candidate?    [Szekeres] Yes. Of course, I informed the presidium that the  name of Laszlo Bekesi [author of the MSZP's economic program]  had also been raised, as a minority opinion. By the way, we  invited Laszlo Bekesi to the presidium session. He also outlined  his views on political and personnel issues.    The presidium has confirmed that the MSZP program in  economic  as well as in other areas is the program we presented to the  people during the election campaign, and it is on this program  that we wish to hold talks with the possible coalition partners.

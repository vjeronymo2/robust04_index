			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel development plans as confidence is boosted FIRM NICKEL prices and the prospect of sustained global growth have persuaded Falconbridge Ltd to commit CDollars 35m (Pounds 17.6m) to underground development at its remote Raglan property in northern Quebec over the next 18 months. Falconbridge, owned 50-50 by Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden, is discussing developing a mine at Raglan with annual output of 20,000 tonnes of nickel. The cost would be around CDollars 375m, including infrastructure. The property has been long known as Falconbridge's 'perennial mine of tomorrow'. The deposit was found after World War II by the late Mr Murray Watts, one of Canada's most successful mine finders. He was looking for uranium as well as precious and base metals. Falconbridge bought control of the property in 1957 and spent many millions of dollars outlining the deposit. However, its location north of Schefferville and the northern rail terminus, ruled out development. Raglan is nearly 1,000 miles north east of Montreal and only 60 miles south east of Deception Bay, on Hudson Strait, the shipping point for the former Asbestos Hill mine. During the seventies asbestos fibre was mined openpit and shipped for refining at Nordenheim in Germany until the US Environmental Protection Agency finally knocked the bottom out of the international asbestos market. Last month, the ice-breaking freighter Arctic, used to move zinc ores from the central Arctic to European refineries, successfully navigated the forbidding ice in Deception Bay, tying up at the old asbestos dock. This means the old three-month shipping season for asbestos can be extended to eight months, helping Raglan's economics significantly. The mine could operate year-round and production for four months be stockpiled. Falconbridge will spend CDollars 20m at Raglan this year alone and has begun a full feasibility study. Most of the money will go for an underground ramp, lateral work and drilling. Raglan is a series of deposits along a 30-mile strike length. Estimated reserves are 18m tonnes averaging 3.13 per cent nickel and 0.88 per cent copper in one group of mineralised zones. But total reserves are believed much larger. In terms of grade Raglan is the best undeveloped sulphide deposit anywhere, believes Falconbridge. The mine would be a fly-in/fly-out operation. A rail connection with Schefferville was considered in the past, but the rugged terrain makes the cost prohibitive. The tree line ends just north of Schefferville and the permafrost then begins. Potentially, Raglan could increase Falconbridge's annual nickel output by 25 to 30 per cent by 1996. Last year Falconbridge produced 62,000 tonnes from its mines in Sudbury, Ontario, and in the Dominican Republic. Nickel prices are around USDollars 4 a lb and many forecast tightness in supply because of problems in the Soviet Union. Together the Soviet Union and Cuba have been supplying between 12 and 15 per cent of western demand. Falconbridge says production in Sudbury and the Dominican Republic will remain flat for the next few years and Raglan would help retain its world market share.</p>

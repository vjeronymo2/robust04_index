This year will be the year of reform,  in which the province will enjoy many good opportunities and  favorable conditions.

The five-member group headed by (Ma Li), chief editor of  HSIANG KANG SHANG PAO, and (Wu Xiyuan), executive deputy general  manager and deputy chief editor of the Hong Kong newspaper, came  to Jinan to attend the celebration sponsored by the office of  DAZHONG RIBAO to mark the first anniversary of establishing a  special column for the province in the Hong Kong newspaper.  Over the past year, the Hong Kong newspaper has carried the  special column on 54 pages of 25 issues in which the column has  vividly introduced the fruitful achievements scored by our  province in reform, opening up, and economic construction and  played the role of a bridge or acted as a link in attracting  outside business and investments. Reports in the special column  have drawn attention and praise from the broad masses of  overseas readers.    Accepting with pleasure the interviews with the reporters of  the Hong Kong newspaper respectively on the morning and  afternoon of 12 January were Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the  provincial party committee; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee and vice governor of the province;  and Dong Fengji, member of the provincial party standing  committee and director of the provincial propaganda department.

They  have also seized the opportunity, deepened the reform, and  correctly grasped or handled the contradictions cropping up in  the economic operation, bringing about the sustained,  accelerated, and healthy development of the province's economy.  Undertakings in various fields have achieved new progress.  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: In the course of establishing the  systems of socialist market economy, it has been inevitable to  encounter some problems and contradictions and we have discerned  that in order to deal with the deep-rooted problems cropping up  in the economic operation, it is imperative to rely on reform  and to reinforce the strength in reform.

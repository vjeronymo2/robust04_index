			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INS RAIDS 2 HOTELS, ARRESTS 32 WORKERS  </P> <P> Two days before the start of the busy Memorial Day weekend, U.S. immigration  agents arrested 32 undocumented workers Wednesday in raids at two large Mission  Bay hotels.  </P> <P> Officials said the apprehensions at the jointly owned Bahia and Catamaran  Resort hotels were routine, except that the presence of 80 agents was required  to seal off escape routes on the hotels' sprawling grounds. The operation began  with a 9 a.m. muster at an armory in National City, authorities said.  </P> <P> The simultaneous raids at the two hotels, which began at about 11 a.m., went  off largely without incident, according to federal authorities, although one  unidentified Bahia employee, a U. S. citizen, was arrested for assaulting an  officer.  </P> <P> James Turnage, district director for the Immigration and Naturalization  Service, said an effort was made to minimize interference with hotel  operations. The need for a large-scale raid, Turnage said, was precipitated by  the hotel's management's "flagrant disregard" for recently enacted laws  outlawing the hiring of undocumented labor. Agents entered the premises with a  federal court warrant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protocol Chief Involved  </P> <P> Anne L. Evans, proprietor of the two family-owned hotels, accused the INS of  "heavy-handed" and disruptive tactics that included the kicking in of two doors  at the Bahia. She said hotel officials had cooperated with the INS.  </P> <P> "The policy of the hotels is to verify to the best of our ability that persons  working for us are eligible to do so," said Evans, who is one of two chiefs of  protocol for the city of San Diego and who was at the Bahia when the arresting  officers arrived. "We have no wish to circumvent the law."  </P> <P> An INS official said at least one door at the Bahia had to be opened forcibly  when hotel officials refused to provide a pass key.  </P> <P> U. S. authorities are likely to propose a hefty fine on management of the two  hotels, although the amount to be assessed has yet to be determined, said  Turnage, the top INS official in San Diego.  </P> <P> The sweeping reforms of U. S. immigration laws enacted in 1986 created a range  of civil and criminal fines and potential jail terms for employers who  knowingly hire undocumented workers. San Diego, home to more than 1,000  employees of the INS and the U. S. Border Patrol, a uniformed arm of the INS,  has led the nation in the number of such fines.  </P> <P> On March 16, officials said, agents detained 14 undocumented workers at the  Bahia.  </P> <P> Subsequent inspections indicated numerous violations, said Rudy Murillo, an INS  spokesman in San Diego. Last month, Murillo said, the agency filed a subpoena  seeking the hotels' payroll records. The documents have yet to be turned over,  said Murillo, who noted that authorities plan to go to U. S. District Court to  enforce the subpoena.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low-Paying Jobs  </P> <P> Many hotels in California and elsewhere have traditionally relied on immigrant  labor to fill low-paying jobs.  </P> <P> Some other area hotels have been served with fine notices of assorted alleged  violations of the federal statutes outlawing the hiring of undocumented  workers. In one of the largest cases, said Murillo, the INS spokesman, the  Executive Hotel in downtown San Diego was assessed a penalty of $9,200 last  September; it eventually settled by paying $5,650, Murillo said.  </P> <P> Turnage said the proposed fine against the ownership of the Bahia and Catamaran  will probably top the highest area total yet, a $27,000 penalty imposed on Big  Bear Markets. The supermarket chain contested the penalty, and an  administrative law judge later reduced it to $13,500, said Gene Smithburg, a  spokesman for the Border Patrol, which conducted the investigation.  </P> <P> The two hotels employ about 600 workers, Evans said. The Bahia has 423 rooms,  and the Catamaran Resort Hotel has 314 rooms, hotel officials said.  </P></p>

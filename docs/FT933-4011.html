			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Halved interest costs help Manders A HALVING of the interest charge helped Manders, the Wolverhampton paint, inks and property group, lift pre-tax profits 21 per cent to Pounds 4.92m in the six months to June 30. Interest payable tumbled to Pounds 965,000 (Pounds 1.94m) in the wake of lower rates and a fall in borrowings to Pounds 20.5m at the end of the half, against Pounds 29.6m previously. Mr Roger Akers, chief executive, suggested that borrowings would have been lower, but for the 13.8 per cent rise to Pounds 52.4m in the turnover of continuing operations and the need for stock at Wickes, the 70-strong DIY multiple, where Manders started delivering own-brand paint in March. The group also announced that it was marketing the Mander Centre in response to 'unsolicited approaches'. It was valued in December 1991 at Pounds 57.5m. Mr Akers said that, even if it was not sold soon, Manders would continue to look for acquisitions in Europe in paints and, especially, inks. Group turnover fell to Pounds 55.2m, against Pounds 56.1m, though the latter figure included Pounds 7.55m from discontinued activities. Operating profits were Pounds 5.88m (Pounds 5.77m) with the coatings and inks division rising to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.43m) on turnover of Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 19.8m) and the decorative side making Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 1.72m) on sales of Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 26.3m). The interim dividend is lifted to 2.9p (2.6p), payable from earnings per share of 9.02p (7.74p).</p>

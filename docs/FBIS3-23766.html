			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitry Korchinsky, leader of the Ukrainian </F> National Self-Defence (UNSD) by MN correspondent Vladimir  Gubarev: "Ukrainian Revolutionaries are Fond of Mao and  Mussolini"]    [Text] What is UNSD?    UNSD is to me Ukraine's only organization for the protection  of human rights which is utterly devoted to this cause.    This is the only revolutionary force which engages in real  politics. The results of our activity include participation in  two wars, organization of scores of strikes and the  establishment of the Ukrainian Patriarchate and a military trade  union.    Who supports you?    We rely on officers' circles and free trade unions.    What can you say about the relations between UNSD and  Ukraine's official leadership?    The Ministry of Justice refuses to register us, and about 15  of our men are currently being detained. But they can't do  anything with us, times have changed and our strength has grown.  The Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior can certainly muster more  fighters than I, but when the minister gives an order he cannot  be sure that it will be fulfilled, while I can count on the  support of several thousand people who will die and kill without  any pay.    In what wars did UNSD participate?    We took part officially on the Trans-Dniestrian side in  Trans-Dniestria and on the Georgian side in Abkhazia and  Mingrelia. We also received some practical experience in  Azerbaijan and in the Balkans.    Why were your men on the Azerbaijanian and not the  Armenian side?    We believe that Azerbaijan can become a friendly power to  Ukraine, while Armenia is more in Moscow's sphere of influence.    Have you come to Moscow for a specific purpose?    My purpose is to search for allies, but I did not expect  such  a lack of the right people. As a matter of fact I was surprised  during the October events how few defenders your Supreme Soviet  had. Were it not for its foolish stand on the Crimean question,  we alone could have sent more fighters than there were actually  gathered at the White House.    MN Note: Shortly before the October events  the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation transferred one of  the Crimea's biggest cities, Sevastopol, to Russian  jurisdiction.    You said once that the Crimea would be either Ukrainian  or depopulated. What did you mean?    The Crimea is very vulnerable geographically. Even if there  were no UNSD, the rupture of ties with Ukraine would lead to a  catastrophe, for transport would not be able to operate and the  supply of drinking water and electricity would stop. There would  be no need to kill anyone, for everybody would flee on their own.    It is often said today that Ukraine's statehood will  collapse. Do you agree?    We obtained independence much too quickly and had no time to  form a revolutionary elite. But the absolute majority of the  population is interested in independence.    An isolationist policy is impossible and undesirable, we are  against a complete break with Russia, but Kiev must become a new  strong geopolitical centre. The slogan of Slav unity remains  basic to us, and we do not want Russia to become a battlefield  between Jewish and Japanese capital.    Is a collapse in store for Ukraine? This is hardly probable.  What may happen will be rather like the Polish variant.    Is that why you study the experience of Solidarity?    The most valuable experience for us is that of Lenin and his  comrades in 1917.    Telegraph, telephone, the post and banks?    This is only the beginning of the building of the state.  This  is what happened in Germany in 1933 and in France when General  de Gaulle came to power.    Who of the 20th-century politicians arouses your  warmest feelings?    For UNSD fighters they are first of all Mao Zedong and  Benito  Mussolini.    MN File: UNSD emerged during the putsch of  August 1991 as a force intended to resist the so-called State  Emergency Committee which organized the putsch. At present this  unregistered militarized organization has from 3 to 5,000  members. About 500 of them took part in local wars. UNSD is  amalgamated in the Ukrainian National Assembly. It has nominated  120 candidates, mostly in Western Ukraine, for the forthcoming  elections to the Ukraine's parliament.</p>

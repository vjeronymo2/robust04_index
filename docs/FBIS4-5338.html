Tanzanian Vice-Minister of Home Affairs Edward Mwesaumo said  in a statement March 26:    "The United States is making haste with the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea and threatening `sanctions'  against the DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a  premeditated act intended to delay a solution to the nuclear  issue of the Korean peninsula and stifle the DPRK."    Mozambican Minister of Interior Manuel Jose Antonio said in  a  statement April 1 that nothing could be solved by war or  pressure and all the issues should be settled only through  peaceful negotiation.    "The United States must renounce its policy of strength," he  added.    Chairman of the Zaire-Korea Friendship Association Pierre  Welo Ahondju Ewale said in a statement April 1 that the United  States, if it is truly willing to solve the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula, must stop at once, though belatedly,  introducing Patriot missiles into South Korea and posing a  nuclear threat to the DPRK and approach the DPRK-U.S. talks with  sincerity.    "If the United States venture invasion of Korea, we will  join  the heroic Korean people in the fight of justice against U.S.  imperialism," he declared.</p>

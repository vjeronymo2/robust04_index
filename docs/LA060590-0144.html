			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHANG MEETS AGASSI A THIRD TIME IN FRENCH OPEN QUARTERFINAL  </P> <P> When Michael Chang moves on to Center Court of Roland Garros Stadium this  morning to meet third-seeded Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals of the French  Open, the 18-year-old from Placentia will find himself in the familiar role of  a decided underdog to his older opponent.  </P> <P> Chang, the 11th seed and defending French Open champion, has met 20-year-old  Agassi twice since the former turned pro in April, 1988, and has yet to win a  set against him.  </P> <P> Their first meeting came in May, 1988, in the Tournament of Champions. As an  18-year-old, fifth-seeded Agassi won the first set, 6-2, on the clay at the  West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, N.Y., before rain interrupted play.  Because of a downpour the next day, the match was moved indoors to the  hard-surfaced Port Washington Tennis Academy, where Agassi finished off Chang,  6-4.  </P> <P> Four months later, an unseeded Chang met Agassi, by then ranked fourth in the  world, in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open at the National Tennis Center in  Flushing Meadow, N.Y. The flashy Agassi made quick work of his outmatched  opponent, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> The French Open quarterfinal match between Chang and Agassi today will be  televised live on ESPN, with tournament coverage beginning at 6 a.m.  </P></p>

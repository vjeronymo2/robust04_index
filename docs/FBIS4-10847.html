			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Apr (NA) -- Guillermo Ignacio,  president of the Argentine Association of Newspaper Owners  (ADEPA), today maintained that independent journalism "is not  necessarily antagonistic to the government that is in office,  but it has not been conceived to place itself at its disposal,"  and he also flatly rejected the creation of a court of ethics.    Ignacio also expressed his concern about the draft law that  is currently in the hands of Congress and has been approved by  the Senate's Penal Committee. This draft law provides for "a  six-year sentence for the crime of slander and damages, and from  six months to two years for the illegal enriching of an  official."    "The trouble is that President (Carlos) Menem occasionally  makes these verbal outbursts on certain occasions and they worry  the media. They are trying to penalize the crime of slander and  damages in the same way that the Penal Code penalizes a homicide  committed during a fight," he said.    Ignacio added that a court of ethics "only serves for the  authoritarian censorship of the task of a professional who may  not be on good terms with the management of a professional  association or with the members of that court."    The ADEPA chief stated that the media submits "to the court  that is made up of the people, and of course it is always open  to action by the courts," and that "if this draft law is  approved the country's press freedom will be doomed."    He said: "We have never demanded impunity for journalism, on  the contrary, we have always said that there are no special  types of press crimes, there are just common crimes that can be  committed through the media."    In remark to a Buenos Aires radio station, Ignacio termed  events in Santiago del Estero as "inadmissible because Labor  Ministry Resolution No. 08/94 obliges the prior recognition of  the Union of Sellers of Newspapers and Magazines in order to  allow the distribution of the newspaper EL LIBERAL."    ADEPA expresses its rejection of the presidential initiative  to create a court of ethics to control the media in a 10-page  document in which the Press and Information Commission expounds  all the reasons for concern regarding the possible gagging of  freedom of expression.</p>

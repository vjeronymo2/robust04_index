			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver shortage 'will lift prices' SILVER DEMAND is expected to outpace supply by about 100m troy ounces this year, according to Mr Dennis Wheeler, chairman of Coeur d'Alene Mines, a big US silver and gold producer. He suggested that in the long term this would push prices up from their present very depressed levels, 'possibly starting this year, but certainly in 1994'. Mr Wheeler said the world's primary silver producers needed a price of Dollars 5 a troy ounce, with an expectation that it would rise to Dollars 6 or Dollars 7, to be viable. Last night silver closed in London at just over Dollars 3.91 an ounce. Two mines in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho in which his company has an interest - the Coeur and the Galena silver mines - are at present temporarily shut down and on a care and maintenance basis. Mr Wheeler said their break-even production costs were about Dollars 4.50 an ounce but he would not estimate what silver price would be needed to bring them back into operation as they are leased to Asarco, another US group, which would make that decision. Demand for silver has outstripped supply since 1990, according to the Silver Institute, a Washington-based producers' association of which Mr Wheeler is president. But huge stocks of the metal held by investors continue to weigh heavily on the price. The institute estimated that there was a supply shortfall of 37m ounces in 1990 and one of 46.2m ounces the following year. At this time last year the institute was looking for the 1992 supply deficit to rise to about 53m ounces, representing a shortfall of 10.6 per cent on demand forecast to be 548.6m ounces. The organisation will be giving the results of its latest supply-demand survey next month. Mr Wheeler, in London yesterday during a tour to give presentations to European investors, said that, while primary silver mines had been shutting down, demand for the metal by big users such as the photographic industry and jewellery producers was increasing by about 2 per cent a year.</p>

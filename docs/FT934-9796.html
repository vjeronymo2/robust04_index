			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / ABF hit by lower baking profits IN SPITE OF ever fiercer competition in the UK bread market, Associated British Foods, the leading UK baker, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 267m to Pounds 338m in the year to September 18. However, operating profits were only Pounds 4m higher at Pounds 273m although sales rose 10.9 per cent to Pounds 4.39bn. Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said the fall in operating margins from 6.8 to 6.2 per cent was entirely because of lower baking profits. An attempt to increase prices halfway through the year had failed, he said. 'A lot of bread is being sold below cost. The only hope is that the public will get tired of eating cheap and nasty bread.' He said that Ranks Hovis McDougall, the number two in the market, had been aggressive on market share since its takeover by Tomkins, the conglomerate, late last year. However, ABF is believed to have won back some market share. Mr Weston said: 'Someone's gain is someone else's loss. There has to be a degree of retaliation. They have a right to my market share like I have a right to theirs.' There was no sign of any of the big independent bakers - many of which focus on a limited range of bread and retailers - going out of business. On the milling side, which is largely inseparable from baking, ABF had also suffered lower by-product prices because of lower EC intervention prices. A poor wheat harvest this autumn had led to a 5 per cent rise in flour prices, he said. Analysts said it was vital that this rise be passed on in higher bread prices. As well as milling and baking, ABF makes a range of grocery products. Responding to the latest escalation of a supermarket price war, he said food retailers were putting ever more pressure on manufacturers. 'It has always been there, it always seems exceptional and it always gets worse. There is very little left for retailers to try and grab from food manufacturers.' Rising bond markets meant returns on the group's net cash of more than Pounds 500m at the year end, net of interest, rose from Pounds 26m to Pounds 43m. Profits also included a Pounds 12m rise in the value of the group's stake in Berisford International, compared with a Pounds 22m fall in 1992. The shares rose 4p to 479p.

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Government seeks room to move in a tight corner: Holding public-sector pay down is central to keeping spending within planned totals HIGH on the agenda of the cabinet's two public-expenditure committee meetings this week will be how to go about creating a strategy for slashing public-sector pay awards. However, the scope for influencing pay this year is restricted, as settlements for two thirds of public-sector workers have already been made. The government has room to manoeuvre on settlements for only a few workers, including teachers and nurses. Their pay increases, due for implementation next April, are recommended by independent review bodies that are taking evidence at present and will make their recommendations in the next few months. The deliberations are therefore concentrated on next year. Pushing down settlements is central to the government's fight to keep public spending within the Pounds 244.5bn planned total for 1993-94. Public-sector pay, covering about 6m workers, including civil servants, amounts to about Pounds 70bn a year. No decisions have been taken yet by the special cabinet committee shaping spending priorities, but a wide range of options is being considered - from pay freezes for those employees within ministers' direct control such as Whitehall civil servants, to suspension of the independent pay review bodies that cover about 2.4m people including doctors, nurses and teachers. Although the government has fought shy of setting a formal pay 'norm' for the public sector, it is widely assumed that it would like to keep increases in public-sector pay to about 2 per cent a year, its long-term inflation target. 'A very firm downward pressure is needed,' says Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body. 'But government must not panic. It needs a strategy it can deliver over the medium to longer term. What it must not do, as it has done for the past 10 years, is discriminate in favour of groups like nurses at the expense of local-government workers.' The fact that pay in the public sector has outstripped private-sector pay for the first time since 1986 - reflecting the fact that pay in the public sector tends to do better during a recession - presents the cabinet with an opportunity to argue for low public-sector settlements. The government's earnings survey, published last month, showed that earnings in the public sector averaged Pounds 307.80 a week in April, compared with Pounds 303.30 in the private sector, increases of 8.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively on the previous April. Settlements since April have maintained that trend, albeit at low rates of increase. Many stretch well into next year, including those of the 1.5m local authority workers. Their pay cannot be influenced until July next year for white-collar workers and September next year for manual workers. First in the pack for settlements next April is the pay of workers covered by the review bodies. Such bodies have traditionally made high settlements, which are seen by other unions as benchmarks. Unions have in the last month made claims to their review bodies of between 9 per cent and 16 per cent for teachers and 8.7 per cent for nurses. Mr John Patten, education secretary, gave the teachers' review body a heavy hint last month to keep down the cost of April's salary awards. Mr Patten, who wants to link all or a large proportion of the pay bill to performance rather than through national awards, told the review body: 'It is unacceptable if, over time, the review bodies recommend settlements in excess of those being obtained . . . in the private and public sectors.' This year's pay settlement for teachers was 7.8 per cent. If the review bodies ignore ministers' cajoling and set high awards, the government has the option of either rejecting them or phasing them in - as it has done four times over the past nine years for nurses. Phasing in awards does not solve financial problems, however. Mr Trinder says: 'Staging is not a solution - it merely defers a problem.' Another option would be to suspend the pay review bodies and impose settlements directly. However, such action would provoke fury among those affected, particularly nurses, many of whom are employed by the new National Health Service trusts which are starting to make redundancies to balance their books. Ministers are not afraid of conflict, including taking on bodies such as Nalgo, the public-sector union. That has dismayed local authorities who are responsible for the pay of 1.5m workers. Through rate-support grants paid to local authorities, the government can and is likely to influence directly what councils pay their staff next year. Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, says his association is exploring the possibility of a partial freeze next year - a small increase for low-paid staff and a pay freeze for those earning more. But he says: 'Ministers talking about it being 'quite nice' to have a strike with Nalgo undermines these efforts.' He adds: 'The government cannot legislate for what we pay our employees. But it may leave us little room for manoeuvre. If the total pay bill can only be roughly the same as last year, we will have to make redundancies and/or cut services.'</p>

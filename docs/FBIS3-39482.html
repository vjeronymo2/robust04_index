			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stefano Folli commentary: "Pact's Aim Now To Withstand </F> Impact of Elections"]    [Text] It is not surprising that [Pact for Italy leader]  Mario Segni devoted the sharpest parts of his speech yesterday  to [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and the errors  committed by the media magnate and would-be politician. Over  the past few days the winds of change have blown strong, and  while Segni is launching his appeal to voters on the theme "we  are the new," he must keep in mind that the scenario is changing.    The problem now is no longer just the PDS [Democratic Party  of the Left], the greater or lesser distance that separates [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto from [Communist Renewal Secretary]  Bertinotti, the danger that the center will allow itself to be  seduced by the progressive forces' arguments, their desire or  ability to put themselves forward as an alternative.    Now Berlusconi's dizzying rise and the alliance rudely  imposed on [League Secretary] Bossi (and tomorrow perhaps also  on [National Alliance coordinator] Fini) confronts Segni's  movement with a new and urgent problem.    Much more than [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary]  Martinazzoli's Popular Party, the Pact constitutes a border  area. Segni's desire to "rally" votes to the center-right so as  to justify a possible government agreement and his own personal  leadership after the elections, has prompted him to explore  League territory, thoroughly and boldly. But the famous  document signed with [League lower house floor leader] Roberto  Maroni, subsequently repudiated by Umberto Bossi, and, last  again confirmed last night by Maroni as "still valid" seems to  be no more than a worthless piece of paper.    The Berlusconi-Bossi political accord creates in the North  that which Occhetto would call, with roles reversed, "a joyful  war machine." Now everything is more difficult for Segni --  including the local "technical" alliances with the League and  perhaps the Berlusconi grouping that he still believed in until  a few days ago. They are still possible, of course, but on  different conditions and with a clearer supremacy for Berlusconi  over the Pact.    This is why Segni yesterday chiefly wanted to stress the  "liberal democratic" character of the center -- first and  foremost, with regard to principles, but also with regard to  policy. Behind Berlusconi's offensive -- which is effectively  taking over some of the themes propounded by Segni (free  enterprise, the rejection of state control) -- there is the  prime necessity to withstand the huge impact of the elections.  The impact is damaging the Pact in the North, where several  sectors are at present submitting to the temptation of reaching  an agreement with the strongest. As Guido Bodrato so accurately  put it, the center risks meeting the same fate as Poland,  crushed and split between Hitler and Stalin.    This also explains why the most moderate members of the  Popular Party, such as Formigoni and Buttiglione, were worried  yesterday. On the one hand, there is the strategy of the  center's approach, from still solid positions, toward the League  and the Berlusconi group. On the other hand, there is the  agreement between Berlusconi and Bossi and all that this entails.    It is not without significance that [Radical leader] Marco  Pannella too has tried to drive a wedge into Berlusconi's war  machine. By saying "no" to an alliance with Fini under any  circumstances, Pannella's aim is to ruin the plan to encircle  the Martinazzoli-Segni center. "Neither Fini nor Occhetto," the  Radical leader is saying, in an attempt to recreate a political  space that at the moment is in danger of running out of air.  The paradox -- as Pannella well knows, and as Segni and  Martinazzoli do, too -- is that the center would still remain  strong at the tactical level. If, as many still believe, no  definite winner emerges from the elections, the  Catholic-nonconfessional group ("Only idiots believe that this  is a new edition of the five-party alliance," Buttiglione  protested yesterday) would have a crucial role to perform.    But unfortunately, the elections are before that. And  Martinazzoli's and Segni's Poland, with their numerous  nonconfessional allies, must withstand the convergent offensive  being mounted by Berlusconi and Occhetto. This is the scenario  of right-left polarization imposed by the situation -- the worst  possible one for those performing an intermediate role, or who  aspire to do so.</p>

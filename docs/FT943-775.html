			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / High cost of backing rouble The Russian Central Bank spent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the past two months on intervention to support the rouble, reducing its foreign exchange reserves to below Dollars 5bn, a senior bank official said yesterday. 'It's good for the central bank to raise its currency reserves but it means pumping roubles into the market, fuelling inflation,' deputy central bank chairman Alexander Khandruyev told a news conference. 'By cutting our reserves by Dollars 2.5bn we have introduced a stabilising element into the economy.' The rouble fell to a record low of 2,476 to the dollar on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange earlier, with the central bank refraining from intervention. Last week it dropped 5 per cent to the previous record low of 2,460 as the central bank stayed on the sidelines.</p>

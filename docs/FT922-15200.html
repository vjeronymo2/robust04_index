			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Portuguese border truck protest At least 1,000 lorry drivers from across Europe blocked the main border post with Spain for road freight at Vilar Formoso yesterday to protest against the slow pace of Portuguese bureaucracy, Reuter reports from Lisbon. The drivers said their patience had been stretched to the limit by red tape affecting lorries entering Portugal and a series of strikes by customs agents facing redundancy when the EC abolishes internal customs controls in 1993.</p>

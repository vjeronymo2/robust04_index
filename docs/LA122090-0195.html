Last weekend, many United Artists theaters in the Los Angeles area --  and nationwide -- began giving patrons free PB Max candy bars, a new Mars Inc.  brand. And next week, some UA theaters in the Dallas area will dole out free  packs of Smart Foods popcorn to all theatergoers. Other theater chains also  have plans to step up product sampling programs.  </P> <P> Why the sudden freebies? Well, earlier this year film studios Walt Disney Co.  and Warner Bros. banned theater chains from showing on-screen advertisements  before their films. As a result, some chains are scrambling for new ways to  boost ad revenue. It could mean a boon for freebies at the movies.  </P> <P> "The reduction of on-screen advertising is going to hurt us," said Cathy  Kasberg, director of promotions and marketing at UA, the nation's largest  theater chain, with 2,500 screens in 515 locations. "Hopefully, this can give  us another avenue for income."  </P> <P> By one estimate a nationwide sampling of a single product at a major chain can  generate up to $100,000 in extra advertising revenues in one month. That's well  over $1 million per year. Instead of paying for time on screen, advertisers pay  theaters to hand out their products.  </P> <P> UA hopes to lure business away from others by becoming the movie chain people  associate with free gifts. "Nine out of 10 people don't even know which theater  company owns the theater they go to," said Kasberg. "This is one way to stand  out."  </P> <P> Marketing experts say freebies rank among the very best kind of advertising.  "People love free samples," said Susan Small-Weil, a specialist in consumer  behavior at the New York ad agency Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore. "In this case,  advertising isn't an uninvited guest. It's a welcome guest."  </P> <P> Eventually, the UA chain wants to entice customers by handing out different  samples every weekend. But they certainly won't be limited to candy bars and  popcorn. Kasberg said the theater chain is considering everything from bars of  soap to ballpoint pens to frozen yogurt.  </P> <P> But competitors say they won't be outdone. Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based  chain which ranks No. 2 in the United States, with 1,690 screens in 415  locations, says it has tested product sampling since 1986, handing moviegoers  everything from packages of sugar-free Dentynechewing gum to samples of Hero  men's cologne.  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon, however, hands out its samples when customers exit the theater.  "If someone doesn't like a product," explained Howard Lichtman, executive vice  president of marketing, "we don't want them leaving it on the floor."  </P></p>

The meeting was attended by provincial and city party,  government, and military leaders Li Zemin, Liu Feng, Chai  Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Wang Qichao, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Li  Jinming, Xu Xingguan, Xu Zhichun, Jue Duanlin, Wei Boliang, Wang  Jingxi, Yang Shijie, Yan Eryi, Xu Tingsheng, and Li Jinliang, as  well as 2,000 officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and  armed police units stationed in Zhejiang.    Li Jinming, Standing Committee member of the provincial  party  committee and secretary of the Hangzhou party committee,  officiated at the meeting.    Liu Xirong, Standing Committee member of the provincial  party  committee and vice governor, was the first to speak. On behalf  of the provincial party committee, the provincial government,  the provincial people's congress, the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference provincial committee, and the people of  Zhejiang, he extended Spring Festival greetings to officers and  men of all ground, naval, air, and armed police units stationed  in Zhejiang; families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers;  disabled soldiers; demobilized servicemen; and retired military  cadres. He also extended warm congratulations to the seven  cities and counties named as model counties (cities) in  supporting the military and government and in giving  preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and  soldiers.    Liu said: Led by the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin at the core, over the past year we have adhered to  the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points,"  earnestly studied and practiced Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, persisted in  reform and opening up, and accelerated the pace of establishing  a socialist market economy, thereby achieving significant  progress in socialist construction and bringing about a new  climate in building a socialist spiritual civilization. These  achievements are the results of concerted efforts and hard work  by soldiers and civilians in Zhejiang. He added: Over the past  year, officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and armed  police units, sharing weal and woe with the people, have further  rendered meritorious services for economic development and  military building. Over the past year, families of  revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and  demobilized servicemen, preserving and carrying forward glorious  revolutionary traditions, have played an important role at  various posts and on all fronts, and have performed new exploits  in reform and construction; at the same time, the large number  of retired military cadres have made new contributions to  promoting social stability and economic growth, thereby winning  the respect and praise of the people throughout Zhejiang.    Liu went on to say: The year 1994 will be very crucial for  China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. We must  unswervingly follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. In line with the  requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, we  must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider,  promote development, and maintain stability so as to achieve  faster growth in the provincial economy and raise the standard  of living by a larger margin. In the coming year, we must  inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions; further  deepen the campaigns to support the government and cherish the  people, and to support the army and give preferential treatment  to military dependents; concern ourselves with military  building; and further strengthen unity between the military and  the government as well as between soldiers and civilians,  thereby pushing the double-support work to new heights.    On behalf of all officers and men of the ground, naval,  air, and armed police units, Xu Yongqing, political commissar of  the provincial military district, extended warm congratulations  to the counties and cities named as models in supporting the  military and the government and in giving preferential treatment  to military dependents; he also extended sincere gratitude to  party committees and governments at all levels, as well as the  people of Zhejiang, for their concern and support for the  construction of military units and reserve forces over a long  period of time. Xu said: In accordance with the requirements  set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission, all units stationed in Zhejiang, under the  leadership of higher authorities and the support of the  provincial party committee and provincial government, have  successfully completed the tasks and duties of war preparedness  and training, focusing on education and training, and aimed at  raising their combat capability. In the coming year, we shall  inherit and develop the glorious traditions of the party and the  military, preserve the nature of the people's military, and  promote social stability and military building. In the face of  arduous tasks, all military units shall unfailingly adhere to  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of military building in the new  period, and in accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's demand --  that "all military units must be politically qualified and  militarily capable, must have a good work style, must maintain  strict discipline, and must be assured of adequate logistic  support" -- shall strengthen military building in an all-round  manner and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by higher  authorities. Meanwhile, we shall stand fast with the 42 million  people of Zhejiang in holding high the banner of reform and  opening up, and in working with one heart and one mind to make  even greater contributions to building two civilizations in  Zhejiang.    Liu Feng, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee  and head of the provincial leading group on double-support, read  a "Decision on Naming the Third Group of Model Cities (Counties)  in Double-Support" adopted by the provincial party committee,  the provincial government, and the provincial military district.    Wang Zhuohui, deputy secretary of the Ningbo party committee  and head of the city's leading group on double-support, spoke on  behalf of the model counties and cities.</p>

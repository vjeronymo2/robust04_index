			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Portugal set to launch DM2bn global FRN issue today Rumours of a big floating-rate note offering from a European sovereign borrower which have been in the eurobond market for more than a week proved true yesterday when details emerged of a DM2bn offering of five-year FRNs from Portugal. The issue, which is being arranged by Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS, is likely to be priced to yield between 9 and 10 basis points over three-month Libor. It is expected to be launched today. Syndicate managers said the indicated pricing was fair but they raised some concern about the size of the offering, in the light of the continued price volatility in European government bond markets. However, one manager pointed out that Depfa, the German mortgage bank, raised DM1bn yesterday without too much difficulty through a domestic offering of nine-year FRNs at Libor flat. Some syndicate managers were surprised that Portugal had opted for a global structure since they did not think there would be huge demand from the US for FRNs denominated in the German currency. However, they said the structure would increase the appeal of the FRNs to central banks around the world. By contrast, a syndicate manager at one of the joint leads said that the pre-marketing of the deal had identified strong demand from New York-based international bond funds who needed floating-rate non-dollar assets. Portugal's offering will be the first sovereign FRN deal since the beginning of May, when the Hellenic Republic raised DM1bn through an issue of seven-year FRNs, with a call and a put option after five years. The discounted margin on Greece's notes at the launch was 112 basis points over six-month Libor but yesterday it stood at 122 basis points over Libor, according to traders. Among yesterday's deals, Halifax Building Society raised Dollars 150m through an offering of three-year eurobonds. Lead manager Paribas said the deal was targeted at retail investors in the Benelux region and in Switzerland who were attracted by the 6 3/4 per cent coupon. There were reports that some banks in the syndicate had trouble selling their allocation, mainly because the Halifax did not have as strong a following in continental Europe as other UK financial institutions, notably Abbey National. However, the yield spread widened only slightly when the bonds were freed to trade. The proceeds of the deal are believed to have been swapped into floating-rate sterling. GECC also tapped the pool of Benelux retail investors with its CDollars 100m offering of five-year eurobonds. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds would coincide with the redemption of around CDollars 600m worth of bonds in August.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Racists' protective blanket Here is a news item: 'German thugs stab Turk at petrol station, jeer his German girlfriend'. Here is another: 'Gang of nine Germans, one a girl, savagely beats 17-year-old Turkish boy, leave him for dead'. Here is a third: 'Turkish child, 15, stabbed to death by neo-Nazis at Hamburg bus stop'. The lesson is clear. You cannot trust the Germans. They always revert to type. Oh yes? The above headlines have all been doctored. The attacks they describe did take place, but not in Germany, and not on Turks. The perpetrators were British, the victims black and Asian British youngsters. The natural German response to such events in their own country is a resurgence of angst; the natural British reaction is to snuggle down under a blanket of complacency. After all, they - the Germans - are the known racists. Who won the war? We - the British - are the most humane and liberal of the earth's peoples. Phooey. The number of racial 'incidents' reported to the police - the British police - rose from 4,383 in 1988 to 7,793 last year. The actual number is far higher. Many blacks and Asians are too sceptical, or too afraid, to make an official complaint. Responses to the British Crime Survey suggest that there are now 140,000 racial attacks a year in England and Wales alone. It does not matter that some or many of these may have been 'minor'; the point is that their cumulative effect is to make certain neighbourhoods unsafe for a segment of the population. A few are unsafe in the extreme. There were 10 racial murders in Britain last year, putting us second in Europe after Germany. Some interpretations of the statistics put the home of liberal democracy first. Britain's complacency is partly explained by electoral behaviour. Continental Europeans are more likely to vote for openly xenophobic parties than are their offshore cousins. In one German state, Hesse, the Republican vote in March was 7.9 per cent. In France Mr Le Pen's candidates attracted 12 per cent in the first-round vote of the March election. The recent victory of the British National party in a council by-election in a deprived inner-city area is meaningless set against such figures. A more appropriate comparison is with the April 1992 general election. The average BNP vote in the dozen or so constituencies it contested was 1.2 per cent; as a share of national votes cast its score was 0.02 per cent. Psephologically speaking, this is Monster Raving Loony party territory. The explanation for the apparent sophistication of Britain's voters is well-known. The main parties have a tacit understanding with the electorate. They will eliminate non-white immigration, by supporting laws that reduce it to the barest minimum that humane treatment of family connections will allow. Race relations legislation is in place to protect the British-born ex-immigrant population. In return, voters abstain from supporting openly racist parties. What is not so clear is the connection between the presence of the BNP office in Welling, south London, and the rise in the number of serious racial assaults and murders in the surrounding area. What is even murkier is what is to be done if there is a provable connection. Angry - scared - blacks and Asians who marched towards Welling last weekend want the racist party closed down. That is not the British way. It is, rather, to allow the BNP to speak and campaign, and to prosecute anybody who assaults anyone. This is probably not good enough. Much depends on how hard the police try to protect non-white citizens. 'Racial attacks will not be tolerated,' said Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, in his celebrated leading-from-the-right speech to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool on October 6. I wish I could say that the Conservatives cheered, stamped their feet, clapped and whistled. They did not. 'We are all, rightly, dismayed at events such as the recent sickening attacks on young Asian and black men,' Mr Howard told the Jewish welfare organisation B'Nai Brith last week. He also deplored 'the election to a local council of a candidate whose very policies are an affront to the overwhelming majority of the British public'. Mr Howard must be given credit when it is his due. He gets plenty of stick when it is not. Strong signals from leading politicians should be part of an effort to isolate the skinheads. But if words alone could limit the threat of racial attacks, the home secretary's statements would be the end of the story. We must hope that Mr Howard is thinking of more than declarations of outrage. He is due to visit Tower Hamlets, the scene of many racist crimes, this morning. His purpose is 'fact finding', to establish whether the 'community relations' policies he praised in his B'Nai Brith speech need improvement. They do. Local committees are being established, under the guidance of an interdepartmental Racial Attacks Group, chaired by the Home Office. We need more of them, with strengthened powers and sufficient resources. More targeted policing would help. This should reduce attacks and, as experiments in key boroughs have shown, the number of thugs caught - the 'clear-up rate'  -increases dramatically when a small police team is dedicated to the job. Many Asians and Afro-Carribeans want new offences of racial violence and harassment to be created. The Commission for Racial Equality, the Jewish Board of Deputies, and the Anti-Racist Alliance support this. I would like to, but remain puzzled. Mr Howard says that existing law deals with violent assaults, while the Public Order Act prohibits conduct intended or likely to stir up racial hatred. To require proof of racial motivation in addition to proof of assault might make convictions more difficult. Put that way, yes - but the police could get assault convictions on ordinary grounds. Judges could take racial motivation into account in determining sentence. This might deter some skinheads. Against that, certainty of conviction is a greater deterrent than length of sentence. These are fine, arguable, details. What is beyond question is the need to place the protection of black and brown British subjects higher on the government's list of priorities. Telling ourselves we are not Germans will no longer suffice. I'd like to think that Mr Howard is aware of that.</p>

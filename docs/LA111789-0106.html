			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> LIBRARY TO EXPAND GENEALOGY SOURCES  </P> <P> A $15,113 federal grant is enabling the city to purchase for its library system  more genealogy books, library director Ron Hayden said Thursday.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the City Council formally received the money and passed it  on to the library system. The money is part of the federal government's program  to encourage urban libraries not to duplicate expensive, specialized  collections, Hayden said.  </P> <P> "The strategy is to help libraries enhance their collections without  duplicating some of the expensive references of other nearby libraries," Hayden  said. "For instance, here in Huntington Beach, we have a very extensive  genealogy section," he explained, adding that the library serves as a sort of  regional resource center for genealogy references. "It would be very expensive  for other libraries in our area to go out and purchase many of these books."  </P> <P> Hayden said that the federal money will also be used to buy science, social  science and other reference indexes.  </P></p>

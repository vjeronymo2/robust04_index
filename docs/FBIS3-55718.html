He informed Council members about a presidential decree to  equip the House with modern communications allowing to in  contact with a total of 44,000 telephone numbers nationwide.    The session is expected to discuss and adopt procedures and  house rules on its first day of work, Shumeyko told INTERFAX.    Since the constitution does not say who exactly is in charge  of the first session, the organizing committee will recommend  the eldest deputy do so to fall into line with the procedure  adopted by the State Duma, he said.    He named leader of the Peasants' Party Yuriy Chernichenko as  the eldest member of the Federation Council, which is also  expected to elect its Speaker.    The Council is to meet every third week of the month. The  session's seven-point agenda includes discussion of house rules  and organizational matters, elections of Speaker and his  deputies, formation of house committees and election of its  leaders.    Shumeyko spoke of two viewpoints on the arrangements for the  Federal Assembly. Some say the two houses must employ the same  staff for day-to-day management. Others prefer independent  staffs since the two house operate autonomously.    The Council will need about a week to cover the whole of the  first session's agenda, Shumeyko said.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAMES REPLACE FIRED CRISP WITH RISEBROUGH  </P> <P> A year after winning the city's first Stanley Cup title in 1989, the Calgary  Flames were stunned in the first round of the playoffs to the Kings. The defeat  ruined a season in which Calgary posted the second-best regular-season record  in the NHL.  </P> <P> It prompted the firing of Coach Terry Crisp.  </P> <P> Eleven days later, Friday, Doug Risebrough, already Calgary's assistant general  manager, was given the additional duty of coaching the team.  </P> <P> Crisp was criticized because he couldn't command his players' respect, but  defenseman Al MacInnis said Risebrough won't have that problem.  </P> <P> "There's no question he's going to demand a lot," MacInnis said. "I respected  him as a player, I respected him as a teammate. He was certainly one of the  guys I looked up to when I broke into the league. I think a lot of guys are  going to be looking forward to having him as a head coach."  </P> <P> "A coach has to be himself and he can't be anything else but that," Risebrough  said. "Certainly there's an evolution. I have not coached behind the bench. I  have to find myself in a lot of ways. There's growth there and I'm willing to  grow."  </P> <P> Risebrough, 36, was a hard-nosed player for 14 seasons, nine with Montreal  during which the Canadiens won four consecutive Stanley Cups. He was traded to  Calgary before the 1982-83 season and remained with the club for five seasons.  </P> <P> After retiring in 1987, he became an assistant under Crisp and last summer was  named assistant to Fletcher. He will retain that job while coaching the team  under a three-year contract approved on Friday.  </P> <P> "It's an important day for me," Risebrough said.  </P></p>

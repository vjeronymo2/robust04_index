			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 10 Apr (AFP) -- Subcommander Marcos,  the military chief of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN], says no conditions currently exist that permit the  resumption of peace talks with the government or allow the EZLN  to continue consultations within the Indian communities on the  government's proposals, according to today's edition of LA  JORNADA.    The newspaper quoted the rebel leader as saying: "There is  movement among Mexican Army troops to cut off EZLN forces in the  zone" in which the EZLN maintains control over various  communities.    The guerrillas and the government held their first round of  talks 21 February-1 March. At the conclusion of the talks, the  two sides issued a list of 32 commitments (rebel demands and  government proposals). The EZLN then opened discussions among  the Indian communities on the government's proposals, but this  activity was suspended following the 23 March assassination of  ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.    Marcos indicated that in order for the consultations to  resume, "it is necessary for the Army to reduce its presence and  for the ranchers, businessmen, and politicians to suppress their  belligerence, at least to the level that existed before the  dialogue."    Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis recently said peace  talks could resume within the next few weeks, but Marcos insists  that new conditions are required. The guerrillas have denounced  a series of alleged aggressions by the cattlemen, including the  killing of an EZLN member by a rancher in Altamirano  Municipality.</p>

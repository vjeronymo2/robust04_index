			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Anne Henderson Pollard, who is serving a prison term on charges related to her  husband's spying, pleaded with U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin in  Minneapolis to be transferred from a federal prison hospital in Rochester,  Minn., where she said she is being mistreated. Pollard, who is serving two  concurrent five-year prison terms, is the wife of Jonathan Jay Pollard, 34, who  was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison for supplying classified documents to  Israeli agents. Pollard, 28, and her lawyers argued that she should be  transferred to a less stressful facility, namely a federal prison camp in  Danbury, Conn. She has a gastro-intestinal disorder. Among other things,  Pollard said she feels isolated because she is the only female prisoner.  </P></p>

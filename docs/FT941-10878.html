			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World News in Brief: Death of central figure in German banking Hermann Josef Abs (left), who during his postwar heyday as head of the Deutsche Bank stood at the centre of corporate Germany, died at the weekend aged 92. He won renown as the quintessential German banker, using his network of directorships and influence to play a significant role in rebuilding the West German economy, but attracted controversy, not least because of his wartime role.

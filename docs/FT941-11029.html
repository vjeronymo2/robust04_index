			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / O'Reilly to hold Independent talks Senior executives of Independent Newspapers of Ireland plan to hold talks today with the management of The Independent newspaper in London. The talks follow last week's coup by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of the Irish Independent, when he bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, from institutions at Pounds 3.50 a share. As the largest shareholder the Irish group is seeking board representation and is likely to get it. Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between members of the consortium that last week offered Pounds 2.60 a share. The consortium includes Mirror Group Newspapers, the existing Independent shareholders El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and the founders of The Independent led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith.</p>

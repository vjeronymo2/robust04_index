			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Ellis &amp; Everard shares fall by 7% after chairman departs SHARES in chemicals distributor Ellis &amp; Everard fell 13p, or 7 per cent, to 172p yesterday following the departure of Mr Michael Marshall, executive chairman since 1990, due to 'management differences'. Mr Marshall, who built up a private chemicals company in the early 1980s, joined Ellis &amp; Everard in 1986. He is temporarily replaced by Mr Simon Everard, a former chairman. 'Mike was a successful entrepreneur. But building a private company and being a chairman of a PLC is different,' Mr Everard said. Advisers to the company said there had been a clash of styles. Mr Marshall, who left the company on Friday, said he was very surprised. 'It's all happened very suddenly in the last week,' he said. Ellis &amp; Everard announced the shake-up along with lower than expected profits for last year, dragged down by margin pressures and a poor performance from its swimming pool chemicals division. But Mr Everard said the company's problems were in no way similar to those of MTM, the specialist chemicals manufacturer which saw its shares collapse earlier this year following the chairman's resignation and a profits warning. '(Mr Marshall's) departure is in no way results-related,' Mr Everard said. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 12.6m in the year to April 30, from Pounds 17.5m. Operating profits for the pools division fell by more than Pounds 1m, affected by poor weather and recession. In the US, squeezed margins, combined with rising healthcare and insurance costs, led to a profits fall of 23.5 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. Turnover increased 7.1 per cent to Pounds 383.4m, helped by acquisitions in Ireland and Spain and the exchange rate. There were extraordinary items of Pounds 9.5m, although Pounds 8.2m related to goodwill previously written off against reserves. The remaining Pounds 1.3m of provisions covered losses incurred on the disposal of two subsidiaries and a third which is for sale. Earnings per share fell from 15.9p to 11.5p. An unchanged final dividend of 4.8p is recommended, to give a maintained total of 7.05p, which is 1.6 times covered. Mr Peter Wood, group managing director, said trading had improved since the year-end. Weak prices, Page 20; Observer, Page 17</p>

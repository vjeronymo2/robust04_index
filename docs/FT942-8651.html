			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yorks Electricity invests in Swedish power group Stockholm Energi said yesterday it planned to offer Yorkshire Electricity a 17.3 per cent stake in the municipally-owned power company. Yorkshire last month signed a letter of intent to invest in the utility, which was seeking a foreign partner in anticipation of deregulation of the Swedish market. Stockholm Energi said it needed the additional capital to meet new competition in its established market and to enable it to seek new markets for itself. It planned to float next year, if market conditions permitted, or by 1998 at the latest. Brokers in Stockholm estimate the stake will cost Yorkshire between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn (Pounds 150m to Pounds 172m).</p>

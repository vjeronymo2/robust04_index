			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By KHOVAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe April 7 TASS -- The Russian frontier check  point Nizhnyy Pyandzh, through which refugees were coming from  Afghanistan, was brought under missile fire at 09.20 [0520 GMT]  today from the Afghan territory.    According to Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin,  commander  of the frontier guard troops in Tajikistan, the fire came from a  suburb of the port of Sherkhan-Bender, where some 1,000 Tajiks  are concentrated. Missiles were fired from the control zone of  the 54th and 55th Infantry Divisions of Afghanistan under the  command of Kazi Kabir and Amir Chugai.    No casualties were reported. One of the missiles exploded 50  metres away from the check point.    Russian frontier guards did not open reply fire and did not  respond to the provocation. According to General Chechulin,  "The purpose of the action was to force us to open reply fire at  the refugee bases and disrupt talks between the Tajik  authorities and the opposition in Moscow."    Reinforcement -- more artillery pieces and tanks -- came to  the check point.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Folly of the Doomed" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  issued a "special alert order" and an "emergency alert order" to  the entire puppet Armed Forces and police throughout South Korea  for the period from May 31 to June 7, raising outcries over the  "military moves of the North" surrounding his foreign tour.  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a  premeditated provocation intended to aggravate tensions while  slandering the North and drive the situation to the brink of war.    The news analyst says:    The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the  South, not from the North.    The puppets have worked out and published a war scenario  codenamed new operation plan 5027 and are continuously shipping  in new-type weapons and equipment including Patriot missiles and  Apache attack helicopters and staging nuclear war exercises  against the North every day in conspiracy with outside forces.    Yet the Kim Yong-sam group is making a fuss over "threat  from  the North". This is a shameless act reminding us of a thief  crying "stop thief." Such act can be done only by those who have  been driven into a hopeless crisis, forsaken by the people.    Their clamour is motivated by a criminal intention to divert  elsewhere the people's resentment against them and bridge over  the crisis of the fascist rule by aggravating confrontation and  tensions.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO BOWL BOUND FOR FOURTH TIME IN ROW  </P> <P> The El Camino College football team will make its fourth consecutive Orange  County Bowl appearance Dec. 1 at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Ranked third in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau, the Warriors will meet  fifth-ranked Orange Coast College, with whom they shared the Mission Conference  title.  </P> <P> Both schools finished 8-2. The Warriors were 6-2 in conference play and the  Pirates were 7-2. El Camino won its third consecutive title in the conference's  Northern Division with a 4-0 record. Orange Coast finished 4-1 to win the  Central Division. (Palomar, 4-0 in the Southern Division, will play in the Hall  of Fame Bowl.)  </P> <P> Orange Coast will make its first bowl appearance since the 1975 Avocado Bowl.  The Pirates defeated the two highly ranked teams (Riverside and Fullerton) that  beat El Camino.  </P> <P> "We expect a real good game from them," El Camino Coach John Featherstone said.  "It's going to be a great community college game."  </P> <P> Featherstone said the disappointment of not receiving an invitation to the  Potato Bowl is gone. The Warriors would have played undefeated Bakersfield in  the Potato Bowl for a chance at the mythical national title, but the bid went  to Taft, a team El Camino beat by a point on Sept. 15.  </P> <P> "We can still be state champs," Featherstone said. "If Taft beats Bakersfield  and we beat Orange Coast, we can become state champions."  </P> <P> Featherstone has an impressive record in six years at El Camino. The Warriors  haven't lost a Northern Division game since joining the Mission Conference in  1988, and they are 38-4-1 in the past four years.  </P> <P> Orange Coast's LeBard Stadium has been the sight of many El Camino triumphs. In  1987 the Warriors claimed the national title by defeating Taft, 24-7, in what  was then the Pony Bowl. In 1988 the Warriors beat Saddleback, 48-20, in the  Pony Bowl and finished 9-1-1.  </P> <P> Last year however, El Camino's 10-0 regular-season record was tarnished by a  21-14 loss to Riverside in the Orange County Bowl.  </P> <P> Featherstone said a repeat of last year's disappointing finish is highly  unlikely. He believes this time his team is better prepared.  </P> <P> "We're as fired up as we've been," he said. "We're just real excited."  </P></p>

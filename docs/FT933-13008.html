			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck back in black SEARS, Roebuck yesterday said it had returned to profitability, reporting record second-quarter earnings of Dollars 580.6m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, excluding unusual items, compared with Dollars 325.5m, or 85 cents, for the same quarter last year. The diversified US group is in the middle of a restructuring, having spun off the last of its Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage unit. It has also sold 20 per cent of Allstate Insurance, and all of the Coldwell Banker property group. The unusual items include a gain of Dollars 635.1m from the initial public offering of Allstate Corp, a Dollars 145.3m charge for debt reduction, and a Dollars 64m loss on its sale of Coldwell Banker Residential Services. If these items were included, Sears' second-quarter earnings were Dollars 1.01bn, or Dollars 2.63 per share. Sales from Sears' continuing operations increased 5.6 per cent to Dollars 12.16bn, from Dollars 11.51bn a year ago. Its core retail merchandising group had second-quarter income of Dollars 162.5m, on sales from continuing operations of Dollars 6.85bn, compared with year-ago earnings of Dollars 131.1m and sales of Dollars 6.46bn. Sears pulled out of its loss-making catalogue business during the second quarter. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said the record second quarter was the result of the successful repositioning programme and improved operating performance of its core businesses. Sears' results include those of the merchandising group, the 80 per cent of Allstate it still owns, and the Homart Development property group. In its first publicly-reported earnings as a publicly-traded company, Allstate announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 396.7m, or 94 cents, compared with Dollars 229.6m, or a pro-forma of 53 cents per share in the second quarter last year. Sales rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 5.23bn, from Dollars 5.02bn last year. Underwriting losses fell to Dollars 1.7m, down from the loss of Dollars 253.8m the second quarter of 1992. Catastrophe losses for the second quarter were Dollars 118.6m, against Dollars 275.4m in the second quarter of 1992. Dean Witter Discover reported second quarter income of Dollars 157.1m, up 42 per cent on a comparable basis from the second quarter of 1992. On a per share basis the results were 92 cents, up from a pro forma 57 cents in 1992. Second quarter revenues were Dollars 1.42bn. The company's spin-off from Sears, Roebuck was completed June 30.</p>

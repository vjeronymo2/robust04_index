			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Genka Markova: "Reshuffle With Unusual </F> Logic"]    [Text] Boyko Noev resigned as deputy minister of defense  on military-political issues, and thus the first resignation of  Berov's cabinet materialized on Monday [25 April].    At about the same time, at the trade-political  around-the-clock meetings related to reshuffling the cabinet, it  was confirmed that a third deputy prime minister in charge of  monitoring the so-called power ministries is being conceived.  Thus it became clear that the demands of the forces that  support the government have two main directions -- the first is  directly related to the ministerial posts in industry and trade,  the other -- to the army and certain aspects of our foreign  policy.    The logic of the changes in the government really is  strange.  It puts the stress on the economic bloc and the power  ministries, while at the same time the claims of the main  political forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the New  Alliance for Democracy [NSD], and the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms [DPS] -- show beyond any doubt that it is the  government's social policy that is the most vulnerable sphere.  This government and this social minister -- Evgeni Matinchev --  did practically everything to stop the social dialogue with the  trade unions and make it meaningless. In addition, the budget  wages of 600,000 people were indefinitely frozen. The  consumer-goods prices reached incredible heights. Matinchev and  [Finance Minister] Stoyan Aleksandrov refuse to do anything  under the convenient cover of market economy. By this, I mean  market economy as they understand it. The experts remind us all  the time that speculations have nothing in common with the  market. However, it appears that this is not a sufficient  argument to request the resignation of the first deputy prime  minister, acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev.    The so-called political consultations related to basically  reshuffling the cabinet are actually not the expression of some  striving to work out a new formula through which the country  will really be ruled by a strong executive power. The basic  goal of those consultations is to redistribute the ministerial  posts so that they will correspond to the newly announced claims  of the political forces that support the government. The BSP,  DPS, and NSD are trying to hide all this behind certain  tragicomic differences as to what Professor Berov will present  at the National Assembly on 27 April -- first the program and  the then the cabinet's structure, or the two things together.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading REVISED figures showing a further widening in the UK trade gap in the first quarter of this year joined with the poor overnight market performance in Tokyo to dominate a volatile session in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo. The poor showing in Tokyo caused a weak opening in stock index futures and the June contract on the FT-SE opened just below the 2,600 level, although at a premium to the underlying cash market. However, the covering of short positions pushed June forward to 2,606 by about 10.15am, the high of the day. The revised UK quarterly current account figures sent June into decline once again, the contract falling to 2,577 by around 2.15pm. The recovery of Wall Street after a tentative opening helped June to regain some lost ground and it closed at 2,593, at the same level as the underlying cash market. Fair value has dropped to parity with cash this week. Turnover at just over 7,000 contracts was light. Traded options volume was reasonable, reaching 35,333 contracts. The FT-SE option traded 14,442 lots. Amstrad was the busiest stock option as Sheppards sold the September 40 straddle - the selling of calls and puts at the same strike price. A total of 3,320 contracts had been dealt in Amstrad by the close.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Macedonia border protests Macedonia yesterday protested to neighbouring Yugoslavia about several incursions into Macedonian territory, including the taking of a strategic hill. The Macedonian Foreign Ministry said yesterday the moves by the Yugoslav army could have 'unforeseen consequences'. The ministry repeated calls for an urgent meeting with the government of Yugoslavia, now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, to define the border. The protest follows a warning by the Macedonian chief-of-staff that he would send the army to put a halt to the violation of what he sees as Macedonian territory.</p>

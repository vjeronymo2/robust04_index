Stefashin, candidate of military </F> sciences, and Colonel M. Markov]    [Text] This is the first in a series of articles on  Chinese military science. It provides a general impression of  the subject in question. In the next journal issues we will tell  about military-scientific establishments and training of cadres  for them, the status of military-economic and military-technical  sciences, and organization of military research.    Chinese scientists look at four periods in the development  of  the country's modern military science. It is believed that the  first period begins with the appearance of works by Mao Zedong  in the late 1930's and ends in the 1940's. It is characterized  by an interpretation of theoretical questions of military  problems revealed by Mao in a number of theoretical studies such  as "Questions of the Strategy of Guerilla Warfare Against  Japanese Invaders," "On a Protracted War," "War and Questions of  Strategy" and others. The second period falls in the 1950's and  is marked by the extensive adoption of Soviet military  experience both in military-theoretical as well as  military-technical studies. A network of military educational  institutions, scientific research establishments and  post-graduate work was established at this time. The third  period comprised the years of cultural revolution (1966-1976),  when the country's leadership rejected military cooperation with  the USSR. General stagnation of military research is a  distinctive feature: There was a sharp drop in volume and  quality of military RDT&amp;E, but work to create nuclear weapons  and missile-space equipment was carried on actively. Profound  transformations of the state's entire military system were  required with transition to a reform policy in the late 1970's.  This became the beginning of the fourth period, which continues  at the present time. It is characterized by a large-scale  unfolding of military-scientific research, which was not seen in  the preceding three periods.    With consideration of changes in the political,  military-strategic and economic situation in the country and  world, especially in the Asiatic-Pacific region, Chinese  military specialists prepared fundamentally new provisions for  the military-political leadership in a short time on problems of  national security and Armed Forces organizational development.  Up to the end of the current century they recommended being  guided by the concept of "priority development of the national  economy" with respect to defense organizational development and  to rely on the "state's comprehensive might" and political  authority for establishing their leadership.    The present highly dynamic development of military science  was facilitated not only by increased attention to it on the  part of the country's leadership, but also by its "conversion,"  i.e., emergence from a closed, isolated system of a purely  defensive nature into the broad market of "know-how" and  introduction of military technologies to civilian production.  The number of such projects and developments which are becoming  the property of the civilian sector of the economy is growing  continuously. There were around 40 of them in 1983, already 800  in 1984, and over 20,000 in 1985, which contributed to a  constant growth in volume of funds for economic agreement work,  consultations and S&amp;T servicing of projects between  military-scientific establishments and enterprises of the  country's economic complex. (In 1984, for example, it was around  430 million yuan and in 1985 it exceeded one billion yuan). This  trend also is preserved at the present time.    In analyzing the history of development of military science,  it should be noted that in the first three periods China  approached a solution to problems of military theory from purely  dogmatic Maoist positions. This placed an imprint on development  of general problems of military thought, and in particular on  the conceptual apparatus, which is an instrumental part of  military research. To this day the role and place of military  science and its divisions have been the subject of scientific  disputes. Chinese scientists note that with the development of  military affairs, new directions appear in military science,  including "military-social science," "military-economic  science," the "science of military mobilization," and "military  forecasting," but their place and collateral subordination have  yet to be determined.    Official PRC Ministry of Defense publications define  military  science in the broad sense by the term "military theory," which  is understood to mean systemized knowledge in the area of  military affairs and of war as a whole which realistically  reflects the evolution of military organizational development,  the nature and regularities of warfare, and the very process of  obtaining this knowledge.    At the present stage military theory is called upon to study  problems holding a priority position such as war and peace, war  and politics, the interrelationship of defense organizational  development and economic organizational development, and  dialectics of military affairs. Chinese specialists believe that  the level of development and practical value of military theory  are determined by the degree of conformity of the "new strategic  situation in the world to the level of China's economic  development, to the status and development prospects of weapons  and military equipment of the People's Liberation Army of China  [PLA], and to requirements of modern military doctrine and  missions of organizational development of the regular Armed  Forces."    The following are components of military theory: leading  ideas, military science, science on armed forces organization,  history of military affairs, military history, and military  geography.    Chinese theorists interpret leading ideas as a  system of scientific views which combine general provisions of  Marxism-Leninism on war, peace and the army as well as the  specific experience of revolutionary wars in China. Military  ideas of Mao and Deng Xiaoping are their basis.    Military science is defined as a system of  knowledge about the nature of war, the country's preparation for  it, and methods of its conduct. Military science accomplishes  the following tasks: research of the strategic nature of modern  wars; development of doctrinal views on defense organizational  development and on the country's military-technical and  military-economic policy; cognition of regularities and methods  of preparing and conducting warfare; development of pressing  problems of technical outfitting and economic support of the  Armed Forces. Theory of military art as well as  military-technical and military-economic sciences are components  of military science.    The theory of military art is understood to mean various  fields of knowledge encompassing theoretical and practical  aspects of preparing and conducting military operations of a  varying scale. The theory of military art includes theories of  military strategy, operational art and tactics.  Military-technical science, which engages in developing military  equipment and the technology of its production, is considered a  very important factor determining the country's  military-technical and military-economic potentials and defense  capability. Military-economic science represents a system of  knowledge on military-economic problems relating to production  of means of warfare and to war as a whole. As an independent  field of military knowledge, however, it still has no specific  place in the set of components of military science, which is a  constant subject of theoretical arguments. A number of Chinese  military scientists place military-economic research among  problems of military-technical science, others examine it in the  theory of military strategy, and still others suggest making it  an independent division of military science or an independent  field of military theory.    The science on armed forces organization is a  system of knowledge on regularities and principles of Armed  Forces organizational development. It studies questions of  determining directions of development of the Armed Forces  structure and ratios of branches of forces and combat arms;  performs tasks of substantiating the PLA's quantitative and  qualitative makeup for peace and wartime; determines principles  of manpower acquisition for military formations and units and  the procedure for performance of duty and for functioning of the  cadre training system; studies problems of discipline, combat  training and the provision of military equipment and supplies;  and develops recommendations on billeting troops, the basing  system for naval and air forces, training of reserves, and  establishment of mobilization stockpiles.    The history of military affairs studies the  history of the origin and development of military affairs. Its  components are the history of wars, history of armed forces,  history of military equipment, history of military thought and  history of military art. The regularities and trends in  development of armed forces and military art are revealed and  theoretical and practical recommendations on improving military  affairs are offered within the scope of these sciences.    Being a component part of general historical science,  military history studies the causes, role and place  of warfare of popular masses, classes and parties in the overall  process of development of mankind and the state. It views the  history of wars as a sociopolitical phenomenon, and the military  system (the army) as an instrument of violence and a very  important element of state organizational development.    Military geography studies military-political,  military-economic and natural conditions, elements of terrain  relief and their influence on conduct of combat operations, as  well as the historical-geographic features and operational  preparation of probable theaters of military operations.    The structure of Chinese military theory (see figure)  graphically demonstrates that the predominant place in it is  held by military science, whose main task at the present stage  is to give theoretical and technical support to modernization of  defense and to ongoing military reforms. In performing this  task, Chinese researchers arrived at the conclusion that "reform  is a means of self-improvement of the army" and it "must follow  its own national path." The principal contradictions in Chinese  Armed Forces organizational development are considered to be  their nonconformity to demands of modern war and the still low  level of PLA modernization on the one hand, and on the other  hand, the fact that under present conditions the Army has ceased  to be an effective means of achieving political goals which can  be used in all cases and at any time. Difficulties connected  with determining directions of Armed Forces development stem  from this.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-09A>      Structure of military theory </FIG>     To perform its principal task, Chinese military science now  is resolving the following specific problems:     -  forecasting the military-political situation and possible  variants of initiation of military operations in the course of  which the country's interests may be affected;    -  technical  substantiation of the military-political course and principles  of defense organizational development and military  reform;    -  revelation of features of modern wars and development of  new forms and methods of warfare;    -  scientific argumentation of  directions of development of weapons and combat equipment and a  determination of their most important kinds for future  wars;    -  substantiation of territorial stationing of military force  elements;    -  precise determination of goals, missions and content  of military education.       Chinese scientists assert that all research on military  questions in the PRC has specific features, which are--relying  on Marxist-Leninist theory and the military ideas of Mao and  Deng Xiaoping, military-scientific research should be linked  closely with the practice and traditions of the state itself and  the Army. In conducting such research it is considered necessary  to rationally combine the international and national theory and  practice of military organizational development and the applied  and basic research on military subjects.    Thus, a characteristic feature of the present, fourth, stage  of development of Chinese military science is the sharp increase  in its role of developing practical recommendations for the  country's military-political leadership. New trends have begun  to predominate in China's contemporary military science:     -  the growing influence of military science on state  decisionmaking not only in the military policy area, but also  for many domestic and foreign policy problems;    -  use of results of  military-scientific research for further developing China's  "strategic course" and for resolving complex national security  problems;    -  the determining influence of military-scientific  research on a search for the main, future, and optimal  directions of Armed Forces organizational development and their  combat employment in different kinds of wars and military  conflicts;    -  conduct of military-scientific research in support of  military policy requirements not only of today, but also for the  long term (right up to the middle of the next century);    -  rapid  development rates of military science, an expansion of its  content, and the appearance of new independent divisions;    -  activation of conversion of military research with wide use  of  general scientific and special research methods typical of world  and national scientific schools.       In conclusion, one can state that at the present stage of  military organizational development the problem of development  of military theory has begun to occupy a very important place in  the work of the PRC military-political leadership, which  believes that "correct theoretical conclusions permit reaching  the goal by the shortest path," and that theory itself,  including military theory, must outstrip practice. In addition,  Chinese analysts believe that victory cannot be won either over  a weak or a technically superior enemy without the presence of  advanced theory. Therefore, rapid development not only of  applied, but also of basic directions of theory is a  characteristic feature of China's modern military science.</p>

Discussing the outcome of today's talks between President  Suharto and visiting Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in  Jakarta, Minister-State Secretary Murdiono said that even though  Indonesia will not send troops to the former Yugoslav republic,  it supports the Bosnian people's struggle against Serbia and  Croatia.</p>

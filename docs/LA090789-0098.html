			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUZZ'S BOYS STAY CLOSE IN SPIRIT  </P> <P> Buzz Holcomb eagerly anticipated the 1989 high school football season when he  embarked on his great experiment more than a year ago. But because of a  personal tragedy, he probably never realized how important this season would  become for him.  </P> <P> Holcomb is the Westlake Village salesman who made news last year when he opened  his home to a group of talented athletes from a disadvantaged neighborhood in  Pacoima. The boys had played on the same youth track and football teams in the  San Fernando Valley with Holcomb's son Erik.  </P> <P> Rival coaches charged Holcomb with recruiting, and Southern Section  Commissioner Stan Thomas claimed Holcomb broke the spirit of the section's  anti-recruiting rule. But Thomas took no action against him, acknowledging that  Holcomb was helping the young athletes.  </P> <P> Still, Erik Holcomb, Brian Brison and Mukasa Crowe entered Westlake High last  fall as ninth graders without athletic eligibility because of academic  deficiencies and missed the football season. Leonice Brown and Ontiwaun Carter,  who also had lived with the Holcombs, played on the varsity teams as sophomores  at Crespi and Kennedy, respectively.  </P> <P> A year later, Buzz's "boys" will play varsity football at five different  schools. Erik has remained at Westlake and is the only wide receiver in the  bunch. The other four are running backs. Carter, who rushed for 1,190 yards  last season, returns to Kennedy and Brown is back at Crespi. Brison will start  at defensive back at Alemany and will share playing time at tailback with the  Indians' other dazzling sophomore, Terry Barnum. Crowe has enrolled at  Chatsworth through the Permits With Transportation program in the Los Angeles  Unified School District and will share the tailback position for the  Chancellors.  </P> <P> "I've got so many kids to read about this year," Holcomb said.  </P> <P> In addition, Holcomb's nephew, Jeff Burdick, is a wide receiver and defensive  back at Chaminade, and Brad Gossen, a close friend of the family and a Westlake  graduate, is Washington State's starting quarterback.  </P> <P> Holcomb needs the distraction of a busy football schedule and a horde of boys  to root for. He claims it's the best therapy to help him deal with the loss of  his child. Mike Holcomb, a former football player and track athlete at  Westlake, died in a car accident in March. An autopsy revealed that Mike, 20,  was legally drunk when the car he was driving careened out of control and  crashed into a telephone pool on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Agoura Hills. Also  killed in the crash was Mike's girlfriend, Michelle Sinclair.  </P> <P> "That's the greatest loss any man can have," Holcomb said. "Football is really  going to help me through this time. The kids have been so good to me since  Michael's death. You know, a lot of people think these kids from Pacoima are  supposed to be such tough, bad (guys) but they've really been thoughtful and  kind."  </P> <P> The Pacoima youths visit Westlake regularly and still hold a special affection  for Buzz. Mike's death has cemented that bond.  </P> <P> "When I heard about his death, that really ripped me up. It tore me apart,"  Brison said. "I get out to Westlake about once a month. Buzz is a close  friend."  </P> <P> Holcomb wishes the Pacoima youths still lived with him, citing the eligibility  battle with the Southern Section as the chief reason the boys moved out. Carter  had moved back to Pacoima last summer, and after Brown enrolled at Crespi, he  moved in with Russell White, a former Celt running back now at Cal. Brown is  the half brother of former Rams running back Charles White and is Russell's  uncle.  </P> <P> Brison and Crowe left the Holcombs just after Christmas, saying they felt both  homesick and unwelcome at Westlake High.  </P> <P> "It's a shame that everyone looked at it as recruiting," Holcomb said. "I was  just interested in what was best for the boys. I can understand how everyone  saw it as something else, but it's sad they didn't see it for what it was."  </P> <P> Holcomb claims he holds no animosity toward the Southern Section, a stand made  easier by the fact that everything has worked out well for the boys, who take a  similar position.  </P> <P> "Because I'm doing so well at Alemany, I don't think about it much," Brison  said. "I have no resentment. It's all behind me. I'm starting a new career  Friday night."  </P> <P> The intent to provide a better environment for kids is a good one, Holcomb  said, but he has questioned that impulse since the death of his son.  </P> <P> "The boys would still be at my house if there wasn't that problem with the  Southern Section," he said. "The irony for me is that I wanted the boys to see  what the good life is all about. But after they left, their brother Mike  wrapped himself around a tree. I wanted to offer protection for these boys and  I couldn't even provide it for my own son."  </P> <P> Where they are now:  </P> <P> ONTIWAUN CARTER  </P> <P> The first of the Holcomb bunch to establish himself, Carter (5-11, 175) was the  Valley-area's top sophomore and one of the area's best backs last year. He  rushed for 1,190 yards and caught 13 passes for 184 yards for Kennedy. "He  electrified people last year," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. And Francola  expects more fireworks this season. "He's bigger and stronger this year," he  said. "You're going to see a running back nearly as good as Russell White. He  has great speed and he's tough."  </P> <P> MUKASA CROWE  </P> <P> Crowe also endured a personal tragedy this summer. The ensuing personal  problems he felt in the wake of the death of his grandmother kept him off the  practice field much of the summer. But Chatsworth Coach Myron Gibford is  willing to be patient. Crowe (5-11, 175) has been impressive since the start of  two-a-day drills this week. "We expect great things from him," Gibford said.  "He has great acceleration and can run with anybody."  </P> <P> BRIAN BRISON  </P> <P> Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn calls Brison the team's top defensive back and a  punishing runner. Brison packs 180 pounds on a 5-7 frame and he timed 10.9 in  the 100 meters last year as a freshman. "When he breaks into the open and you  try to tackle him, you pay for it," Blackburn said. Brison will share playing  time in the backfield with Terry Barnum, who scored 28 touchdowns for the  freshman team last year.  </P> <P> LEONICE BROWN  </P> <P> Brown gained all of 22 yards last year as a backup to Russell White and then  missed summer workouts to improve his grades. He attended summer school at  Montclair Prep to wipe out a failing mark and showed up for one workout at San  Fernando. He has returned to Crespi a little out of shape but is still a  prospect. "He's talented, has very good speed and is making great cuts in  practice," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. Brown will compete with Lucas Freeman at  tailback.  </P> <P> ERIK HOLCOMB  </P> <P> The only wide receiver of the group, Holcomb will get a world of action his  first year on the Westlake varsity. The 6-0, 155-pound sophomore will start on  offense and in the defensive secondary and will return punts. "If he comes off  the field the whole season, I'll be surprised," Coach Jim Benkert said. "He's  been very impressive. He catches everything and he's a sure tackler."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> More Vanilli: To guard against future Milli Vanilli-like scams, two Boston-area  lawmakers filed a bill Monday to prevent singing groups from giving audiences  nothing but lip service in Massachusetts. "If you pay 'real' money for a  concert, you ought to get 'real' live music in return," said Rep. Kevin  Poirier. The bill would require promoters to disclose whether any part of a  performance consists of recorded vocals. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM voices impatience over Serbia sanctions BRITAIN'S impatience to secure the UN Security Council's approval for action to 'widen and deepen' sanctions against Serbia was underlined by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday. He said Britain wanted the necessary resolution passed as speedily as possible - 'we would have welcomed it today,' he said - and indicated that the delay reflected concern about the implications for President Yeltsin in the referendum in Russia next week. Without naming Russia or its president, Mr Major explained that one of the permanent members of the Security Council would be unlikely to support the resolution at present although would do so later in the month. Downing Street officials later re-affirmed that Russia could be expected to vote for the UN Security Council resolution on April 26. Mr Major came under strong pressure from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to act with greater urgency. Mr Smith said a 'leisurely diplomatic pace' was unacceptable given the daily slaughter in Srebrenica. Mr Smith said Britain should be urging the security council to bring the resolution forward so the international community could take effective action. The prime minister defended Britain's attempts to secure an end to the fighting in Bosnia and distanced himself from the demands by Baroness Thatcher, his predecessor, that the Bosnian Moslems should be allowed to secure more weapons. Mr Major stressed the need to 'damp down and not increase the supply of arms'. He said Britain was looking for a diplomatic way to end the fighting as the only 'credible way forward'.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A federal jury returned a verdict in favor of the University of Nebraska in the  case of an academic adviser who sued the school and top officials, claiming she  was fired in September, 1988, for investigating the records of student  athletes.  </P> <P> The jury of four men and three women decided for Dr. Donald Gregory, university  general studies supervisor, and James Griesen, university vice chancellor, in  the suit filed by Mary Jane Visser, a 19-year employee.  </P> <P> Thom Cope, Visser's attorney, said he is still considering his options but  noted that he is waiting for an expected ruling by U.S. District Judge Warren  K. Urbom, who presided over the case, on the sex discrimination part of the  suit.  </P> <P> The jury decided against her claim of sex discrimination under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act, but that part of the verdict was advisory and not binding on  any decision the judge might make.  </P></p>

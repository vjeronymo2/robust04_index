			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Computing For Investors: The playful way to do your accounts  -Jean Miles tries finance programs and learns to love mice I CAN summon the necessary stoutness of heart to deal with a flesh-and-blood mouse, but I have not had the same success with the ones attached to computers. Mice are an almost invariable accompaniment of the Windows operating system. Windows is a program to be run before you run any other program. It needs a lot of computer memory and a lot of disk space. It has little pictures, called icons, for you to click at with your mouse. With Windows, you can run several programs at the same time. Windows does seem to be the signpost to the future. I swallowed my scepticism and looked at three finance programs for Windows: Microsoft Money, a Windows program tout court; Quicken for Windows, brother of a DOS program; and Sage Moneywise, which comes with the DOS and the Windows versions in the same box so you do not have to decide until you get home. I have written about Quicken (for DOS) before as a home budget program. But I use the phrase 'finance program' this time because Money and Quicken are also something else, new in Britain: serious accounting programs for people who think they do not understand accounting. Moneywise, on the other hand, is unashamedly a computerised cashbook, part of the traditional double-entry book-keeping system. Money and Quicken are US imports, carefully converted; Moneywise is a British program. The basic structure of all such programs is the same. You define the accounts in which your money resides. As sums arrive and depart, you assign each transaction to one or more income or expense categories: salary, interest earnt, electricity, mortgage, whatever. Quicken and Money allow subcategories, which can be included or 'hidden' in your financial reports. If you are registered for VAT, each of your categories can have a VAT code and transactions will then automatically, in all three programs, be broken into Net and VAT amounts. Quicken and Money can suppress this feature. Moneywise enforces VAT tracking until you figure out how to turn it off. In Money and Quicken it is possible to assign a transaction to a class or a subclass as well as to a category or subcategory. The mind begins to boggle, although it is straightforward in practice. All US budget programs assume (interestingly) that you are likely to own or manage rental property: assigning transactions to classes lets you view both income and expenditure property-by-property. The system also has its uses if you want to break things down by client, by job, or by project. Quicken and Money both let you fiddle with categories, subcategories, classes and subclasses, after you have started using the program, changing the names, merging categories, reassigning transactions. Moneywise enforces proper standards of accountancy. No change can be made once a transaction has been 'posted'. I had to install the program from scratch several times because it refused to allow me to redeem the mistakes made in setting up my accounts. It is the freedom to shape the program to your purposes which is the novel element in Quicken and Money. Gone are the formal constraints and the terminology of accounting. But programs can still handle accounts receivable and accounts payable. Aged debtors (I love that phrase) can be identified. Quicken is the better at predicting cash-flow. Half the point, and more than half the fun, of Windows programs are the graphics. Moneywise is restrained, offering only bar or line graphs comparing actual, budgeted, and last year's expenditure. Both Money and Quicken offer a rich variety of line, bar, stacked bar, and pie charts. In Money, you call up charts as a visual representation of a financial report, once you have tweaked the report to your liking. All those categories and classes provide a lot of scope for designing and filtering reports. Quicken does things the other way around: you specify a chart, then click on a particular section of it to see the underlying figures. By this stage I was having a lot of fun with my mouse. Best of all was Quicken's iconbar, a row of coloured pictures across the top of the screen, providing quick access to various aspects of the program. You can choose icons yourself and assign them to actions you use frequently. I found an icon of a cash dispenser and set it up to open my cash account. This may cut as much as a second from the time otherwise taken in choosing that account, but that is not the point. What did I conclude? Moneywise did not seem a good choice for private accounts. It is a program for small business cash accounting. There were features I liked, including the feeling of rugged reliability. A club treasurer bowed down by a sense of responsibility for other people's money might welcome the constraints this program imposes. Quicken and Money are both very usable, similar in concept, and as suitable for private accounts as for small businesses and the self-employed. I prefer Quicken. Both have good manuals, but Quicken's is fuller. Money will not print your cheques or monitor your portfolio; Quicken will. VAT tracking is more sophisticated in Quicken. it will calculate VAT on transfers between accounts. And in Quicken you can customise the iconbar. All three programs require an IBM-compatible computer running DOS 3.1 or a later version and Microsoft Windows. The prices below include VAT.

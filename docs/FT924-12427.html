			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wentworth suspended as results are again delayed SHARES IN Wentworth International were suspended at 3p yesterday as the plastic packaging company announced a further delay in the publication of its annual results. Mr Robert Gill, who became chief executive in July, said the board had decided to suspend the shares because of the prolonged nature of an investigation into the company's past accounting practices. 'It has taken us longer to pull the pieces together than we had expected,' he said. Mr Gill said he hoped an announcement could be made within weeks rather than months. 'There are still some uncertainties,' he said. He refused to comment on whether any charges would be brought against former employees. Many of the accounting problems appear to have occurred since the company's 1989-90 results. That was the year Wentworth merged its energy assets into a joint venture. The value of the oil and gas business formed a significant part of the accounting problems, Mr Gill said. He maintained that Wentworth's packaging businesses remained sound. They were 'not without problems, but I believe these can be addressed by hands-on management,' he said. In August Mr Gill had warned that Wentworth would be unable to pay a dividend following the discovery of accounting practices which he described as 'sharp' and 'at the cutting edge'. Banque Indosuez is Wentworth's largest shareholder with a 61.3 per cent stake. The bank found itself with the holding following a failed rights issue in 1990.</p>

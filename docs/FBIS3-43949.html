The national police dossier is  nearly ready. Alioune Beye will be meeting in Luanda tomorrow  with the directors of the World Food Program, before returning  to Zambia. More details from Luanda from Paulo Juliao:    [Juliao] Early this evening Alioune Blondin Beye, the UN  secretary general's special envoy to Angola and mediator at the  peace talks between the Angolan government and UNITA, arrived in  Luanda. Blondin Beye came to Luanda to meet the World Food  Program's executive director who will be arriving here tomorrow.  As usual, the UN diplomat showed optimism and reported that  there has been considerable progress in Lusaka:    [Blondin Beye, in French] Since the resumption -- in fact we  resumed on 6 January -- we have had a total of six working days.  I reject allegations that we are dragging things out. This is  not true. We are not progressing at the pace people expected.  However, we are progressing. Had this not been true, the  international community would not have allowed us to mark time  in Lusaka.    [Juliao] Mr. Beye, can you tell us whether the issue  relating  to the police has been overcome?    [Blondin Beye, in French] We have almost overcome this  because we have already approved a fair share of the general  principles. As regards the other details, prior to my departure  from Lusaka today, I conveyed to the government and UNITA  delegations very concrete proposals which, in my view, should  enable us to overcome this issue.    [Juliao] Blondin Beye is due to return to Lusaka tomorrow  afternoon.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Evening Post at Pounds 3.1m An 80 per cent higher contribution from its newspaper and printing activities helped the Bristol Evening Post lift pre-tax profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.1m in the 26 weeks to September 30. The regional newspapers and retailing group had been stalked until May by Mr David Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday Sport and Daily Sport, who was keen to move into mainstream newspapers. Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said the possible imposition of VAT on newspaper cover prices made it difficult to comment on the prospects for the second half of the year. Group turnover declined by almost 3 per cent to Pounds 30.1m, with the contribution from newspapers and printing down at Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 17m) and from retail activities down 5 per cent at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.9m). The latter was mainly due to 'an acceleration of the disposal of kiosk shops'. Profits from newspapers and printing grew to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 731,000), though Mr Clarke said that the circulations of the two main newspapers - the Bristol Evening Post and the Western Daily Press - remained depressed. The kiosks reorganisation led to the retailing side making less at Pounds 215,000 (Pounds 288,000). Features agencies and film production was flat at Pounds 47,000, while transport and vehicle repair lifted profits to Pounds 249,000 (Pounds 202,000). The group offset the increased reorganisation costs of Pounds 342,000 (Pounds 244,000) by profits from the sale of further Reuters shares which accrued Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 276,000). Earnings advanced to 8.47p (7.27p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 4.25p (4p).</p>

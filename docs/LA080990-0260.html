			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRAINER LUKAS HAS REDEFINED HIMSELF -- AND HIS PROFESSION  </P> <P> Since he began his meteoric rise in the thoroughbred business, Wayne Lukas has  been the trainer everybody loves to hate.  </P> <P> Many rival horsemen have looked at him with a contempt that is surely mixed  with jealousy. Neutral observers say that the reason he annually leads the  nation in purse winnings is that he has more good horses and more money behind  him than anybody else.  </P> <P> Even though Lukas, in the space of a decade, has shattered records that Woody  Stephens and Charlie Whittingham needed more than 50 years to compile, his name  is rarely mentioned in the same breath with those icons of his profession.  Although Lukas obviously is a savvy businessman, he rarely is extolled as a  great horseman.  </P> <P> The reason is that he often has seemed obsessed by getting fast, immediate  results with young horses -- and burning them out in the process. He pushed  such ill-prepared horses as Capote and Houston into the Kentucky Derby, and  they were never the same afterward. The three horses he won Triple Crown events  with -- Codex, Tank's Prospect and Winning Colors -- never won a race of  consequence thereafter. His color bearers were often finished at a stage of  their careers when Whittingham horses were just beginning to develop and  mature.  </P> <P> For those of us who have cited this argument as the principal indictment of  Lukas' training skills, the identities of America's leading racehorses of 1990  come as a bit of a surprise. The top-ranked horse is Criminal Type, who has  just begun to blossom at age 5 and has won four straight Grade I stakes. The  top turf horse is Steinlen, who earned the Eclipse Award last year and is going  strong at age 7. Both are trained by Lukas.  </P> <P> It may be time for his detractors to re-evaluate Wayne Lukas. Has he changed  and matured as a trainer?  </P> <P> He says no: "I don't think we've made any changes; this is the same program  we've always had. I just think we're wearing down the critics. The most  difficult thing to do in horse racing is to be consistent. This game is full of  guys who have up years and down years. We've been consistent for nine years."  Indeed, this will be the eighth straight year in which his stable has led the  nation in winnings.  </P> <P> What has changed during that period, he said, is the type of results he has  sought. It was no accident that he made his first success with precocious  2-year-olds; the Steinlens came later.  </P> <P> "When you don't have an established program, and you get new players, you have  to show them some action," he said. "They can say over and over again, 'I'm a  patient person, I want to build a program,' but that's baloney. You couldn't  tell Gene Klein that you wanted to buy some grass horses that would be good  when they were 3 or 4. He wanted action!"  </P> <P> Now that he has established himself and built ongoing programs with his big  clients, Lukas said, he can afford to take his time. He is waiting later and  later to turn loose his best prospects; he's taking a longer view. He still  seems to succumb to impatience and wishful thinking at the time of the Kentucky  Derby, but otherwise, his image as a trainer obsessed with instant results is  passe.  </P> <P> Indeed, he is proving that his great strength is his long-range vision. He  entered the thoroughbred game with a concept of an operation that challenged  the traditional notions of training. His critics could focus on his more  blatant mistakes (the Capotes, the Houstons) and use them to deride the whole  concept. But as these criticisms fade, it is becoming increasingly clear that  Lukas' program has revolutionized his profession.  </P> <P> Of course, it is hardly revolutionary for a trainer to cultivate large numbers  of wealthy owners and assemble large numbers of high-class horses. But every  American trainer who has done so in the past has run a regional business. Woody  Stephens is a New York trainer. Charlie Whittingham is a California trainer.  They would, of course, ship their horses out of town for major stakes, but they  had a single base of operations. They are limiting their opportunities in an  era when moneymaking opportunities for good thoroughbreds have proliferated.  </P> <P> Lukas' management of Criminal Type typifies the national scope of his program.  Criminal Type spent the winter in California for the rich stakes races there,  then went to Arkansas, Maryland and New York for major stakes before returning  to California for a $1-million race. He has earned more than $2.2 million in  these travels. Now he is in New York for the rest of the year, aiming for the  prestigious fall stakes and the Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> Lukas can shuttle his horses around the country because he has bases of  operation at several race tracks, with an assistant trainer in each -- an idea  that appalls traditionalists. A true horseman is one who scrutinizes his  animals every day, watches them gallop, feels their legs and ankles, watches  how they eat and bases his handling of them on such nuances.  </P> <P> But Lukas has thrived by establishing and supervising far-flung divisions of  his stable. "I think the absolute key to doing this is quality control," he  said. "You cannot ever see a deviation of quality from one division to the  other. The barns are the same. The feeding program is the same. There are a lot  of young assistants in this business who think they have a better way of doing  things, but the people who last in this operation are ones who have blind faith  -- and a high intensity level.  </P> <P> "This is what makes it easy to ship horses around the country. Most horses,  when they ship, have to adjust. There's never an adjustment necessary in our  divisions. It's the McDonald's principle. We'll give you a franchise, and that  franchise is going to be the same wherever you go."  </P> <P> There was a time when most people in the horse industry would have hooted at  the concept of the McStable. His record $105 million in earnings has answered  his detractors, and as surely as McDonald's revolutionized the hamburger  business, Lukas has redefined the training profession.  </P></p>

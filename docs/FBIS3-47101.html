			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 6 January His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan,  president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party [DKP], sent a  telegram to Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, president of  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], in reply to the latter's  letter of 1 January. The telegram reads as follows:    Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, FUNCINPEC president,  Phnom Penh    Respected Samdech Krompreah: I would like to acknowledge  receipt, with deep and sincere thanks, of Samdech Krompreah's  letter of 1 January 1994. May I be permitted to make the  following clarifications?    I. The points we agreed upon at our meeting on 17 December  1993 discussed the basis (?that) the cause to be pursued must be  the five-point guideline set forth by His Majesty [H.M.] the  King. As Samdech Krompreah is fully aware, this five-point  guideline clearly stipulates the following:    1. An immediate and complete cease-fire over the whole  territory of Cambodia;    2. An immediate and unconditional transfer of the Preah  Vihear temple, Pailin, and other Democratic Kampuchea-controlled  zones to the state and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia;    3. The dissolution of the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK] and its partial inclusion into the Royal Army  of Cambodia;    4. The government shall in return give the post of  co-ministers, co-vice ministers, co-secretaries of state, and  advisers to acceptable personalities of the DKP. H.M. the King  would appoint a Democratic Kampuchea high-ranking personality as  his senior personal adviser;    5. The DKP and the government must hold talks to settle all  the issues.    The points of the five-point guideline cannot be separated  one from the other. These five points form a single body to be  simultaneously dealt with altogether. H.M. the King has pointed  out that the DKP alone cannot make any progress. The  government, for its part, must do something through talks.    The essence is clear, that is, the first three points are  what the DKP must give to the other side, and the last two  points are what the government must give to the DKP in return.  Altogether these five points make national reconciliation  possible. On the contrary, if one side insists on the other  three points, then the other two points cannot be fulfilled. By  the same token, if the DKP demands only the two points for  itself, then the three points cannot be fulfilled either. In so  doing, the five-point guideline cannot be [as heard]  materialized.    II. As Samdech Krompreah has been fully aware all along, the  Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party have for a long  time insisted on their points, namely:    1. An unconditional cease-fire by the national resistance  forces;    2. The handing over of Democratic Kampuchea-controlled zones  to the Vietnamese-controlled Phnom Penh party;    3. The dissolution of the NADK, which is an important  component of the national resistance forces.    Samdech Krompreah may also be well aware of the the fact  that  our Cambodian nation and people, like the DKP, have not  accepted, nor can they accept, these conditions set by the  Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party. Our tripartite  national resistance forces have also unequivocally rejected  them, for they are like a guillotine beheading the national  resistance forces enabling the Vietnamese communists and the  Phnom Penh party to perpetuate their occupation of Cambodia.  This would amount to blotting out our Cambodian nation and  people.    The three points of the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom  Penh party are the opposite of the five-point guideline of H.M.  the King. The former are a scheme aimed at continuing the war in  Cambodia, while the five points would lead to national  reconciliation. The five-point guideline aims at true national  reconciliation without excluding any national force. The DKP  would (?thus) be included so that there would be sufficient  national forces within the army and the government in order to  make them truly national forces. And all the national forces  would work together to tackle the present situation, which is  worsening day by day, so that peace, independence, national  unity, and territorial integrity could be restored.    I sincerely believe that Samdech Krompreah personally wishes  to support the five-point guideline of H.M. the King as well.  However, the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party  have been resorting to all sorts of maneuvers and pressures to  ensure that only the three points are singled out, the aim of  which is to dismantle the DKP according to their dark and dirty  scheme. They categorically oppose Cambodian national  reconciliation since the strategy of the Vietnamese communists  and their lackeys is to swallow up Cambodia through a military  war and a war conducted by sending massive Vietnamese nationals  into the country and to the state power they installed in 1979,  which is now running Cambodia.    Thus, as far as the technical group is concerned, and as  Samdech Kromopreah is fully aware, we had reached an agreement  according to which that group should have no name at all.    I would like to recall that at that time I proposed that the  technical group be formed by the representatives of the DKP and  FUNCINPEC. However, in case the representatives of the  Cambodian People's Party are also included, then those of the  [words indistinct] democratic parties should be brought in as  well.    The content of Samdech Krompreah's communication of 1  January  1994 has departed from this point of agreement we reached on 17  December last and did not give an answer to my letter of 28  December which I addressed to you. I would like to propose that  we should proceed as fast as we can on the basis of what we  achieved on 17 December 1993, that is, the points of agreement  which I have recalled above.    Please accept, Samdech Krompreah, my high and respectful  consideration.    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the DKP    [Dated] 6 January 1994</p>

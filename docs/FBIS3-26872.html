			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yongli (3769 3057 7787): "One Month After the New </F> Taxation System Comes Into Effect"]    [Text] During the first collection of tax under the new  taxation system, one month after the new system came into  effect, this reporter contacted some enterprises and interviewed  Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of  Taxation and some officials from grass-roots tax offices.  <H5>  Taxpayers Support Taxation System Reform </H5>   After meeting the directors, managers, and tax personnel  from  some enterprises, especially large and medium enterprises, this  reporter's overwhelming impression was that they are good at  accounts and have a detailed understanding of the reform of the  taxation system, especially value-added tax [VAT].    Xu Shizhen, chief accountant at the Beijing Electrical  Machinery Plant, said: This reform is a positive one and  constitutes a major measure for bringing the socialist market  economy in line with the international market. As VAT will not  lead to duplicate taxation in the links of social reproduction,  it enhances coordination among specialized departments. It also  encourages direct export because the export tax rate is zero.  The electrical machinery plant has the right to export its own  products. Xu Shizhen estimated that exports would increase this  year. In the course of implementing the new taxation system,  the plant has also issued two documents to the appropriate  personnel: "The Handling of Accounts After the New Taxation  Comes Into Effect" and "The Points of Attention in Writing  Receipts and Accepting Receipts From Outside."    To adapt enterprises' internal operations to the unified VAT  special receipts, the Beijing Municipal Department Store and the  Beijing Municipal Medical Corporation hurriedly printed vouchers  for internal delivery in late December last year. Foregoing the  New Year's Day holiday, the Beijing Municipal Mechanical and  Electrical Corporation carried out advance on-the-spot exercises  on the method of using VAT special receipts and rushed to made  seals in coordination with the use of special receipts so as to  reduce customers' waiting time. In implementing the new  taxation system, the nine branch factories and one company of  the Guizhou Organic Chemical Plant have taken the headquarters  as a unified tax-paying unit and, with some subordinate  enterprises undertaking more or less tax burdens, the overall  tax burden has dropped. In light of the rising prices of raw  and semi-finished materials and the increasing enterprise tax  burden, the plant has worked out several measures for tapping  its internal potential. Because it uses bauxite as a raw  material, the China No. 7 Abrasive Wheel Plant cannot enjoy tax  credits and hence has to assume a heavier tax burden. The  plant's chief accountant, Ma Quanbin, said: The introduction of  the new taxation system has vigorously compelled us to change  our internal operation mechanism and adapt to the market  economy. We should budget carefully, raise efficiency by  improving management, and try every possible means to internally  absorb the increased tax burden.  <H5>  Good Order in the First Tax Collection Period </H5>   The first collection of tax according to the new taxation  system covers a 10-day period from 1 to 10 February.    At the No. 1 tax office of the Dongcheng tax sub-bureau of  the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, this reporter discovered that  most enterprises filled in the "VAT Returns" and other forms in  pencil first and, after consulting those individuals  specifically assigned to the task of checking them, officially  filled in the forms. As these individuals asked questions and  made calculations column by column and item by item, everything  was in good order. The No. 4 tax office of the Chaoyang tax  sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, which is  responsible for over 200 large and medium city- level  enterprises, extended its working hours lest enterprises should  require a second consultation. They also stipulated that  administrative personnel should first give guidance on how to  fill in all forms and then check them before they are submitted  to the tax collection department, the information is entered in  the computer, and the tax invoices are printed. This can  prevent enterprises from making mistakes or enduring long  waiting periods to submit returns.    It has been learned that during the first tax collection  period under the new taxation system, the order of paying taxes  has been good in most parts of the country.  <H5>  Taking the First Steady Step </H5>   Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of  Taxation, said: There are four conditions for judging whether  the taxation system reform has been successful: First, whether  it will give rise to price fluctuations and soaring prices;  second, whether tax revenue can grow steadily; third, whether  there are numerous counterfeit VAT special receipts and tax  evasions in violation of regulations on the use of special  receipts; and fourth, whether the new taxation system boosts the  transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms and  production. Judging from the first month, the taxation system  reform has not given rise to great fluctuations in commodity  prices, about which people are most concerned; there have not  been major problems in the use of VAT special receipts; the tax  revenue maintained a fairly high growth in January; and some  localities are exploring economic development strategies to  adapt to the new taxation system and some enterprises are  readjusting their internal operation mechanisms. Due to its  vast territory, conditions differ greatly throughout China, and  all trades and professions have their own special features.  Given such disparate conditions, many complicated issues have  yet to be solved in the implementation of a unified taxation  system. However, through the vigorous coordination of various  quarters and the joint efforts of both tax departments and  enterprises, we have taken a steady first step in implementing a  new taxation system which contributes to the sustained, rapid,  and healthy development [as published] of the national economy,  meets the requirements of the socialist market economic  structure, and conforms to international practice and our  national conditions.</p>

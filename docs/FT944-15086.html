			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Hamas raises terror campaign to new pitch in Israel: The attacks have now come to dominate the political agenda of both Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin The devastating bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv yesterday marks the increasing confidence and power of Hamas, the militant Islamic group, which has pledged to destroy the peace process, the state of Israel, and usher in an Islamic republic based on Koranic law. An anonymous caller told Israel radio that the bombing had been carried out in the name of some 400 Hamas activists expelled by Israel for several months to a no-man's land in Lebanon in December 1992. He said he wanted to thank the government for deporting the Hamas members where they had received training in sabotage and explosives. 'We know how to carry out attacks and we will carry out other attacks,' he said. The threat is very real. In the past fortnight, Hamas has struck a new level of terror into the heart of Israeli society; spraying a busy Jerusalem shopping promenade with bullets and killing two people; kidnapping and killing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier; and carrying out yesterday's attack in the commercial centre of Tel Aviv. Its increasingly successful military campaign against Israeli civilians and soldiers has come to dominate the political agenda of both Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. The attacks have shown that Hamas has the political initiative and can influence the pace of the peace process. Furthermore it has now laid down an open challenge to Mr Arafat for the leadership of the Palestinian people and defied him to take repressive measures at the risk of civil war. Experts on the extremist movement, which has a growing support base of between 20-40 per cent of Gaza's 850,000 residents, say Hamas does not want Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin to suspend the peace process. Rather their strategy is to cripple it, thereby ensuring that Mr Arafat fails to deliver on his promises to his people of new jobs, alleviation of poverty and a gradual assumption of legitimate Palestinian rights. These include the return of Israeli-occupied land, the right of return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees and the establishment of an independent state, with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital. Each time Hamas carries out an attack Israel seals off the Gaza Strip, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from travelling to their jobs inside Israel. Last week Israel briefly suspended peace talks following the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Such moves play into the hands of Hamas by showing Palestinians how weak Mr Arafat is, and how dependent on Israeli goodwill. Israeli demands for Mr Arafat to smash the military wing of Hamas are also easily exploited by the Islamic group as Mr Arafat doing Israel's dirty work for them. Last week's mass arrests of Hamas activists in Gaza by Mr Arafat's security forces were met with demonstrations and riots, accompanied by threats of civil war. Hamas's military wing warned Mr Arafat that if he continued arresting its supporters it would reply 'by setting the Gaza Strip ablaze'. Hamas continues to benefit from the very limited gains Palestinians have reaped from the peace process and the poor performance so far of the ineffectual Palestinian authority. Like other militant Islamic groups, Hamas thrives on despondency, poverty and the failure of secular Arab governments to restore pride and economic wellbeing to their peoples. Many Palestinians feel Mr Arafat gave up the Palestinian struggle in return for a virtual bantustan in a part of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Months after the PLO was supposed to have taken over the West Bank and held elections, Mr Arafat's peace negotiators remain locked in negotiations with Israel in Cairo. Furthermore, after three months in power, Mr Arafat has yet to put together a credible government capable of tackling the massive task of rehabilitating the derelict Gaza Strip and combating an unemployment rate of 40-50 per cent. Part of his failures are self-imposed - a result of centralisation of power and an aversion to transparent government. International donors, choking on their own bureaucracy, are also to blame for the slow drip of promised emergency funds. As Mr Arafat struggles to deliver real economic and political change, Hamas continues to provide better services through its social welfare network of schools, clinics and kindergartens. Hamas also offers a strong moral message and a religious certainty in a period of upheaval and instability. In a recent interview, Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a leading Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said his organisation welcomed the return of Mr Arafat to Gaza because his obvious failures would expose the moral, economic and political bankruptcy of secular Arab government and encourage Palestinians to turn to the Islamic solution. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he said. But it is not just Mr Arafat's failings that contribute to the flow of recruits to Hamas. Hatred and suspicion of Israel remain deeply rooted in the hearts of many Palestinians. Even amongst PLO supporters, Hamas is viewed as a 'liberation organisation', fighting a legitimate battle against continued Israeli occupation of their land and denial of their rights. Mr Arafat will now come under renewed pressure from Israel to deal a decisive blow to Hamas. For Israel, peace means increased security. During last week's kidnap crisis Mr Rabin said: 'Arafat must choose between making peace with Israel or making peace with Hamas'. It is an acute dilemma for Mr Arafat, while still trying to find his feet as leader of a people in a nascent state. If Mr Arafat does not move against Hamas he risks allowing Israel to continue dragging its feet in talks and so ensuring the vacuum which Hamas so readily exploits.</p>

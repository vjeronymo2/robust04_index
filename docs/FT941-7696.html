			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover from early weakness Bourses threw off their earlier weakness late yesterday afternoon although, in Washington, the much-awaited testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, seemed to indicate that further increases in US interest rates were simply a matter of time, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT responded to a rising US equity market and the Dax index, which had slipped just below 2,100 during the session - which it closed 11.91 lower at 2,107.62 - recovered to 2,113.64 in Ibis trade by the end of the day. Turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM7.6bn. The afternoon produced some big winners in the financial sector, after a brief dip in bunds immediately after the Greenspan news. Allianz hit DM2622.5 in London after falling DM29 to DM2,600 on the session and Bayernhypo DM464 after DM454, down DM7.30. In industrials, BMW recovered from a Honda scare to end DM15 to the good on the afternoon at DM854 after falling DM9 to DM839 on the session. Mannesmann's 1993 loss left it DM4 lower DM421 after a relatively stable morning, and brokers said foreign buying took Contnental, the tyremaker, up DM6.50 on the session to DM272.50. PARIS gathered pace after viewing Mr Greenspan's comments as mildly positive for equities. On the first day of the new account the CAC-40 index improved 11.53 to 2,226.73 in turnover of FFr4.8bn. St-Gobain was one of the sharpest fallers, down FFr12 at FFr662 after the industrial materials group announced a FFr3.6bn rights issue. Euro Disney dipped FFr2.05 to FFr34.75 as investors remained worried about restructuring plans. AMSTERDAM was disappointed with Unilever's results, marking the shares down Fl 6.30 or 2.7 per cent to Fl 221.50 by the close. The downturn in the food and comsumer products stock had a marked effect on the AEX index, which ended the session off 3.30 at 422.23. While Unilever's results came in at the bottom end of forecasts, most analysts' remain broadly positive about the group's prospects, with expectations that it will benefit from the recovery in worldwide consumer markets. Nedlloyd, the transport and distribution group, was another loser, off Fl 2.50 at Fl 73.30, with some investors continuing to switch into the convertible bond. ZURICH edged lower as waited for Mr Greenspan, with program trading related to futures and options adding to the unpredictable mood. The SMI index shed 14.8 to 2,982.8. SMH registered added SFr6.50 to SFr207.50 on the Daimler go ahead for Mercedes to co-operate in the development of the environmentally friendly Swatch-Mobile small car project. MILAN fell prey to profit-taking after its recent strong run, prompting expectations that the market could face a volatile period in the run-up to elections next month. The Comit index fell 12.39 or 1.8 per cent to 672.16. Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan noted that much of the day's selling was by domestic investors, while foreigners, already fully weighted in Italian stocks, had become increasingly reluctant to buy at current high prices. The banking sector remained at the centre of attention. BCI fell 4.9 per cent on profit-taking ahead of its privatisation which begins next week. The ordinary stock, which has surged more than 25 percent since the start of the year, shed L305 to L6,234. Fiat fell L89 to L4,890 as a series of strikes and protests against Monday night's agreement on jobs cuts clouded the chances that a final agreement would be signed before the weekend deadline. ISTANBUL's composite index lost another 932.62 or 5.4 per cent to 16,317.5. WARSAW saw Bank Slaski shares rise 10 per cent to 4.6m zlotys after the stock exchange's supervisory body again refused on Monday evening to suspend the stock, in spite of pressure from the finance ministry, writes Christopher Bobinski. Bank Slaski management has now confirmed that the bank's broking office is registering stocks without delay which means that those shareholders who have accounts with brokers are now able to sell and buy the stock freely. Demand for Bank Slaski shares remains high with turnover at 171bn zlotys (Dollars 7.7m) yesterday seeing a mere 25 per cent of buy offers finding sellers. Although the share price has oscillated at around eight times its public offer price of 500,000 zlotys, the price/earnings ratio of 22.9 means it is the cheapest on the exchange, where the average p/e is 34.5.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FEB 22                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1479.27     1478.82     1474.49     1474.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1531.53     1531.82     1526.59     1526.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1473.95     1475.32     1477.90     1476.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1524.82     1526.52     1530.02     1530.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 21    Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 16    Feb 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1483.51   1495.00   1516.65   1491.80   1483.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1539.13   1550.75   1569.16   1554.49   1540.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90);  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1479.53; 200 - 1534.42 Low/day: 100 - 1472.10 200 - 1523.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

Speaking of his resignation from the post of minister for  affairs of nationalities and the voiced intention to leave the  vice-premier's post, Shakhray said "the question has been  closed, I remain the vice-premier". He told the audience that  meetings with the prime minister and president assured him "his  potential has not been exhausted".    Shakhray did not exclude "the right to future existence of  Far Eastern or Urals republics on condition it will not be a  mere isolation of the region or the territory within the current  administrative borders". In his opinion, this is possible "in  case of formation of larger federation subjects on the basis of  inter-regional economic unity and cooperation".    Commenting on press reports claiming fake results of the  December 12 referendum on the new Russian Constitution, the  vice-premier said "as long as these claims are not proved, I  will think that the Constitution has been approved". The  Constitution is a reality, said Shakhray.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING SOCKERS BEATEN BY ST. LOUIS IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> The Sockers blew an opportunity to gain home field advantage for the first  round of the MISL playoffs when rookie Dan Donigan scored his second goal of  the season 5:30 into overtime Sunday night to give the St. Louis Storm a 2-1  victory at St. Louis Arena.  </P> <P> The Sockers had problems before even leaving for St. Louis. Midfielder Brian  Quinn didn't make the trip because his wife, Sharon, who is seven months  pregnant, suffered an appendicitis attack on Saturday.  </P> <P> Problems continued in St. Louis. At the conclusion of the second quarter,  midfielder Waad Hirmez and Socker Coach Ron Newman had words while going off  the field and butted heads. Hirmez didn't play the rest of the game.  </P> <P> The Sockers (23-27) then tired in the second half after tying the game, 1-1.  With the victory, St. Louis (23-27) clinched the season series five games to  three and moved into a tie with the Sockers for second place in the Western  Division. A Socker victory would have given them home field advantage for their  five-game Western Division semifinal playoff series with the Storm. Each team  has two games remaining. St. Louis will have home field advantage if the teams  are tied at the conclusion of the regular season.  </P> <P> The winning goal was set up when forward Michael Collins picked up the ball at  midfield and hit forward Claudio De Oliveira outside the penalty box. De  Oliveira drew defender Ralph Black to him and passed to Donigan, who tapped a  shot past goalie Zoltan Toth.  </P> <P> "It almost looked like the old San Diego Traders," Newman said. "We had a lot  of developmental players on the field. We tired in the second half. The boys  played their guts out, but we came up short. That's been our story all year."  </P> <P> Hirmez wouldn't comment on his differences with Newman. Newman told Hirmez near  the end of the half that he needed to get back on defense more quickly. The two  argued and were eventually separated by several players.  </P> <P> "It was a pure case of insubordination, plain and simple," Newman said. "I'm  the boss and he didn't agree with me."  </P> <P> The Sockers tied the game 8:56 into the fourth quarter when forward Damir  Haramina scored his fifth goal of the season. Branko Segota knocked a pass off  the boards, and Haramina beat goalie Slobo Ilijevski.  </P> <P> Segota almost won the game with 50 seconds remaining, blasting a shot from  outside the penalty box that Ilijevski punched wide.  </P> <P> "Slobo played great," Storm Coach Don Popovic said. "He has played well against  San Diego all year. The guy is amazing."  </P> <P> Segota also had a good chance to score in overtime, but Ilijevski came out of  the goal to stop him point blank. On the rebound, forward Jim Gabarra shot from  midfield and Ilijevski dived backward to make the save.  </P> <P> "We started off poor and we looked tired," Newman said. "I kept telling the  guys to get going."  </P> <P> Forward Thompson Usiyan put St. Louis in front, 1-0, with 3:34 remaining in the  third quarter. De Oliveira hit a pass near the midfield to Usiyan, who lofted a  soft shot over Toth's right shoulder into the net.  </P> <P> Neither team had many scoring chances in the second quarter. Socker forward Rod  Castro opened the quarter hitting the post from 20 yards. Segota raced down the  left sideline late in the quarter and fired a shot off Socker defender Ralph  Black that Ilijevski caught.  </P> <P> The Sockers had virtually no offense in the first quarter. The Storm opened the  game with good scoring chances from Marcio Leite and Godfrey Ingram. Leite hit  the far right post on one shot, and Toth stopped Ingram twice inside the box  within a matter of seconds.  </P></p>

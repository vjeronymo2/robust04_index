			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Smurfit upbeat despite 30% fall JEFFERSON SMURFIT Group, the paper and packaging company which accounts for about one-sixth of the Irish stock market's capitalisation, yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits, but a slight increase in earnings per share. The results were affected by the restructuring of Jefferson Smurfit's US operations and the general downturn in the paper industry. Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint deputy chairman, said the rise in diluted earnings per share from 51p to 52p was an impressive achievement when set against the troubles elsewhere in the paper industry. 'We think it's a big deal,' he said. 'We think Jefferson Smurfit is the only major paper company in the world that has increased its earnings per share this year.' During the year to January 31, Jefferson Smurfit saw pre-tax profits fall almost 30 per cent from IPounds 245.52m (Pounds 225.25) to IPounds 173.12m. Sales were also sharply down at IPounds 992.6m (IPounds 1.66bn). These declines, however, largely reflected the recapitalisation of Jefferson Smurfit's US operations in December 1989. This resulted in the US arm, JSC/CCA, being treated as a related company rather than a subsidiary. The recapitalisation gave Jefferson Smurfit Dollars 1bn cash, which transformed the company's borrowings position. At the end of last year, the group had a cash pile of IPounds 854.35m set against borrowings of IPounds 547.55m. Jefferson Smurfit received interest of IPounds 26.1m last year, compared with the IPounds 31.91m paid out the year before. Tax payments also fell sharply from IPounds 101.51m to IPounds 41.78m. Mr Smurfit said the company was still considering how it might best use its cash. 'But we have nothing huge in the pot at the moment,' he said. Jefferson Smurfit's capital expenditure last year was IPounds 133m last year. The group made acquisitions worth IPounds 196m. The company has aimed its expansion towards continental Europe, which now accounts for 34 per cent of the group's consolidated sales. The US operations are still suffering from the downturn in the industry. JSC/CCA lost about Dollars 13m (Pounds 7.6m) in the first quarter. 'But we should be looking for some significant bump-up in terms of pricing in the third and fourth quarters this year,' Mr Smurfit said. The board has recommended a final dividend of 3.48p, which will bring the total to 5.053p (4.7p). Lex, Page 20</p>

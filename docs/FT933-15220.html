			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marriott posts advance to Dollars 36m MARRIOTT Corporation, the large US lodging and food services group, yesterday posted underlying second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 36m, or 29 cents a share, excluding the impact of accounting changes. A year earlier, Marriott earned Dollars 29m, or 24 cents. Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 2.16bn, compared with Dollars 2.04bn in the same period of 1992. Last month, the company said that it would take a charge against second-quarter earnings of Dollars 32m, or 29 cents, to reflect more accurately the net realisable value of assets being held for sale. Including this charge, Marriott earned Dollars 4m in the 1993 quarter. For the six months to June 187, Marriott earned Dollars 55m, or 44 cents, on sales of Dollars 4.24bn, excluding the one-time charge. This compares with earnings of Dollars 40m, or 31 cents on sales of Dollars 3.99bn. The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Marriott eased Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 25 7/8 in New York. Doubletree Hotels Corporation, a Phoenix, Arizona-based hotel chain, and Boston-based Guest Quarter Hotels Partnership yesterday signed a letter of intent to merge. Guest Quarters Hotels Partnership is owned by General Electric Investments in partnership with Richard Ferris and Peter Ueberroth. Doubletree is owned by Canadian Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts and Metropolitan Life Insurance.</p>

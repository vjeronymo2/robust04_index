			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: US banks stake out insurance battlefield THE TINY outpost of Banks, Oregon (population 489), is an unlikely battleground for the struggle between US banks and insurers over whether banks should be allowed into the insurance business. Yet this small town, wedged between the city of Portland and the Pacific Ocean, has been the setting for one of a series of convoluted legal actions which will ultimately determine whether banks can use their networks to sell insurance products around the country. This Oregon town is home to one of the first nationwide insurance marketing efforts by a bank, the Portland-based US National Bank. Taking advantage of a legislative loophole which allows nationally chartered banks (as opposed to those organised under state laws) to sell insurance from towns with populations of less than 5,000, US National markets insurance products by direct mail throughout the US. Similar operations have sprung up in small towns all over the country as banks seek to expand the range of products they sell to their customers. A flurry of legal actions over such operations, brought by insurance agents eager to protect business, is currently winding its way through the federal court system. The right of US National to continue its operations in Banks was upheld in July by a federal appeals court in Washington. But the latest ruling of its kind, handed down by the federal appeals court in Houston, was a setback for the banking industry. This judgment, delivered against NationsBank, the North Carolina-based bank, could severely restrict the ability of banks to sell annuities, a business with bank sales put at Dollars 15bn a year. According to the Houston ruling, annuities - contracts which pay a set amount periodically to an investor for life in return for a single lump-sum payment - are a type of insurance contract, and so should be subject to the same rules as other insurance products. That runs counter to a ruling earlier this year by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the arm of the US Treasury charged with regulating nationally chartered banks. The OCC concluded that annuities were banking rather than insurance products, a view it continued to adhere to yesterday. For banks which have grown accustomed to picking their way through the discrepancies between banking and insurance regulation and between federal and state legislation, such conflicts are nothing new. 'We've been in litigation for three years,' says Mr Tom Brumley, president of the small Kentucky-based Owensboro National Bank, which has assets of just Dollars 370m. Mr Brumley has been fighting the Kentucky insurance regulators over whether the bank can sell insurance products at all in the state. Echoing the ambitions of bankers around the country, he says he wants to use his existing network to sell more products to the 22,000 households which comprise the bank's customer base. Kentucky law forbids bank employees from selling insurance. The question now, to be decided in the federal appeals court in Cincinnati, is whether such state legislation has primacy over federal law, or whether Mr Brumley's bank can enter the insurance business. Complicating the picture for the banks has been a lack of clarity in some of the rulings so far. The Washington judgment found that banks could sell insurance from small towns - apparently leaving it open to banks with insurance operations headquartered in such places to use any method to sell insurance anywhere in the US, including through their existing bank branch network. Last week's ruling in Houston, though, appeared to limit banks to selling insurance only in small towns. Bankers hope that such discrepancies will eventually be ironed out in the supreme court. Given the vested interest involved, most hold out little hope that Congress will attempt to clarify the issue with new legislation, a route recommended by the Washington court.</p>

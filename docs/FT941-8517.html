			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / More action on global warming Industrialised countries have agreed on the need to strengthen the international climate change treaty to reduce emissions of gases that warm the earth's atmosphere, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The treaty, signed by over 160 countries in 1992 and due to come into effect next month, commits rich nations to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. However, governments have now accepted that this will not be enough to prevent potentially dangerous atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Scientists have said a 60 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions is needed to halt global warming. Environmental groups are urging a rapid reduction of at least 20 per cent.</p>

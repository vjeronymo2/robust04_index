			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> June 28, 1994 (TS 94&hyph;09). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would revise the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 2 Technical Specifications (TS) surveillance requirements, bases, and a Limiting Condition For Operation to incorporate alternate steam generator tube plugging criteria at tube support plate intersections. The proposed changes would be implemented for Fuel Cycle 7 only and would affect: (1) TS 4.4.5.2.c.2 to address bobbin probe inspections; (2) TS 4.4.5.3.d to address future inspections of tubes where the interim criteria is used; (3) TS 4.4.5.4.a.6 to address application of the interim criteria for indications found within the thickness of the tube support plate; (4) TS 4.4.5.4.a.10 to address application of the tube plugging alternate criteria and evaluation of indications; (5) TS 4.4.5.5.d and 4.4.5.5.e to address reporting requirements and information to be reported to the Commission regarding application of the criteria; (6) TS 3.4.6.2.c to reduce the allowable reactor coolant system total primary-to-secondary leakage through all steam generators from 1 gallon per minute to 600 gallons per day and from any one steam generator from 500 gallons per day to 150 gallons per day; and (7) Bases 3/4.4.5 and 3/4.4.6.2 to reflect the new primary-to-secondary leakage limits and add a reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA has evaluated the proposed TS change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing of model boiler specimens for free-span tubing (no tube support plate restraint) at room temperature conditions shows burst pressures in excess of 500 pounds per square inch (psi) for indications of outer-diameter stress corrosion cracking with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on intersections pulled from SQN with up to a 1.9-volt indication shows measured burst pressure in excess of 6,600 psi at room temperature. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5-volt indications shows burst pressures in excess of 6,300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety-factor requirements of NRC Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.121.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions because of the proximity of the tube support plate (TSP). Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes that have 100 percent throughwall electrodischarge machining notches, 0.75-inch long, provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Since tube-to-tube support plate proximity precludes tube burst during normal operating conditions, use of the criteria must retain tube integrity characteristics that maintain a margin of safety of 1.43 times the bounding faulted condition steam line break (SLB) pressure differential. During a postulated SLB, the TSP has the potential to deflect during blowdown following a main SLB, thereby uncovering the TSP intersections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the existing database, the RG 1.121 criterion requiring maintenance of a safety factor of 1.43 times the SLB pressure differential on tube burst is satisfied by 7/8-inch-diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes less than 8.82 volts, regardless of the indicated depth measurement. A 2.0-volt plugging criterion (resulting in a projected end-of-cycle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> { <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EOC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> } <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  voltage) compares favorably with the 8.82-volt structural limit considering the extremely slow apparent voltage growth rates and few numbers of indications at SQN. Using the established methodology of RG 1.121, the structural limit is reduced by allowances for uncertainty and growth to develop a beginning of cycle (BOC) repair limit that would preclude indications at EOC conditions that exceed the structural limit. The nondestructive examination (NDE) uncertainty component is 20.5 percent, and is based on the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) alternate repair criteria (ARC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the few number of indications at SQN, the EPRI methodology of applying a growth component of 35 percent per effective full power year (EFPY) will be used. Near-term operating cycles at SQN are expected to be bounded by 1.23 years, therefore, a 43 percent growth component is appropriate. When these allowances are added to the BOC interim plugging criteria of 2.0 volts in a deterministic bounding EOC voltage of approximately 3.26 volts for Cycle 7, operation can be established. A 5.56-volt deterministic safety margin exists (8.82 structural limit_3.26-volt EOC equal 5.56-volt margin).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the voltage/burst correlation, the EOC structural limit is supported by a voltage of 8.82 volts. Using this structural limit of 8.82 volts, a BOC maximum allowable repair limit can be established using the guidance of RG 1.121. The BOC maximum allowable repair limit should not permit the existence of EOC indications that exceed the 8.82-volt structural limit. By adding NDE uncertainty allowances and an allowance for crack growth to the repair limit, the structural limit can be validated. Therefore, the maximum allowable BOC repair limit (RL) based on the structural limit of 8.82 volts can be represented by the expression:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> RL + (0.205 &times; RL) + (0.43 &times; RL) = 8.82 volts, or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> the maximum allowable BOC repair limit can be expressed as,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> RL = 8.82-volt structural limit/1.64 = 5.4 volts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is reasonable that this RL (5.4 volts) could be applied for interim plugging criteria (IPC) implementation to repair bobbin indications greater than 2.0 volts independent of rotating pancake coil (RPC) confirmation of the indication. Conservatively, an upper limit of 3.6 volts will be used to assess tube integrity for those bobbin indications that are above 2.0 volts but do not have confirming RPC calls. This 3.6-volt upper limit for nonconfirmed RPC calls is consistent with other recently approved IPC programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conservatism of the growth allowance used to develop the repair limit is shown by the most recent SQN eddy current data. Two tubes plugged in Unit 1 during the last outage had less than one volt of growth over the past five operating cycles. Only one tube in Unit 2 required repair because of outer-diameter stress corrosion (ODSCC) at the TSP intersections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously established that a postulated main SLB outside of containment, but upstream of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV), represents the most limiting radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the IPC, it will determine whether the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the end of Cycle 7 for Unit 2 is projected to be such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. A separate analysis has determined this allowable SLB leakage limit to be 4.3 gallons per minute (gpm) in the faulted loop. This limit uses the TS reactor coolant system (RCS) Iodine-131 activity level of 1.0 microcuries per gram dose equivalent Iodine-131 and the recommended Iodine-131 transient spiking values consistent with NUREG&hyph;0800. The projected SLB leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG&hyph;1477 is used to calculate EOC leakage. Because of the relatively low number of indications at SQN, it is expected that the actual leakage values will be far less than this limit. Additionally, the current Iodine-131 levels at SQN range from about 25 to 100 times less than the TS limit of 1.0.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of the criteria requires the projection of postulated SLB leakage, based on the projected EOC voltage distribution for Cycle 7. Projected EOC voltage distribution is developed using the most recent EOC eddy current results and a voltage measurement uncertainty. Data indicates that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would result in throughwall cracks long enough to leak at SLB condition. Draft NUREG&hyph;1477 requires that all indications to which the IPC are applied must be included in the voltage projection. Tube pull results from another plant with 7/8-inch tubing with a substantial voltage growth database have shown that tube wall degradation of greater than 40 percent throughwall was readily detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with the maximum throughwall penetration of 56 percent (42 average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded bobbin voltage from the EOC eddy current data. Based on the SQN pulled tube and industry pulled tube data supporting a lower threshold for SLB leakage of 2.8 volts, inclusion of all IPC intersections in the leakage model is quite conservative. The ODSCC occurring at SQN is in its earliest stages of development. The conservative bounding growth estimations to be applied to the expected small number of indications for the upcoming inspection should result in very small levels of predicted SLB leakage. Historically, SQN has not identified ODSCC as a contributor to operational leakage. The current leakage level at SQN is less than 1.0 gallon per day (gpd).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to assess the sensitivity of an indication's BOC voltage to EOC leakage potential, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed for a 2.0-volt BOC indication. The maximum EOC voltage (at 99.8 percent cumulative probability) was found to be 4.8 volts. Using NUREG&hyph;1477 and EPRI leakage models, the leakage component from an indication of this magnitude is 0.12 and 0.028 gpm, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as implementation of the 2.0-volt IPC criterion during Cycle 7 in Unit 2 does not adversely affect steam generator (S/G) tube integrity and implementation will be shown to result in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

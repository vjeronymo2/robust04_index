			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;960.5(a)(1) implements section 10(j)(2)(B) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, which provides that Bank members may use subsidized advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from the Banks to finance the purchase, construction, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of rental housing, at least 20 percent of the units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households for the remaining useful life of such housing or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortgage term. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(2)(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.5(a)(1) provides that the applicant and project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordability and income-targeting requirements. In addition, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant may commit to maintain additional units as affordable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for and occupied by low- or moderate-income households, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment shall be a minimum period of 30 years or, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Long-term requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``remaining useful life'' as used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). However, the legislative history of section 21A(c) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act regarding residential properties sold by the Resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trust Corporation (RTC), which was enacted as part of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation that enacted section 10(j), states that the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life of such RTC property is intended to cover the property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as long as it is habitable and assumes good faith efforts by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchaser to maintain the property and to rehabilitate it as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. See Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Conference, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101&hyph;222, 101st Cong., 1st  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sess., 419 (1989) (FIRREA Conference Report); 12 U.S.C. 1441a(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RTC has in fact adopted a specific uniform period of useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life for all buildings instead of a period of useful life based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical habitability. See 12 CFR 1609.2(kk). The legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history of a recently enacted affordable housing statute, the Low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Income Housing Preservation and Residential Homeownership Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (LIHPRHA), provides further support for a definition of ``remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life'' based on the period of physical habitability of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property by explicitly rejecting the RTC's regulatory definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, &sect;960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life'' as the period during which the housing remains in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repairs are made and major systems and capital components are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced or repaired as becomes necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``mortgage term'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history of section 10(j) states that the conferees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect that the Board will encourage the use of the longest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable mortgage term in order to aid in making the housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable for very low-income households. See FIRREA Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report at 431. Accordingly, the Board believes that ``mortgage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term'' should be defined as the mortgage term only of long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortgage loans and believes that 30 years is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' intent in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted rental housing projects remain occupied by and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable for income-eligible households for a long-term period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``very low-income household''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``very low-income household'' discussed above for AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing projects apply for AHP-assisted rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the definition of ``income,'' rental housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects typically have multiple providers of financing, each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may specify the eligible sources of income, which sometimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict with each other. However, as with AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing projects, the Board has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule should not specify the eligible sources of income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for rental housing projects, but rather that applicants should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to follow their usual underwriting guidelines, or may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow those of the predominant source of financing in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

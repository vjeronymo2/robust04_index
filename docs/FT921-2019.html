			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Short-term buyers boost dollar THE DOLLAR touched DM1.67 in late trading yesterday, mainly due to speculative buying by two major players, writes Neil Buckley. Traders said a south-east Asian central bank and a large Middle East operator were buying dollars, sending the currency up rapidly in otherwise thin market conditions. The US unit was generally slightly stronger, however, with some investors turning to the currency as a safe haven following a newspaper report that the US might be preparing to attack Iraq once more. The report said US military planners had given President George Bush a set of options for bombing Iraq, with the possibility of starting before the end of next week, if it does not comply with UN resolutions to destroy its weapons of mass destruction. Mr Steven Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'The market has been very thin, so a little rumour goes a long way.' He added that better US jobless claims figures (433,000 against 460,000 last week), Wednesday's Tan book from the Federal Reserve which saw a cautious economic recovery in the US, and a slightly lower January trade deficit of Dollars 5.77bn, were further good indicators for the dollar, but had had little effect on the market. The news that the Democrat Mr Paul Tsongas was to drop out of the US presidential race, leaving Mr Bill Clinton, of Arkansas, the most likely challenger to President Bush, also had little effect. 'It has been a jobbing day,' said one analyst. 'The market is very choppy. Speculators took the dollar down as far as it would go yesterday, and took it up to the top today.' The dollar closed at DM1.6697/05 after a DM1.6595/05 start and a DM1.6560/65 Asian close. Against the yen, it was at Y133.33/38, from Y132.70/80 and Y132.55/60. In New York it edged higher to end at DM1.6707 and Y133.57. In Tokyo, the dollar had remained slightly firmer against the yen and D-Mark, with traders saying this was mainly due to D-Mark/yen interest, with some dollar position adjustments before the three-day weekend in Tokyo. The market is closed today for a national holiday. The D-Mark lost ground against the French franc and lira after the Bundesbank failed to raise interest rates, in spite of some rumours that it might do so. The Italian currency has been under pressure ahead of next month's election, but yesterday it improved to L752.38/48 from an opening L752.90 to the D-Mark. Sterling was unaffected by mixed opinion polls and a big increase in the UK jobless figures, closing at DM2.8572/76 from a DM2.8550/57 start, and never moving outside this tight range. It stayed close to its effective floor against the peseta, at a 50 per cent swing below its central rate. Against the dollar, however, it fell more than 1 1/2 cents to Dollars 1.7120 from Dollars 1.7290, and in New York eased to Dollars 1.7111.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : A BRECHT-WEILL VETERAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles isn't exactly a major hub on the international opera circuit -- not  yet, anyway. So why is international opera star Julia Migenes living in Los  Angeles?  </P> <P> "This is where my children (from her previous marriage) were growing up," she  says, "and where I met my current husband," film director Peter Medak ("The  Ruling Class"). It's also not unwise, she suggests, to be close to the film  industry. She co-stars with Raul Julia in "Mack the Knife," Menahem Golan's new  movie adaptation of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The Threepenny Opera,"  which opens Feb. 2.  </P> <P> Her opera-on-film debut opposite Placido Domingo in Bizet's "Carmen," as well  as her rags-to-riches, New York streets-to-New York Met triumphs, first brought  Migenes to the world's attention. Brecht-Weill may seem a leap from Bizet, but  it's really a small hop for Migenes.  </P> <P> "Actually, I have 10 years of experience with Brecht-Weill," says the  singer-actress in her living room, proudly pointing to an award she received  for her 1988 recording of the duo's "The Seven Deadly Sins." Lotte Lenya, the  first great Brecht-Weill singer as well as Weill's widow, once came backstage  after a Migenes performance of "Mahagonny" and rewarded her with a rose.  </P> <P> "Carmen" occasionally beckons her -- she was to rejoin Domingo for a recent  production at an opera house deep in the Amazon but had to turn it down because  of scheduling conflicts. "I'm booked two years in advance, and, if the opera  world had its way, I'd be tied up for five years. But I refuse to do much  Broadway or opera while my kids are young. And Peter and I are never more than  two weeks apart from each other. There are good reasons for letting a marriage  fall apart," she says with a wink, "but uncoordinated travel plans isn't one of  them."  </P> <P> Migenes will soon be reunited with Medak for his film version of Jean Cocteau's  "The Human Voice." ("For once, I'm not playing a whore, a Gypsy or a maid. I'm  a normal woman.")  </P> <P> On the other hand, she enjoyed playing Jenny, a whore, to Julia's Mack the  Knife. "We have only two scenes together, but it was fun -- Menahem was very  jolly. He let us perform, which I like." ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

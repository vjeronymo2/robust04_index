			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A ministerial council was held this morning at  the Presidency and was chaired by Liamine Zeroual, head of  state. The meeting was attended by a number of ministers.    Following the meeting, the government's official spokesman  held a news conference in which he explained the issues on the  agenda of today's meeting. Here now follows the details of this  news conference:    [Begin unidentified official spokesman recording] In the  name  of God, the compassionate, and the merciful. The Council of  Ministers held a meeting today under the chairmanship of Mr.  Liamine Zeroual, head of state. [passage omitted]    On the national economy level, the head of state submitted a  report on the content of the letter of intent to the IMF that  the council adopted. It will be sent to the IMF director  general today. To this effect, the national economy minister  submitted a report on the situation of the national economy,  especially the issue of the management of foreign debts.  Following this report, it became clear that the method that has  been adopted to manage the foreign debt up until now was not  suitable, because it did not help the country break the vicious  circle that our national development was suffering from despite  all the debt repayments operations undertaken by us in an  organized way.    In addition to this, the current reduction of oil prices and  the international oil markets situation forced us into a  situation that gave the impression that we did not repay our  debts; this is because the income from our exports during the  year 1994 will not exceed more than $8 billion, whereas the debt  repayments will reach $9.3 billion.    In conclusion, the possibility of our country securing new  loans from the international market has become difficult because  our traditional creditors insist on linking link their financial  cooperation with us with the conclusion of an agreement between  our country and the IMF. We have been working for the  preparation of such an agreement with the IMF. Additionally, we  have begun preparing for negotiations that we will have with  Paris Club. In these negotiations we have adopted two  fundamental principles: To protect, as far as possible, the  scope of movement regarding the economic policy of our country;  to work, in particular, toward the preservation of the maximum  abilities to manage the social repercussions caused by the  reforms of the structural program, and make it acceptable to our  workers. To this end, the Council of Ministers adopted a number  of projects during today's meeting.    During his interventions at the council's meeting, the head  of state stressed the following directives:    To work toward the consolidation of the Maghreban march,  which for Algeria represents a strategic choice. To implement  the resolutions of the Algerian-Tunisian summit and to promote  and bolster relations between the two countries. At the  economic level, he stressed the need to use seriousness and  determination to manage and implement the program of  restructuring and bolstering the national economy.    To work for a fair distribution of the burden caused by the  economic restructuring operation among all social strata. The  head of state also underlined the priority enjoyed by the  following sectors: The hydrocarbons sector which should not  suffer from any delay regarding investment and prospecting  operations; the housing sector that represents a pressing social  priority and warrants fundamental reforms and great attention.  The farming sector: To better use fertile land, and to embark  on reforming new land. The sector of small and medium  enterprises: As it represent the main source for investments and  the creation of new jobs opportunities.    In the field of external trade and distribution, the head of  state stressed the need to cleanse this sector and to find an  immediate solution to the phenomenon of the shortage of basic  commodities in the markets, and to put a decisive end to the  smuggling operations via our borders that harm the resources of  the national economy.    In parallel with this program, and in order to achieve its  results, the head of state stressed the need to continue and  boost the structural reforms of the national economy and to work  for the liberation of all national initiatives. I thank you.  [end recording]</p>

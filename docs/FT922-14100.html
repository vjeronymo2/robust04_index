			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Christian Democrats accept Tory MEPs BRITAIN'S 32 Conservative Euro MPs were last night accepted into the European parliament's Christian Democrat group - which favours proportional representation. Their application to join was accepted by the Christian Democrats with a sizeable majority - 66 in favour and 28 against, with five abstentions. Dutch Christian Democrat Mr Tom Penders, who opposed having the Tories as allied members, said afterwards: 'That's it. They are de facto inside the group, and have accepted all the principles we stand for.' The move came amid reports that Mr John Major had signalled his willingness to consider accepting PR for elections to the European parliament in 1994.</p>

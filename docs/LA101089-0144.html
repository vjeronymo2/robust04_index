			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET TENNIS STAR FEELS 'HOMETOWN' PRESSURE  </P> <P> It was no ordinary first-round match for Natalia Zvereva. The 18-year-old from  Minsk carried the hopes and dreams of a tennis-starved nation.  </P> <P> "I can't remember being as nervous for a first-round match," Zvereva said today  after beating compatriot Aida Khalatyan 6-3, 6-0 in the first professional  tennis tournament in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "I badly want to win here. The pressure is intense."  </P> <P> Prolonged applause from a sparse first-day crowd of about 1,000 greeted the  entrance of Zvereva onto the court at Olympic Stadium.  </P> <P> Zvereva said she tried to treat it like any other match, but the occasion was  too unusual.  </P> <P> "If I had been told three years ago that in 1989 a professional tournament  would be staged here, I'd have been shocked," Zvereva said. "It took me awhile  to settle down. This was a wonderful feeling."  </P> <P> Zvereva, last year's French Open finalist and ranked 14th in the world, said  many of the other top players on the women's tour had expressed a desire to  play here.  </P> <P> "Martina (Navratilova) and Gabriela (Sabatini) both wished me luck and told me  how much they would love to come," Zvereva said. "I'm sure this event can get  even bigger. The public is hungry for tennis."  </P> <P> Zvereva is in a dispute with the Soviet tennis federation over how much prize  money she can keep. She declined to discuss the issue until the end of the  tournament.  </P> <P> In another first-round match, Jo-Anne Faull, the No. 8 seed from Australia, was  upset 6-1, 6-4 by Sabine Hack of West Germany.  </P> <P> Elsewhere today, Johan Anderson of Australia upset seventh-seeded American  Richard Matuszewski 6-2, 6-2 in a first-round match of the Australian Indoor  tennis championships at Sydney.  </P></p>

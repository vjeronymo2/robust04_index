			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: FTC agrees to Dollars 4bn Eli Lilly deal Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, has reached an outline agreement with the US's Federal Trade Commission which will allow it to go ahead with the planned Dollars 4bn acquisition of PCS, a pharmaceuticals distributor, writes Richard Waters in New York. The deal, full details of which have yet to be finalised, is expected to act as a model for how two other drugs companies - Merck and SmithKline Beecham  -operate similar drugs distributors that they have acquired in recent months. Lilly, while refusing to confirm that it had reached a provisional deal with the anti-trust authorities, said it believed a final agreement would be completed by next Thursday. This would open the way for completion of the PCS acquisition before the end of the year. The deal with the FTC is believed to require PCS to continue to offer drugs made by companies other than Lilly. It will also establish arrangements to prevent Lilly from gaining access to information about the prices at which other companies sell their drugs to PCS. Yesterday, Lilly sought to play down the significance of both aspects of the agreement. However, concern that the deal would limit its ability to earn the sort of profits it had hoped for from the PCS acquisition left the company's share price Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 60 yesterday. Merck said that it had also been asked for information during the FTC investigation into Lilly, though it refused to say whether the regulators were examining its dealings with Medco, its own distributor.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> NEW VACCINE METHOD FOUND  </P> <P> The bacteria that cause food poisoning can be altered to make improved vaccines  that may be able to ward off a wide variety of infections, perhaps including  AIDS, scientists reported.  </P> <P> To develop the new vaccines, Stanford University researchers genetically  modified the thin, corkscrew-shaped filaments or propellers, called flagella,  which the salmonella bacteria use to swim.  </P> <P> These flagella can be changed into vaccines to protect against infections for  which there are no current immunizations, the scientists reported recently in  the journal, Science. The method is an important step toward developing better  medications that program the body's immune system to recognize and prevent  disease.  </P> <P> One test vaccine stimulated an immune response to cholera toxin in mice, the  researchers found. In addition, other vaccines produced by the novel method  stimulated immune responses in mice, rabbits and guinea pigs to antigens --  proteins that stimulate antibody production -- of several disease-causing  microorganisms, including the AIDS virus, malaria parasite, hepatitis B virus  and a hemolytic streptococcus, which results in strep throat.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> $5-Million Sale: Irvine-based Laser Precision Corp., a maker of test and  measurement instruments, said it has tentatively agreed to sell its Analytical  Division to New Jersey-based Air &amp; Water Technologies Corp. for an  estimated $5 million.  </P> <P> The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 1991.  </P> <P> The final purchase price will be paid in cash and notes due within three years,  and is subject to due diligence, including confirmation of the value of certain  assets.  </P> <P> The Laser Precision division, also known as Analect Instruments, makes  laboratory equipment based on infrared light technology, said spokesman Neil G.  Berkman. The unit accounted for $6.5 million of the company's $26 million in  sales in 1989.  </P> <P> The sale is not expected to have any impact on the division's 72 employees,  said James Johnson, general manager of the unit.  </P> <P> Laser Precision now plans to focus on its fiber-optic and light-sensitive  instrument technology, which is based in Utica, N.Y. Proceeds from the sale  will be used to develop new products and expand international marketing for the  remaining divisions.  </P> <P> Air &amp; Water Technologies Corp., based in Branchburg, N.J., provides a broad  range of environmental services for air-pollution control, water-resources  management, and the disposal and recycling of waste. The company also has an  environmental products division in Irvine with about 100 employees.  </P> <P> For the second quarter ended June 30, Laser Precision reported net income of  $111,000, down from $264,000 a year earlier.

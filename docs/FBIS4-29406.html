			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea's nuclear issue, which had entered a  confrontational stage because of North Korea's withdrawal from  the International Atomic Energy Agency, seems to face a new  phase with the talks between former U.S. President Carter and  North Korean President Kim Il-song.    This morning, the government held a Unification-National  Security Coordination Council meeting during which it fine-tuned  its position not to oppose the third round of talks between the  United States and the North if North Korea's new conciliatory  gesture, including its policy of allowing inspectors to remain  in the DPRK--revealed by former U.S. President Carter now on a  visit to the North--turns out to be true.    However, if the U.S. Clinton administration focuses on  having  North Korea freeze its nuclear development plan, it will be  difficult to guarantee the transparency of its past nuclear  suspicion. On the basis of this judgment, the government decided  to convey to the U.S. side its firm position on this point.    The government also decided to fine-tune its final position  after President Kim Yong-sam is briefed on the result of former  President Carter's visit to the North, who will return to Seoul  through Panmunjom tomorrow.</p>

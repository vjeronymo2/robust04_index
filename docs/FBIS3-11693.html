Unyielding in their expectations of  abolishment of the salary increases, the military leaders  already have, among various alternatives for the possible  outcome of the current crisis, a declaration of a state of  national defense as a strategy to move up the call for general  elections.    A general who has free access within the Armed Forces and  Planalto Palace told O GLOBO on 22 March: "As (Army) Minister  Zenildo de Lucena has told President Itamar Franco, it is a  moral problem. The Army cannot retreat."    The military leaders already have proposals for  constitutional alternatives that they would raise after the  declaration of a state of defense, moving up the elections.  They are betting on Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso's advantage since he would attract all anti-Lula (PT --  Workers Party --presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva) forces. The alternatives and their possible outcome will  be discussed during an Army High Command meeting scheduled for  24 and 25 March in the Brasilia headquarters.    A military minister said: "The military has the  constitutional duty of guaranteeing order and harmony among the  branches of government. This harmony has been broken with a  decision made by the Judicial and Legislative Branches to grant  themselves salary increases."    According to the assessment made by the military commanders,  there is no possible solution to the impasse among the branches  of government without producing trauma for the administration.  The military commanders do not consider the possibility that  the STF might retract and abolish the 10.9-percent increase  granted to the Judicial Branch because this "would involve  pleading guilty." The military commanders caution that even if  Franco eventually decides to make the Executive Branch's  position more flexible, a retreat would not be possible because  it would demoralize the president of the Republic.    The minister noted: "The president has taken an irrevocable  stance. If he retreats, it would weaken the government."    The president's irrevocable stance, expressed in a note  released after a tense ministerial meeting on 18 March, was  challenged by some of the ministers present at the meeting. In  the opinion of these ministers, the note should leave some room  for possible negotiation with the STF. It was Franco himself,  encouraged by the military leaders' indignation over the salary  increases for the Legislative and Judicial Branches, who decided  on the communique's radical overtones.    The source said: "He also could not run the risk of calling  for negotiations and being defeated."    Among the options reviewed by the military leaders, there  was  the possibility of appealing to the STF itself for its decision  because the salary increase was granted at the administrative  level. The military leaders, however, thought there was a risk  of the Executive Branch being defeated since the action's  judgment would be passed by the same (STF) justices who  unanimously approved the salary increase.    Another military adviser said: "The judges are making an  attempt to transform the criticism of the decision that they  made into criticism of the supreme institution. It is like  attempting to involve the Armed Forces in criticism of a  decision eventually made by the military ministers."    The military leaders believe they have society's support for  an eventual intervention if there is no political solution to  the impasse. And, from any angle, the solution depends on the  STF's retreat alone. Concerning the Legislative Branch, the  military ministers' expectations are that the decision to  increase the salaries will be abolished.    The general noted: "The military never anticipates what  society wants. Those who dared to do this failed."    With much caution, the possibility of an intervention is  under discussion in the barracks. It is not compared, however,  with the 1964 military coup that deposed President Joao Goulart  and installed an ad hoc government in our country. The  intervention currently under review would reportedly be aimed at  restoring harmony among the branches of government. In the  military leaders' interpretation, this represents removing the  salary increases for the Judicial and Legislative Branches.    A late attempt at negotiating with the Executive Branch was  unsuccessfully made on the afternoon of 21 March when Edson  Vidigal, a Superior Court of Justice (STJ) justice (appointed by  former President Jose Sarney), played the role of a Judicial  Branch envoy to convince the Executive Branch of the lawfulness  of the STF's decision.    A military source explained: "This mission might have  succeeded in initiating negotiations if it had been carried out  last week before the government's and the STF's radicalization.  Now it is too late."    The military ministers still are expecting an unmistakable  position by Minister Fernando Henrique, whom they guaranteed  their support for the economic program's approval.    A usual Army interlocutor claimed: "The minister spent five  days out of town and still has not taken a clear position."    Among the Armed Forces, the Navy is the most indignant over  the decisions made by the Legislative and Judicial Branches.  Despite being more cautious, the Army is no less indignant.  Minister Zenildo de Lucena often has guaranteed that the  democratic system is not in jeopardy and that any solution will  be determined by the Constitution.</p>

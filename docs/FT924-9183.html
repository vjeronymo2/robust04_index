			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Paramount names head of film arm PARAMOUNT Pictures moved quickly to name a new studio head to replace Mr Brandon Tartikoff, who resigned last week citing family obligations. Ms Sherry Lansing, the best known woman in Hollywood film-making, was appointed to the newly-created position of chairman of the Paramount's motion picture group. The 48-year-old Ms Lansing first made her name in the early 1980s when she served for three years as president of production at 20th Century Fox. Before that she had been a senior vice-president at Columbia Pictures. Paramount said the appointment of Ms Lansing reflected a structural change in the Paramount Pictures organisation. Mr Tartikoff had headed both film and television activities. But the company has now named Mr Kerry McCluggage as head of the television division. Both he and Ms Lansing will report to Mr Stanley Jaffe, who is president and chief operating officer of Paramount Communications, the parent company. Mr Jaffe is an old friend and business partner of Ms Lansing's. Until he joined Paramount in March 1991, he and Ms Lansing had a joint film production deal with Paramount called Jaffe/Lansing Productions. Elton John, the British-born pop star, has signed a publishing contract estimated at Dollars 39m with Warner-Chappell Music, a division of Time Warner. The 12-year deal includes the rights to all songs written since 1974 by Elton John and Mr Bernie Taupin, his collaborator, plus songs from the next six albums.</p>

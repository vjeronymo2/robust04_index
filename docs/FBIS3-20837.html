			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Biserka Dumic: "Loans Only for `Sound' Programs"] </F>   [Text] The dinar has gotten to its feet, and now the second  phase can begin -- invigoration of production -- which is the  foundation of the stabilization program, Dr. Dragoslav  Avramovic, professor, said recently. How many loans have the  banks granted to a dead industry since introduction of the  Avram, what problems are they encountering, and is there a  chance of the "rusty wheel" starting up and gathering speed in  the foreseeable future?    Under the new market-oriented conditions, one gets the  impression, the banks are ready to extend loans exclusively to  sound production. Production which will yield an assured profit,  and they have no intention of using their money to revive  losers. Meanwhile, the big question is how many producers will  manage to obtain enough credit to get their machines going and  at the same time sell their products.    For Zastava alone, one of our largest factories, for  instance, it will take bank support amounting to at least 3  million German marks or new dinars per month, and that  represents between 30 and 40 million super dinars annually. From  what certain daily newspapers are writing, the announcements now  coming from that giant are that this month "there will be  nothing" coming from the assembly line for precisely that reason.  <H5>  A Real Rate of Interest at Last </H5>   Unfortunately, there are quite a few giants like that in the  country. Factories at Rakovica in Belgrade are waiting for loans  like a thirsty man waiting for water, but even if they get them,  the question is who they will sell the tractors and other  machinery to, so that they can repay the money. They cannot  export them abroad, at least for the present, and the peasants  are holding onto their money in order to buy petroleum products,  seed, fertilizer....    To invigorate production in the large factories, there is no  doubt, the government and the banks will need a great deal more  money than they themselves have at this moment, and it is  uncertain when the sanctions will be removed and when we will  again get foreign loans. Nevertheless, commercial banks here  have already begun to invest money in production. This is not  enough for a beginning, but things have nevertheless begun to  move.    Since early January the mixed PKB [Beograd Agroindustrial  Combine] Bank has loaned about 9,000 billion old dinars and more  than 700,000 new dinars to support production. Seventy percent  of that credit was invested in agriculture, and the bank mainly  enters into joint investments with creditors.    Nenad Urosevic, general director of the PKB Bank, who  mentioned first of all that the banks must operate on a profit  basis, but an honest profit, also says that a real rate of  interest has finally been introduced for the first time and must  be at least 0.1 percent above the rise of retail prices.  Otherwise it is inflationary.    "It is not true that the banks are obstructing the program.  So far the producers have been putting up for sale goods from  inventory only to the extent that they could market them. Now  they must count on a real rate of interest, since otherwise the  program will not succeed," Mr. Urosevic warned.    He added that people are not coming to the bank for credit,  but for a loan. The bank in turn is seeking security in the form  of collateral, and it wants repayment of the principal and  interest within the period called for in the contract. When  things are set up like that, no one will be operating at a loss,  and there will not be any inflation.  <H5>  All Credits Are Short-Term </H5>   Union Bank has also begun to furnish credit to its  customers,  agricultural producers, although sizeable applications for  credits are expected only in the months to come, when planting  begins.    According to Milan Aleksic, director of funds and loans,  730,000 dinars have so far been invested in the fattening of  baby beef, production of equipment for the food manufacturers,  and the purchase of production supplies. Another 200,000 dinars  have been supplied to agriculture through interbank credits,  that is, not directly, and applications are being examined for  600,000 dinars in credit to finance the fattening of hogs, but  also about half a million dinars for other types of production  (wood manufacturing), and about 150,000 for fruit. In addition  to all that, this bank is also furnishing customers guarantees  so that they can import production supplies.    "All the credits are short-term, for one month with the  option of extension at an interest rate margin of 1-4 percent  per annum. The price of our capital is perhaps high, since bank  costs are immense," Mr. Aleksic said, adding that producers,  those who have taken credits, have not complained about the  rates of interest, since they have the kind of production that  will bring a profit.    From 24 January to 1 March Agrobanka approved about  4,300,000  dinars for spring farmwork, and more than 2,000,000 have been  used. Slightly more than 3,000,000 dinars in credit have been  granted to animal husbandry, of which about 2,500,000 dinars  have been used. All in all, this bank has supplied about  7,300,000 dinars in credit, and between 80 and 95 percent of  this was for agriculture.  <H5>  The Forgotten Cooperatives </H5>   "The amount of credit approved is far less than agriculture  needs," says Stanko Bugarcic, assistant director of the  dinar-loan sector of Agrobanka. Nevertheless, this bank expects  to be able to furnish about 25,000,000 dinars for spring  farmwork. Interest rates have been set at two levels: 12 percent  for primary production and 14 percent for other production.  Asked whether these are real rates of interest, Mr. Bugarcic  replied: "They are high for the borrowers, but for us they are  low, in view of the situation the bank is in, since capital has  melted away."    The decision on mandatory guidance of bank loans (published  in SLUZBENI LIST [OFFICIAL GAZETTE] on 15 February), which  prescribes how the banks are to behave, calls for credits to be  committed to production, but nowhere were the agricultural  cooperatives mentioned. "We went to the NBJ [National Bank of  Yugoslavia] and demanded that the cooperatives be treated like  any other production firm, since between 80 and 95 percent of  agriculture is based on the agricultural cooperatives," Mr.  Bugarcic said.    Vojvodjanska Banka has also begun to grant credits in new  dinars, mainly for agriculture. So far, according to Mirko  Tisma, deputy general director of the main headquarters in  Belgrade, more than 10,000,000 dinars have been invested in food  production.    All in all, the commercial banks are ready to invest sound  capital only in sound projects. The time of primary note issue  is behind us, and therefore so is the credit financing of firms  so that they can meet their payrolls.</p>

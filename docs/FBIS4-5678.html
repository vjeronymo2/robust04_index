			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A seven-member panel began  work Monday [11 April] to delimit 300 new single-seat districts  in general elections for the House of Representatives,  government officials said.    The panel, headed by Tadao Ichikawa, former president of  Keio  University, will file a report on its work in six months, they  said.    The government will submit a bill based on the panel's  report  and the Diet is expected to enact the bill in an extraordinary  session this fall, the officials said.    The launching of the council followed the enactment earlier  this year of a package of political reform bills which introduce  single- seat constituencies for lower house general elections.    Under the package, 300 of the 500 lower house members will  be  elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through  proportional representation.    The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected  last July from constituencies with the number of seats ranging  from two to six each.</p>

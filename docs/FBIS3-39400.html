			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostakis Andoniou] </F>   [Text] Reliable political circles estimate that the Turks  will wreck the talks on the confidence-building measures for the  following three basic reasons:    1. Turkey does not want a solution, nor has it made the  political decision to proceed with serious dialogue that would  facilitate the promotion of the issue. Consequently, an  agreement on the confidence-building measures would force the  Turkish side to proceed with other steps as well, which would  lead to the achievement of an agreement that is not in Ankara's  plans at this time.    2. [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas believes that the  only concession he will make for an overall solution of the  Cyprus issue is to turn over Varosha. It is the last card he  will play in order to "end the game." However, from the moment  he offers this card before the achievement of a final solution,  he will be forced to negotiate and give up other parts  throughout the process of the talks.    3. The opening of the Nicosia Airport will automatically  deprive him of any argument to ask for recognition of the  illegal airport in Tymbou and the special FIR.    These appraisals come from reliable political circles and  cause great pessimism within the government, which does not  expect progress in the talks on the confidence-building measures.    The same circles also stressed that according to our  experts'  assessment, the problem for our side is not the operation of  Nicosia Airport and the arrangements that will be agreed upon,  but the issue of Varosha. Specifically, there are reservations  about the fact that if there is no withdrawal of the Turkish  troops from the "passage" to Dherinia, there will be no way out  for those who return.    Despite the practical difficulties and the certainty that  the  Turkish side will wreck the confidence-building measures in the  end, the same political circles stressed that: The Greek  Cypriot side could not refuse participation in the talks because  its refusal would actually destroy any further deliberation  process on the Cyprus issue. It would also slam the door on  deliberations for the promotion of Cyprus' access to the  European Union.</p>

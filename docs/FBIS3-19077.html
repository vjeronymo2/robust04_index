Assistant chairman of DEP, Kemal Bilget announced his  party's  assembly decisions in a press conference here today.    The statement said that DEP was ready to do whatever it  could  in accomplishing democracy, peace and brotherhood, despite the  fact that the state has removed the immunity of six of their  deputies.    "The party assembly, which has decided to take the necessary  legal actions to celebrate Nevroz in some parts of the country,  will spend all efforts to have the celebrations in a peaceful  manner and free of bloodshed," the announcement said.    Bilget told journalists that his party was not, in fact,  calling on the people to boycott the local polls.    "This is not a boycott but a wish" he said, adding that on  March 27, he will stay in his home.    He added that his party was evaluating the option of  celebrating Nevroz in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Izmit, Bursa,  Mersin, Adana and Gaziantep, rather than the emergency rule  regions.    He added that his party members will be in their electoral  districts during Nevroz and large numbers of delegations from  foreign countries will also go to the southeastern region during  the Nevroz.    Meanwhile, the Anatolian News Agency learned that DEP  members  Remzi Kartal and Sedat Yurtdas flew to Brussels today to take  part in a Kurdish conference.</p>

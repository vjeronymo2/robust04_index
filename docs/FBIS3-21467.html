			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoubir Ferroukhi: "No Gasoline, No </F> Newspapers?"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] Service station operators and workers at the  downtown printing press are threatening to go on strike. Do  labor tensions really need ratcheting up another notch?    It is very possible our readers will not find their  newspaper  in the kiosks this Tuesday, and no one knows how long the strike  at SIA [Algiers Printing Company], which prints LIBERTE and  other dailies, will last. Beginning tonight at midnight,  service-station franchise operators are also going to shut down  for a week, and smart motorists will fill up their tanks before  noon. First no gasoline, now no newspapers, unless something can  be worked out today. In short, the labor situation is  deteriorating, if not quite yet calamitous.    The issue at SIA is not really new. The bone of contention  is  implementation of a new wage schedule approved by the company's  board of directors but apparently blocked by high-level  intervention, probably by the Labor Ministry. SIA's management  is trying to work things out, but the SIA union local is  determined to follow through on its threat to strike, which it  temporarily suspended on 16 February. The accord reached by  labor and management was reviewed by the ministry on 17 January  and seemed well on its way to implementation, since it took into  account among other things the financial condition of the  enterprise (which was good) and the sound measures enacted by  SIA management. Unless the authorities concerned take dramatic  action, the presses may quit rolling, as of tomorrow.    The other dispute, involving service-station franchise  operators, actually erupted several months ago. It hinges  basically on the low-profit margins forced on them by current  fuel prices. The franchise operators, affiliates of the National  Union of Merchants (UGCAA), are incensed not only at the refusal  of the relevant authorities--in this instance, NAFTAL [National  Enterprise for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products]--to  seriously discuss the issue, but also concerned about a much  more fundamental problem. The operators have long demanded the  right to run their businesses freely to maximize profit,  something NAFTAL does not want to hear.    An employers' organization, the CNPA [National Confederation  of Algerian Patronat], has just thrown its support to the  strike, which could seriously inflame labor tensions already  aggravated by the unprecedented high cost of living.    Labor tension can also be found in other sectors. Our  colleagues in the Photographic Agency (API), who have not been  paid in months, yesterday went on an indefinite hunger strike,  imploring the tutelary ministry to pay some attention to their  plight and that of their families. Finally, talks have broken  down between labor and management at the state-owned Major  Petroleum Projects Enterprise (GTP). A meeting scheduled for  today is expected to determine whether the strike will be  postponed, or possibly canceled if the essential demands of  workers in this important oil company are met.    The basic thread that runs through all these conflicts is  always the same--to wit, that people are no longer as easily  bought off with "promises" as they were in the bygone era of the  one-party state. Even more important, the terms "dialogue" and  "concertation" have become so debased that they now sound hollow  and no longer seem to mean anything to the decisionmakers. It is  a pity!  <H5>  Franchise Operators </H5>   Tomorrow's service-station strike, announced Saturday by the  General Union of Algerian Merchants and Artisans (UGCAA), will  not be observed by service-station franchise operators, Mr. Omar  Gaya, president of the Association of Service Station Franchise  Operators, told APS.    "In principle, we are not against the strike," said Mr.  Gaya,  noting however that, "this is hardly the time to launch such a  strike" before adding that, "we have not been involved in this  decision to stage a 7-day strike."</p>

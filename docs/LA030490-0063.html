			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> BUDGET BLADE POISED AGAIN TO SLICE ARTS FUNDING;  </P> <P> PRIORITIES: GOVERNMENT HELP ALLOWS THE ARTS TO TAKE THOSE RISKS THAT MAKE THEM  WORTHY OF BACKING AND FREE THEM FROM THE PLUTOCRATIC DEPENDENCY THAT MAKES THEM  ELITIST.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council faces some hard budget choices: raise taxes or cut  programs. Like clockwork when it comes time to consider the budget, money for  the arts gets offered as a sacrificial lamb.  </P> <P> Under the most current proposal, suggested by Councilman Ron Roberts, $4.3  million would be taken from art and tourist promotion to fund other needs, and,  under the city manager's worst-case scenario, if no new taxes or fees are  enacted, $12 million could be diverted. Either scenario, or any other that  takes money away from the arts, would be a mistake.  </P> <P> It would also violate the spirit of the transient occupancy tax (a hotel room  tax) increase two years ago. The arts community and tourist industry supported  the increase only after a promise that the extra revenue would go to art and  tourism. These proposals would raid the TOT funds for use in the general pot.  </P> <P> After the mayor's "year of the arts" and the hoopla of the Soviet arts  festival, public support of the arts in San Diego appears to be sinking into  oblivion. Even the existence of the infant, but effective, Commission for Arts  and Culture is in question.  </P> <P> The arts are obviously vulnerable and considered a frill in our city. The  reasons for this have to do with a lack of basic education in the arts, our  youthful society's relatively short history of supporting the arts, and the  inability of artists and arts institutions to make a convincing case for public  support.  </P> <P> Arts organizations have not demonstrated their strength. Their patrons are  numerous. (Surprisingly, nationally, more people attend arts events than  sporting events). Furthermore, arts patrons are influential because they are  voters, contributors and very vocal if enlisted in a cause.  </P> <P> But why are no petitions to our City Council seen in every museum, theater  lobby or concert hall? And why can't San Diego artists do what has been done  elsewhere: stop all performances for 10 minutes and say to audiences, "See,  this is what life would be without art. Write your council member."  </P> <P> The gravest mistake that artists and art institutions make is to play the game  by the other team's rules. They make their case in terms of marketplace values,  even though the real worth of the arts to society is that they represent values  other than those of the marketplace.  </P> <P> It is true that the arts spark economic development. They pay out huge sums to  many businesses and services. Yes, the arts do make San Diego more desirable as  a home for corporations and make recruiting easier for those businesses that  are here.  </P> <P> It is evident that the arts increase the appeal of San Diego as a tourist  destination. And, as San Diegans travel around the country, they find that the  positive image of our city is bolstered by our vibrant and growing art scene.  </P> <P> The arts can also show why they need government money. While productivity in  industry increases and it takes less time to produce goods, the arts are labor  intensive and their costs continue to rise in relationship to the general  economy.  </P> <P> It can be shown that the real subsidy of the arts comes from the artists  themselves. Their incomes are a disgrace in a civilized society. That we have  art at all is due to our artists' sacrifices and generosity.  </P> <P> Although all of these reasons, and many others, are true, they are economic and  soulless. Happily, society does not measure all of its institutions with a  monetary yardstick. If it did, Mission Bay park would be sold to developers of  condos, all libraries would rent out books, and our schools would be private,  paid for only by those who use them.  </P> <P> The arts have greater difficulty making a case for continuing public support.  Maybe it is because the public understands that parks, libraries and schools  nourish us spiritually, mentally or physically, but it sees the arts only as  entertainment.  </P> <P> Maybe it is because the public sees parks, libraries and schools as egalitarian  institutions but believes the arts are elitist, reserved for the wealthy.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the public perception of the arts is partly true, because some  people in the arts community believe that to survive in the present precarious  financial climate, they must offer mere entertainment and cater to an elite  audience.  </P> <P> Martin Benson, director of the excellent and financially successful South Coast  Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa, said, "We once tried to cater to the tastes of  our audience and found that their taste fell faster than we could cater to it."  </P> <P> Certainly, the arts are partly to blame for their problems. Too often control  is vested in boards made up of wealthy donors, and too seldom are risks taken  to lead rather than follow public taste. But before any council members use  this criticism of the arts to deny funding, they should examine the parallels  between arts' predicament and their own political situation.  </P> <P> The rising costs of election campaigning has created the public perception that  rich campaign contributors have a growing and unfair influence with elected  officials.  </P> <P> It is also believed that council members are not taking those difficult  leadership risks they were elected to take. By submitting controversial issues  to the voters as referendums, they are not doing the job they are paid to do.  </P> <P> In both the arts and politics, a momentary loss of courage and an unhealthy  dependence on fat-cat donors does not mean scrapping the institutions. As  politicians look for alternate ways to finance campaigns, the arts look to  government support to fulfill their mission.  </P> <P> The paradox is that more government support will allow the arts to take those  risks that make them worthy of support and free them from the plutocratic  dependency that makes them elitist. Less government support will drive them  further from their mission of delivering messages of importance to our whole  society.  </P> <P> The arts' mission deserves public support. It is to complete the mosaic of our  civil life with a tolerant forum for ideas, emotions, institutions and insights  that are available in no other way.  </P> <P> When seeking physical well-being, we are told "no pain, no gain." The same is  true of our aesthetic well-being. Our citizens must be aware that support of  art is not a risk-free enterprise. In a time of profound worldwide changes,  artists are affected by what is happening and will explore concepts that some  of us may not want to think about. They may speak to us of our sexuality, of  how we treat one another, of the failures of our system of government or of the  greed in our market economy.  </P> <P> A time of great change brings great fears. But we must learn to be brave enough  to listen to our artists. As playwright David Mamet says, "The artist is the  advance explorer of the societal consciousness. As such, many times his first  reports are disbelieved."  </P> <P> The value of art to society is that it opens our minds to new perceptions,  unthought-of possibilities, and prepares us emotionally for what we will  eventually understand rationally. Art asks us questions and leads us to wonder,  amazement and growth.  </P> <P> These are the valuable gifts the arts can give to San Diego. They go far beyond  the economic advantages we usually hear about. They are priceless.  </P> <P> The arts-funding problem is particularly critical in San Diego. We are an  adolescent city moving toward adulthood, making life decisions, forming a  character that will define our civic personality for generations to come. Will  we be the largest bubble-headed resort town on the West Coast? Or, as a mature  city, will we be a metropolis where the geographical beauty is matched by the  strength of our culture?  </P> <P> That future is being decided now by our City Council.  </P></p>

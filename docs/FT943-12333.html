			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Cost cutter - Legal Briefs London law firm McKenna &amp; Co has launched its specialist solicitor advocacy services for planning inquiries and disputes. Under this service, a solicitor, rather than a barrister, appears as advocate. The firm claims this results in savings of 30 per cent of the cost of instructing both a solicitor and barrister. The move, according to the firm, is in response to client demand.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Zimbabwe importing maize to beat famine Zimbabwe, crippled by the most serious drought in living memory, said yesterday it plans to import up to 2m tonnes of maize to avert mass starvation, Reuter reports from Harare. Mr Cephas Msipa, chairman of the Grain Marketing Board, said his board expected farmers to deliver 250,000 tonnes of maize to the national granaries in the current agricultural season, a quarter of the average figure. Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero told a donors' meeting in Paris this week that Zimbabwe needed Dollars 430m (Pounds 245.7m) to help it overcome the drought, which has killed thousands of livestock and threatens millions of people with starvation.</p>

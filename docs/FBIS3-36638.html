			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Sergey </F> Chernykh: "Moscow-Tbilisi: Friendship Demands Sacrifices"]    [Text] Tbilisi-Moscow -- The interstate Treaty on  Friendship and Cooperation has been signed. However, there were  no happy faces or celebratory salvos fired.    It became clear prior to the Tbilisi summit that no one  wanted the upcoming signing except the heads of state. The  State Duma came out against it -- deputies feared that the  treaty would exacerbate the situation in the North Caucasus and  provoke another demarche by the Confederation of Caucasus  Peoples, which takes all the rebellious regions of Georgia under  its wing.    The Russian Government sighed deeply and got ready to grant  further unsecured credits.    Russian servicemen, who were about to quit finally this  restless region where they had suffered so much strife and  humiliation, are unpacking their bags.    The signing of the treaty is seen in Georgia as solely a  forced measure. The country's impoverishment has gone beyond  all conceivable bounds. People fainting from hunger in the  center of Tbilisi are an everyday occurrence. There have been  three full-blown wars, leaving aside strikes, blockades, and  political and economic crisis. The hopes of integration within  the world community were dashed almost simultaneously with the  fall of Sukhumi. In these conditions you have to grasp any hand  that is extended. So the signing of the treaty by Georgia is  not so much a gesture of goodwill as a "recognition of  necessity."    There is no doubt that the Georgian radical dissidents  Chanturiya and Tsereteli will soon start fighting again for the  independence of the republic, as in the seventies.    The local mafia, which has been furiously printing coupons,  by no means all of which have been sold, has also had its nose  put out of joint.    The Georgian parliament is well aware of the political  failure: The country's economy will be revived through Russian  money, Russia will set up the Georgian Armed Forces, and Moscow  specialists will settle the sovereign state's internal problems.  Not for nothing does the old proverb run: "Whoever controls  Tbilisi controls the Caucasus." Roughly the same situation is  emerging as in the 19th century, and Georgia is acquiring  roughly the same status.    The Russian president's visit to Georgia is perhaps  comparable only to the arrival of Czar Nicholas II at the  beginning of the century. A state of emergency was declared in  Tbilisi: The streets, particularly the airport road, were  repaired as much as possible, while bread and even other food  appeared in stores.    As already reported, Georgian Deputy Defense Minister  Nikolay  Kekelidze, who was in charge of armaments and tehnical supply in  the military department, was killed by an explosion in his own  apartment on the actual day of the visit. He kept a small stock  of weapons and munitions in his own apartment in the center of  Tbilisi. Arriving at the scene of the incident at 1300 hours,  Defense Minister Gorgiy Karkarashvili was almost killed himself,  sustaining contusions of medium severity -- also from a bomb  blast.    To protect themselves against such "coincidences" the  Russian  side took complete control of the airport and all the places  visited by the Russian president. The high ground overlooking  the airport was occupied by Russian assault troops while the sky  was patrolled by fighters. Changes were made to the Russian  president's security system: Soldiers on compulsory service  were enlisted for the first time for such an important matter.  They were mustered from all sorts of special subunits of the  Army and Internal Troops. Their function was to provide  external protection for the delegation. This was previously  done by "Alfa." This time there were only a few men from "Alfa"  present.</p>

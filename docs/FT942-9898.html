			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Top Treasury job for plain speaker A Whitehall reshuffle has resulted in the promotion of one of the Treasury's least conventional senior officials to take charge of public expenditure. Downing Street announced yesterday that Mr Robert Culpin, 47, would become second permanent secretary, public expenditure, on June 1. He succeeds Mr Andrew Turnbull, 49, who will leave the Treasury to become permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment. Mr Culpin is a no-nonsense official who speaks his mind. Apart from a spell with the UK delegation to the European Community in the early 1970s, he has been at the Treasury for his entire working life since 1968. A tall man, with a fondness for brown brogues, one newspaper once described him as looking more like a biblical prophet than a typical mandarin. In his memoirs Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, says Mr Culpin had 'the most luxuriant beard in a generally clean-shaven Treasury'. Mr Culpin was promoted to be director of fiscal and monetary policy last year after heading the Treasury's fiscal policy group from 1987. Between 1984 and 1987 he was press secretary to the then Mr Nigel Lawson and one of a select group of officials in the Treasury with whom the former chancellor would exchange and discuss economic ideas. In his book, Lord Lawson recalls that Mr Culpin was 'a controversial appointment' as press secretary. 'He claimed that until I offered him the job he had never the slightest desire to read the newspapers.' The Treasury announced that Mr Chris Kelly, 47, would take over from Mr Culpin as director of fiscal and monetary policy. Mr Kelly is head of the general expenditure policy group.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Case for ITV rules change 'flawed' Sir, Central Television's chairman, Leslie Hill, says he thinks those pressing for changes to the ITV ownership rules have won the commercial argument (UK Company News, September 30). Not so. The fact is that the amazing array of ever-changing 'commercial' arguments put forward by those pushing for change has been found to be hopelessly flawed. Their logic has been questioned by the City, politicians from all parties, the regulator in the shape of the Independent Television Commission, and many others. Mr Hill refers to the 'commercial logic' of these arguments. They are anything but logical. Try this one for size: 'Only by joining together can ITV defend itself from foreign takeover.' Yet, allowing ITV to group into two or three companies would actually make it easier for foreign predators to take over ITV. Where's the logic in that one] We have also been told of the 'commercial logic' of the imaginary Pounds 100m savings through takeover and of the four-companies-could-run-ITV-better-than-15 routine. And, finally, there is the cry that ITV will go broke in the face of competition from satellite, in flat contradiction to the relatively optimistic tone of recent reports from the boards of individual licensees. There is now a clear majority of ITV companies rejecting ownership rule changes. Each company has a board of directors responsible to its shareholders, and we at HTV certainly do not accept that the commercial argument has been won. Quite the opposite. Despite the fact that the burden of proof should fall on those who seek to change the existing regulations, the arguments in favour of change are weak and superficial  - but potentially dangerous in their consequences.

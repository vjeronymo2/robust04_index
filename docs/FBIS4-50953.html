			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth in series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F> Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342  7160): "Female and Juvenile Prisoners"]    [Text] Beijing 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--On the  platform a female inmate was reciting a poem entitled "A Lost  Dream," pleading with her mother to forgive her past behavior.  In the audience, tears ran down the faces of all the female  inmates in their gray prison uniforms; were they repenting their  pasts? Or were they expressing a shameful feeling toward their  kin?    This was the scene during an art performance for the female  inmates in Shandong's Weibei Prison, whose ages ranged from 18  to 65. They were put here to accept transformation for crimes  of theft, murder, embezzlement, and sex offenses.    "The way of the world is made dangerous by human desires,  which make quite a few people go awry and ruin their lives."  The female inmates are categorized into those desiring material  goods, those desiring sex, and violent types. Most of them have  committed crimes because of the stimulation of such factors as  marriage, family, and love, and could only come to their senses  when they were put into prison. However, they are then liable  to sink into degradation. In transforming female inmates, it is  precisely necessary to awaken their consciences, which have not  been lost in their entirety, while guiding them to bear maternal  and social responsibilities.    Liu Xiulian, who is 32 years old, was given a life sentence  for murder because she was disappointed in a love affair 10  years previously. When she was first put into prison, she was  in utter despair. With the persuasion of a prison warder, she  taught herself the skill of tailoring and became a garment  designer in prison. Because of her outstanding performance, she  was granted a commutation of her sentence to 16 years  imprisonment. Later, she was again granted a commutation of her  punishment and released. However, she was determined to train a  few apprentices before leaving as an appreciation for the  education by the prison authorities.    In her briefings, female ward deputy instructor Wei Huiying  of Weibei Prison said that most female inmates are narrow-minded  with very strong inferiority complexes and suicidal by  inclination. The administration and education call for  well-organized meticulousness to help substitute their negative,  world-weary outlook on life characterized by "belittling  themselves, lacking in self-respect, being self-piteous, and  being self-destructive" with "self-respect, making efforts in  self improvement, conducting oneself with dignity and  independence." Over the past 10 years, there have been over 30  attempted suicides but none of them have been successful.    Female sex offenses mostly result from a deviation in moral  concepts and outlook on life and are regarded as the most  difficult category for transformation. There is a "kingdom of  women" inside Shanghai Municipal Prison in which "the worst  women in Shanghai are imprisoned" as Shanghai residents put it.  The prison authorities put them in different cells based on  different categories to avoid overlapping effects; at the same  time, they invite experts to give a series of lectures on sexual  ethics, sexual sociology, and sexually transmitted diseases.  They then conduct treatment using drugs and psychological  techniques on those those who are abnormal both physiologically  and psychologically with remarkable results. The rate of  recidivism among those released after serving the full term of  their sentences has been extremely low.    Compared with female inmates, juvenile delinquency has more  profound social causes. The bulk of the more than 800 juveniles  being held in Shandong Prison for Juvenile Delinquents are from  the rural areas, especially the suburban areas, and 70 percent  of them are school dropouts. The situation is pretty much the  same in the Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents.    Such an unsound social atmosphere as the "theory that study  is useless," and money- worship has spoiled the innocence and  nature of rural teenagers. The major criminal offences committed  by juvenile delinquents are theft and sex offences.    Regarding juvenile delinquents, "it is imperative to treat  them as parents would when nursing their own children with  infectious diseases, as doctors treat their patients, and as  teachers treat their students when they make some mistakes."  This is China's persistent policy for correcting juvenile  delinquents. Each day in prisons or reform centers, juvenile  delinquents take part for half the day in labor to learn some  skills, such as repairing electric appliances, gardening,  sewing, and cooking; the rest of the day is devoted to cultural  studies, to make up for the lessons they should have learned at  school.    Fine arts, such as music and painting, have become effective  means in correcting juvenile delinquents in China. This  reporter watched a rehearsal by the "Yuxin Performing Art  Troupe" at Shandong Provincial Prison for Juvenile Delinquents  and a performance of "Huichun Performing Art Troupe" at Shanghai  Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents. When one sees their  concentration on music, one has to believe that the best of  human culture has purified the soul that was once soiled. Wang  Wenting, who has already served four years of her sentence for  theft told this reporter that whenever she feels restless, she  finds peace once again when she takes up her musical instrument.    Inside the iron gate of Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile  Delinquent stands a three-dimensional work of art, entitled:  "Return." The Center named its cultural and technical school,  art performance troupe, and paper "Hui Chun [return to spring]."  All work involving education, persuasion, and salvation here is  just for spring to return to those tender but distorted minds  and help the lost lambs return to spring.</p>

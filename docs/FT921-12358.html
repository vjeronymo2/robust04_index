			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Observer: Decision time Isn't it time the UK government stopped shilly-shallying and decided who's to follow Sir David Wilson as governor of Hong Kong? People living there would certainly welcome a decision in place of gloomy rumours such as that the post has already been hawked round Tory politicians, all of whom said no. And as for the much-tipped David Owen, HK dignitaries visiting London last week were reputedly told by Labour foreign affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman that the former SDP figurehead has 'less chance than a waiter' of getting the job. A good way of short-circuiting the ditherings about whether it should go to a politician or a diplomat would be to appoint a successor from business. After all, Hong Kong is a thriving centre of trade, not least for UK companies, and a business leader as its last British governor could help to ensure it continues as such after the 1997 handover. One - and only one - who might fit the bill is Hongkong and Shanghai Bank chairman Willie Purves who has just made John Gray chief executive of the bank, having previously held both posts himself. He remains firmly in control, but as a vigorous 60-year-old has the leadership strengths and negotiating skills to take on the new role.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Observer: Buck House Late news flash from the pass-the-buck department. The Department of Trade and Industry has admitted that it underestimated the number of companies entering administration under UK insolvency law by more than half in the first six months of last year. However, the DTI is spared any real embarrassment because such official figures are now released through the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Indeed, when it owned up to getting its facts and figures wrong, it suggested that the real blame should not lie with itself or the ABCC, but Companies House. Once part of the DTI, Companies House is now a Next Steps agency and expected to take responsibility for itself. How convenient.</p>

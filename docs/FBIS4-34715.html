			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived this  morning at 0615 at the El Alto international airport. During  his 11-day trip the Bolivian president visited Cartagena,  Colombia, where he attended the Ibero-American summit; and the  United States, where he attended the inauguration of the World  Cup of soccer.    During a news conference after his arrival, the president  discussed the Bolivian-German soccer match. [passage omitted]    The president also referred to the sea outlet issue, which  was discussed both with Chilean President Eduardo Frei and at  the foreign ministerial level.    [Begin Sanchez recording] We want to advance at all levels,  at the cultural, political, and economic levels, so that we can  succeed in our great objective of achieving an outlet to the  sea, both through the waterway and to the Pacific Ocean.    I believe we had a good meeting, and that there is the  willingness to continue negotiating. I also explained that we  want to take specific steps to improve Bolivia's situation.  [end recording]    Regarding capitalization, journalists asked him whether he  had been able during this trip to obtain more investments. He  said:    [Begin Sanchez recording] We witnessed real interest in this  regard in the United States. For example, the Chicago Stock  Exchange will be sending a delegation to Bolivia. They are  interested in helping us establish a modern and fully  computerized stock exchange in Bolivia.    I believe things are working out, step by step, in a  positive  manner, and that there is good acceptance. Obviously this  entails a lot of work, but I am optimistic. I believe we are  obtaining positive results. [end recording]    President Sanchez de Lozada said that his administration  will  consist of several stages. He said the first stage is that of  sowing, which is the current stage.    [Begin Sanchez recording] This stage consists of preparing  the soil, of sowing. It is a very austere stage, and people do  not always see results. Nevertheless it is a necessary stage,  as there is no harvest without a season of sowing.    We are very confident that during the second year of this  administration we will be able to implement the capitalization  program. In other words, we estimate that by 6 August 1995 we  will have completed the capitalization process, and that the  pension funds will be operating by the end of next year. [end  recording]    The president said that the harvest will be taken in during  the third year. He said that the last year of his  administration would be unquestionably a political year.    Regarding the latest poll conducted by the Catholic  University of Bolivia, which indicates that Bolivian public  opinion believes a president should not also hold the post of  MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] leader, the president  said:    [Begin Sanchez recording] We have a government system that  is similar to that of a parliamentary system of government.  Therefore, if a candidate lacks two-thirds, he has to go to  Congress and establish a coalition. This is why I am the leader  of a political coalition.    This situation is not at all strange for Spain's Felipe  Gonzalez, or for German Chancellor Kohl, because if they intend  to implement their government programs they must be their  party's leaders and establish coalitions in order to be able to  govern.

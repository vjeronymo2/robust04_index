			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DEFECT TIED TO ANESTHESIA DEATHS  </P> <P> Scientists report they have zeroed in on a genetic defect that appears to  underlie life-threatening reactions to anesthesia, findings that may lead to  better tests to avert anesthesia-related deaths. Two research teams, working  independently, said they have narrowed down the location of the gene for  inherited malignant hyperthermia -- one of the major causes of death from  anesthesia -- to chromosome 19.  </P> <P> In two articles published in the journal Nature, one team from Ireland's  University College, Germany's University of Munich and London's St. Mary's  Hospital and another group from the University of Toronto said they have found  genetic markers that appear linked to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, or  MHS.  </P></p>

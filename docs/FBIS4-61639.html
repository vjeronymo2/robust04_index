			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays to </F> the Russian people; from the "Around and About Moscow" program  -- recorded]    [Text] [Video caption says: Appeal to the Russian people by  Anatoliy Chubays, Russian Federation Government deputy prime  minister] [Chubays] Voucher privatization is ending in Russia  now. It is creating the conditions for an upturn in the  economy, laying the foundations for the way to a stable society  and well- being. Today not everyone has decided what to do with  their privatization vouchers. I understand that this is a  difficult question for many -- where can they invest their  voucher profitably, how not to miscalculate.    I want to tell you that in April and May enterprises from  the  oil and gas industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and  telecommunications, high-tech enterprises from the defense  complex, and major Russian exporters will be put forward at  voucher auctions. This is the most reliable and profitable  sector of our economy. There is still time before 30 June to  think about this. But I would advise you to hurry and not put  off until tomorrow what can be done today.    The choice is yours. I wish you success.</p>

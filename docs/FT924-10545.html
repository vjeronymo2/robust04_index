			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Haemocell launches Pounds 6m rights HAEMOCELL, which has seen its shares more than double this month following US approval for its blood filtering device, yesterday announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 150p to raise Pounds 6.1m. The rights were priced last week at a 30 per cent discount. But the shares had risen to an opening price of 224p yesterday on enthusiasm about the prospects for the device. They closed at 249p. Before approval for the device from the US Food and Drug Administration, they traded at 95p. The proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings of Pounds 1.1m, upgrade manufacturing equipment and for working capital. Directors Mr Trevor Wilson and Mr Philip Martin, have renounced their rights. Mr Wilson has also placed 400,000 shares with UK institutions and, following the rights, his stake will fall to 11.1 per cent while Mr Martin will hold 14 per cent. They have been constrained from selling since the company joined the USM. The company also wanted to increase its institutional shareholders, who will hold more than 40 per cent after the rights. Mr Andrew Priestley, chairman, said the new money would allow the company to improve facilities and develop new uses for the technology.</p>

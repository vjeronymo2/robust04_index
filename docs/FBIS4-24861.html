			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin admitted today that the Russian debt to South Korea,  which stands at 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, 400 million of which  is overdue, is an impediment to bilateral economic cooperation.    Speaking at a joint news conference, the Russian president  said, "this serious problem impedes progress in major projects  undertaken by the two states."    He cited as an example the construction of a gas pipeline  from the Siberian republic of Yakutiya to South Korea.    Other major projects include the development of the far  eastern port of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center  in Moscow.    "It is important for us that the president of South Korea  treats with understanding the issue of postponing debt  payments," Yeltsin said, and added, "Russia has sufficient  grounds for an optimistic assessment of the prospects for  bilateral relations with South Korea."    The Russian leader stressed, "we have on many occasions  stated that we are interested in full-blooded economic relations  and would like to see a growth in South Korean investment in our  economy, especially in the Far East."    He also expressed the belief that South Korean companies  could help convert Russian defense enterprises to civilian  production and noted that "considerable understanding" had been  reached on issues concerning cooperation during the current  Russo-South Korean summit meeting.    At the news conference, Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow  would not pay compensation to relatives of the victims of the  KAL-007 boeing downed by the Soviet Air Force in the Far East in  1983, as the crew of the South Korean airliner was to blame for  its intrusion into Soviet airspace.    He stressed that the tragedy occurred during "Cold War"  times  and was triggered by "a combination of a number of  circumstances."</p>

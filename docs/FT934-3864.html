			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: CRT edges ahead to Pounds 472,000 recruitment and training - lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 472,000 in the six months to October 31. Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive, said the group had withdrawn from consultancy because that side of the business had become a 'tail' that was wagging the CRT dog. When CRT bought Doctus Consulting Europe from the receiver for Pounds 175,000 in August 1991, what had started as an advantage - exposure to European markets - soon became a disadvantage as the economies of France, Spain and Portugal declined. However, Mr Chapman was keen to point out the buoyancy of the group's other two areas of activities. Operating profits in recruitment rose 47 per cent to Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 320,000) on turnover up 29 per cent to Pounds 9.75m (Pounds 7.58m). In training they increased 23 per cent to Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.51m) on turnover expanded to Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.13m). Consultancy operations made losses of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 270,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 4.49m) and there were associated closure and disposal costs of Pounds 471,000 (Pounds 557,000). Earnings grew to 0.58p (0.48p) per share, insufficient - at this stage  - to cover the interim dividend lifted to 0.75p (0.65p). Mr Chapman said the rise was more an indication of the group's strong cashflow, rather than profits.</p>

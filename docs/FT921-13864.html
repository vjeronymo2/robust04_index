			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Modern operas built to last - Records ZIMMERMANN'S only opera has become something of a virility symbol among opera Intendants eager to display their credentials. Of all the significant operas written in the last 30 years Die Soldaten makes the most extravagant demands, with its multiple stage levels and three film screens, as well as cruelly taxing vocal parts - the role of Marie outstrips that of Lulu in its high-lying lines, while there are no less than six high tenors of various kinds specified in the score. So finding the resources and the rehearsal time necessary to mount Die Soldaten has become required proof of a genuine commitment to contemporary opera. In the autumn Andrew Porter reported here enthusiastically on the New York premiere at the City Opera, while both Opera North and the Royal Opera have pencilled productions into their schedules in recent years, only to abandon them when economic stringency was enforced. The only British performances remain those brought to the Edinburgh Festival by the Cassel Opera in 1972. Perhaps when it was first performed in 1965 Die Soldaten did appear to be a modern masterpiece, the long-awaited reconciliation between the post-war avant-garde and traditional opera, directly descended from Wozzeck and Lulu. A quarter of a century later it seems much less convincing, and distasteful. However humane Zimmermann's intentions in setting Lenz's brutal drama his treatment comes over as sensationalist and exploitative: the concern for society's victims, so affecting in Berg's operas on similar themes, seems merely schematic. Musically, too, the opera appears dated; though dramatically the pace is sure and tight enough, the language is self-consciously modish, the cliches of total serialism laced generously with quotation and pastiche. Such shortcomings may come over more strongly in a recording than they would in the theatre, where the sheer scope of Zimmermann's scheme doubtless carries a great deal before it. The new studio recording from Stuttgart (based upon a production there in 1988) is a superb one. Bernhard Kontarsky has been associated with Die Soldaten since its premiere and obtains a degree of accuracy and control from his players and singers that is often astonishing, while the insurmountable problems of containing all the musical effects and multi-layerings within a mere two-channel mix have been taken on more rigorously than could have dared hope. The cast is led by Nancy Shade's impressive Marie and Zoltan Kelemen's eloquent Wesener; every part though, is strongly cast, and many of the roles are more lovingly detailed than Zimmermann's cardboard characterisations deserve. Le Grand Macabre belongs with Soldaten (and Reimann's Lear) in the select band of recent operas that promise to lodge themselves firmly in the European repertory. The Wergo recording appeared first on LP, and the transfer on CD is very welcome. It is a fine performance with a multilingual cast singing in German, which originated at Austrian Radio and is conducted by Elgar Howarth, who was in charge of both the first performance, in Stockholm in 1978, and the British premiere four years later. No one would make great claims for the dramaturgy of Grand Macabre. Ligeti's version of the Ghelderode play is a simple fable that targets the weaknesses of the human appetite for power, wealth and particularly sex. It is a frieze of absurdist jokes, musical and verbal, which orbits constantly about the biggest absurdity of all, death, and which along the way affectionately parodies and pays homage to much of the Western operatic tradition. One experiences enchantment rather than deep emotion in Grand Macabre, there is delight in its musical dexterity, its fond vocal writing and extravagant conceits, and marvellously unbuttoned humour. There is nothing else remotely like it, and it was to be both a summation of Ligeti's achievement and a leavetaking: the pieces that emerged in the wake of Grand Macabre were to be utterly different. In two significant respects at least both Soldaten and Grand Macabre are entirely traditional: they both take as given the frame of the opera-house stage (even if Zimmermann stretches it a good deal) and the imperative of a linear narrative. Wolfgang Rihm's Hamletmaschine, based upon Heiner Muller's theatre piece is far more radical in its basic conception - less perfectly realised, and sometimes badly miscalculated, but often thrilling, fresh and full of striking ideas. Rihm cites Schoenberg's Erwartung and Gluckliche Hand as the jumping-off point for his 'music theatre in five movements', but he throws Antonin Artaud into the mix too, to yield a result that deifes accurate description and straddles any number of formal boundaries. The text is a sequence of discursions around the Hamlet story; Rihm says it is not his business to explain Muller, but that 'the drama is presented through the constantly shifting layers of projection in the music'. Like the words, the music coheres through an obscure network of pathways; one senses their wholeness long before beginning to tease out all the connections and meanings. The recording, made at the premiere in Mannheim in 1987, has its roughnesses but the power and originality of Rihm's writing are never obscured. It makes for a fascinating preface to his new opera Die Eroberung von Mexiko, scheduled for Hamburg in three weeks' time. Zimmermann: Die Soldaten.

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / How To Spend It: The combat boot goes in - Chunky footwear is in vogue. Lucia van der Post looks at one purveyor of sensible shoes that finds itself suddenly chic Once it was just the young who clumped around in Doc Martens while their elders tended to look on and wonder why they could not trip about in something a little daintier. These days, however, clumpy shoes are everywhere. I even found myself scouring London for a pair of heavy lace-up Ann Demeulemeester shoes (found eventually - at a price - at Jones in Floral Street in London's Covent Garden); everything else seemed too timid, too demure to set off a new suit I had bought. The fashion pages show that the skinniest, most fine-boned of models prefer combat boots or heavy trainers. Every fashionable foot is wearing the walking shoe, the army boot or the sturdy lace-up. There may be some among you who think that dainty lady-like shoes should be worn with floating chiffons - I urge you to try a sturdier shoe (or even boot) and see how it gives a fresher, more youthful look, how it adds a touch of wit and modernity to what could otherwise verge on cutesey sweetness. An unlikely provider of this look is Hawkins, a traditional footwear company which bears a Royal Warrant and which provided hard-wearing and comfortable riding boots to the army during the Boer War. For years Hawkins has been a solid provider of footwear for riding, for walking, for the army. Its reputation was founded on function, quality and practicality. Fashion, however, has caught up with Hawkins which, to its astonishment found that its Kinderboot, which it had perceived as a functional low-budget walking boot, was nearly as fashionable as Doc Martens. Featured in The Face, Arena and other trend-setting journals it was to be seen tromping up and down the chicest streets, worn with everything from jeans and cotton chinos to evening dress and floaty chiffons. Since it had found itself so unexpectedly in the fashion arena Hawkins decided that it might as well build on that and developed a fashion collection of its own which it launches next Thursday. As fashionable footwear this year coincides so closely with the things that Hawkins does best - the boot, the lace-up, the brogue - the collection is well-timed. Prices, though not cheap, do seem good value. They vary between Pounds 39.99 and Pounds 89.99. Hiking boots can be had for Pounds 52.50, the famous Kinderboot for about Pounds 55. The collection is available nationwide at Sacha branches as well as at many other shoe shops. For a local stockist you could call 0604-32293.</p>

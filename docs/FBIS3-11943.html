Alarcon participated in the conclusion  of the parliament assemblies in Villa Clara, which concludes  this process at the provincial level.    Speaking to deputies and union leaders in Villa Clara,  Alarcon de Quesada said that Villa Clara workers agree on the  need to preserve the achievements of the Revolution and reject  the IMF formula. Let no one think that capitalist formulas will  solve the problems of the great majority of the population, he  said. Alarcon de Quesada went on to say that after four years of  the special period, there are signs of economic recovery.</p>

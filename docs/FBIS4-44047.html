			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative on Cyprus, left Cyprus this afternoon. He met  President Glavkos Kliridhis last night and Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas today.    In a statement, Clark said the agreement that was expected  on  the confidence-building measures has not been reached, adding  that Denktas did not give him the draft agreement on the  confidence-building measures his side has prepared. He denied  reports that he conveyed any messages in any form to both sides.    Denktas said Clark did not give him any document or letter,  as he had expected, because the UN secretary general succumbed,  to use Denktas' expression, to Kliridhis' blackmail that if  something like this happened he would submit his resignation.  Denktas added that in his meeting with Clark, he asked why the  United Nations has not yet prepared a supplementary report on  the events since 31 May, which demonstrate the goodwill of the  Turkish Cypriot side. He said that, considering the current  facts, during his talks in Corfu Kliridhis will cite the UN  secretary general's 31 May report, which puts the Turkish  Cypriot side in a bad light, and will accuse it of a lack of  political goodwill.</p>

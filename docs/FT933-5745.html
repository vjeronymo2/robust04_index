			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Israel and PLO pact could be signed 'in days' MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was last night battling to persuade his senior colleagues in Tunis to sign an unprecedented mutual recognition accord with Israel. Jordan, meanwhile, said it would sign a preliminary peace agreement with Israel in Washington. At PLO headquarters in Tunis, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, an executive committee member, said the accord could be signed within days and would be agreed before the signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, shared the optimism and said Israel was ready to sign a recognition agreement immediately the PLO agreed to annul its charter calling for the violent annihilation of the Jewish state. Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby EC officials for aid to Palestinians, also said that the accord was separate and independent from a peace deal with Palestinians on interim self-rule. He said the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on self-rule for 1.9m Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, including Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, 'stands on its own legs' and was not dependent on a recognition deal. In Amman, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, the Jordanian prime minister, said he expected a Jordanian-Israeli declaration of principles to be signed during the of Middle East peace negotiations in Washington. He said an 'agenda' between Jordan and Israel had been near completion for months but the Jordanian government had held back from signing to allow the Palestinians time to agree on an initial settlement. "Aside from certain matters concerning language, we are likely to agree on an agenda this time round,' he said. The agenda - which contains the framework for a peace agreement - is believed to include the return by Israel of two strips of land and increased Jordanian water rights from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. It also outlines the right of return of an estimated 100,000 of Palestinian refugees who fled to Jordan after the 1967 war when Israel seized the West Bank. In Jerusalem. Mr Peres agreed that a Jordanian agreement could be signed 'tomorrow' and said the last Israeli-Jordanian rounds of talks had discussed only minor details. The rapidly developing Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian breakthrough showed signs of triggering possible progress in the two other tracks of the Middle East peace process - the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks. A PLO official said Spain was hosting secret talks among the three parties and that a draft Israeli-Syrian agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace was close to completion. However, Israel and Syria denied the claim. Mr Peres clarified the timetable for the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord. He said a signing ceremony and approval by Israel's parliament would take place within two weeks. A joint committee would then iron out outstanding issues and the plan would then be implemented within four months.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a dull session in stock index futures, with disappointing news from several leading companies taking centre stage, writes Joel Kibazo. Independent traders sent the March contract forward early in the session, and it soon recorded an 8-point advance to 2,590. But a downbeat trading statement accompanying ICI's full-year figures, together with the disappointing news of the collapse of merger talks between British Airways and KLM, sent March into retreat. A poor early Wall Street showing brought out more sellers, but independent traders moving to cover short positions as March fell to 2,565 led to a bounce before the close. March closed at 2,573, down 11 on the previous session and around 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Volume reached 5,613 lots. Turnover in traded options was a reasonable 31,157 contracts. Volume in the FT-SE 100 index option at 7,429 lots was down ahead of its expiry today, but satisfactory trading was seen in the stock options. Tesco was the top stock option, recording a day's total of 1,873 lots. This was followed by Midland Bank, which traded 1,643 contracts.</p>

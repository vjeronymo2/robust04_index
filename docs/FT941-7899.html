			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / IMF gets tough on Nigeria debt deal Nigeria must reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on an economic reform programme before its Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.9bn) external debt could be rescheduled, Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister, was told yesterday during meetings with British Foreign Office and Treasury officials. A Foreign Office statement said the officials 'made clear Britain's desire to see a return to democracy in Nigeria as soon as possible, and the Nigerian government was urged to take concrete steps in this direction'. Mr Kalu is likely to receive an equally blunt message in Washington and Paris during a 10-day visit to western capitals. His task of defending the military government's economic policy has been made more difficult by complaints by bankers in Lagos that Nigeria's new system of direct allocation of foreign exchange to importers has become entangled in bureaucracy. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday delayed the allocation for the second time since last week, blaming intermediary banks for artificially inflating demand and failing to comply with guidelines. The CBN is to allocate pro rata for approved applications, with half going to manufacturers, 30 per cent for finished goods and the rest for agriculture and invisibles. Bankers say total demand was Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn for the allocation of Dollars 200m. There has been no official supply of foreign exchange for two months while the exchange rate has been fixed at N22 to the dollar, with the black market rate falling to nearly N50. The CBN has suspended allocations to 22 designated banks pending snap investigations, warned another 50 banks to be more accurate, and demanded from all banks extra copies and more detail about customers' applications.</p>

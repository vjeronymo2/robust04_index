And this is natural, inasmuch as the  authorities of Azerbaijan who successively replaced each other,  given the outward dissimilarity of their political form,  differed very little in their attitude toward the Karabakh  problem, adhering to one logic--war. True, a revealing  metamorphosis has taken place: Ayaz Mutalibov, who did not  consider it possible to create his own combat-capable army in a  short time, stressed resources at hand--the remainder of the  Soviet troops in Azerbaijan. Abulfaz Elchibey was a follower of  the national idea and, consequently, a supporter of the creation  of a national army. He organized an offensive, after promising  in one of his interviews to resolve the problem in a year--and  Geydar Aliyev repeated the very same words in January of this  year. He returned to the use of the idea that it was impossible  to gain a victory in war with one's own forces. But as a more  flexible politician in the line of his predecessors, he actively  used peaceful rhetoric. Although the first negotiations by his  representatives on the dispatch of mujahidin to Azerbaijan were  going on at the end of the summer and the beginning of  September, when Aliyev still claimed that he should become  president first and then engage in peaceful negotiations.    The present offensive was being readied since July, but it  started in December, when Azerbaijan considered that it was  already prepared for them. A large amount of ammunition was  received from Russia, all produced in 1993--Aliyev took  advantage of his contacts with brass hats and the generally  indefinite situation in Russia. Negotiations were held about the  mercenaries--both Afghan and Russian--and time was needed for  all of this. Turkish instructors arrived in Azerbaijan, and  today Karabakh soldiers are finding Turkish-produced cartridges  on the battlefield.    While the Russian plan for settlement and the CSCE plan were  being actively worked on, Azerbaijan, while participating in the  negotiations, maneuvered, and when it was necessary ignored them  in order to avoid a determinant and far-reaching decision. It  needed a victory more than it needed negotiations, inasmuch as  the initial position for the start of political bargaining was  less than advantageous. Therefore, a declared armistice was  broken more than once. The concept arose in Russian diplomatic  circles of "limited military victories" that were necessary to  Azerbaijan--incentives that could incline it to accept the  Russian settlement plan (up until now, Baku in one or another  form reported its objection to it).    Azerbaijan tried to use the potential support of Iran,  Turkey, and Russia, showing that it was acting in their  contradictory, however, interests. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has  already written about the facts of the participation of Afghan  mujahidin in combat operations on its side. Documents, whose  originals were transferred to the editorial office, were found  on dead Afghans on the battlefield. In particular, a list of  personnel of one of the subunits of the training center in  Gyandzh consists only of mujahidin. Here are names: Abdurrazak  Mukhamatrasul, Zakhedulla Muminkhan, Abdulvakil Mukhamadkarim,  Gulzada Sardar, Alikhaydar Shakhmukhamat, Gulakhmat Mirrakhman,  Khanshirin, [preceding names as transliterated] and others. As  follows from the September information report on the  military-political situation in the region by the commander of  military unit No. 160, Lieutenant Colonel Lyatifov, in which  Afghans are fighting, "the military unit is deployed on the  territory of Yevlakhskiy Rayon. The closest populated centers  are the Geran Station, Geranboyskiy Rayon, the city of  Mingechaur... A special contingent is located in our unit, they  are combat motivated, and they maintain good relations with us  and with the local population. They drive out to the cities of  Mingechaur, Geranboy, and Gyandzha escorted by interpreters who  are called up for periods of training. Questions that arise with  the command element of the special contingent are resolved  successfully. Although it can be noted that the leadership of  the neighboring rayons does not maintain close contacts with the  command element of the special contingent in order to furnish  its assistance at the necessary moment. I would like in the  future to improve relations with the leadership of the  neighboring rayons and the command element of the unit. These  meetings and contacts will have a positive influence on the mood  of the personnel and will support their combat spirit. No effort  was seen to plant leaflets and propaganda against the leadership  of the republic..."    The mujahidin, as the Karabakh people acknowledge, fight  stubbornly, although the motive for their participation in this  conflict is not religious convictions, but strictly pragmatic  considerations. According to unconfirmed reports, the Afghans  began to be actively used after the son-in-law of Prime Minister  Hekmatyar, together with a representative of his current  ally--General Dostam--visited Baku in the middle of December.    This problem was commented on for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by  Feliks Mamikoyan, the permanent representative of Armenia in  Russia:    "According to the protocol to the treaty on collective  security, to join it requires the consent of all of the country  participants. Azerbaijan expressed a desire to sign the treaty,  but juridically its entry has not yet been ratified in the  prescribed procedures. Several questions arise in this  connection--in particular concerning the Iran-Azerbaijan border.  Inasmuch as individual borders of the CIS, in contrast to the  `transparent' internal borders, must be protected, then the  Iranian border also cannot be outwardly open--otherwise a threat  emerges for all states, particularly for Armenia. The threat is  associated with the participation of third-country servicemen in  a local conflict on the territory of Azerbaijan--which is one of  the members of the CIS.    "Considering the complicated situation on the Afghan-Tajik  border, on whose different sides a combined CIS contingent and  those mujahidin are deployed, this fact looks even more  ambiguous and requires clarification. As does Aliyev's  persistent reluctance to protect his outer border with Iran. If  an agreement should be written that the Russian border troops of  the combined CIS contingent is to take control of the border,  the Karabakh authorities are prepared to release these  territories--they have repeatedly declared that they do not plan  to retain these lands. In the context of peaceful negotiations,  the question of stationing Russian border troops along this line  can become one of the most important.    "We have information that makes it possible to reach  conclusions, in particular, about the fact that the Iranian  border was used for operations of the Azerbaijan army. In the  first stage, the success of the operation on the southern front  is explained by the fact that the troops got into the rear of  the Karabakh armed formations through the Iranian border. This  once again confirms the need for common border troops that  control the borders of the Commonwealth--then it would be  possible to avoid reproaches of this kind."</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: Simpler control Sir, I was intrigued to see the elaborate technology now installed to deal with the traffic at the Blackwall Tunnel - the Northern (Poplar) entrance, presumably. In the 1930s a lone police-constable controlled traffic there; often it was my parents' friend, PC Walter Brockhurst, whose elder son, also Walter, was then one of my close friends at Woolmore Street Elementary School, Poplar.

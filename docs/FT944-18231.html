			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (28): Early sign of a change in attitudes - Technology: European buyers are starting to demand more extras Europe is a motoring paradox for the systems engineer. European motorists, as any engineer (and especially any Japanese engineer) will tell you, drive faster, go round corners quicker and generally expect more in the way of performance from their cars than anyone else. Yet for the most part they have until now remained resolutely indifferent to developments which make life at the wheel safer, more comfortable, and more efficient. The antithesis of the European is to be seen in the clogged streets of Tokyo. Here the driver of a typical medium-sized car will edge his way along with the aid of automatic transmission. The temperature and the humidity may both be in the nineties but the Japanese driver will have air conditioning to take care of that. Every so often, he will glance at a display which tells him if he is still heading in the right direction. And if the boredom of slow progress becomes too much, he may switch the display from navigation mode and sing his way along to the tones of his own in-car karaoke as the words of the song appear on the same screen. It may be that European drivers will forever place in-car karaoke lower on their list of priorities - but don't laugh: the addition of such frivolities gave a huge boost to the originally slow-starting sales of in-car navigation systems in Japan. Many motor industry suppliers, and in particular the larger component groups, are writing their plans around the assumption that European drivers will begin to embrace technically advanced systems for their own sake. An early sign of this changing attitude was provided by the air-bag. Product planners wise in the ways of Europeans had long predicted that the air-bag would remain a largely American phenomenon, its extra cost stoutly resisted on this side of the Atlantic by drivers who would continue to rely on the efficiency of their tried, trusted and sensible safety belts. The planners were wrong. The majority of cars on sale in Europe are now equipped at least with a driver-side air-bag, and there is no question that the trend has been consumer driven. Through 1993, there was what amounted to a panic among car manufacturers to engineer installations and secure component supplies to avoid being left behind in the rush. The question now is which item of equipment will be the next to rise to the top of the consumers' must-have list. Some of the smart money has gone to back air conditioning systems. In perhaps 10 years, air conditioning has moved in European eyes from being an indulgence confined to the most luxurious of cars, to a remarkably efficient aid to comfort which is now beginning to appear in the upper reaches of mid-range family cars. Significantly, as used to be the case with central locking (which is now fitted to well over half of all the cars sold in Europe), those who have tried it tend to insist that they could never again do without it. Encouraged by such sentiments, the leading system suppliers such as Valeo are gearing up for a rapid rise in demand, with the possibility of 50 per cent of new European cars being air conditioned by the 1997 model year. The debate meanwhile rages as to how eagerly European car buyers will embrace the visible aspects of electronics - not the karaoke, but certainly the navigation display, for example. The electronics are already there in the car, of course: no modern low-emission engine could function without its electronic management system, no anti-lock braking and traction control system could operate with high efficiency without the speed and precision of electronics. Most automatic transmissions have abandoned hydro-mechanical for electronic control; the new generation of 'active' chassis control systems, from adaptive damping to Citroen's remarkable new Activa roll-limitation system, depend on electronic sensing and control. The real arguments in this area now centre around two questions: visibility and standardisation. Visibility in this context means whether or not the presence of extensive electronic systems should be apparent to the driver. There is a powerful school of European engineering philosophy which would prefer such technology to be 'transparent', functioning entirely behind the scenes, so that the actual driving task remains as simple and straightforward as possible: more simple and straightforward, indeed, than it has ever been before. Others, encouraged in some degree by marketing departments who feel they have a better chance of selling more expensive cars if the technology behind the expense is immediately apparent, want to see the power of electronics brought to the 'driver interface'. In other words, communication between the driver and the vehicle will become electronic rather than manual. One reason for the current surge of interest in navigation systems is that their technology appears to fall between the two extremes. Which works best, a display screen or audible instructions? How does the driver best tell the system where he wants to go - by keying into a computer-type keyboard, or by issuing verbal instructions into a microphone? As yet, there are no clear answers to such questions. It is the need for standardisation, however, which is most occupying the automotive electronics industry. Even within a single car, the need clearly exists. We have already reached the stage where an engineer developing a new system, and needing a specific piece of information - how fast the car is going, how fast the engine is turning - will usually find that the information is already being supplied by a sensor to an existing system. It is far cheaper and easier to tap into that source - as long as the information is being supplied in a form which the new system can accept. That used not to be a problem, but the mushroom growth in the number of sensors, systems, and types of information is beginning to make it one. Some of the largest and most 'technical' cars, such as Mercedes' S-class, already have a 'databus' and a formal protocol to speed the exchange of information between systems (as well as saving the weight of a hefty wiring loom, and gaining reliability through the elimination of countless electrical connections). But which information standard, which communications protocol will become the worldwide standard? There is a need for such a standard, because we are rapidly approaching the point at which cars will be able to communicate with a roadside infrastructure of navigation and information 'beacons', and with each other. This is the essential technology behind programmes such as the pan-European Prometheus, now reaching fruition, and which aims to increase safety and efficiency, and reduce emissions, by minimising traffic conflicts and allowing vehicles to spend more of their time travelling at a steady speed. Such universal systems will only be able to operate properly if every vehicle is speaking the same 'language'. The commercial rewards of developing from the outset equipment which conforms to the eventually adopted standard will be immense: manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the US are well aware of this, with the result that a techno-political battle royal is likely to be joined in the final years of the century.</p>

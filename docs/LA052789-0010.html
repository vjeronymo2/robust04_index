			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY FALLS SHORT ONCE AGAIN;  </P> <P> MILLIKAN'S 6-3 VICTORY PROVIDES A FAMILIAR POSTSCRIPT FOR PIONEERS  </P> <P> In baseball parlance, it's known as warning-track power.  </P> <P> For the fifth time since 1982 -- and the third season in a row -- Simi Valley  High lost a playoff game in the quarterfinal round. This time, the Pioneers  fell, 6-3, to visiting Long Beach Millikan in a Southern Section 5-A Division  game.  </P> <P> The warning-track label doesn't mean Simi Valley has never won a big game. Far  from it. The Pioneers are 18-9 in playoff games since 1980, including two trips  to the semifinals. However, as he has done too often for his tastes, Simi  Valley Coach Mike Scyphers was left standing on the infield grass, explaining  away a playoff loss.  </P> <P> "In a game like this," he said, "you need some breaks. They got every break  imaginable and we got none.  </P> <P> "It seems like they always had the momentum. Every play seemed to be an  exciting play for them and a downer for us."  </P> <P> Scyphers, though, maintained that he was satisfied with the success of the  Pioneer program, despite all the near-misses in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I don't get tired of being in the playoffs," he said. "There's only one team  that can win it all. There's a lot of teams who would love to be where we are.  </P> <P> "One of these years we'll put it together."  </P> <P> But it wasn't to be this year as Millikan (20-8), runner-up in the Moore  League, mixed in a lot of little ball, an occasional display of power, solid  pitching by right-hander David Mauss and, yes, several good breaks to advance  to the semifinals against Hacienda Heights Wilson.  </P> <P> The Rams scored a run in the first on three soft singles and a sacrifice fly  off Simi Valley starter Mike Jenkins. They added two more in the second on a  rally started by a pop-up to shallow right field lost in the sun by Simi Valley  second baseman Jesse Anguiano. A hit batter followed, then a two-run double by  Todd Taylor.  </P> <P> Millikan led, 3-1, with Anguiano accounting for the the Pioneers' scoring with  a leadoff home run in the first inning. Mauss (11-3) didn't allow another hit  until the fourth inning but then struggled in the sixth and seventh. His  three-year playoff record is 6-0.  </P> <P> "After that home run, I think most kids would cave in," Millikan Coach Dan  Peters said. "But he pitched his guts out. He had very average stuff today."  </P> <P> The Rams provided support with a run in each of the last three innings, and  Simi Valley's only reply was Mike Jenkins' two-run homer in the sixth that made  the score 5-3. Jenkins (9-1), who went 5 1/3 innings, was the losing pitcher.  It was the senior's first varsity loss in 14 decisions.  </P> <P> Scyphers was able to find some positive aspects in a season that included 23  wins and only four losses, but others were not as generous.  </P> <P> Junior first baseman Kenny Hood, like many of his teammates, thought that this  Pioneer team had enough to carry over the warning track and out of the  ballpark.  </P> <P> "We had it all -- pitching, hitting," Hood said. "Get a few bad breaks . . .  It's just, like, devastating."  </P></p>

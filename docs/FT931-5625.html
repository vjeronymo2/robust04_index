			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / South Africa approaches moment of truth: Which way Buthelezi moves is at the heart of constitutional talks CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the proud but unpredictable leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party in South Africa, is about to face his moment of truth. For months Chief Buthelezi has fulminated in public over government efforts to agree a post-apartheid constitution bilaterally with the African National Congress, blood-rivals of Inkatha. His two adversaries have now done their deal - which calls for multiracial power sharing to the end of the century - and they must sell it to the belligerent chief from Natal. That process begins today, when the ruling National Party, the ANC, Inkatha and as many as 20 other organisations (no one can be sure exactly how many will attend until they count heads at the door) meet for two days of talks to plan the resumption of multi-party constitutional talks. Those talks, in the forum known as the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, collapsed 10 months ago. They are due to resume at the end of this month. But the resumption will depend on this week's so-called 'multi-party planning conference', which none of the party leaders will attend. The conference will bring together lower-level delegations spanning the political spectrum. The white supremacists will be represented in multi-party talks for the first time, by the small and relatively moderate Afrikaner Volksunie (Afrikaner People's Party), while the ultra-right Conservative Party may also attend. Sitting opposite them will be black supremacists from the Pan Africanist Congress, who intend to show up despite government efforts to bar them. The aim of such an inclusive conference is to ensure that any new constitution is viewed as legitimate by the whole of South Africa's fractious population. But the harsh truth is that there will be a constitutional settlement in South Africa, with or without the acquiescence of these 20-odd groups - and that means, with or without Chief Buthelezi. The cost of an imposed settlement, however, would be frighteningly high. Over the next few days and weeks, Chief Buthulezi faces the most critical decision of his political career which has spanned over 40 years and has seen him lauded as an opponent of apartheid as well as condemned for collaboration. He must decide whether to compromise over a constitutional deal which he substantially rejects - he opposes power-sharing and demands maximum devolution of power to regions in a confederal state - or whether to stand on principle to oppose a multi-party agreement. Chief Buthelezi must know that he cannot prevent a deal: the ruling National Party will go to great lengths to accommodate him (and even his rivals in the ANC insist they wish to be conciliatory); but National Party ministers have made plain, in the words of one Inkatha official, that they would 'ditch anybody' rather than jeopardise their power-sharing deal with the ANC. 'Chief Buthelezi does not want to be seen as a Savimbi in the talks,' says Mr Oscar Dhlomo, political analyst and former lieutenant to the Inkatha leader. He was referring to the role played by Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Angolan Unita movement, widely credited with having wrecked Angola's multi-party elections. Faced with pressure to negotiate from western embassies, from the National Party itself and from white businessmen (traditionally his allies and financial backers), Chief Buthelezi appears to have moderated his intransigence. The conference which begins today may provide a measure of this new flexibility. Still, the debate is likely to generate a large amount of heat and light before conclusions are reached. For most of the participants in the talks feel - understandably - that they have been convened simply to rubber-stamp an agreement reached bilaterally between ANC and the government. That agreement calls for multi-party power-sharing at cabinet level for five years after the first multiracial elections (due to be held sometime between the end of 1993 and April next year). It also calls for a measure of power-sharing between central and regional governments, through devolution of certain powers; but no agreement has yet been reached on which powers should be devolved. This means, in effect, that the form of the future state - a federation or a unitary nation - has not yet been agreed. And that is Inkatha's largest concern. Inkatha intends to raise this issue at the current talks, and sparks could fly. Inkatha wants each new South African region to negotiate its own separate constitution - like the original American states. This will be opposed by the government and the ANC, which want the issue decided centrally. For though the ANC has shifted significantly away from a highly centralised state, toward a model where regions have substantial powers, it continues to oppose Inkatha's model, which is at best loosely federal. Considerable rhetoric will no doubt be expended on this issue over the next few days, before a date and agenda are set for multi-party talks. But however angry the debate, the ANC and Government will do all they can to see that Chief Buthelezi remains in negotiations. For if Chief Buthelezi is left to seek a separate peace for Natal - perhaps even fulfilling a recent veiled threat to secede from South Africa - greater violence can be the only result. Natal has one quarter of the country's population. It is hard to see that a new constitution can succeed without it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTDOWN TO DEMOCRACY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed timetable for majority rule  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TODAY AND            Groups from across the political spectrum meet as TOMORROW             the Multi-party Negotiations Planning Conference to                      plan the resumption of constitutional negotiations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STARTS LATE          Fully fledged multi-party negotiations along the THIS MONTH,          lines of the Convention for a Democratic South CONTINUES            Africa (Codesa), which collapsed in acrimony last THROUGH JUNE         May                      Transitional Executive Council (TEC) created to                      organise level playing field to ensure free and                      fair elections                      Independent Elections Commission established to                      organise and supervise the vote                      Independent Media Commission set up to oversee                      fairness of news coverage by state-controlled media  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BETWEEN              Constituent Assembly (CA): END-1993             Would be elected by proportional representation AND APRIL            One half of seats would be from national lists; the NEXT YEAR            other half from regional lists                      Decisions would be by a two-thirds majority                      CA would draft and adopt new Constitution                      Interim Government of National Unity:                      Parties with more than a set minimum percentage of                      CA seats - possibly 5 or 10 per cent - would be                      represented proportionally in the Cabinet                      In general, executive authority would be exercised                      by the President                      For specified matters, the President would require                      approval of at least two-thirds of the Cabinet, or                      possibly a full consensus  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EARLY                Adoption of new Constitution 1995                 Constituent Assembly would continue as Parliament                      Interim Government would continue as a Government                      of National Unity and phase in new Constitution  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BY 1999              MAJORITY RULE                      Elections would be held within five years of first                      Constituent Assembly elections; National Unity                      Government would then be replaced by a majority                      government under the terms of the new Constitution  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The main protagonists: Who they represent and what they want  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK and his ruling National Party claim to represent all of South Africa's minorities (but especially whites). He heads a formidable party machine which could win a quarter to a third of the national vote, with the support of most of the country's 3.8m white voters, a majority of the 2m coloured and 660,000 Asian voters, plus some of the 16m black voters. Mr de Klerk has already seen his main demand -    that South Africa be ruled by power-sharing - granted in bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress. It was agreed that power would be shared between majority and minority parties at cabinet level through the end of the century. He will now push his power-sharing demands one step further by calling for substantial devolution of power from central government to regional and local government, as a further measure to dilute the power of a 21st-Century black government in Pretoria.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MR NELSON MANDELA, president of the African National Congress, can count on support from a majority of the 16m black voters (more than 70 per cent of the country's total). But privately the organisation is not certain that it can win more than 50 per cent of the total vote, as it will have almost no white support and only minority support among coloureds and Asians. It also has problems with organising in the black communities. Still, the ANC seems certain to be the single largest party in any future government, and could win as much as 60 per cent of the vote if it can improve organisation and raise a large election fund. The ANC's ultimate demand is majority rule, but it has agreed to five years of power-sharing at cabinet level (though it wants to retain effective control over most cabinet decisions despite the presence of minority parties). Meanwhile, its most immediate concern is over devolution of power: the ANC wants a more centralised system than envisaged by the National Party or Inkatha (see below).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHIEF MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI combines a political role (he is Chief Minister of the KwaZulu black homeland and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party) with the traditional tribal role as a prince of the Zulu royal house. He has cleverly exploited both positions to underpin his support in Natal province, his regional base, where strong support from whites and minority support among Zulus may guarantee him half or more of the regional vote (Inkatha would probably win only 5 to 10 per cent of the national vote). As a regional leader who can claim no national political role, Chief Buthelezi's hope is to be able to insist on maximum devolution of power to the regions: he demands a federal South Africa with greater devolution than envisaged by the National Party and far more than that proposed by the ANC. He recently published what amounts to a secessionist constitution for Natal. Nevertheles, his support will be crucial if a future national constitution is to succeed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting between the COB [Bolivian Labor  Federation] and the government is being held openly, in the  presence of reporters, at the Labor Ministry. The real  negotiations have not yet begun. Let us listen to the positions  of the two parties. First, Carlos Camargo of the COB:    [Begin Camargo recording] The COB has made a national  proposal, and has been patiently waiting, without putting on any  pressure, in the hope that the government would reply in a  positive manner. This is an attitude that shows the willingness  of the COB to talk. We did not implement measures first, and  them submit the COB proposal. I would also like to point out  before the public that in the case of La Paz, where regrettable  events took place this afternoon, there was no provocation from  the workers. The provocation came from the government, the  police, and the Armed Forces. [end recording]    Let us listen now to the government representative, Human  Development Minister Enrique Ipina:    [Begin Ipina recording] The government does not accept, and  will not accept, the formal resumption of talks if there is no  constructive and positive spirit for lifting the coercive  measures. We reiterate the terms of our letter of 24 April, and  expect from the COB, the lifting of all coercive measures  without exception, as an essential condition, as absolutely  necessary, for contributing to social peace and demonstrating to  the world that Bolivians can understand each other without  threats of any kind. We believe, we are convinced, that we need  the lifting of all coercive measures, without exception, as a  prior condition. [end recording]</p>

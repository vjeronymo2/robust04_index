			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: UN plan for eco-friendly products Proposals for a certification scheme for environmentally friendly products from developing countries are being drawn up by the United Nations in a bid to head off the growing threat of trade discrimination against poor nations from proliferating labelling requirements. Announcing the initiative yesterday, Mr Kenneth Dadzie, secretary general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, said industrialised-country labelling and certification rules for environment-friendly goods often ignored the nature of products and production processes in developing nations. Inappropriate standards, and onerous information requirements, could make it difficult for Third World exporters. The proposals, being worked on by Unctad and the UN Environment Programme, would have three key elements, Mr Dadzie said. These were: the use of equivalent environmental standards, allowing certification of goods that helped the local environment in the producing country; mutual recognition of certification schemes; and local standards-setting within internationally agreed guidelines.</p>

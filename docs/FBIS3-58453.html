			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The debate on the motion of no confidence in the  government proposed by [Radical leader Marco] Pannella has begun  with a speech by Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.    Ciampi said it was not up to government to decide whether to  dissolve parliament, and invited President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,  whom he will consult after the debate, to express his opinion  about the situation, making it clear that he would place his  mandate at Scalfaro's disposal. Ciampi pointed out the  different positions of the political forces concerning the  legislature's prospects: according to some they have been  exhausted, while others say that important and specific acts  still have to be carried out.</p>

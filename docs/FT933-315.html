			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall STERLING interest rate fut-ures fell sharply yesterday, as the pound suffered a decline against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. The pound's fall against the D-Mark was partly due to worries about next week's Conservative party conference in Blackpool, at which Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will come under pressure. Any drop in the currency, in turn, tends to raise some doubt about whether the authorities have room to engineer another easing in monetary policy. The December short sterling contract lost 5 basis points to close at 94.39. In the sterling cash market, three-month interest rates remained very high at around 6 per cent. This was mostly due to end-of-month factors which put pressure on banks to meet liquidity requirements. Conditions in the discount market were a great deal easier. Most of a Pounds 900m shortage in the banking system was removed through regular operations. The cost of overnight funds was as low as 2 per cent at one stage. In the German market, there were no surprises in the Bundesbank announcement of a 6.70 per cent repo for 14-day maturities in its money market operations. More surprising, however, was the decision to go for a 33-day variable rate repo. This was seen by many dealers as an indication that conditions in the German market are getting back to normal. The recent reduction in the discount rate to 6.25 per cent has made it possible for the Bundesbank to auction for liquidity. Bids often tend to come in levels lower than call money. There were signs yesterday that bank dealers were trying to obtain funds as cheaply as possible, with some bids coming below 6.70 per cent. In the German interest rate futures market, the contracts were down in spite of better than expected figures on German inflation. The Decem-ber contract declined 3 basis points to finish at 93.90. The December French franc contract was little changed at 93.70. Dealers continue to think that there could be an easing in the French intervention rate in the near future, although yesterday's weakness in the French currency may make this a little more difficult to execute. The intervention rate has remained at 6.75 per cent since the European exchange rate mechanism crisis.</p>

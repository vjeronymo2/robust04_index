			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, Polish deputy defense </F> minister and chief of the National Security Bureau, by Andrzej  Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of  Radio Zet" program -- live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Good morning to you.    [Milewski] Good morning.    [Woyciechowski] Poland is a partner of NATO as of yesterday.  Half of the Polish people do not understand what that means.    [Milewski] Poland has declared its willingness to  participate in a program which was proposed at the NATO summit  on 10 January and which is called Partnership for Peace. The  program was offered to all postcommunist countries, as well to  those of the former Soviet bloc. It is an individually oriented  program, the contents of which contents will be negotiated and  determined with each country separately.    [Woyciechowski] You say, "will be negotiated." That means  Poland has not negotiated the program yet, in terms of details.    [Milewski] Not yet, since all Prime Minister Pawlak did in  Brussels yesterday was to officially declare Poland's intention  to join the program.    [Woyciechowski] Who will negotiate the details -- the  Defense Ministry [MON], the Sejm, or the National Security  Bureau? Which of these institutions will determine the details?    [Milewski] It will be the government, that is beyond any  doubt. The most important ministries in the government that  will be dealing with it will be MON and the Foreign Ministry.    [Woyciechowski] Poland is NATO's third partner -- prior to  us, the treaty was signed by Romania and Lithuania, with Estonia  signing tomorrow. Did we all sign the same thing [words  indistinct]?    [Milewski] It is exactly the same thing. It is simply an  official intention of a given country to participate in the  Partnership. All the texts are exactly the same and the  agreements that will be signed between specific countries and  NATO -- these will be individually oriented.    [Woyciechowski] The document we signed -- is that a very  detailed text comprising 100 pages, or perhaps is it half-a-page  long?    [Milewski] It is just one page.    [Woyciechowski] So it is a very general kind of document.    [Milewski] Yes, it is a completely general kind of document  which only expresses intentions which are in accordance with  so-called Western standards regarding democracy in a given  country, transparency of military budgets....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the Polish military budget  transparent?    [Milewski] In my view, it is too transparent....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Too transparent, meaning?    [Milewski] Meaning that there are simply no longer  any....[pauses] A military budget should be a matter of  confidence or secrecy regarding some items, because it is after  all the issue of a country's entire defense system. As far as  Poland is concerned, both our defense industry, the budget, and  various military issues are too public nowadays -- no legal  provisions concerning state secrets are being observed.    [Woyciechowski] So the devil is in the details, in how  specific the treaty will be, I mean the treaty between Poland  and NATO. It depends on the size of those military units which  we intend to devote to cooperation with NATO. Do we know  precisely how big they will be?    [Milewski] No, we do not. We are deliberating right now  what kind of units should be proposed to NATO within our version  of the Partnership for Peace program. It is definitely known  that it is the West's intention for Poland to have a greater  contribution to UN peace efforts....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Greater than Estonia and  Lithuania.    Mr. Minister, what is a platoon? How many soldiers are there  in a platoon?    [Milewski] There are about 30 men in a platoon, if you mean  a classic platoon of infantry or mechanized units.    [Woyciechowski] You have heard -- just like everyone else --  a statement by a Polish officer who said on television a few  days ago that Poland will designate an entire platoon for  cooperation with NATO.    [Milewski] No, that is a misunderstanding. As far as the  long term is concerned, Poland intends to be an equal member of  NATO with full rights -- just as we want to be an equal member  of the European Union, a member with full rights; our goal is  full integration of our country with Western organizations, so  as far as the long term is concerned, the entire operational  Armed Forces of the Polish Republic will be placed at NATO's  disposal in case of a conflict....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this will not be a  platoon but many divisions, many armies. What do you mean by  the entire operational forces?    [Milewski] The entire Polish operational forces currently  comprise 11 divisions plus four independent brigades.    [Woyciechowski] Is that a great deal compared with our  neighbors like Lithuania, Estonia, or Romania? Do we have more  than them?    [Milewski] We have much more than Lithuania or Estonia --  what we have is within the limits which were granted to us by  the Vienna treaties; that is to say, about 250,000 soldiers and  officers.    [Woyciechowski] When you say long term -- what specific year  do you mean? When will it happen?    [Milewski] It will happen when the member [as heard] will be  a regular member of NATO -- I think it will happen in the next  few years, before the year 2000; even Western politicians have  been saying that recently. It seems that a period of three to  four years should be sufficient to prepare Poland for membership  in NATO, which would be with full rights and equal membership.  Which does not mean that we are not looking for a political  protection shield against increasing dangers from the East much  earlier than that date.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us return for a moment to  those divisions which we will be able to earmark for cooperation  with NATO some day -- this could happen perhaps within three to  four years, as you said. What must we do to those divisions and  soldiers? Do we have to change their uniforms, machine guns,  boots, and everything else, or will these preparations be easier  than that?    [Milewski] No. All that has to be changed is the command  system with regard to the aforementioned divisions and brigades,  and also the way of communication among them and with the higher  command -- that must also be changed.    [Woyciechowski] What does that mean?    [Milewski] Communications systems and fire-steering systems  must be made uniform, simply....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it mean that military  commands will be given in English as of now? Fire! -- will that  be in English?    [Milewski] Not in the case of commands at the level of a  platoon, about which you asked, but commands given at the level  of a division will of course have to be in English.    [Woyciechowski] That means that Polish generals will be  communicating with their British or American colleagues in  English?    [Milewski] Not just Polish generals, but all Polish officers  should speak English, just as is the case with armies of  Western, non-English-speaking countries.    [Woyciechowski] Newspapers publish a poll today conducted by  the Public Opinion Research Center in which Poles are asked the  question: In case of a danger to its independence, can Poland  rely on Western aid? Fifty-one percent of Poles say absolutely  no, 32 percent say yes, and 17 percent -- don't know. Could you  answer the question for those 17 percent of Polish people who do  not know? So the question is: Can Poland rely on Western aid  or not?    [Milewski] Poland can rely on Western aid on the condition  that Poland can first demonstrate it is capable of making its  own defense effort -- then Poland can rely on being provided  additional foreign aid. But if Poland does not show any effort  on its own and if it was to wait passively for someone to give  Poland a protective umbrella as a gift, then in that case, it  will not receive the umbrella.    [Woyciechowski] So to translate into plain language what you  have said here: Poland should defend itself for some days or  some weeks, and only then.... [pauses] Is my understanding  correct, or did I overdo it?    [Milewski] You missed the point. Once the conflict is in  progress, then it is too late since such conflicts erupt very  suddenly nowadays. In practical terms, the issue is that in a  situation where Poland has already joined the Partnership for  Peace program, Poland should show its high activity as part of  the program; it should demonstrate a real effort toward  integration with NATO forces. In that case, we will have a  response from the other side. But if all we do is passively  wait and just keep asking for shipments of new tanks, new  aircraft, and also keep asking for protection, and if we fail to  demonstrate the effort I mentioned -- in that case we may not  receive aid. After all, there is a simple rule in effect in the  West: Help yourself first, and only then will I also [words  indistinct] aid to you.    [Woyciechowski] Now, the efforts that you have talked  about -- do they reflect the political will of the Polish  Government and the will of other Polish authorities? Or is this  simply money?    [Milewski] First, this is a political will....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this will present today?    [Milewski] Well, yes, it is declared by all three branches  of authority in Poland: by the legislative, executive, and....  [pauses] Well, the judicial authorities are actually not making  any statements....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But there is the problem of  money.    [Milewski] No, an organizational effort must also be made by  the entire defense system in Poland, in which, of course, the  Army is the most important element.    [Woyciechowski] Today the arms industry has announced a  four-hour strike. Some factories will be on strike all day. In  one of today's dailies, SZTANDAR [MLODYCH], I have found  information that one of the things that the unionists are  protesting is the fact that the government has recently blocked  two major contracts for the sale of tanks; they claim that these  two contracts for the sale of Polish tanks abroad would have  saved the arms industry in Poland. Is this true?    [Milewski] I do not know anything about the government's  blocking any contracts of our arms industry. However, I do know  that it is very difficult to sell our military equipment abroad  because it really is of poorer quality than products available  in the West. The advantage that we have is that our products  are much cheaper. However, our closest neighbors are somehow  more skilled in trade -- they are in the same conditions as we  are....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are probably referring to  the Czech Republic, are you not?    [Milewski] I am referring to the Czech Republic, Hungary.    [Woyciechowski] Is it today not so that some countries would  be willing to buy Polish tanks and Polish cannons; some  countries would like to purchase them because they are not sold  by anyone else -- for political reasons -- and we do not want to  sell anything like that to those countries because they are  under UN sanctions?    [Milewski] If a country is under UN sanctions, then we  certainly must respect that.    [Woyciechowski] And we cannot violate them, even for  economic reasons?    [Milewski] No, we cannot violate them because in such a case  the political as well as material losses that our country would  incur would be much greater than any profit derived from such a  contract.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us change the subject for  a while. Do you think that the prime minister has the right to  recall a deputy minister without the consent of the relevant  minister?    [Milewski] This question should actually be addressed to the  prime minister. The prime minister appoints both deputy  ministers and general directors in all ministries; that is to  say, if we go by the rule that the mode of appointing those  officials is the same as the mode of recalling them, then we  must say that the prime minister undoubtedly is entitled to  recall them. However, the relevant minister should be involved  in this process because it is, in fact, he who selects his  cooperators. Nevertheless, in exceptional situations, as we  know, also such situations are possible -- not only in Poland,  but also in the West.    [Woyciechowski] Some people believe that in recent days, or  in recent weeks, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], one of the  coalition partners, wants your scalp -- it wants the scalp of  Milewski. It wants you recalled from the post of MON deputy  minister.    [Milewski] Well, no one has told me about that; no one told  me that someone is after my scalp. However, I can sometimes  hear the criticism -- which is completely unfounded -- that I  allegedly fulfill various functions in various segments of  authority, which is said to violate the principle of the  division of powers. I would like to say now that this is false,  because the principle of division of powers means that different  people are related to the legislative branch, different people  to the executive branch, and different people to the judicial  branch. These powers should not be combined; for example,  deputies, who are members of the legislative branch, should not  be appointed ministers and deputy ministers. Now, the  president's and the prime minister's segments are two segments  of the executive branch which should be integrated with each  other. Therefore, shortening the distance between the Belvedere  establishments and the establishments of the Office of the  Council of Ministers is not only possible, but should be  recommended.    [Woyciechowski] Like a good soldier, you are defending  yourself through attack. I have discerned this allusion to the  coalition's desire to introduce a minister of SLD to MON. You  implied that a deputy should not simultaneously be a deputy  minister. What does the situation in MON really look like: Is  it going to have a minister proposed by SLD and the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL], or not?    [Milewski] If there are experts who will be able to fulfill  various functions -- functions of deputy ministers, general  directors, department heads -- then I can see no reason why they  should not fulfill them; in MON, and certainly in MON under  Piotr Kolodziejczyk, people are selected for reasons other than  political-- the main criterion is that of expertise. However,  if the only purpose of the operation of introducing new deputy  ministers is the limitation of constitutional powers of the  minister in his ministry, then this just cannot be accepted.    [Woyciechowski] Is it possible, then, that within a month  new deputy ministers -- proposed by SLD or PSL -- will come to  MON?    [Milewski] I find it difficult to make any statement on  behalf of the minister, who is on leave; however, as far as I  know about the plans that he approved and submitted to us when  he was taking over the office of MON head, I can tell you that  he will not make any selection based on criteria other than  substantive, and that he will not agree that any other --  political or ideological -- criteria be taken into account. The  minister accepts exclusively the criterion of expertise.    [Woyciechowski] This means that new deputy ministers will  come if they are nonpolitical experts. Can we say that?    [Milewski] This is what I think I can say on behalf of my  superior. However, he has not authorized me to....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The minister is on holiday in  the mountains. Do you not like winter in the mountains? Will  you be in Warsaw, or will you leave?    [Milewski] I like winter in the mountains very much. I was  a mountaineer. However, I no longer spend my holiday in the  mountains -- not only because I have no time for that, but also  because I am already past the age when one can climb mountains.    [Woyciechowski] Do you ski?    [Milewski] No, I do not. I have never skied; I have always  devoted my free time to mountaineering.    [Woyciechowski] Now, let us change the subject once again:  Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy. What do you  think of him?    [Milewski] I think that Zhirinovskiy himself is a dangerous  character, maybe as dangerous as Hitler. However, the emergence  of Zhirinovskiy is the result of a certain climate which has  dominated Russia. This climate is dangerous. In a situation of  great poverty in everyday life, many people in that country are  still being fed by the vision of imperialism, a vision of being  the most important country in the world; it is an abstract  vision that is contrary to the well-understood interests of the  Russian people and other peoples of the Russian Federation.  Now, the emergence of Zhirinovskiy has made it obvious to us  that such a social trend is dominating in that country. It is a  very dangerous trend. Thus, I would say that Zhirinovskiy is  actually doing us a favor -- by revealing this trend, the  existence of which many Western politicians did not want to  believe. Well, we know perfectly well that it is there.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Milewski] Good-bye.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: A mixed double - Concert Before the Wigmore Hall shut up shop for refurbishing, a pair of French-Canadian artists offered striking rewards in two recitals that included Beethoven's five sonatas for cello and piano. On Tuesday Sophie Rolland and Marc-Andre Hamelin resurfaced at St. John's, Smith Square, with a frankly cello-oriented programme: bright chances for the pianist in their Grieg and Samuel Barber sonatas, all of which Hamelin seized eagerly, but basically soloist-and-accompanist stuff. As a musical partnership, it is virtually seamless. There were keen interpretative insights in every work. In Martinu's seductive Variations on a Slovakian Theme, Miss Rolland sported ripely ethnic portamento swoops whilst Hamelin conjured up cimbalom-sounds; in Grieg's A minor Sonata he rang all the echoes of the much-loved Concerto in the same key, while the cellist adapted her portamenti to Victorian salon-style. They found no clear trajectory through Barber's early Sonata, but they lit up its passing ideas as vividly as could be. There was nevertheless a sense of some restraint,of compromise. Hamelin has been described as a 'super-virtuoso'; more precisely, he is a thoughtful young musician with an all-encompassing technique - incisive dispatch, brilliant clarity in quick passages, gorgeously balanced chords. Contrariwise Miss Rolland's address is soft-grained and discreetly suggestive, unemphatic, elusive: I soon lost count of the times when she began what we expected to be a broad line with a brittle sforzando/piano, a sudden stab reduced at once to a bated-breath hush. In late Debussy she capitalised upon the trick to striking effect. That Sonata is at once haunted and mannered, abrupt and whimsical; Rolland captured not only its sudden mood-switches, but also its sense of a chill ironic distance. Its original title was to have been Pierrot fache avec la lune ('Pierrot being cross with the moon'), invoking both commedia dell'arte and an absurdist joke - for which Hamelin scaled-down scrupulously to play an elegant foil to Rolland's nervy soliloquising. Yet the swimmy St. John's acoustic guaranteed that the piano-resonance would swallow up the cello's bass-register: even when Rolland was at her most delicate and agile down there, what we heard was only a soft oleaginous mutter. As solo-with-accompaniment, a lot of the music sounded the wrong way round. I think she deserves another partner with a naturally chamber-sized attack, and Hamelin a thrusting competitor of another clean-edged, super-polished order.

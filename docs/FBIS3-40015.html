			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The German  Government supports the U.S. position of getting Japan to open  its market "not only in words but with actions," German Economy  Minister Gunter Rexrodt said here today. The official  emphasized, however, that Germany's support for Washington would  be limited if the United States simply wishes to establish  export or market quotas, because such measures could damage all  international trade.    Last week, the United States announced it will retaliate  against Japan because the Far Eastern nation has not allowed  several U.S.-made products to enter its market.    The German minister, who has been on an official visit here  since last Thursday [17 February], asserted that placing limits  on exports will only lead to bilateralism, which runs against  multinational agreements. He explained that such a decision  "would violate GATT and would conflict with the interests of the  world's large exporting nations."    Rexrodt said his country's investments in Mexico will  increase if Mexico signs an agreement for reciprocal promotion  and protection of investments. In 1993, 31 percent of Mexico's  exports to Europe went to Germany and, in turn, Germany became  Mexico's foremost commercial partner in the region.    After meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello  Macias, Rexrodt explained that Germany has given Mexico priority  status in its relations with Latin America. An example of this,  he said, is the "Technogerma Mexico 1994" industrial fair, which  was inaugurated by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  on Monday.</p>

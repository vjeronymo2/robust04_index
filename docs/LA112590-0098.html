			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROP. C FALLOUT  </P> <P> While generally accurate and fair, The Times' article on the Proposition C  aftermath ("Animal Advocates Unbowed by Defeat," Nov. 15) contains an  inflammatory quote certain to leave a wrong impression.  </P> <P> In the story, a Los Angeles "animal activist" called vivisectors to task,  describing them in derogatory terms.  </P> <P> The article then connected the quoted woman to the San Diego coalition opposing  Proposition C.  </P> <P> The woman quoted was not a part of the San Diego County coalition to defeat  Proposition C, and was not authorized to speak for that coalition or for San  Diego-based Stop Taking Our Pets. It is unfortunate that the article did not  make that clear.  </P> <P> The crux of Proposition C was and is pound seizure -- pets in research -- not  the broader issue of vivisection and its practitioners.  </P> <P> Incidentally, there were plenty of quotable anti-Proposition C people available  locally without going so far afield for opinions on a San Diego County Issue.  </P> <P> ROBERT S. MELVIN, Co-Founder, Stop Taking Our Pets  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Democrats tackle North: Independents struggle to enter Senate race Virginian voters in a Democratic party primary election will choose today a candidate to face the Republican nominee Mr Oliver North for a seat in the US Senate. Incumbent Senator Chuck Robb is generally expected to sweep the primary, but the real race will be elsewhere as independent candidates battle to gather enough nominating signatures to get their names on the ballot for November. By the time the polls close at 7 pm (11 pm GMT), Mr Douglas Wilder, Democratic former governor of Virginia, and Mr Marshall Coleman, Republican former state attorney-general, must present documents with about 15,000 signatures, including at least 200 from each Congressional district in the state. Their independent candidacies are expected to be crucial in an election where neither of the main party candidates has wide support. Mr Robb, once a rising star of the Democratic party, has been tarnished in the eyes of many voters by his sexual peccadilloes. His acknowledgment of a naked massage, but nothing more, by a beauty queen has entered the comic lexicon of US politics with President Bill Clinton's insistance that, yes, he had smoked marijuana but did not inhale. Many ardent Republicans are expected to vote for him today in the primary, in the belief that he is the candidate Mr North can most easily defeat. Mr Robb could lose many votes, especially among the mostly Democratic black Virginians, to Mr Wilder, the first African-American elected a state governor since the Reconstruction period immediately after the Civil War. Mr North was a central figure in the Iran-contra scheme to send arms to Iran in exchange for the release of US hostages held in Lebanon. That damaged President Ronald Reagan's later years in office. Mr North commands fervent adoration from the mostly right-wing and religious Republicans who nominated him, but deep distrust from almost everyone else, including many centrist Republicans.</p>

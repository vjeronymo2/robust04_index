			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: VW's 29 hours GERMANY is struggling to adapt manufacturing employment to reduced demand for its high-cost goods. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, German unemployment will grow from 7.7 to 11.3 per cent of the workforce between 1992 and 1994 - a far bigger increase than in any other large industrial country. Volkswagen, the loss-making motor group, faces not only the general problems of German industry, but also some specific ones caused by inability to control costs during previous periods of capacity expansion. It is, however, not clear whether the company's radical proposal for a four-day week from January 1 maps out the route to recovery. Volkswagen says it needs to cut its 108,000-strong workforce to 72,000 by the end of 1995 - a consequence of stagnating sales and big productivity improvements. Labour reductions of this order can be avoided, VW maintains, only if employees agree both a 20 per cent cut in working hours - to 28.8 from 36 per week - and equivalent reductions in wages. The IG Metall trade union, which in the past has led an industry-wide drive for shorter hours, has ruled out 20 per cent pay cuts, but indicated willingness to compromise. Bound by a commitment to the Lower Saxony government, VW's largest shareholder, to maintain a 100,000-strong domestic workforce until the end of 1994, the company's chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, badly needs a deal. However, in his efforts to press through wage cuts, he holds strong negotiating cards. Germany's labour costs, having failed to adjust to straitened economic circumstances, are too high, while VW workers earn roughly 10 per cent more than in other German motor groups. The company may partly offset reductions in workers' living standards with cash which would have been deployed for redundancy programmes. Provided IG Metall agrees appropriate pay cuts, the plan could grant Volkswagen breathing space in which to work out longer-term arrangements for lowering costs. Yet unless the company can foresee a relatively speedy return to five-day working (at present unlikely), cuts in working hours will not be more than a short-term expedient for tackling the fundamental problem of over-manning and excess capacity. Such deals have only limited applications for companies in similar predicaments. They do not tackle the non-wage costs which represent an important burden on German companies. Additionally, across-the-board reductions in pay and hours, demanding equal cuts in living standards from all workers, irrespective of their productivity, could even counter the move to more flexible working practices which Germany urgently needs. German labour and management are showing welcome readiness to negotiate solutions to the country's industrial difficulties. But they are still only at the beginning of the adjustment process.</p>

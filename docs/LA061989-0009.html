			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: RECRUITS GET LIFESAVER IN SINK-OR-SWIM BOOT CAMP  </P> <P> It sounds corny, but young men and women still join the Navy to see the world.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some never see anything more than boot camp and are back on a  homeward-bound bus after a few frustrating weeks. It costs the Navy time and  money, and leaves the failed recruit with a lifetime of explanations.  </P> <P> Last year, 21% of the 25,292 recruits at the Navy boot camp in San Diego washed  out. Similar rates also plagued the Navy's other two boot camps, in Great  Lakes, Ill., and Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman says the attrition rate is "unacceptably high in today's tough  recruiting market and shrinking manpower pool." It's a stubborn problem that  has defied numerous remedies.  </P> <P> The latest attempt is a three-month experiment under way at all three camps, in  which there will be no "drops" during the first  </P> <P> three weeks of the 8 1/2-week training course. Studies show that 85% of the  washouts fail in the first three weeks.  </P> <P> No more. Foundering recruits are to be targeted for counseling and additional  attention to provide "added motivation."  </P> <P> Two skills are particularly troublesome: swimming and reading. Remedial  instruction has been strengthened in both.  </P> <P> Sailors who still cannot swim after boot camp will be assigned to shore duty  while undergoing further swimming instruction.  </P> <P> "We get a lot of fine young sailors from Kansas and Iowa who've never seen  water until they hit San Diego," said a Navy spokesman. "We want to give them  every chance to make it."  </P> <P> Along with the new buckle-down policy, the Navy is also trying a sweetener to  encourage recruits to tough it out. A fringe benefit phased out in 1979 to save  money has been reinstituted: a 15-day leave for all recruits who complete boot  camp.  </P> <P> Hot Fans, Cool Cod  </P> <P> Short shots:  </P> <P> It's a good thing that the Padres' Jack Clark has shown signs of emerging from  his batting slump. The fans were getting hostile.  </P> <P> Last week a group down the third base line held up eye charts every time Clark  came to bat.  </P> <P> And when a fan spotted an ambulance outside the stadium, he yelled, "Hey, are  Clark's bats in there? They need some emergency treatment." He wasn't joking.  </P> <P> Sorry, Greenpeace. The San Diego school system is buying 30,000 pounds of  Icelandic cod fillet for $56,700. The environmental group had asked that no  Icelandic cod be bought for school cafeterias to protest Iceland's allowance of  whale hunting.  </P> <P> School Supt. Tom Payzant decided to go ahead with the purchase.  </P> <P> His reasons: Iceland has promised to rethink its whaling practices, Icelandic  cod is cheaper than Canadian cod, and Icelandic cod doesn't have "as fishy a  taste."  </P> <P> Go Ahead and Sue  </P> <P> Update: First the judges called the Leonard-Hearns fight a draw. Now the city  attorney has rendered a verdict in Wolfsheimer-Dickey: Wolfsheimer on a split  decision.  </P> <P> Alan F. Dickey, chairman of the Rancho de Los Penasquitos Planning Board, had  protested that Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer violated the Brown Act by  strong-arming him into turning off his tape recorder at a meeting of a citizens  committee.  </P> <P> Chief Deputy City Atty. Ted Bromfield says no violation took place because the  committee was not formed by the City Council and thus is not subject to the  Brown Act.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the committee does not fit what the council had in mind when  it decided that a citizens committee should provide recommendations on spending  $2.2 million in developer fees in Rancho Penasquitos. Wolfsheimer merely formed  a committee and installed herself as chairwoman.  </P> <P> Bromfield's decision throws the committee matter back to the council. Other  council members may have their own ideas on who should be on the committee and  how it should be run.  </P> <P> Bromfield writes that, should Dickey disagree with his decision, "he is free to  challenge further action by mandamus," which to you and me is a lawsuit. Dickey  says he's busy making a living and can't afford a mandamus.  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Italy plans to give banks wider role THE BANK of Italy is to seek changes in legislation to permit banks to invest directly in non-financial concerns. The announcement was made yesterday by Mr Antonio Fazio, the new governor of the Bank of Italy, presenting the central bank's annual report. The changes could have important ramifications for the Ciampi government's privatisation programme, allowing the banks to take stakes in the L30,000bn (Pounds 13.1bn) sell-off planned over the next three years. Mr Fazio avoided spelling out details of the proposal or the extent to which state-controlled banks, which account for nearly two thirds of the banking system, should become involved. He merely said: 'The limits on the size of shareholding in a given company will be defined on the basis of the bank's assets, its structure, results and management.' He was also careful to point out that the banks 'must not act as shareholders of last resort nor convert debts into shares in companies making chornic losses.' It was not clear whether the move represented a genuine attempt to expand the role of Italian banks or the provision of a safety net for government sell-offs. At a time of recession with limited prospective buyers, a small stock exchange and the public's savings heavily geared towards buying high yielding/low tax treasury bills, the Italian banks are among the few institutions with the resources to help out. Mr Fazio took over as governor on May 4 after designation of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as prime minister. Under Mr Ciampi, the governor's annual speech had become the most important occasion on which the Bank of Italy judged the state of the economy and government policy. With Mr Ciampi as prime minister, Mr Fazio's strictures against government efforts to reduce the public sector deficit were low key. He contented himself with saying it was vital that the 1993 public sector deficit of L155,000bn had to be reduced in absolute terms in 1994 and succeeding years. He pledged to work to help reduce the real cost of money which remained well above the EC norm. He predicted growth in 1993 would 'not be above the already modest levels of 1992' when the economy grew 0.8 per cent. He said a surge in exports as a result of the lira's devaluation could provide a launch-pad for higher growth but inflation had to be held down. He declined to predict an end of year figure for inflation, currently running at 4 per cent annually. In a brief reference to the economic effects of the corruption scandals, Mr Fazio said bribes and contract rigging had swollen public spending. 'The ending of these practices in the short term could act as a break on economic activity; but very quickly a more open market system will benefit us all.' A significant part of Mr Fazio's statement was taken up by a defence of the Bank of Italy's commitment to fixed exchange rates within the European Monetary System and the handling of the EC currency crisis in September. Between mid-June and mid-September 1992, Italy lost Dollars 48bn in reserves. The bank has suggested no date for re-joining the ERM but Mr Fazio yesterday appeared to share the commitment of his predecessor for closer monetary union: 'Rather than changing the rules of the EMS, it is a question of having full co-operation on their proper implementation.'</p>

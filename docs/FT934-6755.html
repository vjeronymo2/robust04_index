			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australia's CSR lifts payout by 20% after strong first half CSR, the large Australian timber, building materials, aluminium and sugar group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in first-half profits after tax and abnormal items, at ADollars 173m (USDollars 114.2m). Total revenue in the six months to end-September rose by 17 per cent to ADollars 2.83bn. Abnormals were nil, compared with a ADollars 9.9m surplus in the first six months of 1992-93. CSR traditionally enjoys a stronger trading period in its first half. However, Mr Geoffrey Kells, managing director, yesterday stressed that the company expected the 'strong profit improvement' to continue into the second half, and the overall results for the year to end-March 1994, to be 'substantially higher' than last time's ADollars 211.2m (after tax but before abnormals). The interim dividend is being increased by 20 per cent, to 12 cents a share. With the figures exceeding analysts' expectations, CSR shares bucked a falling stock market yesterday and added 2 cents to ADollars 4.70. CSR said that the improvement came from all divisions, with operating profit before interest, foreign exchange considerations and tax rising by 18 per cent to ADollars 328.8m. The core Australian building and construction materials division saw operating profits of ADollars 127.5m, against ADollars 118.6m last time; the North American construction materials business made ADollars 70.7m, up from ADollars 56.1m; timber products, helped by productivity gains and higher sales volume, more than doubled to ADollars 35.5m from ADollars 14.9m; and aluminium, in spite of depressed prices, contributed ADollars 36.9m, compared with ADollars 18.8m. The weakest spot was the sugar division, where operating profits were marginally higher at ADollars 87.5m, against ADollars 86.9m. CSR blamed 'intense' competition in Australia's refined sugar markets, and stressed that it was still arguing its case before the Trade Practices Commission, which last week provisionally ruled against a refined sugar joint venture between CSR and Mackay Refined Sugar.</p>

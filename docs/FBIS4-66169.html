			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Pengjun (1728 7720 6511) of the Foreign </F> Trade Department, Northeast Finance and Economics University:  "Protection of Service Marks in China"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Legal Status of Service  Marks in China    So far, China has no sound legal system to protect service  marks. Article 4 of the Chinese Trademark Law states:  "Enterprises, institutions, and self-employed workers and  businessmen wishing to have rights to the exclusive use of  trademarks for the commodities they are producing,  manufacturing, processing, turning out by selection processes,  or putting on the market for sale should apply to the Trademark  Bureau for registration of the trademarks." As can be seen, the  trademarks protected by the Chinese Trademark Law cannot be  separated from commodities. That is, only trademarks for  commodities are protected by the Trademark Law, while service  marks are not. Of course, in actual practice, service-type  enterprises that also produce and sell commodities sometimes may  register their service marks as trademarks in the hope of  getting legal protection. From the perspective of the Trademark  Law, however, those service marks are protected simply because  they are treated as trademarks. If someone uses a mark identical  with or similar to the registered trademark as his or her own  service mark, the act will not constitute an infringement, and  the one who originally registered the trademark will have no  right to ban such use or claim indemnity under the Trademark Law.    In some countries, service marks are protected not only by  the trademark law but also through the adoption of an  anti-unethical competition law. The two kinds of protection  differ from each other. Generally speaking, to be protected by  the anti-unethical competition law, the service mark must be  well-known to the public, and it is necessary to prove that use  of the service mark by others would confuse the public and that  such use has already occurred and constituted an act of  unethical competition. The "Anti-Unethical Competition Law of  the People's Republic of China" adopted on 2 September 1993  stresses the protection of trademarks but lacks explicit  provisions on service mark protection. So we can say that now in  our country service marks are neither protected by the Trademark  Law nor safeguarded by the Anti-Unethical Competition Law as in  some foreign countries.    With the acceleration of China's market-oriented economic  construction, the tertiary industry is playing an increasingly  striking role in the whole national economy. Obviously, the  pertinent laws and systems currently in effect in our country  can no longer meet the needs of service mark protection. Now  that more and more countries in the world are legally protecting  service marks, we should lose no time in formulating our own  laws and systems for this purpose. Based on the successful  experience of most countries, we should, first of all, enlarge  the scope of protection by our Trademark Law. Necessary  provisions should be included in the Trademark Law so that it  will protect service marks as well. By revising this law, we  should establish a service mark registration system similar to  the one for the registration of commodity marks. Since service  mark registration has many unique problems that do not exist in  the ordinary trademark protection system (such as the unit or  individual with the right to use the service mark, the  definition and scope of the service, the makeup of the service  mark, and infringement on the service mark), an essential  question to be studied in revising the Trademark Law is how to  properly proceed with the legislation of service mark  protection. Apart from this, we should consider adding a  clear-cut provision on service mark protection to the  Anti-Unethical Competition Law. This way we will not only be  able to prevent unauthorized use of properly registered  commercial marks, trade and service marks alike, but can also  give them legal protection if the rightful interests are hurt  through unethical competition, whether the marks have been  registered or not. We will thus improve our legal system for  service mark protection to meet the needs of our country's  economic development and the program of reform and opening up.</p>

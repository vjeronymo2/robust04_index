			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Hurd backs Kiev plans to destroy nuclear weapons MR DOUGLAS HURD, the British foreign secretary, yesterday visited Ukraine to discuss the republic's efforts to move to a market economy and its plans to dismantle nuclear weapons on its territory. Mr Hurd, who was in Kiev, the capital, between trips to Kazakhstan and Russia, arrived at a tense time: Ukraine's relations with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have been strained nearly to breaking point by a dispute over the division of the Soviet military. Although Mr Hurd said the issue was not raised in his discussions with the leadership, he said 'it would be a pity' if Ukraine left the Commonwealth and urged it to follow the example of the European Community in resolving conflicts between member states through negotiation. Over the weekend, in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata, Mr Hurd received assurances from the republic's president that Kazakhstan would join the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and intended to become a nuclear-free state. He received similar reassurances from Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Konstantin Morozov, minister of defence. Ukraine has been steadfast in its plans to dismantle nuclear weapons. Mr Hurd praised it for setting dates for the removal and destruction of nuclear weapons on its soil and said Nato countries 'will be willing to make what contributions will be necessary to the progress of dismantling nuclear weapons'. Mr Hurd also said he was 'encouraged' by the manner in which Ukraine and other republics were negotiating the reduction of conventional forces and believed it would be possible for them to abide by the Vienna Agreement on Conventional Forces in Europe. On the economic front, Mr Hurd said Ukraine's application for full membership in the IMF was a priority and should serve as a cornerstone in the republic's efforts to move to a market economy. In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said republics of the former Soviet Union would continue to receive western economic aid only if they convinced the west they were honouring international arms control agreements, Reuter reports. In an interview published yesterday, Mr Kohl spelled out a link between aid for the CIS and assurances that agreements signed by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev would be honoured. 'In our talks on western aid, we must make clear to those responsible in the former Soviet republics that trust is a precondition for help,' he said.</p>

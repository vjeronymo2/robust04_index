			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Motoring: Real stars do outshine those with facelifts - Geneva's talk of the town has stayed away THERE are so many genuinely new models, as distinct from mature but facelifted ones, at Geneva's Salon International de l'Automobile this week that picking the star is a problem. Is it Ford's Mondeo, Citroen's Xantia, Peugeot's 306 or the Opel Corsa? Or even a new and seductive Aston Martin DB7? If money and sheer size were the only criteria, the star would be a one-off Rolls-Royce convertible that weighs in at 3.5 tonnes, measures 21 ft (6.3 metres) long and can be yours, squire, for just Pounds 2.1m. Yes, 2.1m pounds sterling, not dollars or marks, is the price of this over-egged monster with a front end like that of the late and unlamented 1975 Camargue two-door, arguably the worst car Rolls-Royce ever made. If you fancy something a little nimbler, how about a V12, 500 hp, four-wheel driven Bugatti EB112 four-door which, with a top speed of about 200 mph (322 kph), is claimed to be the world's fastest saloon car? This is a joint effort between Bugatti Automobili and Italdesign. It looks remarkably like the Kensington, a V12-engined Jaguar concept by Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro. This car - a genuine runner, not a mock-up  -caused a sensation at Geneva in 1990 but little has been heard of it since. Is the Pounds 175,000 Bugatti a technological masterpiece or a hostage to fortune? It depends what role you see for the motor car in a future dominated by radar camera-enforced speed limits and concern for the environment. Back in the real world, a probable star of the show would be the Mercedes-Benz C-class - if only it were there. This is the car that will succeed the 190, the best-selling model ever to wear the three-pointed star. The C-class had been expected to make a Geneva debut but, having issued pictures and some details a week or so ago, Mercedes-Benz seems to have felt there was no need to display the car at the salon. It will be at the Frankfurt show in September, three months after going on sale in Germany and other left-hand drive markets. Britons will see it at London's Motorfair in October, by which time right-hand drive cars may be in British showrooms. Citroen and Opel think differently from Mercedes-Benz. They, too, leaked information about the new Xantia and Corsa well before their media launches last month. Yet, both made their new cars the centre of their stands in Geneva. Even so, the C-class is a major talking point there. Although only 1.5 in (4 cm) longer than the 190, it is said to be much roomier and more comfortable and to come with an air-bag as standard on the driver's side. Buyers will have a choice of four multi-valve petrol engines (1.8-litre, 122 hp; two-litre, 136 hp; 2.2-litre, 150 hp; and 2.8-litre, 197 hp) and two new diesels (2.2-litre, 95 hp and 2.5-litre, 112 hp). These are the world's first diesels with four valves per cylinder. Although the proof, as ever, will be in the driving, the C-class is likely to become the benchmark car in its category. That is what the 190 has been for the past 11 years, during which more than 2m have been sold, 72,000 of them in Britain. The General Motors' Opel Corsa, which I drove in Spain last week, is an attractive small car - or, rather, two small cars. Because the three- and five-door versions look so different, it is hard to credit they share the same platforms, power trains and suspensions. When the 17-model Corsa range  -which replaces the Nova - goes on sale in Britain this spring, there will be 1.2-litre, 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre petrol-engined versions and two 1.5-litre diesels, one of them turbo-charged. All Corsas bristle with safety and security items, like seat belts that tighten automatically in a crash and side-impact protection beams. Door deadlocks are available now; a driver's airbag will be by the year's end. Of the four I drove, my favourite was the 1.4-litre, 82 hp GLS petrol model  -but only by a very short head from the 67 hp TD turbo-diesel, which has an exhaust catalyser to make it super-clean. They rode like big cars, not super-minis, on Andalucia's best and worst roads. And they proved - as has Nissan's Micra - that buyers of small, cheap cars can now enjoy the quietness and refinement once found only in large, expensive ones. A 109 hp, 16-valve Corsa 1.6i was a rousing performer, smooth on the motorway, nimble on bends but a bit knobbly on granite setts. These are early days to be talking about Car of the Year 1994, as votes will not be cast until late autumn. But it could well be a four-horse race between Mondeo and Corsa, Xantia and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. If so, my money probably will be on the Mondeo. Apart from the three main Geneva debutantes (Mondeo, Corsa and Xantia), Peugeot is displaying its 309 replacement, the 306, first seen last month at Amsterdam Show. And Nissan's Spanish-built Terrano II, which also will be marketed by Ford as the Maverick, also makes its bow. This recreational, on/off-road estate, with three or five doors, has selectable four-wheel drive and a 2.4-litre petrol or 2.7-litre turbo-diesel engine. It will, no doubt, perform as capably as any of the present generation of high-slung 4x4s on the rare occasions it is taken seriously off-road. But Nissan's aim has been to produce a civilised alternative to a conventional, up-to-seven-seat family estate car, that will pull horse trailers and will not allow owners to look foolish by getting stuck in muddy car parks. Both the Terrano II and its Ford Maverick clone enter Britain's burgeoning 4x4 market early in summer. Aston Martin lifted the veil on the DB7, its first really new car in more than 20 years. In contrast to the two-ton, V8-engined, dinosaur Aston Martins, the DB7 is of the same bloodline as the DB6 that died in 1971, although entirely up to date. It looks a proper, hard-topped 2+2 sports coupe. More importantly, massive pulling power from low revolutions promises easy driveability in traffic. With a five-speed manual gearbox or four-speed automatic, and standard air-conditioning, the DB7 will sell in Britain for under Pounds 80,000 from early 1994. Before that, Ferrari's new 348 Spider, shown for the first time at Geneva, will be available for less than Pounds 80,000 to UK buyers this summer. A strictly two-seat car with a 3.4-litre, four-cam V8, it is motoring's forbidden fruit personified. The Salon International de l'Automobile is being held at Palexpo, adjoining Geneva airport, until March 14.</p>

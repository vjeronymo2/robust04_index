			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Former oil chief and his wife found dead A FORMER executive of an oil and gas group who shared in one of the biggest post-takeover payments in British corporate history has been discovered drowned after apparently battering his wife to death, Jimmy Burns writes. Police yesterday named the dead man as Mr David Elton, a 48-year-old former executive director of Ultramar, which was bought by Lasmo after a three-month Pounds 1.1bn takeover battle last December. Mr Elton's body was found on Monday morning floating in the sea, a few miles from his second home in Middleton-on-Sea, West Sussex. Police had earlier discovered the body of Mr Elton's 43-year-old wife Jane at the house. She had died from head wounds. Police said last night that Mrs Elton's death was being treated as murder, but that following the discovery of Mr Elton's body they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder. Mr Elton resigned from the Ultramar board in January. Within days Lasmo announced that he and six other former directors would share an Pounds 8.1m pay-out, including a top-up to their pension funds. The package included Pounds 4.8m for termination of contracts, and Pounds 1.9m for pension contributions. Mr Elton was thought to be under stress after the takeover and the death of his mother.</p>

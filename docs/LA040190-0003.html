			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> There is something really offensive about The Times' printing an account of  deconstruction by Jack Smith, who admits to being "ignorant," and even  "frightened" by it (Feb. 11). If he doesn't understand deconstructionist  theory, then why does he proceed to write about it? Just about everything he  says is, indeed, meaningless (which is not, by the way, the same as ambiguous).  </P> <P> Worst of all, his proud display of ignorance is packaged in his usual annoying,  self-congratulatory style. He calls deconstruction "an esoteric critical  methodology that seems to undermine my temple and my reason for being." So, his  reason for being is to understand everything readily, at face value, without  ambivalence? And he's criticizing a scholarly movement?  </P> <P> I admit that deconstructionist theory can be difficult to grasp, but an article  that makes fun of it by a person who does not understand it does nothing to  further anyone's knowledge and, in fact, belittles anyone who desires to really  learn, unlike Smith, who is just looking for another excuse to show his ability  to turn any topic into a cutesy Sunday magazine piece.  </P> <P> KATIE DUNIGAN HUGHES  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

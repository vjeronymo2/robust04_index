			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's coffee output decline THE NUMBER of trees producing coffee in Brazil has fallen from 4.2bn to 3.2bn since 1988, according to a survey by the National Coffee Council, a producer group. The study says that the country's output is expected to drop from the estimated 26m-28m sacks for last season to 18m-20m for 1992-93. International prices for the commodity, now at the lowest level for two decades, are primarily responsible for the decreased production, says Mr Luiz Sergio de Paiva Pereira, director of the coffee division of the Pocos de Caldas Regional Coffee Producers' Co-operative, in Minas Gerais state. 'Unless things turn around, we believe that output will continue to fall gradually,' he predicts. 'At current prices, income doesn't even cover production costs.' The CNC study reveals that 55 per cent of the country's coffee plantations are considered to be in a poor state of upkeep. Another 35 per cent are believed 'unsatisfactory'. Yields are low, with 60 per cent of plantations producing less than five bags (60 kg each) per hectare. Many producers are shifting, where feasible, to alternative crops - to sugar-cane and citrus fruits in the south-central state of Sao Paulo and to soyabeans and wheat in the southern state of Parana, says Mr Pereira. But in the mountainous regions in the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, 'it is often a case of pure and simple abandonment', he says. Generally, these farmers are using their land for cattle grazing, often without pulling up the coffee plants. The CNC is using the study to back its request for government assistance for the coffee sector. It has developed a 74-point plan that includes proposals for tax reductions, investment in productivity and the establishment of an official body to carry out many of the functions once handled by the Brazilian Coffee Institute, abolished by President Fernando Collor de Mello when he took office in March 1990. One of the sector's main requests, the roll-over of its debt, was fulfilled by the government last week.</p>

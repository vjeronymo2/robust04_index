			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Speculation about NBC TV bid persists Speculation about a possible takeover of the NBC television network continued yesterday after a senior NBC executive stopped short of issuing an outright denial of reports that General Electric, NBC's parent group, has been considering selling all or part of the network to Time Warner. Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, would only say that a report that NBC and Time Warner had been negotiating a sale of the network for Dollars 2.5bn was not accurate. A spokesman for Time Warner, meanwhile, said the group would not comment on the story. Mr Wright's comments failed to dampen takeover speculation on Wall Street, which has been buzzing with rumours about upheaval in the US network television market. The latest talk of a NBC takeover was accompanied by reports that Walt Disney has been negotiating to buy the CBS network, which earlier this year failed to merge with the QVC television home-shopping company. The takeover rumours lifted GE and CBS's share prices yesterday, even though most leading stocks on Wall Street were lower. GE climbed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 50 1/4 , and CBS rose Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 332 1/2 , while Time Warner fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38. Disney closed unchanged.</p>

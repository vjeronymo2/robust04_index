			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Australia beef exports hit by US - Trade officials fear other nations may join sales ban after pesticide concerns Australian trade officials yesterday sought to lessen a threat to the country's ADollars 3bn (Dollars 2.2bn) a year beef export industry after a decision by the US to halt the sale of Australian beef until further notice. The US action follows a temporary ban on the sale of Australian beef by Japanese retailers. Both countries acted after tests which showed that some beef consignments might be contaminated with a chemical pesticide used in cotton growing. The chemical, chlorfluazuron, is found in cotton waste which was fed to some cattle after the country's severe drought led to limited grain supplies in September and October. According to the Cattle Council of Australia, the chemical is non-toxic and only a very small proportion of Australian cattle - those fed cotton waste from irrigated cotton - have any chance of being affected. All livestock from affected areas, predominantly in New South Wales, were being tested. Nevertheless, the CCA acknowledged that the trade consequences for the beef industry, Australia's third largest export sector with overseas sales of ADollars 3.2bn in 1993, could be serious. Australian officials met counterparts at the US Department of Agriculture last night in an effort to allay US concerns and resume trade. Afterwards an Australian embassy official said the department had asked for more data and further talks but the ban remained in place. Japan and the US are the two biggest markets, accounting for three-quarters of beef exports. But there are fears other, smaller customers could follow the lead taken by the US and Japan. In Darwin, Mr Bob Collins, the federal primary industries minister, said testing had shown that 'the actual levels of this chemical that have been detected are very, very small. It's a question of satisfying the importing authorities and health authorities in our customer countries that we've done everything that could be expected of us in terms of containing the problem'. The enhanced agricultural export opportunities flowing from the Uruguay trade round could be eroded or even negated if countries are given 'undue freedom' to pursue unilateral environmental protection measures, the Australia's National Farmers Federation warned yesterday. The gain to Australian farmers from the Gatt agreement has been estimated at about ADollars 1bn a year in additional exports. But it is feared these opportunities could be much reduced by non-tariff barriers dressed up as environmental protection measures.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain yearly profits plunge 45% Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday announced a 45 per cent fall in net profits last year, from FFr2.37bn in 1992 to FFr1.31bn (Dollars 220m). It blamed the fall on the difficult economic conditions in Europe which had a serious impact on several group activities. Overall sales fell from FFr74bn to FFr71.6bn, while operating profits fell from FFr6.4bn to FFr4.9bn. Despite the decline, Saint-Gobain reduced debts by FFr3bn, to an estimated FFr15bn, as a result of its cost-cutting measures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma today asserted  that the government deadline for Carabineros General Rodolfo  Stange to modernize the Carabineros Institution will be extended.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is it true that  Gen. Stange will return to his post between 15 and 17 June?    [Perez] Yes, based on the 30 days he asked for, he should  return around the dates you have mentioned. I believe he will  be unable to finish by then and there will probably have to be  an extension.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Perez] Because I believe he has not had enough time.

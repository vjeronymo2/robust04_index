			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Belgian coalition facing collapse BELGIUM'S governing coalition headed for collapse yesterday after ministers failed to agree how to bring the country's worsening budget deficit in line with the strict Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union. King Baudouin was last night considering whether to accept the resignation of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's centre-left government, formed just over a year ago. The king will consult political advisers before taking his decision. The criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty have come in for severe criticism over the last year, as it has become clear that deepening recession will make it difficult for most EC member states to meet the economic conditions for monetary union by the first deadline of 1997. But Mr Dehaene, a Flemish-speaking Christian Democrat, denied that his coalition had cracked under the Maastricht pressure. 'Belgium remains a firm supporter of the Maastricht treaty and economic and monetary union. We need economic and monetary union more than ever,' he said. 'The source of this crisis is not a dispute over whether we need to meet the convergence criteria; it's about how we're going to meet that objective.' Belgium's annual budget deficit reached BFr485bn (Pounds 10bn) last year, or 6.9 per cent of GNP, compared with the 1996 Maastricht target of 3 per cent.</p>

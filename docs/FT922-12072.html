			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM was in retreat on the London bullion market after the Easter break. By midday platinum futures on Nymex were hovering around the key resistance level of Dollars 340 a troy ounce. New York dealers pointed to the third consecutive day of losses on the Tokyo stock market, continuing to signal that the Japanese economy is slipping towards recession, with bearish implications for platinum demand. They were surprised prices had not fallen further given both the Japanese slowdown and high levels of outstanding Soviet swaps still held in Switzerland. 'The Swiss are awash with platinum and they just seem to be holding it back from the market,' one dealer said. On the LME COPPER closed down, but off 10-week lows struck in early trading. Recent constructive US economic data, underlying Chinese buying interest and drawdowns in LME stocks suggest that further declines could be be limited. London COCOA futures ended narrowly mixed, with most activity in the rolling forward of positions out of May and into July. News that the Ivory Coast had proposed an export quota system at UN talks on a new international agreement had little impact. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 30 Mar (TANJUG) -- The cease-fire agreement  signed early this morning in Zagreb between the Republic of  Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] is a big success  and it should now be respected and fully implemented, Rear  Admiral Dusan Rakic, the head of the Krajina delegation in these  negotiations and [RSK] defense minister, told a news conference  in Knin. The agreement comes into effect on 4 April and the  withdrawal of the forces of the warring sides begins on 7 April.  Hence, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], which will now have  full inspection rights and freedom of movement, will be able to  move into the cordon sanitaire created in this way. The  agreement stipulates that heavy weaponry will be withdrawn 20 km  from the current front lines. Thus, for example, the heavy  weapons of the Croatian forces will be located in Sibenik and  Stari Grad and perhaps in some other place, while Serb heavy  weapons will be located in Gracac, Beli Manastir, and other  places.    Admiral Rakic stressed that the talks were very difficult  because both sides had to relax their demands and give up some  pieces of territory in order to reach agreement. In this way, it  was said, the Peruca hydroelectric power station, Miljevacki  Plato, part of Maslenica, and Zemunik airport will remain under  the control of Croatian forces, while Skabrnja near Zadar was  returned to the Croatians.    By way of compensation, the RSK has recovered the Ravni  Kotari villages of Islam Grcki, Smokovic, and Kasic, and  Croatian forces are also to withdraw from part of Velebit, which  is exceptionally important in view of the position of Obrovac  and the return of people and life to this town on Zrmanja.  Teslingrad and Jasenovac, the status of which the Serb side did  not wish to discuss, have remained on the Serb side. The [two]  police forces, assisted by UNPROFOR inspection teams, will enter  the cordon sanitaire -- in which some Croatian as well as Serb  villages remain -- once the armed forces of both sides have  withdrawn from this area.    In the opinion of Assistant [RSK] Interior Minister  Aleksandar Draca, a member of the RSK delegation, the agreement  means the end of the war and the beginning of peace, and the  very important return of the occupied Ravni Kotari villages to  Krajina. The cease-fire agreement makes possible the  continuation of the negotiating process on mutual cooperation  and the resolution of many crucial problems in the field of  infrastructure, transportation, communications, and other  questions of mutual interest to Croatia and Krajina. The talks  on this so-called economic and humanitarian basket will probably  begin in about two weeks. It is only when these by no means easy  problems have been resolved that the negotiations should enter  their third, final, and most difficult phase -- the resolution  of political relations between the RSK and Croatia.</p>

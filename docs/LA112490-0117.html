			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS RUN TO RECORD;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA BEATS UC IRVINE, 134-101, SETTING A SCHOOL SCORING  MARK.  </P> <P> Darrick Martin turned to his UCLA teammates, one by one.  </P> <P> "You tired?" he asked, slapping a hand fiercely at each response. "You tired?  You? You?"  </P> <P> Then he turned to UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, whose Anteaters challenged  11th-ranked UCLA to a fast-and-furious, running, three-point bombing game  Friday and lost, 134-101, in the season-opener for both teams.  </P> <P> "No, coach, we're not tired."  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Jim Harrick calls it "a disease," this offense-mad game that has  seen its apex in Loyola Marymount and its nadir with the Denver Nuggets.  </P> <P> But this UCLA team, whether Harrick likes it or not, thrives on the fever and  proved it by breaking the school scoring record.  </P> <P> UC Irvine countered with 42 three-point shots, three more than the NCAA mark  set by -- guess who? -- Loyola Marymount against North Carolina in an NCAA  tournament game on March 13, 1988, but two fewer than CS Northridge's NCAA  mark, set earlier in the evening.  </P> <P> No UCLA team has scored more points than the Bruins did in the first-round of  the Great Alaska Shootout before a sellout crowd of 7,947 in Sullivan Arena.  And no Shootout team ever scored more.  </P> <P> The school record was 133, set Dec. 23, 1969, at Pauley Pavilion against  Louisiana State and Pete Maravich.  </P> <P> The tournament record also was 133, set by Arizona in 1987.  </P> <P> Mitchell Butler's free throw with 24 seconds left put the Bruins over the top  for both marks, to the delight of UCLA's traveling party of 180 and the  puzzlement of Butler.  </P> <P> "I thought maybe we were approaching 150," said Butler, who scored 15 points  and was one of eight Bruins in double figures, led by Tracy Murray's 24 points  and Don MacLean's 22 and punctuated by 20 points from freshman Shon Tarver off  the bench.  </P> <P> "I can't say enough about Tarver," Harrick said. "I thought he ignited us in  the second half."  </P> <P> UCLA -- which plays Alaska Anchorage at 9 p.m. tonight -- won convincingly in  the end, but Irvine, off a 5-23 season that was the worst in school history,  hung on throughout the first half and until about four minutes into the second  half.  </P> <P> Irvine made 11 of 23 three-pointers in the first half. In all, the Anteaters  made 15 of 42, both school records.  </P> <P> Cornelius Banks, a community college transfer who wasn't in the Anteaters' top  six before the game, led Irvine with 20 points, including four for four in  three-pointers in the first half. Jeff Herdman and Jeff Von Lutzow added 15.  Center Ricky Butler, the leading returning scorer, had foul trouble in the  first half and scored only seven points in a game not suited to his skills.  </P> <P> UCLA trailed by as many as three points in the first half and led at halftime,  69-65.  </P> <P> The score stood tied, 77-77, when UCLA went on a 24-4 run. MacLean scored eight  of those 24 points, but the critical blows were dealt by Tarver, alternating  between three-pointers -- he had two in that stretch -- and dunks, of which he  also had two.  </P> <P> "UCLA has got a helluva team," Irvine's Mulligan said. "It's not like we were  playing dogs. We faded with about 15 minutes left. We were playing against a  great team. Guys like Murray, Darrick Martin, really hurt us.  </P> <P> "We wanted to get tempo. We got tempo."  </P> <P> Irvine plays Texas Tech today at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In other first-round games:  </P> <P> No. 18 Virginia 80, Siena 77 -- Siena led 18th-ranked Virginia for most of the  game, but the Cavaliers' Bryant Stith made four free throws in the final eight  seconds.  </P> <P> Stith, who scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half, hit two free throws  to give the Cavaliers a 78-76 lead, then two more after Siena threw away the  inbounds pass and fouled.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers play South Carolina at 7 p.m. PST tonight.  </P> <P> Siena plays Nevada at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> South Carolina 63, Nevada 61 -- The Gamecocks, who got 15 points from Jo Jo  English and 14 from Barry Manning, held off a late rally.  </P> <P> Alaska Anchorage 70, Texas Tech 58 -- The host team was led by Jackie Johnson  with 20 points in winning its 12th game in the 13-year history of its  tournament.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shootout Notes  </P> <P> Rodney Zimmerman, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery three weeks ago,  entered the game with about nine minutes left and played seven minutes, scoring  all his points on a three-point play.  </P></p>

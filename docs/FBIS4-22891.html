Ovchinnikov  at Russia's Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 577.214.3]    [Abstract] The diversity of biological activity of  interleukin-1 (IL-1) which is a mixture of two polypeptides  IL-1_a_ and IL-1_b_ and can serve as a mediator of various  diseases as well as host's protective mechanisms prompted  renewed interest in the recently characterized protein factor--a  natural IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) which specifically  blocks IL-1 binding to receptors in T-cells and fibroblasts but  does not bind to IL-1 proper and does not have its biological  activity. With respect to the foregoing, an attempt is made to  investigate the possibility of developing a plasmid construction  which contains the IL-1ra gene and is suitable for oriented  mutagenesis and expression in prokaryotic systems. To this end,  a mature IL-1ra gene is constructed with the help of a  polymerase chain reaction (PTsR) using the mRNA[.sup].[/]cDNA  hybrid as a template. The experimental procedure of constructing  a primer and synthesizing the gene is described in detail. Two  in vitro recombinations using the resulting mutant  DNAs on the KpnI/Eco47III and  Eco47III/HindIII sites with recloning into  the pDR540 expressing vector which does not contain the  KpnI site made it possible to eliminate mutations  causing amino acid substitutions and produce a gene which  precisely encodes the earlier described 152-link sequence of  mature IL-1ra. The authors are grateful to S.A. Ketloinskiy,  Ye.I. Shvarts, O.K. Kaboyev, and O.V. Plutalov for help with  preparations and synthesis. References 11: 1 Russian, 10 Western.</p>

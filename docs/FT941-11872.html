			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Nomura Last year Nomura, the big Japanese securities house, saw its ranking in the Eurobond league table drop to seventh from second place in 1992. Now it has poached Simon Howell from Merrill Lynch to run its London-based Eurobond syndicate desk jointly with Andrew Pelling. Howell, 35, is expected to join Nomura in April. His departure has prompted a reshuffle; Mark Garcia will arrive shortly from New York to run the syndicate desk with Paul Richards. Meanwhile, Jon Greenwood's imminent move from the Eurobond syndicate desk at Goldman Sachs to ABN-Amro Bank in Amsterdam, where his brief is to boostthe bank's non-guilder new issues business, also consolidates his personal life. He has married a Dutch woman after a lengthy long-distance romance.</p>

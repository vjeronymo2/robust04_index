			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, I/M programs play an important role in the ability of the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas to comply with the requirements of the Act for achieving the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone nonattainment areas are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas in Illinois will have difficulty meeting the applicable RFP requirements because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M is not allowed. The additional benefits resulting from implementing an I/M program that meets the requirements of the final November 5, 1992, I/M regulation, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. An I/M program is one of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a federally approvable basic and enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is virtually impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an I/M program meeting final USEPA I/M regulations cannot be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This sanction action is being proposed under USEPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are in section 179. The two sanctions available to USEPA for application under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects; and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway funding sanction prohibits the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when states apply the emission offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions must be at least 2 to 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which provide USEPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section 179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of the SIP, or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) USEPA disapproves a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required by the Act; (3) a state has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by USEPA for not meeting the Act's requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 179(a) refers to Agency findings, disapprovals, and determinations. These will all be referred to by the one term ``findings.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

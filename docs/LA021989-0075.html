			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ONLY SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE ON SUPERFUND LIST;  </P> <P> 'HOT HOUSE,' SITE OF RADIUM PLANT, LEAVES A PECULIAR LEGACY FOR TOWN  </P> <P> The whole family helped out when Dican Hadjy Kabakjian began moonlighting in  his basement in 1924, stretching his physics professor's salary and riding the  crest of a promising new cancer treatment.  </P> <P> Kabakjian was a great man and a brilliant scientist, said one neighbor in the  middle-class suburb of towering trees, stately old houses, quiet dead-end  streets and back yards big enough for great games of hide-and-go-seek.  </P> <P> The business in the basement of the three-story, stucco-and-frame Victorian  duplex helped get the Kabakjians through the Depression.  </P> <P> It also did something else: It made theirs the only single residence on the  government's list of the most toxic waste sites in America.  </P> <P> For two decades, until Kabakjian died in 1945, the family supplied doctors and  hospitals with radium-tipped needles to insert near cancerous tumors.  </P> <P> "I'd take the raw stuff and cook it until you get these radium crystals," said  Kabakjian's daughter, Alice Kabakjian Lewis, 74. Her sister Louise would weigh  the crushed crystals and pack them into platinum needles. The physicist's sons  Armen and Raymond worked during vacations. Dicranouhi Kabakjian helped her  husband when she wasn't keeping his house. Daughter Lillian kept the books.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Fear of Radiation  </P> <P> There was no fear of radiation then; far from it. Two decades after it was  discovered, radium was hailed as a miracle treatment for everything from cancer  to tonsillitis. It would be years before scientists learned that radium decays  into radon gas that can cause cancer. The disease may not show up for 40 years.  </P> <P> Someone living in the house 16 hours a day for their whole life stood a 1-in-3  chance of cancer, said Victor Janosik, who is managing the cleanup for the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Raymond Kabakjian died at 65 of abdominal cancer, in 1977. His son, Raymond  Jr., died of bladder cancer in 1983, at age 37. William Dooner, who delivered  radium, died in 1984 at age 71 of cancer of the head and lungs.  </P> <P> Dican Kabakjian didn't develop cancer. He died in 1945, at 70, of emphysema  probably caused by fumes from the acid he used to process the radium ore.  </P> <P> The Tallant family bought the house in 1949 and lived there until moving into a  bigger place in 1961. Anna Tallant died of breast cancer in 1969, at 54.  </P> <P> The "hot house" came to light in 1962 during a search for forgotten radium  sites. In 1964, authorities spent $200,000 to decontaminate it. They declared  success after removing furniture, dishes, rugs and clothing, and after  replacing windows, walls, sinks and a concrete basement floor. That September  the couple who owned it, Harry and Mary Kizirian, moved back in.  </P> <P> But in 1983, during a survey of sites that might be eligible for federal  cleanup assistance, the EPA found radon levels in the basement 10 times higher  than allowable and gamma radiation, similar to X-rays, 3 1/2 times higher.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Superfund List  </P> <P> In 1985, the house was put on the EPA's Superfund list.  </P> <P> Last August, white-suited workers equipped with oxygen masks, vacuums and  Geiger counters arrived. They dismantled the house board by board and brick by  brick. All but 1 1/2 bricks had been contaminated with radium.  </P> <P> The trees where neighborhood children played were uprooted; squirrels had  scampered up them carrying radioactivity from the ground where Kabakjian dumped  workshop waste. The yard was dug up, too, leaving a 9-foot-deep pit.  </P> <P> About 240 feet of sewer line running down the street is contaminated and will  have to be replaced. None of the surrounding houses have been found to be  contaminated, but six lots showed higher-than-normal radioactivity, pushing the  cleanup cost from $7.5 million to $9.5 million.  </P> <P> "I don't feel a great deal of anxiety about radiation," said Georgianna  Gretzenberg. The back door of the house she and her husband bought in 1987 is  20 to 30 yards from the chain-link fence that surrounds the empty lot and from  the trailers where workers are checked for contamination. The free-standing  garage they planned to turn into a studio may be lost to the cleanup.  </P> <P> "It's sad to see the neighborhood ripped up. For me, it's more that," said  Gretzenberg, who had a healthy baby boy six months ago. "My biggest concern is  they won't finish. I hope it will be done so we can go back to doing what you  do in suburbia."  </P> <P> Helen Click, who has lived behind the house for 23 years, said, "We were told  as long as it's not in our house, we shouldn't be concerned."  </P> <P> Richard Kizirian, whose family bought the house from the Tallants, wonders if  the radium can be blamed for illnesses that afflicted his family, including  sores that developed on his father's legs before he died.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $64 Question  </P> <P> "That's the $64 question. Our understanding is the long-term effects of  radiation have not been proven," Kizirian said. He has considered suing, but  isn't sure whom to sue, and lawyers say he is lucky the EPA paid for the  cleanup.  </P> <P> The costs included $140,000 paid to the Kizirians and the Basehore family, who  lived in the other side of the duplex. The families retain ownership of the  land, which will be filled and landscaped when the work is done this summer.  </P> <P> Kizirian said that given its history, he doubts that anyone will buy, so he and  the other heirs to his parents' estate might donate it to the town.  </P> <P> Nancy Basehore, who is in her 70s, declined to talk at length about her  experiences, but considers Kabakjian to be a great man. She hasn't decided what  to do when the property can be occupied again, either.  </P> <P> "Once the EPA finishes they'll certify they don't have a radiation problem,"  said George Bochanski, a borough councilman and former Environmental Protection  Agency spokesman. "That's more than some of us can say."  </P></p>

An oil production deal is due to be signed tomorrow by the government, the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which currently owns the fields, and the Reliance-Enron consortium. Petroleum ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The three oilfields, Mukta, Panna and Tapti, off India's west coast, would be tapped by Reliance and Enron for oil and natural gas. The deal is a part of India's privatisation programme. The reports gave no details on either the cost of the deal or the amount of recoverable oil and gas in the fields. The decision to sign the deal would follow months of debate over concessions that could be made to the private consortium by the Indian government. The consortium already owns a 60 per cent stake in the Mukta and Panna oilfields.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Travel: Real hot spots in future world I WAS talking not long ago to a ski holiday specialist, a man who has schussed the world. Where, I asked, are the skiing hot spots of the future, those places which are little frequented today but whose renown is fast growing? His answer: tomorrow's skiing hot spots are the world's cold spots - its glaciers. So sharply have world weather patterns changed in just a few years that low-altitude ski resorts can no longer be relied on for adequate snow-fall. It is not just the weather that is different. The whole world is changing before our eyes, including travel destinations. What makes us want to travel to one place rather than another? There is no single answer. But well to the fore is our hope that we are getting the 'real thing'. If we want a Mediterranean beach we want it unencumbered by high-rises, discotheques and traffic jams. What we really mean when we say a place has become spoiled is that it has come to contain too many people like ourselves and too much clutter that resembles our own. The trouble is that the attractive, interesting, unspoiled places we choose become spoiled as well. Such places are finite in number and becoming rarer. Yet the face of travel is changing. And, as expectations rise, a large number of options are opening up. Today more people are choosing shorter-duration, independent, tailor-made holidays. They want more active involvement with the place they are visiting. They are likelier to move around than to stay in one spot. They show more interest in culture and food than sun and sea. They are willing to pay for a more expensive, specialised holiday that engages their own hobbies and interests. In future, short European city breaks will be among the most popular types of travel. Cities such as Paris, Venice and Vienna remain eternally fashionable, but others are only now coming into vogue. Travellers are realising, for example, that by visiting lesser-known Italian cities they can have all that Italy has to offer without any of Rome's or Florence's tourist hordes. Will Provence and the Dordogne ever flag in popularity? Probably not. What I cannot understand is why visitors insist on flocking together in rural France. Like the French Mediterranean, these areas are over-crowded and over-priced. Under-rated and just next door, such areas as the Cevennes, Auvergne and Lozere offer delightful rural charms. Perhaps the biggest surprise in newly-accessible destinations is eastern Europe. Here is an area of tremendous historical significance, a great patchwork of cultures that has been cut off to western visitors for half a century. Yet with few exceptions, eastern Europe has failed to catch on. The main problem is that the east regards western tourism as a cash cow. Hungry for foreign exchange, but furnished with sub-standard facilities and lacking expertise, eastern European countries continue to charge more than their services are worth. Shoddy hotels, bars and restaurants charge western prices; the good hotels that do exist charge higher than western prices. Many east European destinations are simply not that attractive. Old, once-beautiful cities destroyed in the war have been rebuilt in drab socialist fashion, while many rural areas have suffered decades of environmental abuse. Sophia is dull. There is little left of old Bucharest. Warsaw is an artificial reconstruction. Budapest, for a year or two a rising star, is now falling back. Even Prague, well preserved and today eastern Europe's most popular city, is in danger of pricing itself out of the market. St Petersburg, on the other hand, is one city which is likely to grow in appeal. So, strangely enough, is Moscow. There are still plenty of people more interested in traditional beach holidays than exploring strange new cities or unknown countryside. If the Mediterranean is slowing down on this type of development, where will they go? There are already signs that many Caribbean islands, once tropical hide-aways for the privilged, are heading down-market; in the next few years the Caribbean is likely to replace both Florida and the Spanish costas as the place for package holidays. Where, then, will one be able to enjoy warm-weather holidays away from crowds and over-commercialisation? Asia and Africa have long been on the exotic travel circuit, but now both offer new and intriguing possibilities. Forget Bali. It is beginning to resemble Torremolinos. Ditto Phuket, Kosamui and many of the better-known resorts in Thailand. On the other hand, there are scores of islands in south-east Asia where you can feel like Robinson Crusoe if you wish to. Excellent facilities without crowds can be found in Lombok, a 10-minute flight from Bali; at Langkawi, just over the Thai border in Malaysia; and in the Visaya Islands in the central Philippines. The really fascinating part of Asia now opening up, however, is Indochina - Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. While the rest of Asia is charging at full speed into a high-tech future, these places have been too busy with war and social re-adjustment to have gone far beyond simple agriculture. Similarly, Africa offers new places to travel. In north Africa, Islamic fundamentalist violence has put many travellers off Egypt, but at the other end of the continent there is hope for an end to violence. If the new South Africa is successful, it has so much to offer in the way of beaches, landscapes, game-viewing and sports that for many it will replace such sunshine spots as Australia and Florida. The place most strongly tipped for the future, however, is Latin America. Ecuador has always been popular for its rain forests and offshore Galapagos islands. Fast-growing in popularity now are Guatamala, for its highland market towns and lowland Maya ruins, and Chile, for the variety of its desert, lake and mountain environments. For some reason, the most popular Latin American destination in 1994 will be that last hold-out of communism: Cuba. No one can quite explain to me why the island should appear quite so glamorous at present. Perhaps the world is changing so fast that we now feel a sentimental attachment to what appears a long-gone past. One of the best publications describing the range of individually-tailored travel available from UK travel firms is the one produced by the Association of Independent Tour Operators: 133a St Margaret's Road, Twickenham, Middlesex TW1 1RG.

Here is my own list of places - urban, seaside, European or tropical - that look promising for 1994, writes Nicholas Woodsworth:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Istanbul: about the most exotic and atmospheric place you can reach    from London on a short city break conveniently.  2 Corsica: has an off-putting reputation for terrorism, which has    left the island one of the friendliest, most beautiful and best    preserved areas in the Mediterranean.  3 Lake Lucerne, Switzerland: astonishing mountain beauty and    bourgeois self-assurance.  4 Luangwa Valley, eastern Zambia: fast being poached out, but so few    controls that it is one of the last places where game-viewing is    still a real adventure.  5 The Keys, Belize, central America: Caribbean islands the way they    used to be - rum, sailing boats, conch-shell steaks.  6 Lombok Island, Indonesia: next door to Bali, but 20 years behind in    seaside development. The further one heads inland, the further the    present age recedes; strictly Stone Age at its centre.  7 Terlingua, Texas: ghost town in the Chihuahuan desert near the Rio    Grande. Recommended for its bars, cowboy music, frontier spirit and    chilli-con-carne.  8 Hue, central Vietnam: old imperial capital on the Perfume River,    home to the most genuine and welcoming smiles in Asia.  9 Salvador de Bahia, north-eastern Brazil: Afro-Latin culture,    physical sensuality, and coconut-milk-based cooking. 10 Sese Islands, Lake Victoria, Uganda: the ultimate escape; difficult    to reach, difficult to get away from, negligible facilities. Serene    and entirely unpressured.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

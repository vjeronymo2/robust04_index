			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Opinion poll inquest sees fatal flaws AN INQUEST into the performance of opinion polls in the general election has provided an explanation for more than half the discrepancies between their findings and the actual result. However, it says there are still 'fundamental problems' in the way polls are conducted. The inquiry by the Market Research Society suggests that the polls have systematically overstated Labour support and underestimated Tory strength for at least 30 years. It will conduct further research to discover the cause of this bias. This investigation is likely to take several months and will focus on representative interviews, the significance of people who refuse to answer pollsters' questions, the reliability of those who do answer, and the interpretation of data. Yesterday's report, which will do little to restore the pollsters' dented credibility, claims their 1992 election performance was 'not wholly untypical' because of underlying problems with sampling and interviewing methods. An average of the four leading polls published on polling day showed an overestimate of 4 per cent in the Labour vote, an underestimate of 4 1/2 per cent for the Tories, and an overestimate of 1 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. The net effect was to underestimate the Tories' winning margin by 8 1/2 points. The main factors in the miscalculation were found to be a late swing that went unspotted, people's reluctance to say how they were going to vote, the impact of postal votes, and voters failing to register because of the poll tax. Up to 3 points of the 8 1/2 point discrepancy was found to have been caused by a last-minute change in voting intentions and up to 2 points by the refusal of some people, especially Conservatives, to disclose their intentions. The report says: 'We feel we can now understand around 5 (points) of the discrepancy between the polls and the result in terms of the Conservative lead: around 60 per cent of the total problem. We are left with a discrepancy of around 3.5 (points), arising from underestimation of the Conservative vote and/or overestimation of the Labour vote.' Mr Brian Gosschalk, political director of leading pollster Mori, said the inquiry's conclusion that there was a long-term bias favouring Labour was 'nonsense'. Mr Bob Worcester, Mori chairman, said there were no easy answers. 'It is far too early to say what we will be doing differently in four years' time . . . It makes us a bit more humble, which will do no harm at all.'</p>

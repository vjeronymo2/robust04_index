			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Devaluation fears shake Egyptian pound The Egyptian pound yesterday rallied from a bout of panic selling sparked by heightened fears of an imminent devaluation against the dollar, brokers and bankers said. The speculative rush jolted the currency to a low of EPounds 3.425 against the dollar at one point on Wednesday, with the central bank entering the market to buy pounds for dollars for the first time in several years. Bankers said they estimated the central bank to have sold anywhere between 'tens of millions' and Dollars 200m dollars to support the pound. The central bank declined to comment. The bank, which has amassed foreign currency reserves of Dollars 16bn during the past three years of economic reforms guided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has previously intervened only to buy dollars and limit the rise in the pound, which has been bolstered by high real interest rates. However, brokers said the local market had been alarmed this week by a report in al-Wafd, a liberal opposition newspaper, that the government and the IMF had agreed in talks last week to devalue the pound to a rate of EPounds 4 by the years' end. 'Basically the town ran dry of foreign currency,' said one banker. Dealers said the currency stabilised at EPounds 3.397 yesterday after a series of senior Egyptian officials denied there were any plans to devalue the currency. Dr Abdel Shakur Shalaan, Egypt's representative on the IMF board, was quoted in local newspapers as saying reports of an imminent devaluation were 'baseless'. Egyptian officials claimed last month they were resisting strong pressure from the Fund to devalue. Officials argued that whatever benefits such a devaluation might have for Egypt's export competitiveness would be outweighed by the damage to hard-won confidence in the currency. The IMF is understood to have said that the pound was being held inflexibly at a rate it calculated to be as much as 40 per cent overvalued relative to Egypt's main trading partners. It is also believed to have sought accelerated cuts in interest rates. The benchmark three-month treasury bill rate is 12.2 per cent.</p>

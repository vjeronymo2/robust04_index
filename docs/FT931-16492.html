			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices touched three-month dollar highs yesterday, in response to further Chinese buying and the announcement of an unexpectedly-large fall in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks. The three months price reached Dollars 2,372 a tonne before profit-taking trimmed it to Dollars 2,360, up Dollars 6 on the day. The pound's strength against the dollar meant that prices were down in sterling terms, however, the three months position sustaining a Pounds 22.50 fall to Pounds 1,555.25 a tonne. Other LME markets were depressed by big stocks rises. Three months ALUMINIUM fell Dollars 14.50 to Dollars 1,245.25 a tonne, while three months ZINC was Dollars 8.25 down at Dollars 1,077.50 a tonne. But NICKEL, again with the aid of Chinese demand, defied a substantial rise in stocks to close at Dollars 6,412.50 a tonne, up Dollars 175 on the day, taking the rise on the week to Dollars 389.50 a tonne. A wave of selling gave London COFFEE and COCOA prices a battering, the former ending nearly Dollars 40 down in the March futures position. Cocoa prices were up to Pounds 18 lower.

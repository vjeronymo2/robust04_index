			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Brussels ends rod dumping investigation THE European Commission said yesterday it had ended an anti-dumping investigation regarding wire rods sold in the EC and made in Argentina, Egypt, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago and the Yugoslav republics, AP reports from Brussels. The Commission said in a statement that it has closed the inquiry following a decision by the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer) to withdraw its complaint against the countries. Eurofer made the dumping charge on behalf of about 75 per cent of European Community wire producers. Eurofer withdrew the complaint in August after imports of wire rod from the countries fell significantly. The product is used mainly in the construction industry.</p>

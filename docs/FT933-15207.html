			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: VW Basque plant plans off 'for now', says chief VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, said it would not for now build a pioneering factory in Spain's Basque Country, the pet project of its Basque-born purchasing director, Mr Jose Lopez de Arriortua, Reuter reports from Berlin. 'If you look at the overall economic situation, there can be no question of it at this time,' VW's chief executive Mr Ferdinand Piech told the German daily Die Welt. 'I have told Mr Lopez this. Contrary to other reports, this is a definitive decision.' However, VW confirmed it was negotiating, through its Spanish unit SEAT, with a group of Spanish investors over setting up the greenfield plant in Mr Lopez's birthplace of Amorebieta. The group was made up of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Central Hispano, the Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa savings bank, the Iberdrola energy group, and the Mondragon co-operative. Mr Piech was also quoted as saying the group expected to make a profit in the third quarter of this year, and to break even for the year as a whole. In the first quarter of this year, VW made a loss of DM1.25bn (Dollars 730m). Die Welt quoted Mr Piech saying: 'Taking the year as a whole we will record a black zero. By that I mean that 1993 will be loss-free for Volkswagen. The first stage of our target has been reached.'</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / The bubbles that bind Britain: Charles and Di, Angie and Dirty Den. Soap operas are today's social glue In Jonathan Dimbleby's new biography, Prince Charles is quoted as saying that the collapse of his marriage 'had all the ingredients of a Greek tragedy'. In fact, the story resembles nothing so much as a soap opera. The features that make soap opera popular - a family that becomes public property; the focus on personalities; the obsession with sexual morality; the mix of glamour, intimacy - are precisely those that keep the royal family in the headlines. Until the 19th century, the great forces for social cohesion in Britain were the monarchy and the church. Today they are the monarchy and soap opera. When Angie walked out on Dirty Den in the BBC television soap EastEnders, 31m people watched - more than half the country. Regular audiences of 17m tune into Coronation Street, 14m to EastEnders and 4m to Radio 4's The Archers. Most people in Britain can name a character from each of these soaps. Two hundred years ago, by contrast, few people could have named any fictional character, but almost all could have explained the story depicted on the stained-glass window of the village church. Now few of us have a clue about religious iconography. Instead, in a fragmented culture, soap opera is the only entertainment that ensures, as the church formerly did, that people across generations and social classes share a set of references, and discuss the same issues at the same time. When, for example, in The Archers last Christmas, Susan Carter, mother of two, was jailed for shielding her brother from the police, the episode caused a national outcry, provoking leading articles on crime and punishment in three national newspapers, and public statements from Michael Howard, the Home Secretary - and an Archers fan - and from the Lord Chief Justice. Soap opera is no longer just easy entertainment. Programmes such as The Archers, EastEnders and Brookside focus on our deepest social and moral concerns. Marriage and family values; abortion and Aids; rising crime and unemployment are their subjects. They also deal with timeless human feelings: love, betrayal, fear, loneliness. Soap deals, in short, with subjects which were once the prerogative of the Church. They also do what Shakespeare's Hamlet said drama should do: 'Hold the mirror up to nature', and reflect 'the very age and body of the time.' Why are they so popular and so powerfully emotive, and what do they tell us about our culture and life? In each century an art form emerges which comes to dominate the nation and embody its values. That art is always changed by the technological possibilities of the time. For the Victorians it was the novel, which reached a mass market because of the opportunity for cheap printing in the new industrial society. In the 17th century, it was Revenge Tragedy, which grew out of the beginnings of public theatres, and in the Middle Ages, it was courtly love poetry, recited aloud and passed on by oral tradition in the days before printing. Today, it is soap opera, the populist drama of an age in which television and radio have supplanted the printed word as media of communication. Television's special virtues are intimacy, continuity, and mesmeric realism. These three qualities are precisely those which make soap opera so successful. Soap is therefore a natural genre for the small screen. On many weekday evenings, television means soap opera to most people - Coronation Street attracts 70 per cent of all viewers, EastEnders 65 per cent. Who is watching? The main soap operas have distinct class and regional profiles. The Archers is a middle class soap so when Caroline Bone tries to lure her putative lover into bed she invites him away for the night to hear the Christmas Oratorio in Birmingham. EastEnders is a working class soap, so Phil and Kathy's engagement party is a knees-up in the pub. Brookside is a Liverpool soap; on the cutting edge of urban social problems, it thrives on strong local accents and Merseyside humour. Although audiences reflect these features, soaps appeal across the classes and regions. The Archers audience includes a far higher percentage of working-class listeners than Radio 4's average audience. Brookside (6m viewers) has a loyal following in the north of England, but is also popular with young London professionals - reflecting Channel 4's middle-class profile. EastEnders also has many middle-class fans. Neighbours (10m viewers), with its light-hearted romances and sunny backcloth, appeals to children of all classes. Coronation Street viewers are mostly working class - ITV's traditional audience. Years after they have left the series, characters from this longest running TV soap, such as the matriarch Ena Sharples and sexpot Elsie Tanner - James Callaghan, a former prime minister, called her 'the sexiest woman on TV' - remain in the popular imagination, like Mr Micawber or Scrooge. They suggest that soap opera is essentially a democratising form, delivering into the family living-room regular everyday drama which millions of people experience at the same time, and discuss next morning. The combination of a mass audience and a serial form of fiction is explosive. It is a relatively new phenomenon - Dickens discovered it in the 19th century, and made a fortune serialising his novels before publication. When the Old Curiosity Shop was running in the 1850s, hundreds of readers wrote begging him not to kill off the heroine, Little Nell. When she did die, top-hatted men wept in the street on hearing the news. It was reported that 'the nation was drowned in a wave of grief', and Dickens received so many mourning letters that he felt he had committed a murder. Soap opera is a descendant of the Victorian serial novel. It uses the same storytelling techniques - cliff-hangers, melodrama, sentimentality - to win a devoted following. Vanessa Whitburn, producer of The Archers says her primary aim is 'to produce good drama which makes audiences cry, makes them happy, surprises them and sometimes shocks them.' The Archers storyline which reached a climax this autumnwith the birth of Shula's baby, after a desperate series of fertility treatments and the death of her husband in a car crash, is an example of how the Dickensian methods still work in an updated 1990 context. Like the serial novel, The Archers' plots are planned months or years in advance, but each episode is produced at a frenetic pace. There are eight writers - those who cut their teeth on the series include best-selling novelist Susan Hill - and after the monthly script meeting, they each complete the week's worth of scripts in a fortnight. Twenty episodes are then recorded in six days. Topical events are written in, during a flurry of re-recording, on the day of transmission. 'Charles Dickens was my teacher,' says Julia Smith, the producer who devised EastEnders. 'He had the gift of combining reality with fairy stories. I don't think we are doing much that Dickens had not done before.' That mix of escapism and social authenticity lies at the core of British soap opera. Soaps tug the heartstrings because they invite everyday involvement with another family or community whose intimacies and indiscretions become, like those of the royal family, public secrets. Hedli Nicklaus, who plays Kathy Perks in the series and runs Archers Addicts, the fan club whose members include Norma Major and Adam Faith, says soap works because 'it lives in people's heads, and when it's in your head, it becomes part of your own world picture'. In extreme cases, viewers identify so completely with the soap world that they send characters wedding presents or apply for jobs at Brookfield Farm or the Queen Vic pub. (Traditionally readers of fiction have done the same: the Royal Mail continues to receive letters addressed to Sherlock Holmes, Baker Street.) But this empathy is grounded in the acute realism with which characters and settings are portrayed. Divorce, racism, cancer scares, children running away from home, dodgy business deals - these are daily events in soap. Behind them is a strong educational and moral impetus, sometimes even a pioneering social conscience. The Archers began in 1951 as a family drama aimed at teaching farmers how to increase food production during post-war shortages. Now Brookside, says Philip Reevel, head of corporate affairs at Merseyside Television, confronts 'a question of how television can accommodate both entertainment and real social issues'. Brookside has recently featured the murder of a wife-beating father, a lesbian affair, and the birth of a Down's syndrome baby. Reevel called the programmes methods 'hyper-realistic': a high concentration of controversial dramatic incidents within a small community. The key to soap success, he suggests, is 'the programme makers' ability to anticipate popular tastes and concerns'. Impeccable social research is the backbone of soap opera. The names of many EastEnders characters were taken from cemeteries in east London. The armed robbery in The Archers was inspired by a conversation between the producer Vanessa Whitburn and police officers worried about the rise in violent crime in rural areas. The Archers employs not only an agricultural adviser but a permanent consultant obstetrician. The story of Shula's infertility treatment rang so true that the BBC was overwhelmed with letters from empathising listeners. A chief pleasure of British soap comes from empathy - from recognising oneself as the drama holds 'the mirror up to nature'. It is emphasised by a comparison with US soaps, which offer pure fantasy - mega-rich Dallas oil magnates, Dynasty's sumptuous mansion 'Fioli' - and invite not identification or social debate but the schadenfreude of 'let's watch the rich screw up'. British soaps are by contrast highly moralistic. Tony Warren, who invented Coronation Street in 1960, summed up the series as 'a fascinating freemasonry, a volume of unwritten rules. These are the driving forces behind a working-class street in the north of England. Coronation Street sets out to explore these values and in doing so, to entertain.' Today, Brookside debates the vices of capitalist tax-evaders versus the jobless on the fiddle. EastEnders is currently running an explosive tale of sexual ethics, about the break-up of Sharon and Grant Mitchell's marriage after she slept with his brother Phil. Commuting between the intensive care ward, where Phil lay after Grant tried to murder him, and the pub, each character has offered a comment on the morality of cheating, revenge and forgiveness. Barbara Windsor made her debut in the programme, as the feuding men's mother, with a homily on family values. The story is as primitively compelling as Cain and Abel. One reason soap operas are so dramatically powerful is the clever adaptation of archetypes - EastEnders' Don Juan villain Dirty Den, The Archers village idiot Eddie Grundy, reformed superbitch Elizabeth Archer - into topical British settings. They build age-old dramatic conflicts in a modern context. The Archer sisters (Shula and Elizabeth) at different times involved with the same man, for example, recall Elizabeth and Lydia Bennett in Pride and Prejudice; but their recent dilemmas have been abortion, IVF treatment, and whether one might adopt the illegitimate child of the other. 'The Archers is living drama not a museum piece,' says Whitburn who, since joining the series from Brookside two years ago, has catapulted Ambridge up to date. Nostalgia and continuity, however, are also crucial to the appeal: issues, characters, move with the times, but soap operas always retain the structure and milieu of opening episodes. The Archers (1951) still follows the farming calendar. Coronation Street (1960) is a dream of working-class solidarity in back-to-back terraces. The new housing estate at Brookside (1982) and the market stalls and entrepreneurial car dealers and cafe owners of EastEnders (1985) are obvious products of the Thatcherite 1980s. Where is the soap opera of the 1990s? Eldorado (1992) flopped, although in many ways it spoke for the decade - jet-setting lifestyles, international profile, a group of people who happened to have landed in the same place rather than growing up together in a traditional, outdated community. The reasons for its failure are still discussed - no social roots, and thus inauthentic characters? No clear niche market? Given insufficient time to prove itself? But the BBC is unlikely to try again. Soap operas are potentially lucrative. Their name comes from their original association with soap manufacturers, such as Procter and Gamble, which sponsored radio serials for housewives in the 1920s to advertise their products. They continue to be an advertisers' dream. Brookside is Channel 4's best-rated show. For a satellite company such as Sky One, a compelling soap opera would be manna from heaven. Will they endure as art? It is an open question. Unlike the popular form of earlier periods such as Dickens's novels and Shakespeare's tragedies, soap operas are by nature ephemeral. They are the easy viewing option of our lazy undemanding television age. Each episode of EastEnders, for example, is too simple and banal to be watched a second or third time, in the way that we can re-read a Dickens novel and discover new pleasures and meanings. On the other hand, soap operas speak of important social and emotional concern to a mass audience; despite their vulgarities and their formulaic presentation, they deliver some of the moral sustenance that Dickens offered in the 19th century and Shakespeare in the 17th. On the Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs last month, Sir George Christie, chairman of Glyndebourne, selected many classical operas, and then chose as his luxury a complete recording of The Archers from 1951 until today. If his stash were to be found in 100 years, it is unlikely that The Archers would be regarded as a successor to Mozart or Verdi, but it would provide a fascinating and unmatchable panorama of Britain in the second half of the 20th century.</p>

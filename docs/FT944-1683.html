			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week and Next): IRI - Other companies The Italian state holding company has until midnight on December 31 to complete the privatisation of Italy's state-owned steel industry, in line with a deal struck by EU industry ministers in December 1993. The most difficult sale is likely to be that of Ilva Laminati Piani, the flat steels company, for which two rival consortia have tabled offers. IRI's directors decided last week to pursue their examination of the bids and are certain to have another meeting before Christmas to discuss the situation. If IRI fails to sell ILP, the European Commission could demand the repayment of nearly L5,000bn (Pounds 1.9bn) of state subsidies which Ilva was set to receive.</p>

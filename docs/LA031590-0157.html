			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MUD HENS TO BE SHOT TO CURB OVERPOPULATION  </P> <P> The county Wednesday ordered the shooting of about 175 mud hens at Legg Lake  near South El Monte as part of an ongoing effort to control overpopulation of  the birds, also known as coots, officials said.  </P> <P> The marsh-living birds are destroying fragile plant life and leaving messy  droppings all around the lake in the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area, an aide  to Supervisor Pete Schabarum said.  </P> <P> Judy Hammond said Schabarum had received numerous complaints about the coots  from residents before requesting that agricultural officials destroy some of  the birds. "Unfortunately, shooting is the only way to bring them under  control," she said.  </P> <P> County officials have shot mud hens at the lake on several occasions, as well  as at Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park in San Dimas and at Santa Fe Dam  Park in Irwindale, Hammond said. The state Fish and Game Department has  authorized the shootings, she said.  </P></p>

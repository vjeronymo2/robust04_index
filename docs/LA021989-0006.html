			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THAT SINKING FEELING  </P> <P> Twentieth Century Fox is reportedly spending a fortune on its big summer pic,  "The Abyss" -- and wants to distance itself fathoms from two other underwater  adventures: Tri-Star's recently released "Deepstar Six" and MGM's "Leviathan,"  which surfaces in March.  </P> <P> In fact, an "Abyss" teaser trailer was pulled from screens recently after only  a two-week run -- a Fox rep confirms that studio brass were worried audiences  might confuse "Abyss" with the other films.  </P> <P> "But one of them is already out of the way," said the Fox spokesman, referring  to "Deepstar," which went glub with only $7 million in ticket sales after three  weekends.  </P> <P> Fox folks insist that "Abyss" -- from the "Aliens" team of director James  Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd -- is not a "monster movie" like the  competing films but a "totally wondrous encounter with the unknown."

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Channel Islands 30, Hueneme 19 -- A fourth-quarter comeback by Hueneme fell  short and Channel Islands' Pharoh Milner scored on a 40-yard run on the last  play of the game at Channel Islands.  </P> <P> Channel Islands (2-0) used a strong ground game to build a 24-7 lead after  three quarters, but Hueneme quarterback David Andrade completed 13 of 18 passes  for 113 yards and a touchdown in the second half to lead his team back.  </P> <P> The Vikings cut the deficit to 24-19 when Rex Barrios scored on a seven-yard  run after taking a pitch from Andrade with 3:20 left before Milner put the game  away with his long touchdown run.  </P> <P> Renard Carn of Channel Islands, who rushed for 197 yards and three touchdowns  in last week's season-opener, left the game late in the second quarter with an  ankle injury after gaining 46 yards in seven carries.

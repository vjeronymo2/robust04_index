After the end of the talks that lasted two days, Zotov had a  meeting with Latvian Prime minister Valdis Birkavas. Both sides  pointed to perceptible progress, achieved on the key issues. A  complex agreement on the legal status of a Russian anti-missile  radar station in Skrunde has almost been completed. An  agreement may be reached even on the most controversial issue --  the time- limit of the functioning of the radar station.    The Latvian prime minister again offered apologies to the  Russian side about the incident [as received], that took place  in Latvia, and said the government was taking measures for  preventing in the future the actions that could have a negative  impact on bilateral relations.</p>

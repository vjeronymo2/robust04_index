On sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 7.02m (Pounds 6.08m) the pre-tax loss increased by 40 per cent from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 2.17m. Directors of this south-east-based housebuilder said yesterday that in view of the continuing uncertain outlook no dividend would be paid. The last distribution was for 1989. Directors also reviewed the value of the property portfolio and in addition to the Pounds 855,000 write-down taken at the time of the rights issue in August, a further Pounds 190,000 has been provided. The decision to reduce prices meant that at the year end more than three quarters of the finished residential stock had been sold and debt reduced to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 7.47m). Losses per share came through at 14.6p (11.1p).</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Observer: Home thoughts The fuss surrounding London's bomb-devastated Baltic Exchange and its Chamber of Shipping neighbour is all very commendable except for one small point. Both establishments are a hangover from when Britain ruled the waves, and such palatial premises are now far from ideal. Indeed, the bombing has helped solve a difficult problem of what to do with growing numbers of empty offices. The Baltic, like the Stock Exchange, no longer needs a trading floor. A telephone and computer are all that's needed. If David Mellor, the new heritage minister, can be conned into paying for the Baltic's restoration, all well and good. But with Pounds 75m of insurance cover, its members are in the lucky position of being able to shop around a bombed-out property market. Citicorp's expensively refurbished Billingsgate fish market already has the edge over the Royal Exchange and the Corn Exchange as the Baltic's new home. The reason is that it has a bar. 'Wherever we go has to have one', says Baltic chairman Peter Tudball. 'It's the way business has always been done,' he adds.</p>

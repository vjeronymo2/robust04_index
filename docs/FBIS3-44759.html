The  situation is now returning to normal following a government  notice to bring an end to the chaos.    With a circular setting out a restructuring of the foreign  exchange system on December 30, last year, shopping malls here  where FECs circulated were crowded with shoppers. The  Friendship Store took in more than one million FEC on one day,  amounting to much more than the usual daily takings of 100,000  FEC. A handful of shoppers used FECs to buy household  electrical appliances while most people spent their certificates  on daily necessities and food. Stores adjusted the exchange  rate between the renminbi and the FEC on their own because they  did not know how else to solve the problem, leading to  disturbances by FEC-holders. The People's Bank of China in  response issued a special notice to clear up doubts regarding  circulation of FECs and how they were to be cleared in  accordance with the official exchange rate posted on December  31, 1993. The issuing of this notice helped ease the chaos to a  great extent.    Shoppers using FECs are now becoming increasingly fewer in  number. Some foreign-funded hotels here stopped accepting FECs  on January 1.</p>

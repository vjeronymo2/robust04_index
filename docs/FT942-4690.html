			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Chase gains equity trade powers in US Chase Manhattan has become the latest bank to be given the power to underwrite and trade equities in the US, marking a further erosion of the barriers that have kept commercial banks out of the investment banking business. Like others, though, Chase has no ambitions to grow a large-scale securities business quickly, and is anyway severely limited in its ability to underwrite and trade securities. Under Federal Reserve rules, only 10 per cent of its securities subsidiary's income can come from these activities. Chase's cautious approach in the US has also been shaped by its disastrous experience in the UK, where it suffered big losses after acquiring local brokers Simon &amp; Coates and Laurie Millbank in the mid-1980s. 'In the UK, we tried to build a stand-alone investment bank,' said Mr Paul Brandow, president of Chase Securities in the US and a former head of Chase's UK securities business. 'It never got integrated into the rest of the bank.' The plan in the US, by contrast, is to use the securities powers to raise money for existing customers of the bank, he said. Like a handful of other US banks, Chase has already used its powers to underwrite and trade debt securities to engage in the sub-investment grade bond business. It has also been among the most active US banks in bringing issuers from developing countries to the US markets. The equity powers will be used to extend activities for these types of issuer, said Mr Brandow. Chase is the sixth US commercial bank to be given equity powers.</p>

The sitting is to discuss a package of  agreements on practical implementation of the treaty on economic  union between the Commonwealth's countries.    The conference is to consider a protocol to the agreement  concerning general conditions and mechanisms to support  development of cooperation between industrial enterprises and  the various sectors, an agreement on cooperation in the sphere  of labor migration and social security for workers-migrants.    In addition, the session is scheduled to discuss a package  of  documents of a humanitarian nature: on benefits and guarantees  to the veterans of the WW ll, Afghan war veterans, and families  of perished servicemen, on preparation for the celebration of  the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, on citizens' rights in the  sphere of benefits and compensations for children, as well as  other issues.    The vice premiers will first discuss proposals to the agenda  of the upcoming summit of heads of CIS governments and states.    According to Korotchenya, the session is supposed to discuss  a package of military problems as well.    Korotchenya reported to Interfax that the issue on Ukraine's  joining the economic union as an associate member had not been  prepared yet. He explained that it is difficult to solve this  issue in a situation where Kiev has not signed the CIS Charter  nor other important documents of the Commonwealth, has not  determined the conditions and mechanisms for Ukraine's  participation in CIS projects.    Korotchenya added that the issue on Ukraine's associate  membership in the economic union would be probably solved at the  summit of CIS leaders.    As Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, said, Kazakhstan's  Prime Minister Sergei Tereshchenko voiced an initiative to unite  separate sittings of the council of heads of governments and the  council of the heads of states scheduled for March into a joint  sitting on March 31 in Moscow. The present task of the CCC is  to prepare documents for a CIS summit.    Korotchenya also reported that in the course of his meeting  with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Monday in Moscow  they reached an agreement to hold a joint session of the CIS  Council of Foreign Ministers and CIS Council of Defense  Ministers.</p>

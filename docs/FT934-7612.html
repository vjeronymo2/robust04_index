			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Chile 'ready to become Nafta member' CONDITIONS are in place for Chile to join the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, said in Santiago yesterday. He had been assured two weeks ago by President Bill Clinton that once Nafta was approved, Chile would be next in line for a free trade pact, he added. Mr Jean Chretien, the new Canadian prime minister, had also indicated his interest in a free trade accord with Chile, while one was already in place with Mexico, which calls for the mutual elimination of tariffs on most goods by 1998. Mr Foxley had no opinion whether the best route would be to secure bilateral trade pacts with the three Nafta members or seek accession to Nafta. Acknowledging Mr Clinton had other priorities, he said there was no rush to sign an accord. 'It's not for us an extremely significant economic event, in the short term at least.' Latin American countries should continue to move ahead with their integration efforts. In a world of managed trade, negotiating clout was what counted and Latin countries could only achieve that by banding together. Chile could eventually become a partner in the 'Group of Three' of Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela, which are expected to finalise a free trade accord shortly.</p>

A draft bill for that purpose is being deliberated by the  congress. When it becomes law, it will empower the Xiamen  municipal people's congress and its Standing Committee and the  Xiamen municipal government to enact laws and regulations for  implementation in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. That means  Xiamen will have the same legislative power as a provincial  legislature.    Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made an  explanation on an NPC draft decision on the question to the  current NPC session.    In recent years, the Xiamen Special Economic Zone has become  an important window for developing economic relations with  Taiwan and the rest of the world.    Development of Xiamen requires that the special economic  zone  have the power to enact local laws and regulations, Xue Ju said.    Xue said local laws and regulations to be enacted by the  Xiamen People's Congress and its Standing Committee shall follow  the country's constitution and the basic principles of national  laws and administrative regulations. They shall be submitted  for the record to the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council  and the Standing Committee of the Fujian provincial people's  congress.    The Xiamen municipal government will be empowered to  formulate regulations and decrees for implementation in the  Xiamen Special Economic Zone.    A motion calling for giving Xiamen legislative power was  raised by NPC deputies in 1989 and 1993, Xue said.    Zhang Binsheng, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of  the Xiamen municipal people's congress, said the people of  Xiamen will treasure and use the power judiciously.</p>

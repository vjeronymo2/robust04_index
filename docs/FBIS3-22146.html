			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Susan Watts report: "Staff Fear Budget Cuts Will Ground </F> 'Snoopy' Aircraft"]    [Text] The future of "Snoopy", an RAF [Royal Air Force]  Hercules adapted to form an airborne laboratory, looks  increasingly uncertain as defence budget cuts bite deep.    The C130 aircraft, named Snoopy because of its 22-foot red  and white striped nosepiece, is guaranteed funding only until 1  April 1995, despite world-wide acclaim for its atmospheric  research. Its scientific crew fear Snoopy will be grounded  beyond that date.    Defence chiefs are expected to rubberstamp the funding  decision at a budget meeting on Wednesday. Snoopy will at least  have a breathing space -- its crew had braced itself for news  that the money would run out this Easter.    The aircraft, based at Farnborough, Hampshire, is owned and  run as one of the Ministry of Defence's 59-strong RAF Hercules  fleet. The Meteorological Office [Met Office] pays for Snoopy's  technical crew and equipment at a cost of around 800,000 pounds  a year.    Met Office staff take part in numerous international  research  projects, and it pays its contribution to costs in Swiss francs.  The fall in the value of the pound at the end of 1992 left the  Met Office overdrawn on its budget by several million pounds --  hence the squeeze on Snoopy. Its future could only be  guaranteed if currency fluctuations swing the other way.    An RAF spokesman conceded that Snoopy was under review, but  no more or less than any other asset as part of a broad  assessment of all defence-related projects. "To say Snoopy  faces the axe would be to anticipate the outcome of that  review," he added.    The aircraft came to public attention after a trip to the  Gulf during which it flew through the thick, black smoke plumes  of the Kuwaiti oil fires -- analysing the level of pollutants to  help predict their health threat.    By "sniffing" the air with its extended snout, Snoopy has  helped to improve weather forecasting and long-term computer  models of climate change. John Pyle, one of Britain's experts  on the ozone hole and chairman of the UK Stratospheric Ozone  Review Group, said the loss "would be a tragedy for atmospheric  science in this country".    In a few weeks' time a scientific paper in the journal  Nature, produced using data gathered in Snoopy, is expected to  help explain why forecasts of global warming have proved wide of  the mark -- one of the most baffling questions facing  atmospheric science. Snoopy's research suggests a second group  of man-made pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, is slowing  down the warming effect of artificial greenhouse gases.    Many eminent scientists, from the UK and overseas, have  written to the Met Office, protesting at Snoopy's threatened  demise. A team from the US National Center for Atmospheric  Research in Boulder, Colorado, recently visited the Farnborough  group for advice on fitting out a joint US/German Hercules for  atmospheric research.    Snoopy flies two or three times a week, clocking up about  500  hours a year. It is booked up for years ahead by research teams  from all over the world. In October, Snoopy is due to be the  only aircraft taking part in a simulated major nuclear accident.  A few kilograms of a chemical compound called perfluorocarbon  will be released high over Brittany and its spread around Europe  monitored.</p>

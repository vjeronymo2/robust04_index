			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Wessex Water in rights issue for NFC waste deal WESSEX Waste Management, the joint venture between Waste Management International of the US and Wessex Water, is paying Pounds 113m for the waste division of transport and logistics specialist NFC. Wessex Water is raising Pounds 144.5m by a rights issue and other funding to pay for its share of the purchase, and leave Pounds 88m for future acquisitions. As part of the deal, Waste Management will lift its stake in Wessex Water from 14.9 per cent to 20 per cent, with options to raise its holding further to 23 per cent from 1995. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said the acquisition would 're-orbit' the company and lead to significant profits from its unregulated waste business when regulation of the core water business was tightening. WWM, which was set up in 1991, will become one of the top five waste specialists in the UK with annual turnover of more than Pounds 70m, just behind market leaders Cleanaway and Shanks &amp; McEwan. Following the acquisition, WWM's consented landfill space will increase from 18m cu m to 51 cu m and its employees will more than double to 1,200. Mr Hood said the extra money raised could be used to buy smaller, add-on companies in areas where WWM was weak, or to buy large waste companies 'when the price was right'. WWM has recently looked at Econowaste, part of Tarmac, but it is believed the asking price of about Pounds 100m was too high. An original standstill arrangement preventing WMI lifting its stake in Wessex above 20 per cent before 1998 has now been amended to 25 per cent. Mr Joe Holsten, WMI vice-president of acquisitions and development, acknowledged that the standstill arrangement could be changed again, although a further increase was 'not even at the discussion stage'. Wessex is raising Pounds 82.8m through the rights issue, which is the first launched by a UK water company since privatisation in 1989. The one-for-six issue, which is fully underwritten by SG Warburg, is priced at 480p, a 15 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of 563p. Wessex's shares closed down 9p at 568p. Wessex will raise a further Pounds 64.5m from WMI in the form of low-cost financing and shares which gain voting rights in 1995. Lex, Page 20 Details, Page 22</p>

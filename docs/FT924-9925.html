			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: An hourly rate to make an electronics engineer happy Sir, I am obliged to Mr John Richards for his enlightenment as to the enormous cost of bank cashiers (Letters, October 31). As an experiment I switched on a timer unit and asked my wife to hand me a Pounds 10 note over my desk. I opened a desk drawer, counted out Pounds 10 in coins and handed them to her. This operation took 15 seconds; so allow five seconds wasted time per transaction and at current bank charges this works out at Pounds 360 an hour. As a humble 66-year-old electronics engineer I would be more than happy to give change all day at this rate of income.

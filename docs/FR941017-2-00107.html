			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With certain minor modifications, the proposal maintains the current exceptions to Rule 1042. The proposal, however, adds language to Rule 1042(b) to expressly state that the burden of establishing an exception to the Exercise Cut-Off Time for a proprietary or customer account of a member organization rests solely on the member organization seeking to rely on such exception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event a member organization does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice in accordance with the proposed procedures, or does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice pursuant to an exception, the responsible member organization must prepare a written memorandum describing the surrounding circumstances <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  and must file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange's Market Surveillance Department no later than 12:00 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day following that expiration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The memorandum must also include the time when such final exercise decision was made or, in the case of a customer, was received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, in order to highlight the seriousness of violating Rule 1042, the proposed rule language would expressly state that effecting an exercise decision in an expiring equity option on the basis of material information obtained after the Exercise Cut-Off Time is considered to be activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposal would state in the Commentaries to Rule 1042 that the requirements specified in the rule do not apply to foreign currency options or index option products listed on the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) Exercise Cut-Off Time on Expiration Fridays for expiring equity options, the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options from clearing firms until 12:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on the expiration date ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Nevertheless, there have been situations where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions until after 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on Expiration Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to make it clear in its rules that the submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the Exercise Cut-Off Time will be activity deemed inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> In re Farmers Group Stock Options Litigation, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Master File No. 88&hyph;4994 (E.D.Pa). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil for violations of Rule 1042 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange, in addition to submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 1042, with the burden of establishing the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore, should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 1042. Accordingly, because the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding the exercise of expiring equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Phlx has represented that it will prepare (in cooperation with the other options exchanges) and distribute a notice to member organizations describing the new procedures set forth above, and notifying member organizations as to when the new procedures will be fully in effect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notes 5 and 15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises, the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 1042. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  Furthermore, the Commission also encourages the Exchange to review the permitted exceptions to Rule 1042 and consider ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the Phlx may wish to consider adopting additional penalties in those situations where a member organization is unable to establish the existence of one of the exceptions to Rule 1042 for a particular trade or trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the Exchange may want to define expressly in the rule the circumstances that qualify for a good faith exception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

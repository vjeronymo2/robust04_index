			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan, the United States, and South Korea have  agreed in principle to "take appropriate measures including  economic sanctions against North Korea in the UN Security  Council" for its suspected development of nuclear weapons. In  response, the government highly assessed the agreement on 5  June, saying, "Japan, the United States, and South Korea have  been able to show their cohesiveness," (according to a Foreign  Ministry source). The idea surfaced in response to Japan's  insistence that the UN Security Council adopt a "resolution  warning North Korea," and the government plans to speedily study  from early next week the possibility of including an embargo on  the export of weapons to North Korea in the resolution. While  the United States, Britain, and other nations are taking a tough  stand, China is still cautious about any economic sanctions  against North Korea. Japan, therefore, is likely to be pressed  to conduct difficult coordination.    The government will start a full-fledged study of measures  to  be taken by Japan after Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign  Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, who attended the  tripartite talks, returns to Japan on 6 June. The government  will hold a meeting of the "Joint Information Council" on 6 June  that is to be attended by officials from relevant ministries and  agencies, and chaired by Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo  Ishihara. With regard to the "resolution warning North Korea"  and other sanctions that were discussed at the tripartite talks,  the government sees the resolution as "a highly possible  option," (according to an informed source).    The Japanese Government has adopted a basic policy for  "phased sanctions against North Korea" under which 1) the UN  Security Council first adopts the "resolution warning North  Korea"; 2) in case North Korea refuses to go along with the  resolution, then the UN Security Council "votes to slap the  economic sanctions on North Korea"; and 3) in case China opposes  the economic sanctions, then Japan, the United States, and South  Korea impose their own economic sanctions against North Korea.  The Japanese Government has adopted this basic policy, taking  into account the situation where China is expressing its  disapproval of the economic sanctions against North Korea, and  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is opposing any  economic sanctions imposed jointly by Japan, the United States,  and South Korea as long as the UN Security Council does not vote  to impose such economic sanctions.    The export embargo of weapons and materials used to build  nuclear weapons to North Korea is included in measures that the  government believes Japan can take. The government believes  that since such weapons and materials are not actually exported  to North Korea, Japan's proposal for the export embargo will be  accepted by other nations (according to a government source).  The proposal is the product of a compromise between the United  States, that has advocated imposing tough economic sanctions  against North Korea from the beginning, and Japan and South  Korea that have been negative about imposing the economic  sanctions. As a result, the proposal has saved the face of the  United States. The effect of the economic sanctions is believed  to be slim. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the  United States, Britain, and France will demand tougher economic  sanctions against North Korea.    The question remains whether China will really go along with  Japan on the proposal for imposing the export embargo of weapons  to North Korea. While some government officials take an  optimistic view that China will accept the proposal in the end,  other government officials take the pessimistic view that China  will resist the proposal to the last. The government intends to  do everything it can in concert with the United States to  persuade China.</p>

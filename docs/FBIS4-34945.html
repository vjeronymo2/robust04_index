			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified special correspondent in Ottawa] </F>   [Text] Argentina confirmed on 20 June that it might "begin  a legal battle" to stop the sale of Canadian wheat to Brazil at  subsidized prices. The slump in wheat quotations resulting from  this move has caused Argentine producers to lose $180 million.    Felipe Sola, the agriculture, livestock, and fishing  secretary, met with his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale for  one of the most complicated negotiations of President Carlos  Menem's state visit to Canada, which is taking place without  other problems.    The issue is complex. Beside the losses incurred, Argentine  authorities know the expected stabilization of the Brazilian  economy would reverberate on the market, causing quotations to  tumble even further.    The diplomatic side of the issue adds its share of  complexity. Indeed, Argentina must try to convince Canada to  review its actions and, at the same time, prevent Brazil from  getting annoyed over the resulting increase in the prices of  their imports.    The Argentine Government needs the support of Brazil, one of  the beneficiaries of the deal in question, in this issue since  one of the possible legal battles will probably be fought within  the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] agreements. The other  front would be GATT.    Nevertheless, Argentine negotiators have an advantage over  their Canadian counterparts. By Canadian standards, to be  accused of dumping is a very serious insult. Canadian officials  are therefore willing to go overboard to prevent such an  awe-inspiring "stigma."    Canadians are proud of their fair-play in trade -- even  though Argentina sometimes disagrees. They boast that "the  United States has on several occasions charged us with unfair  competition practices, but could never prove our guilt."    The Argentine decision could be the acid test of incipient  Mercosur mechanisms, prompted by the fact that Canadian trade  practices triggered a drop of at least $20 per tonne of wheat.    One may wonder how much of the $180 million can be recovered  by Argentina as a result of these negotiations. So far,  considering that there are three parties involved, most  estimates do not exceed 30 percent while others go a bit further.</p>

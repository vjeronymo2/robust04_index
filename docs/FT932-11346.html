			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: China ready to buy 47 Boeings CHINA expects to buy at least 47 Boeing passenger aircraft this year at an estimated cost of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn), among other orders for aircraft such as the European Airbus and the Fokker-100. Mr Ye Yigan, president of the China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC), estimated this week that Chinese demand, mostly for passenger aircraft, would average about 40 a year for the foreseeable future. 'I believe China will purchase more this year than in 1992, when domestic passenger and freight transport volumes jumped by 28 per cent over 1991,' Mr Ye told the English-language Business Weekly. China's huge demand for new aircraft reflects a surge in traffic - passenger numbers have grown by at least 20 per cent annually since 1984 - coinciding with the country's 'open door' reforms and a boom which produced an economic growth rate last year of nearly 13 per cent. China's Boeing orders this year include 20 150-seater 737-300s with six options, and one Boeing 757-200. The Chinese are also reported to have signed for six new-generation 777s to be delivered in 1995. Boeing deliveries to China in 1992 will account for about 14 per cent of the company's total. It expects China to purchase about 800 of its aircraft over the next 15 years. European Airbus also recently clinched a deal for 12 aircraft worth about Dollars 1bn, with options for about a dozen more. 'The market is exploding,' said a western supplier of aircraft technology this week. 'Nobody can believe that the airline market can grow so fast.' Fuelling the boom is the rapid growth in new airlines. At least 42 airlines, including six big carriers, are now operating in China, with three more awaiting approval. Mr Ye said that as well as buying new aircraft, CASC was importing more of such items as navigation aids to upgrade facilities at dozens of airstrips around the vast country. He estimated that since 1980 China had imported aviation supplies worth Dollars 10bn. Among other foreign aircraft makers engaged in the China business are McDonnell Douglas of the US, which has been involved in a joint venture in Shanghai since the mid-1980s; and Saab-Scania of Sweden, which is negotiating with the Xian Aircraft Corporation to produce the 100-seat Saab-2000. The sales boom and increasing talk of co-production deals coincide with publication of a fairly gloomy assessment of the Chinese aviation industry in the official Outlook magazine which posed the question: 'What is wrong with Chinese civil aviation?' The magazine reported big increases in activity, including a surge last year of 30 per cent in passenger traffic, and purchases of some 56 aircraft. But the article concluded: 'Just as the old saying goes, 'we've bought the horse but can't afford the saddle'. 'Ground facilities, including communications systems, radar navigation and weather forecasting, cannot cope with the rapid increase in numbers of planes,' it added. 'Maintenance is another problem, and so, too, is trained staff. An investigation into a plane crash last year showed the pilot had been overworking for several months.' As an illustration of the problems of overwork and exhaustion, the magazine quoted this exchange between a pilot and hostess. 'Why can't you smile when you serve the passengers?' The young woman replied: 'I've no smile left. I work extra hours every day. I'm too tired. I only want to cry.'</p>

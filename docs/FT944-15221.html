			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: GE ahead despite losses at Kidder General Electric, the diversified US conglomerate, shrugged off losses at its Kidder Peabody investment banking subsidiary with a 13 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 1.37bn. GE Capital Services, the financial services division which includes Kidder, raised net earnings 7 per cent to Dollars 526m. This was in spite of Kidder's net operating loss of Dollars 85m. GE said seven of its 12 divisions had produced double-digit rises in operating profit: the NBC broadcasting network, plastics, motors, appliances, power systems, lighting and information services. Only one division, aircraft engines, failed to produce sales growth in the quarter. The unit, which has been hit in the past two years by a downturn in civil and military orders, also suffered a fall in operating profit. GE said on Monday it would take a fourth-quarter charge of about Dollars 500m on the sale of parts of Kidder Peabody to rival broking firm Paine-Webber. Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said yesterday: 'This transaction and the record level of performance demonstrated this year by our other businesses position us well for the future.' GE's involvement with Kidder, which has cost it about Dollars 1.5bn, has exposed Mr Welch to criticism. Further potential embarrassment comes next week with the opening of a court case in Columbus, Ohio charging GE and De Beers, the South African mining group, with collusion over the price of artificial diamonds. Discussions on the future of NBC were continuing with various parties, the company said. However, it reiterated that it was looking for ways of strengthening the business rather than selling it outright. Suitors for all or part of NBC have been said to include Time Warner, Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting and ITT. 'We think NBC is very well positioned for future growth. If there were ways of helping that along, we'd look at it,' GE said. Making no change was also an option, it added. Group sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 16.2bn, and operating margins rose to 12.8 per cent from 11.6 per cent. Operating cash flow in the quarter remained steady at Dollars 2.6bn.</p>

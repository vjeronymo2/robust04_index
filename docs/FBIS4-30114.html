			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa informed U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor by  phone on Thursday [23 June] night that he has canceled his  planned visit to the United States this weekend for bilateral  "framework" trade talks, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Kakizawa and Kantor agreed to hold a working-group meeting  on  the framework talks in the middle of next week in Washington,  the officials said.    The cancellation was decided because the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion  earlier in the day to the House of Representatives against the  cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, they said.</p>

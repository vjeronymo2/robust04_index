			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Olivetti targets mobile telecoms market OLIVETTI, the Italian computer group due to report first-half results next week, hopes to break into Italy's buoyant mobile telecommunications market. The Italian market is Europe's second biggest after the UK, with more than 900,000 subscribers. Mr Corrado Passera, joint managing director, asked the government to respect a European Community deadline to name a second operator for the GSM network by early 1993. Olivetti is one of three consortia bidding for the licence. Although rivals include Fiat and Pacific Telesis of the US, Mr Passera said he thought Olivetti was best placed to win. 'Information technology and communications are drawing steadily closer. Giving us the licence would help lift Olivetti into the first tier of companies combining computers and telecommunications,' he said. Mr Passera said Olivetti already had a nationwide sales and service network, so any additional investment for cellular communications would be 'reasonable'. He would not predict what impact winning the licence might have on profits, but said Olivetti's combination of information technology and communications would expand the Italian market. Olivetti, which made a L649.9bn (Dollars 423m) net loss last year, is expected to announce a further heavy loss for the first half of this year when it reports next Friday. However, while this year's first-half loss may be appreciably higher than the L93.4bn lost in first six months of 1992, analysts believe the results will show the group has contained the severe earnings slump suffered during the second half of last year. Group sales are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent. Although the value of sales outside Italy will be inflated by the lower lira, analysts believe the depreciation has pushed up costs owing to higher component prices. Forecasts for the full-year results predict a net loss of more than L400bn, prior to breaking even in 1994.</p>

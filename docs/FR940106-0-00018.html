			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to these comments, &sect;295.5 has been modified to increase the weight of the ``level of commitment'' to 20 percent, the level that exists in the regulation as it was promulgated in 1990. The weight given ``experience and qualifications'' has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 295.8(a)&blank;Patent Rights_(40 Comments) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forty comments were received concerning the proposed revision to &sect;295.8(a)(1), thirty-nine from universities and other nonprofit organizations opposed to the proposal, and one from a business supporting the proposal. Also, twenty-three of the thirty-nine commentors described above objected to the definition of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``United States-owned company'' defined in &sect;295.2(r) is used in &sect;295.8(a)(1) to determine who is eligible to obtain title inventions arising from assistance under ATP. The definition states that an entity must be organized for profit-making purposes to be deemed a United States-owned company, and &sect;295.8(a)(1) states that only United States-owned companies may take title to inventions arising under the ATP. Taken together, the two sections prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from obtaining title to inventions arising under the ATP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The thirty-nine universities and nonprofit commentors are strongly opposed to this outcome. The following objection is typical: ``The ATP legislation enables universities to participate in research funded through the program, and (we have) taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. However, the problem is that NIST has interpreted the ATP legislation to exclude universities from ownership of intellectual property resulting from ATP funded research.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the view of NIST, the decision to prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from taking title to inventions is embedded in statute, and NIST has no alternative but to follow the law as it presently is written. As a result of comments received from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations, NIST recognizes that one ingredient for the successful implementation of joint ventures under ATP is a flexible patent policy. The participants in ATP joint ventures need the flexibility to determine for themselves the best means of commercializing the technology they develop. This, in turn, requires the flexibility to allocate intellectual property rights as the joint ventures best see fit. Accordingly, NIST is working with the Congress in an attempt to enact a patent policy for ATP that leaves the decisions on patent ownership to joint venture members. Should a change in the law be enacted, NIST would immediately implement it. In that case, NIST would rely on the ATP proposal evaluation criteria to assess the probability of subsequent commercialization based on the proposed intellectual property rights arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)) states that intellectual property rights developed under ATP ``shall vest in a company or companies incorporated in the United States.'' In reaching the conclusion that the term ``company or companies'' refers to profit-making entities, NIST has been guided by the broader context of changes made to the ATP by the American Technology Preeminence Act. NIST believes that it was the intent of Congress to provide title to inventions directly to U.S. companies as the most effective means of assuring that research results enter the marketplace rapidly, and in the way most beneficial to United States businesses. In this context, NIST notes that the Act contains a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' funded by ATP must be industry-led. NIST also notes the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to nonprofit independent research organizations. (See sections 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, NIST believes that the only reasonable reading of section 201(c)(6) is to interpret the term ``United States-owned company'' as referring to businesses, and specifically, to for-profit entities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: TDK slips 34.5% as electronics markets remain depressed TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, yesterday reported a 34.5 per cent drop to Y18.17bn (Dollars 146.53m) in consolidated pre-tax profits in the half-year to September, reflecting broad weakness in electronics markets. Sales at the Tokyo-based company fell 2.1 per cent to Y266.1bn, led by a 5.3 per cent decline in sales of electronic materials and components to Y182.7bn. TDK said that overseas demand from the automobile and computer industries was strong. However, sales had been hit by declining demand from manufacturers of audio and video equipment. The company said it had successfully increased sales to the computer industry of products such as semiconductors and magnetic heads for hard disc drives, metal magnets, and chip capacitors. TDK also managed to increase sales of magnetic recording media, such as tapes and floppy disks, by 5.7 per cent to Y83.38bn. Sales outside Japan grew by 1.8 per cent to Y139,977 in spite of the rise in the value of the yen, accounting for 52.6 per cent of sales. Net earnings fell by 23.9 per cent to Y10.1bn. On a parent company basis, TDK's results were much worse, with pre-tax profits down by 47.6 per cent to Y11.4bn. The weaker parent company figures reflect the softness of domestic Japanese demand, as well as a decline in exports to Europe following the start-up of operations at TDK's magnetic recording media factory in Luxembourg in October last year. TDK said it had given up hope for a recovery in the second half of the year. It added that it had lowered its projection for full-year parent-company pre-tax profits to Y20bn, compared with Y33.4bn last year.</p>

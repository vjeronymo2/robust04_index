			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korea,  speeding up the discharge of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, had removed 60 percent of the rods  as of Monday, a source at South Korea's U.N. mission said.    A mission official said the information became known after  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to the  U.N. Security Council, explaining that "the council's quick  adoption of a presidential statement reflects the urgent state  caused by North Korea's fast refueling of the nuclear reactor."    Referring to IAEA Director-general Hans Blix's letter on May  27 to U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the official  noted that "only two days remained for that opportunity." In the  letter, Blix said that if North Korea continued removing fuel at  the present pace, the chances for selecting, segregating and  storing the discharged rods for later IAEA measurement would be  lost in a few days.    Accordingly, the North Korean nuclear crisis is expected to  reach a critical stage in the middle of this week. It is also  anticipated that the Security Council would take follow-up  action such as adopting a resolution warning of economic  sanctions if Pyongyang continued discharging the fuel rods.</p>

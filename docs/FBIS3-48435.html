			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The people of the  northern half of Korea are bitterly condemning the inhuman act  of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique in blocking the Seoul trip  of a mourners' group of the North for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan.    The director of the Kim Chong-tae General Electric  Locomotive  Works, Pak Su-pom, branded the act of the Kim Yong-sam clique as  an inhuman act of fascist hooligans who take no account of the  beautiful manners and customs handed down through generations  and elementary civility and morality.    He said:    "The South Korean puppet clique mumbled about the `nuclear  issue' and `an organization profiting the enemy.' It is really a  far-fetched argument and an expression of a vicious scheme to  dampen the nation's fervor of reunification, delay the country's  reunification and finally break off the ties of the nation".    He warned that a sledge-hammer blow will be dealt at the Kim  Yong-sam clique, the enemy with whom our nation cannot live  under the same sky.    Yi Song-pong, chief pastor of the Pongsu Church, Pyongyang,  said:    "By not allowing delegates of the North to go to Seoul to  mourn the deceased, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique stripped  themselves bare as a group of barbarians ignoring human  morality."    He said Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a patriotic champion of  reunification who devotedly struggled for the reunification of  the country and democratization of society in South Korea for  many years. He pointed out that the "civilian" signboard hung  out by the Kim Yong-sam clique was false and it was a group of  traitors who did not want national reconciliation and  reunification.    "I join the religious men in declaring to the world that the  Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is a group of truculent, despicable  traitors who must no longer be left in this world where only  love, harmony and trust must prevail and, on this land of our  nation," he added.</p>

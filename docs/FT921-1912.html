			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Motoring: Smart, sporty and it's an estate - BMW 5-Series Touring SMART and luxurious estates have become an attractive alternative to executive saloons. None comes smarter than the BMW 5-Series Touring, which arrives in Britain next week. BMW still cannot quite bring itself to call the Touring an estate car lest it detract from the marque's sporting image, but that is exactly what it is. The tailgate lifts to reveal a carpeted space that takes a couple of golf bags and trollies with the rear seat in use, and something as awkward as a large rotary mower with the seat down. As the sill is wide, low and - unlike the 3-Series Touring - unobstructed by rear light clusters, humping such things on board is not difficult. Four retractable tying-down points come in handy when carrying things likely to move around on their own. It is not even necessary to raise the tailgate to get at the load space. If you only want to drop in, say, some shopping, the rear window hinges up on its own. Naturally, a sliding blind conceals from thieves what is put in the load compartment. Removing the complete blind and roller, or lowering the rear seat backs complete with headrests, is a one-handed job using touch buttons. In every way it is an urbane and civilised car. Unless you turn round and take a look, you would not realise it was an estate, not a saloon. It feels rock-solid on rough roads. Regardless of engine speed, there is no body boom. At present, two engines are offered: 2.0-litre or 2.5-litre, 24-valve straight sixes with power outputs of 150 and 192 horsepower respectively. These engines, introduced for BMW saloons 18 months ago, should return at least 28 mpg (10.1 l/100km) in normal use and give a gentle driver more than 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) on a journey. They are said to cut servicing costs by nearly a quarter compared with the old 12-valve units. Within a year, there will be 2.5-litre turbo-diesel option. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard with automatic transmission (also five-speed) a desirable (if costly) Pounds 1,150 optional extra. BMW claims the two-pedal cars have much the same consumption as those with manual gears. The 520i Touring I am now driving is everything you would expect a BMW to be. The engine pulls silkily in high gear at low revolutions, and hums sweetly at 5,000 rpm-plus in the gears. As the Touring is significantly heavier than the saloon, standing-start acceleration is adequate rather than kick-in-the-back. The 2.5-litre version is, of course, more urgent. But providing you are willing to drop down into fourth or third when necessary, the 2.0-litre car is a vigorous and refined performer on a cross-country journey. Every 5-Series Touring comes with ABS brakes, power steering, central locking (with deadlocks on all doors), electric windows and door mirrors, and a two-section powered sun roof. Buyers of the priciest 520i and 525i SE (for special equipment) models can delete the sun roof and, for only Pounds 350 extra, have air-conditioning instead. This sensible option is not available on the cheaper ones. I think it should be. BMW GB reckons it will sell about 2,600 of the 5-Series Touring estates this year at prices ranging from Pounds 20,950 for a manual 520i to Pounds 28,100 for a 525i SE automatic. Four-wheel drive versions - the first BMW has made with right-hand steering - join the range in June. They will have 2.5-litre engines and prices are expected to be in the Pounds 28,000 to Pounds 30,300 brackets. What will the 5-Series Tourings be up against? Not just the market-leading Volvos and the Audi 100, Citroen XM and Mercedes 200-300 estates you might expect but also large hatchbacks (Granada/Scorpio, Rover 800 Vitesse and the new Renault Safrane, for example). It will compete on price rather than sheer carrying capacity; as a bulk carrier, a 5-Series Touring is no match for the really big estates. BMW GB also sees the Touring seducing some owners out of their Range Rover, Shogun, Land Cruiser and Trooper recreational four-wheel drives. With its up-market looks, a BMW 5-Series Touring has Smith's Lawn and Badminton written all over it. And, with all-wheel drive, it would not need towing out of a muddy car park, either.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Pedro Collor alleges Dollars 25m bribe MR Pedro Collor, the younger brother of Brazil's President Fernando Collor, yesterday produced the results of medical tests confirming his own sanity and accused the president's campaign treasurer of attempting to bribe him with Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.1m) to leave the country. Mr Pedro Collor took the tests to lend credibility to claims against the president and his campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias. Details are on a videotape which Mr Pedro Collor says could bring down the government. Insisting that 'all I have said in earlier interviews is true,' Mr Pedro Collor admitted yesterday for the first time that he had no proof against his presidential brother. However, he repeated his allegations of extortion against Mr Farias (known as PC), whom he said had tried to influence his brother. He alleged: 'PC tried to bribe me with Dollars 25m through a mutual friend to leave the country until 1995 (when Mr Collor's term ends)'. The Brazilian stock markets immediately rose on Mr Pedro Collor's admission of lack of evidence against the president and by the end of the day the main Sao Paulo index had gained 7.5 per cent. However, problems are far from over for the president, who is due to open the Earth Summit next week. In the early hours of yesterday morning the Brazilian Congress approved a parliamentary inquiry into Mr Pedro Collor's allegations.</p>

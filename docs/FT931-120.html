			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brake Bros ahead BRAKE BROS, a supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade, increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 16m last year - helped by steady margins in its core businesses and a sharp rise in sales. Mr Frank Brake, managing director, attributed the group's success in supplying a generally depressed catering trade to the investment in training and service. 'We continue to invest heavily in people,' Mr Brake said. 'That is probably why we have outperformed others in the recession.' The group reported a 26 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 280.5m. However, excluding acquisitions and the newly developed fine foods division, sales were ahead 10 per cent. Mr Brake said the company's main frozen foods business - which claims some 19 per cent of the Pounds 1.3bn UK market - had maintained its margins. Further benefits were expected in this operation from the integration of acquisitions made in 1991 and investments in distribution facilities completed in 1992. A second interim dividend of 4.35p in lieu of a final, to beat Budget changes on ACT, makes a 6.2p (5.75p) total.</p>

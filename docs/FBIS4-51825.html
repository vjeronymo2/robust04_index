			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, May 4 KYODO -- The city of Fukuoka on  Wednesday [4 May] welcomed a proposal to host the annual meeting  of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] in 1997. "I'm convinced  that our city is eligible because the Asian Development Bank's  policy of contributing to development in the Asia-Pacific region  matches Fukuoka city's policy," Fukuoka Mayor Keiichi Kuwahara  said.    Kuwahara made the statement after Japanese Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii proposed the holding of the 30th annual meeting  of the ADB in 1997 in Fukuoka at an ADB annual meeting in Nice,  France Wednesday. Fukuoka is located in the northern part of  Kyushu, the most southwestern main island of Japan.    "It's a great pleasure. It will help make not only Fukuoka  but also Kyushu better known" said Tatsuo Kawai, chairman of the  Kyushu-Yamaguchi Economic Federation, a local business group.    The Fukuoka business community hopes that by holding the ADB  meeting in their city, it will enhance its image as a city open  to Asia.</p>

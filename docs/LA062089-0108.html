			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal judges and senior executive branch employees should get pay raises,  House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) declared. "It may well be that they'll  recommend that we phase out honorariums over a period of years with perhaps an  increase over a period of years starting in the next Congress for members of  Congress," Foley said at a political fund-raiser in New York. Foley's comments  are the first indication that Congress is willing to reopen the politically  volatile issue. The House in February, mindful of a public outcry, killed a 51%  hike for judges, executives and legislators.  </P></p>

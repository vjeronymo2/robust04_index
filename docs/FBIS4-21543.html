			<p>BFN     [Text] Yi Chung-kuk, a sergeant of the North Korean Army  affiliated to the nuclear chemical defense bureau who defected  on 18 March, said in a news conference on 22 March that North  Korea is capable of killing all the people in the South with  just the chemical weapons and bacterial weapons it now possesses.    Yi Chung-kuk said that currently North Korea has facilities  that produce biochemical weapons and storage bases under the  Ministry of the People's Armed Forces in various places. He  also exposed that the chemical weapons are the most poisonous in  the world.    He said he heard on several occasions beginning in 1991 from  high-ranking military cadres and his senior officers that North  Korea has already completed nuclear weapons development. When  North Korea was receiving a special [tukpyol] inspection in  March 1993 from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said  he heard from his senior officer that it will be of no use to  inspect Yongbyon because nuclear weapons are being produced at  another place.</p>

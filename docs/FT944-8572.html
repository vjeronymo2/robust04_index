			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Mobile phone price war fear Hong Kong is to go ahead with plans to issue up to 10 new mobile telephone licences, despite criticism from existing providers and analysts that the move could lead to price wars and lower standards of service. The decision, yesterday, follows a lengthy consultation process that began when industry views were solicited in February. Hong Kong has no bars on foreign ownership, and since the proposal to expand the market was first mooted, big industry players from across the world have made exploratory trips to the colony. More than 100 application documents were handed out after the announcement. The telecommunications Authority will decide on the number of licences to be issued.</p>

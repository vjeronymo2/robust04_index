			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Letter: Conservatives and community principles Sir, David Willetts ('Personal view', April 13) claims Majorite Conservatism rests on a combination of markets and community. Unfortunately for this aspiration, more than 100 years of both conservative and radical social science have shown that market and community activities are inherently contradictory. In a community, people act on the basis of moral values, while markets work largely because values are excluded. As one of J G Farrell's characters mockingly asks in his novel The Singapore Grip: 'Do you expect a stockbroker to die for the Stock Exchange?' On the other hand, pace David Willetts, support for welfare state institutions, such as the National Health Service, is a reflection of moral values. Contrary to Mr Willetts' view, the danger is that blanket support for market processes will displace the shared values that sustain community principles. If Conservatives are serious about 'community' they need to re-think their blind faith in 'free' markets. Otherwise they may have to face a more disillusioned electorate in 1997.

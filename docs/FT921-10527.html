			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian corporate bond issues climb to ADollars 7.19bn TOTAL issuance in the Australian corporate bond market rose 9.5 per cent to ADollars 7.19bn last year, according to investment bank Bain and Co, Reuter reports. Bain said this pushed total outstanding issues in the market to ADollars 18.8bn at December 31, reflecting an impressive growth rate since the market's inception in 1988. It said notable features of 1991 included the relaxation of controls on borrowings by foreign governments and international organisations. 'The creation of a new category of supranational foreign borrowers is an exciting development for the domestic market,' Bain said in its annual corporate bond market review. Foreign organisations to tap the Australian markets in 1991 were the European Investment Bank which issued ADollars 400m of bonds and Eurofima which issued ADollars 200m. Corporate bond issuance rose to ADollars 6.5bn in 1990 from ADollars 2.65bn in 1989 and ADollars 3.58bn in 1988. Bain said AAA-rated issuers accounted for 69.5 per cent of 1991 issues - 94.1 per cent in the first half of 1991. It said this reflected investors' preoccupation with credit worthiness.</p>

The party, however, calls on to the Macedonian people to  organize peaceful demonstrations in front of the Macedonian  Parliament, in support of the Macedonian parliament deputies'  efforts to prevent adopting of the government proposal to  conduct the census in [number indistinct] languages, which would  automatically promote the Republic of Macedonian into a  multinational state.</p>

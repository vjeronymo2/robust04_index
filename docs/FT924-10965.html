			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Market takes aim at the Old Lady: Criticisms of the Bank of England's way of providing cash to the sterling money market These are tough times for the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. The Bank of England has been sharply criticised by politicians and the press for its handling of the sterling crisis and the BCCI affair. Now, a growing chorus of complaint can be heard about another area of the Bank's activity: the method by which it provides cash to the sterling money market. The provision of cash to the banking system is one of the Bank's most important roles. The daily injection of sterling into the money market ensures commercial banks have adequate liquidity for their operations. The rate at which the Bank sells cash also sets the level of base rates throughout the banking system. But, in recent weeks, money market dealers have criticised the Bank's method of providing liquidity as antiquated and unsophisticated. Two specific complaints are voiced. First, that the Bank was unable to check the heavy selling of its currency during the recent foreign exchange turmoil by raising money market rates. Secondly, that it has been unable to stop short-term money market rates rising as high as 100 per cent since sterling's devaluation on Black Wednesday, September 16, forcing some banks to pay a very high premium to borrow money. 'The Bank's money market operations are creaking at the seams,' says Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. 'And a lot of people say that the system needs to be changed.' The first charge against the Bank focuses on its inability to defend sterling in the run-up to 'Black Wednesday'. Critics say that the Bank of England's operations did not enable it to defend the currency with the same credibility that was enjoyed by the Bank of France. In the face of huge selling of the French franc, the Bank of France avoided raising the key 'intervention rate', through which some 90 per cent of bank refinancing is done. Instead, it raised rates in the 5-10 day lending window, through which a small proportion of the banking sector is funded, by 1.5 percentage points. This convinced speculators that the Bank was determined to tighten policy and defend the currency without passing the costs of higher rates on to corporates and the private sector. However, the Bank of England did not enjoy the same flexibility. Its only means of scaring speculators was a vain attempt to raise interest rates on short-dated bills, instantly putting up base rates. This was ineffective. 'The rise in base rates to 15 per cent on Black Wednesday had no credibility with foreign exchange dealers because it dealt a devastating blow to corporates and the household sector,' says Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg securities. 'Effectively, the Bank has a single sledge-hammer with which to crack every nut.' That inflexibility is now being blamed for a problem that has surfaced since Black Wednesday: the sharp fluctuation in short-term sterling rates, making the market an uncertain environment for traders. The rate for overnight lending in the interbank market has ranged between 10 per cent and 100 per cent since last Friday. This is due to the large shortage of cash in the system following the Bank's purchases of sterling on the foreign exchanges last month, estimated at Pounds 15bn. According to one money market dealer, the volatility in rates is undermining overseas confidence in London as a financial centre. 'Why should any overseas investor wish to trade in sterling when he has no idea what rate he will pay to borrow it on any given day?' he said. Critics say the Bank cannot bring rates down because it is hindered by two faults in the system: The discount houses, which are specialist banks acting as intermediaries between the monetary authorities and the banking system, say the shortages are aggravated because the Bank has allowed their traditional role as providers of liquidity to be eroded. Up to the end of the 1980s, most commercial banks had to deposit 6 per cent of their stock of bills with discount houses in the form of a subscription fee known as 'club money'. Clearing banks are now being allowed to ignore that rule and are building up large stocks of these bills, leaving less liquidity among commercial banks and building societies. The discount houses believe the Bank should reinforce the club money rule. The Bank is unable to inject short-term funds into the market because this would be interpreted by dealers as signalling a base-rate cut. In recent months, the Bundesbank has successfully controlled money-market rates by injecting or draining short-term funds from the system, while leaving its officially posted rates unchanged. The Bank of England cannot do the same because it controls money market rates and base rates via the same operations. In the current political climate, dealers are expecting base rate to be cut to 6 per cent at any time, and the Bank cannot inject funds to bring down money market rates without signalling a base rate cut as well. The Bank of England is standing firmly by its system. It acknowledged yesterday that the French have a wider variety of instruments with which to set rates than the British. But a Bank official argued that the Bank of France avoided passing the costs of higher lending rates on to the private sector because of its huge shareholding in the French banks, putting pressure on bank chiefs not to raise base rates. 'Their market is less perfect,' he said. The official also argued that overnight rates were high in spite of its preparedness to offer cash to the market to meet the shortage. Dealers are not prepared to sell bills to the Bank at current rates, thinking there will be a base rate cut. 'The overnight rate has been up at high levels because the market has been in a fever pitch about a base rate cut that never came,' he said.</p>

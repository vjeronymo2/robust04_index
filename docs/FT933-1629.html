			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Howard unveils tough changes to police discipline system MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, yesterday braved a hostile audience of police superintendents to unveil tough changes to the disciplinary system. In his speech to the Police Superintendents' Association, Mr Howard made no concessions on proposed sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system contained in the Sheehy report, the Runciman Royal Commission and a government white paper. On Tuesday, 200 delegates, representing 2,400 superintendents in England and Wales, passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the criminal justice system. But Mr Howard refused - against the conference's hopes - to rule out any of the proposals in the Sheehy report, and emphasised his determination to make the most of the opportunity to improve the criminal justice system. His speech followed a critical address by Chief Supt David Golding, the PSA's president, who described the Sheehy report as a 'sloppy document' that heralded a downmarket service. Nor would the unprecedented range of reforms improve the system. He said: 'The rush to change police structures and practice is not justified, and does nothing to prevent one crime or gain a single conviction.' The government was targeting the police and not the overall system. The home secretary's reforms of disciplinary procedures, which were not greeted warmly, include: A procedure for immediate dismissal for flagrant misconduct. Police officers required to resign or be dismissed for a pattern of unsatisfactory behaviour. Removal of the right to legal representation for officers facing disciplinary hearings. Supt Brian Butcher, for the PSA national executive, said the conference had been disappointed by both yesterday's changes and Mr Howard's apparent failure to listen to concerns during the consultation period to the Sheehy report, which extends to the end of the month. He said: 'The changes to the disciplinary system will remove some of the safeguards that currently exist and the rights, like that of silence, that officers enjoy.' The Police Federation, representing policemen up to the rank of chief inspector, is to take legal advice about the new guidelines. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the reforms would make for 'a more centralised, more bureaucratic and less effective police service'. Mr Howard said he hoped to make an announcement on the Sheehy report late next month.</p>

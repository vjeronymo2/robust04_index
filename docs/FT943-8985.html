			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Travel: Cyprus: empires and civilisations slept here - J D F Jones rediscovers the charms of the island's Greek south and Turkish north but is left feeling a little sad and worried I have a problem with Cyprus. I used to go there a lot, before the Turkish invasion and after the Eoka business, when it was a lovely place. We would arrive from the dangerous complexities of Beirut or Jerusalem or Damascus - Cyprus used to be the transit stop for journalists covering the Middle East  -and grab a couple of days on expenses, based at the late-lamented Ledra Palace Hotel in Nicosia and usually wandering down to Paphos or Kyrenia for a night. It was a modest, undemanding, friendly, beautiful, provincial island. Then it was divided by the 1974 invasion. Today, there is something worrying about the place. A bit sad, perhaps. Certainly there is something wrong in the north. As for the south, it has changed almost beyond recognition. I revisited both the Greek south and the Turkish-held north (on separate trips) and only slowly rediscovered the island's charms. Newcomers may not understand this. The British are particularly keen on Cyprus once they have tried it: apparently no other holiday destination has so high a proportion of 'return' bookings. This is not surprising when you consider that this is the Mediterranean island best suited to the less bold, less confident holidaymaker - everyone is friendly and speaks English, you drive on the left, the food is recognisable and unpretentious, culture is available but not overwhelming, and of course the beaches are splendid, the landscape wonderful, the mountains purple on the horizon, and there are frequent flights from UK airports. For a different sort of visitor, Cyprus has always stood at a crossroads between Europe, the Levant and Africa. Empires and civilisations have passed through Cyprus in unending procession, from Minoans and Mycenaeans to Crusaders and Lusignans, Venetians and Turks, and - yes - the British. But at a more individual level it has also been a stopping-off point, a relaxing place to break a journey either before or after the rigours of Arabia or Egypt. Sir Samuel Butler took a break in Cyprus on his way to explore the Nile, and found time to write a book about the island; Lawrence Durrell's memoir of the 1950s shows a stream of visitors, such as Freya Stark and Harry Luke and Rose Macaulay, all of them on their way to, or from, somewhere more serious. Everyone loved Cyprus for its quiet and undemanding obscurity. Durrell's friends would stay with him in Bellapais and drive up to the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia. You can't do that any more. You have to choose whether to take your holiday in the south or in the north. They are very different places these days, although you will be looking at those same mountains on the horizon. To start with, the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is recognised only by the Turkish government in Ankara. The single inconvenience this entails is that you cannot fly direct: you must break your journey on the mainland, if only for a nominal 45 minutes before taking off again (in the same aircraft) for Ercan. The larger snag is that the north is run-down, poor and much less sophisticated than the south, which lies across the UN-supervised front-line. Many roads are pot-holed, the villages are unkempt, hotels are (literally) dusty, and the churches have been desecrated. The other side of the coin is that life is remarkably cheap, you can always find a room or a table, the food is much more interesting than in the south, and the locals are extremely pleased to see you. Slowly, the expatriates have been returning to their villas in the sun. But there is very little sign that tourists are arriving in the numbers the economy needs, despite the fact that north Cyprus surely presents one of the few and best remaining chances to experience the unspoiled Mediterranean. For example, immediately west of Kyrenia (sorry, Girne, as it is now called) there is a 10-mile stretch of coast which, anywhere else in the Med, would by now be a corniche lined solid with hotels, restaurants and swimming beaches. The narrow coastal plain rises through orchards and olive groves and picture-book villages to the dramatic two-dimensional cut-out silhouette of the Kyrenia range. The sea is very good indeed; Turkey lies in the distance. Yet today, starting from Asil Nadir's glossy Jasmine Court complex on the outskirts of Kyrenia, all you will find is a stutter of small groups of hotels and apartment houses, often half-finished in the Middle East style of sprouting spikes of reinforced concrete. Here and there you come to a 'casino', or a lonely bar like 'Rita on the Rocks', or a small German restaurant set in a garden of flowers. Across on the north-east coast, it is a similar story. Famagusta and its tourist strip are still no-man's land. The Old Town of Famagusta is accessible but stagnant, dead, behind its medieval walls. Ten miles to the north is the island's most important - and largely undug - archaeological site of ancient Salamis, scarcely disturbed by visitors. It is extremely large and stands on a beautiful but surprisingly empty bay which features half-a-dozen high-rise tourist hotels scattered a few miles apart along a good road and incongruously set in a wasteland of flat, drained marsh: rather spooky. I stayed in the best-remembered of these hotels, the upmarket Park, and had to move out because the dust seemed to date from 1974. To the north-east, the Kyrenia range peters out into the Karpas 'panhandle', where few people bother to venture any more and where the UN troops supply a handful of stranded Greek villages. A mile inland from Salamis is a rare curiosity, one of the few unvandalised churches - the Monastery of the Apostle Barnabas, now restored and turned into an unimportant icon museum but with attractive cloisters which have become, thanks to sympathetic conversion, the best archaeological museum in the north. It has the usual range of good-quality pre-classical stuff, Mycenaean, etc, but the stars of the show are a batch of Greek sculptures including Demeter with a poppy, a sphinx, and a superb double-lion. At the bottom of the garden is the alleged catacomb of St Barnabas himself, erstwhile companion of St Paul. The whole operation is presided over by a carob tree and friendly Turkish custodians. As so often in the Mediterranean, one suspects that the site pre-dates both Christianity and Islam. The shadow on this beautiful northern landscape is cast by the visitor's suspicion that he is enjoying - or perhaps living in - occupied property: not the territory so much as the actual house or plot. The subject of land ownership since 1974 is immensely complicated, and not to be discussed here. But walk through Bellapais, for instance - the most thriving of the tourist venues of the north, the hillside village immortalised by Lawrence Durrell in Bitter Lemons - and you find yourself wondering who owns, or owned, what. As the years go by and the reunification of the island refuses to grow closer, these matters will perhaps become faits accomplis. For the record, Bellapais is still beautiful, the abbey unchanged save for an in-house restaurant, the Tree of Idleness there still (or perhaps it is a descendant), and directly at the foot of the abbey cliff there is a new-ish hotel set in handsome gardens. To the sentimental and nostalgic visitor, Kyrenia looks just the same. It was always a lovely, seductive place, and the old harbour is as photogenic and pretty as ever, lined entirely with fish restaurants and open-air tables and pleasure craft, the coloured lights at sunset falling down into the bay like Christmas decorations. The castle still stands at one end, the Dome Hotel at the other. The Dome is one of the famous hotels of the Levant: it pushes its luck for four stars - it is pretty tatty by the standards of the 1990s - but it has character and remains the focal point of the little town, standing there on the edge of the bay, extending these days into a sea-water swimming pool built out into the rocks. A good spot for a brandy sour, that national drink of Cyprus north as well as south. Once upon a time we used to drive back - south - up the hill, past the turn-off to St Hilarion Castle, through the bends where the UN ran convoys, up and over the top and, suddenly, we would be looking down on the sun-parched plain and the roofs of Nicosia in the distance. These days Nicosia needs a separate trip, another flight. I always think that Cyprus is culturally a part of Greece rather in the way that Sicily is culturally a part of Italy: the two islands are different from the mainland nation but are a part of the Greek-Italian experience. South of the UN line, you immediately realise you have returned to Byzantium, however cosmopolitan and English-speaking the place has become. The south has none of the emptiness, the sense of undusted rooms, of the north. On the contrary. Paphos, which used to be a friendly little fishing village with a lovely archaeological site, is stacked and bursting with a hundred tourist hotels; Nicosia for me has lost much of its special character; the south coast, where Aphrodite was born out of the waves - and if you visit her flower-like rock and are in the right frame of mind, you can believe it - is lined with 'Real Estate For Sale' signs. You will find 'Aphrodite's Car Hire' and 'Aphrodite's Snacks' and 'Aphrodite's Gymnasium' and so on, just as in Crete the name of Minos favours every take-away shack. Other things have not changed. This is still a corner of a foreign field for Britain's ministry of defence, notwithstanding the presence in Nicosia of a 'Museum for the National Struggle': the Akrotiri sovereign base still boasts green-grass playing fields, RAF radio masts, reassuring signposts to squash courts and regimental chapels and the 'Devonshire' and 'Kensington' and 'Londonderry' lines. Much more interesting and important, the island still has its orange trees and vineyards, its broom and anemones and wild irises. The Temple of Apollo, not far from Paphos, is still one of the Mediterranean's most attractive sites, looking out over the sea, and now it has been particularly well laid out in extensive gardens, thanks to the Leventis Foundation. The mosaics at Paphos are unspoiled and special, as are the catacombs outside the town, and the Cypriots are friendlier than ever, and all speak English. (Another distinction from the mainland is that Cyprus does not go in for retsina.) And the big museum in Nicosia is still one of the highlights, and surprises, of the Mediterranean. Best of all, the Troodos mountains are still wonderful, all the more so because they offer escape from the concrete coast. I suppose it was the mountains that dissuaded me from an old hand's crotchety nostalgia. The Ledra Palace may have gone, the UN may have settled in for ever, the divided families will be for ever divided, their homes are not going to be recovered, on either side, but Cyprus is still beautiful and the environmentalists are fighting back against the developers and despoilers. My single recommendation is to take a Land Rover trip up into the mountains and your perspective on Cyprus will be quickly corrected. Then take the same Land Rover out to the Akamas peninsula in the far west, and join the debate about whether it should be 'developed' like the rest of the south. Any travel agent can advise on a host of packages and flights to the south. Holidays in the north can be extremely cheap and are best arranged through agents who specialise in the area, such as Metak Travel (70 Welbeck Street, London W1M 7HA; 071-224 4303) or any of the large number of Turkish operations in London's Stoke Newington, best visited in person if you live in London. The season is very long - mid-March into November - but it can be extremely hot in high summer. The Rough Guide for Cyprus is probably the most useful and comprehensive guidebook, covering both parts of the island.</p>

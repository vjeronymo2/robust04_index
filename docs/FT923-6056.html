			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UN expands help to Somalia UNITED Nations efforts to help the starving people of Somalia would be greatly expanded under a plan proposed to the Security Council by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, Calling for an urgent response to the 'overwhelming needs' of a desperate population, he recommended deploying up to 3,500 UN troops to ensure the delivery of food and other relief supplies. At present, there are only 50 unarmed UN guards in the country. A Pakistani battalion of 500 troops has been approved and will be in place shortly, following agreement between the UN and Somali warlords. Under the plan, 1,500 troops would be deployed in the south-western port of Bosasso and two other contingents, each 750-strong, would take up duty in the ports of Berbera and Kismayo.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Cash injected at SecPac Australia on ADollars 259m loss SECURITY PACIFIC National Bank of the US has injected ADollars 236m (USDollars 184m) of capital into its subsidiary, Security Pacific Australia (Spal), after the Australian merchant bank ran up 1990 losses of ADollars 259m. This loss took the combined deficit of Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks over the latest reporting period to more than ADollars 1bn. The largest loss was ADollars 273m, incurred by Hong Kong Bank of Australia. Spal's recently appointed chairman, Mr Richard Keller, said the 1990 result was 'obviously disappointing'. Spal was forced to make large provisions of ADollars 232m on a small number of problem loans, mainly its ADollars 100m exposure to the collapsed Girvan property group and Linter Textiles of Mr Abe Goldberg. The four main Australian banks were able to wrap up most of the best corporate business before the 17 foreign banks were admitted in 1985, so the newcomers were forced to increase aggressively their lending to borrowers that the domestic banks avoided.</p>

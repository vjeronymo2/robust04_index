			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ce)": "The Government Assesses Last Year's </F> Economic Development as Successful"]    [Text] Prague--The government considers last year's  economic development in the Czech Republic to have been  successful. It states this in the draft state closing account  for 1993 that it has submitted to parliament. It considers  price stabilization to be an important feature of economic  development. The level of inflation measured by the consumer  price index was 20.8 percent last year, 8.0 percent of which can  be ascribed to tax reform. During the year, the prices of  foodstuffs increased by 13.2 percent, nonfoodstuffs by 18  percent, public catering by 21.9 percent, and services by 25.3  percent.    The productivity of labor rose for the first time since the  start of transformation--by 2.4 percent compared with 1992. It  has not changed much in large organizations; it has increased by  just under 25 percent in small organizations, and it declined by  12.2 percent in construction.    The decline in unemployment halted in May, and the number of  people out of work began to go up in June. At the end of the  year, there were 185,000 people out of work, 50,000 more than in  1992. The average period of unemployment was 4.6 months. At the  end of 1993, 4,954,000 people were working in the national  economy--that is, 17,000 fewer than the previous year. The  structure of employment has changed, however. The labor force  in industry and agriculture gradually transferred to  construction and services. Some 7 percent were employed in  agriculture and forestry and 34.4 percent in industry. The  50-percent boundary was exceeded in services for the first time.  Some 45.5 percent were employed in the private sector, which  was more than in state and local organizations.    The population's real income rose by 5.6 percent, while its  nominal income rose by 27.6 percent. The government forestalled  extreme wage development (by 32.7 percent in June compared with  1992) by wage regulation.    The closing account showed income amounting to 358 billion  korunas [Kc] and expenditure amounting to Kc356.9 billion. That  is, it ended with a surplus of more than Kc1 billion. The  government proposes that Kc200 million be used to support small  and medium-sized business, especially in the Bruntal, Louny,  Novy Jicin, and Znojmo Districts. The sum of Kc87 million should  be transferred to the North Bohemia Mines shareholding company  to repay the credit for removing the overburden, Kc340 million  should go toward establishing a system for administering and  supervising the Czech Republic's taxes and duties, and Kc454  million should go toward boosting the reserves for dealing with  social problems.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: New Footsie highs as buyers return RENEWED strength in equities across Europe, sparked by US buying of telecommunications stocks in the Far East, drove the London equity market to new peaks yesterday, pushing doubts over the domestic economy into the background. The equity trading account closed on a strongly optimistic note as confidence that interest rates are on the way down throughout Europe was encouraged by new equity peaks in Germany and falling bond yields in London and New York. At the day's best, the FT-SE Index was 40.4 points ahead at a new trading peak of 3,126.7, fuelled by heavy arbitraging from the stock index futures sector where the December contract also touched a new peak of 3,163. The final reading saw the FT-SE Index at a new closing high of 3,120.8, for a net gain of 34.5. London received further US support towards the close. The FT-A All-Share Index also set a new peak. After initial uncertainty over official statistics on UK economic activity, the Footsie closed the week 12.2 points ahead, but gained 2.7 per cent over the equity account. Activity focused on the market's top 100 stocks, although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 15.4 up at 3,479.8. While UK strategists remained convinced that the November Budget will be accompanied by a cut in domestic interest rates - one leading analyst told a radio audience that the chancellor of the exchequer should cut rates by 2 points - the market's focal point shifted from home to overseas. Shares opened strongly, with the weight of US demand for telecommunications stocks, on the back of this week's Dollars 22bn bid from Bell Atlantic for Tele-Communications Inc, taking London marketmakers by surprise. The running was quickly taken up by investment funds from continental Europe and then by renewed interest from the US after the Federal bond market responded strongly to the latest US inflation data. With the benchmark long-dated federal bond offering a record low yield of 5.79 per cent, UK bonds were also in excellent form. Firmness in short-dated British government bonds underlined optimism towards base rates, while the long dates advanced by around half a point. Bonds brushed off news that the next gilts auction, on October 27, will consist of stocks in the 1997-2001 range.</p>

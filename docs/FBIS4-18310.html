			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jobless Rate in Italy Remains at </F> 11.29 Percent"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March, 31 -- The jobless rate in  Italy remained at 11.29 percent in January, the same as in  October of last year, with 2,524,000 people looking for work,  according to the report issued here Thursday [31 March] by the  national statistic bureau ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute].    The ISTAT report went on to confirm how unemployment was  highest in the south but showed a slight decline, 18.80 percent  in January compared to 18.94 in October, and was significantly  lower in Central Italy, where there was a minor decline from  9.84 percent to 9.5 percent, and while lowest in the north saw  an increase from October to January, 7.16 percent against 6.87  percent in October of last year.    An analysis by ISTAT claimed how rising unemployment  appeared  to have leveled out after its steep hike from January 1993 to  October of that year, when it leaped 9.39 percent to 11.29  percent. In absolute terms, however, the quarter under  examination saw a net decline in jobholders equal to 210,000  units, once seasonably adjusted.    ISTAT also drew attention to the alarming fact that, between  October of last year and January of 1994, there was a marked  increase in the number of people looking for employment with  work experience, while those looking for their first job  declined, but probably only due to discouragement, ISTAT said.  Looking over the 12-month period, the number of unemployed rose  by 835,000, of which 452,000 were men and 383,000 women.    ISTAT data also showed how Italy's work force in general has  shrunk from 40.59 percent of the population to 39.8 percent.    The greatest number of jobs lost was recorded by ISTAT in  industry, down 404,000 posts, and the tertiary sector, off  334,000 and that employees were the hardest hit, down 628  percent [as received].    Examination of the ISTAT report on a regional basis saw  unemployment two and a half times greater in the south than the  north, while more than a quarter of the female work force was  out of a job.

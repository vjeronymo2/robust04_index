			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST ON PIGGING  </P> <P> I was aghast that Bill Marriott described families as "pigging out" (The Savvy  Traveler, June 11) in his hotels. First, the condescension toward families is  evident in his terminology, and secondly, Marriott hotels should not have  offered the bargain to families if it did not want their business.  </P> <P> SALLY MONROE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

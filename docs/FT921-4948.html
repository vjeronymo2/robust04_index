			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / British Gas to buy Ulster's biggest power station BRITISH GAS is to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest power station, and build a pipeline to bring natural gas to the province for the first time. The privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), details of which were released by the government yesterday, will raise Pounds 353m for the company's four power stations, Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said in a Commons written answer yesterday. The sale of the power stations, effective from March 31, will form the first stage of the privatisation of NIE. The company's supply and distribution business will be sold to the public in November. British Gas will pay Pounds 132.4m for Ballylumford, in County Antrim, which generates half of Northern Ireland's electricity. Although the 1,000MW station runs on oil, British Gas has undertaken to convert it to gas, which will be imported through a new pipeline from Scotland. Two other power stations will go to a consortium of the US power company, Applied Energy Services, and Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate. The consortium will pay Pounds 214m for Kilroot, a 520MW station in County Antrim, and the 240MW Belfast West coal-fired station. NIE's fourth station, the 420MW oil-fired Coolkeeragh plant in Londonderry, will be bought by a management-employee team from NIE for Pounds 6.5m. Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland minister, said he was particularly pleased by the sale of Ballylumford to British Gas, since it meant customers in the province would not only have gas-fired electricity for the first time but might hope to have the choice of gas in their homes in the future. British Gas said it was delighted with the success of its bid, which would help to expand its power generation business, along with plans for other power stations in Bristol, London, and overseas. The company has set a subsidiary, Premier Transco, to build and operate the new pipeline, and a second company, Premier Energy Suppliers, to market natural gas in Northern Ireland. Mr Needham said the privatisation, which has faced strong local opposition from politicians, trade unions and other groups, would be a great confidence boost to the Northern Ireland economy.</p>

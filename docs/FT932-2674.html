			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Expectations of cuts DEALERS IN German money markets remained confident that the Bundesbank would lower its short term interest rates soon, even though its repo rate remained unchanged yesterday, writes James Blitz. In recent days, Bundesbank officials have led the market to think that monetary policy could be eased because of expectations that M3 money supply growth would come down. Expectations of rate-cutting were dampened yesterday after the Bundesbank announced that the cost of lending short term funds to commercial banks via the repo rate would remain unchanged at 7.60 per cent. Short dated Euromark futures reflected some disappointment with the unchanged policy, the September Euromark contract closing at 93.27, down 3 basis points on the day. Nevertheless, at this level the contract is still pricing nearly 100 basis points off three-month German cash in the next 12 weeks, projecting 6.73 per cent in September. That view reflects optimism that the Bundesbank will lower its official rates again, with an outside chance that the discount rate will be reduced at today's council meeting. The Bundesbank has been concerned that cuts in German interest rates will lead to a depreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar and other currencies, leading to inflation. But it is striking that the D-Mark has continued to decline in recent weeks in spite of unchanged German policy, leading to suggestions that it is the scale of the German recession that now concerns the foreign exchange markets. At the same time, European central banks take the view that they can cut rates to below German levels whatever the Bundesbank does. The Danes, Italians and French have all cut rates in the past week. Sterling markets were slightly more bullish for lower UK base rates following Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech on Tuesday night. The emphasis of the speech was on fostering UK growth and this helped the September short sterling contract to rise 2 basis points on the day to 94.19. Three-month sterling cash was  1/16 percentage point softer at 5 7/8 per cent, helped by the swift despatch of a small daily shortage of Pounds 550m in the discount market.</p>

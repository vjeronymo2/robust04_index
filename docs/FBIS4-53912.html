			<p>BFN     [Text] The Suzhou Industrial Township project is only the  beginning of a long-lasting economic cooperation between  Singapore and China.    This was emphasised by both Deputy Prime Ministel Brigadier  General [BG] (NS [National Service]) Lee Hsien Loong and Chinese  Vice Premier Li Lanqing at a press conference held after the  inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) for the  Suzhou project yesterday.    Chaired jointly by BG Lee and Mr. Li, who is here on a  five-day visit, the JSC is the bilateral body which oversees the  development of the Singapore-style Suzhou Township. Its members  include ministers and senior officials from key ministries and  agencies of Singapore and China.    Among Singapore's representatives are Trade and Industry  Minister Yeo Cheow Tong; the acting minister for national  development, Mr. Lim Hng Kiang; and Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee  Hean, the minister of state for finance.    BG Lee said that Singapore's software transfer programme to  Suzhou should not be treated merely as a commercial investment  project.    While Singapore has helped pay for part of the software  transfer programme, "finance is not an important part of this  project," he said.    If the project could, in some small way, help China prosper,  it would be in Singapore's long-term interest, he noted.    Furthermore, he said Singapore would derive enormous  benefits  by developing "a long-term understanding with Chinese officials  at many levels who would rise over the years."    A successful Suzhou, he added, would also "provide another  outpost for Singapore in its efforts to go regional."    Under the software transfer arrangement, Singapore will help  provide public administration and management skills needed for  industrial township development to Suzhou officials.    So far, nine officials from Suzhou have been attached to  various statutory boards in Singapore to learn about urban  management as well as economic development and financial  management.    If successful, BG Lee noted, the Suzhou experience could  then  be replicated in other township developments in China.    On its parts, said Mr. Li, China would adopt a very flexible  approach towards the Suzhou project in order to help ensure its  early success.    As an example, he pointed out that the Jiangsu Provincial  Government had decided to make an exception by transferring the  administrative authority of five towns which were affected by  the township project, but which were not part of Suzhou City, to  the Suzhou Municipal Government itself.    That would allow the Suzhou Industrial Township Authority, a  Jurong Town Corporation-style statutory board that will be set  up soon, to have better control over the entire township  development.    BG Lee said Singapore will continue to share its experience  on industrial township development with Suzhou as long as the  latter finds it relevant and useful. But the initiative for the  "software transfer" will have to come from the Chinese side, he  noted.    "You have to decide what is relevant to China's needs which  priority areas to focus on, and how to adapt Singapore's  experience for use in Suzhou. Singapore will proceed as quickly  and as extensively as the Chinese officials want to," he added.</p>

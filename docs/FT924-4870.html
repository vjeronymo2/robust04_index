			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese life insurers hit by low asset growth NIPPON Life Insurance, the largest of Japan's life companies, reported a meagre 2.5 per cent increase in premium income for the first half, as the Japanese industry recorded its lowest level of asset growth in the post-war period. The industry would have been further weakened but for a deferral of appraisal losses on securities holdings, eroded by the collapse in Tokyo stock prices, though companies will have to take the losses at the end of the fiscal year in March. Nippon Life's latent profits on stock holdings fell 22.7 per cent from March to Y2,382bn (Dollars 19.2bn) at the end of September, while the latent profits at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life were down 29 per cent to 1,054bn, and those at Sumitomo Life plunged 65 per cent to a relatively thin Y195.8bn The industry was under orders from the finance ministry not to offload shares during the half, as there were fears that sales would put further pressure on already weak stock prices. In return, the ministry allowed the stock appraisal losses to be deferred. The eight leading life companies reported a collective 4.8 per cent growth to Y10,812bn in premiums for the first half, with Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance reporting the smallest increase - 1.9 per cent - and Meiji Mutual Life Insurance the largest, 10.1 per cent. Income from asset investment fell 11.5 per cent, as interest rates and stock prices both declined, but payouts were down 8.1 per cent. The industry has received finance ministry approval to lift premiums, which should bolster income during the second half. But the industry will still be under pressure, as the latent profits on stocks for the eight companies fell 28.4 per cent over the six months to Y6,033bn, down from a peak of Y38,000bn at end March 1989. Yasuda Mutual Life reported the strongest growth in total assets, up 10.5 per cent, followed by the 10.4 per cent at Meiji Mutual, while the 8.2 per cent expansion at Nippon Life was the smallest among the leading companies.</p>

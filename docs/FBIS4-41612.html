			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimea -- During the election marathon on 24 June  Leonid President Kravchuk of Ukraine met with workers of the  "Nassinnytskyy" state farm and the village of Roskoshnoye. To a  question about the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in  particular about Oleksandr Moroz's remarks that the Black Sea  Fleet should be a joint one, the president of Ukraine noted:  "The fleet can either be single or divided but a joint one would  mean that there would never be peace here."    According to Leonid Kravchuk, by law Ukraine has three types  of forces: land, air, and sea forces. "As president I implement  the Supreme Council law. If the Black Sea Fleet is a joint one,  then the law of Ukraine needs to be changed," Leonid Kravchuk  said. He also stressed that he is in favor of the main base  being in Sevastopol, and he is convinced that this issue is not  for the people of Sevastopol to decide in a referendum, but it  is a matter for the states.    Touching on the issue of treaty relations between Crimea and  Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that he "is in favor of granting  the broadest possible powers to the regions, including Crimea."    Replying to a question about his attitude to Yevgeniy  Saburov's opinion that "Ukraine does not need Central Committee  ideologues now, but new politicians," Leonid Kravchuk said:  "Entirely new politicians are needed now, who are not burdened  with the Soviet Union's past."    Regarding contradictions between the constitutions of Crimea  and Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that Crimea's interests and  new circumstances have been taken into account in the new  Ukrainian constitution.    Commenting on information that wheat would not be harvested  on an area of over 180,000 hectares in Crimea, Leonid Kravchuk  reported that it is planned to adopt a resolution on assistance  to rural areas in certain regions on 27 June. "Assistance to  these regions is the main purpose of my trip," the president  said.    Regarding the presidential election of 26 June, Leonid  Kravchuk expressed the conviction that "people have practically  determined their positions and one should not now expect an  election struggle."    Commenting on the preliminary results of the Belarusian  presidential election, in accordance with which Lukashenka (45  percent) and Kebich (1.7 percent) [figure as received] have gone  through to the second round, Leonid Kravchuk observed that "the  people elect whoever is consistent in his policy."</p>

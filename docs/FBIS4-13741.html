			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The United States has announced its  Secretary of State Warren Christopher is coming to the region in  order to activate the peace process. The word activation is a  loose enough term. It might mean just going through the  motions, or might, on the other hand, imply a more significant  and far-reaching action. Activation can be either the mere  formality of calling the negotiators back to the conference  table or a meaningful and purposeful exercise.    We do not think the U.S. secretary, who is known for his  seriousness, would take the trouble to come to the region just  for the formal activation of the negotiating tracks that have  been suspended in Washington--that is, the Syrian, Lebanese, and  Jordanian tracks--or for the sake of securing a new round of  negotiations that will be added to the previous rounds, as far  as achieving limited results.    We believe the activation required in the peace process and  on which Secretary Christopher will focus during his tour very  much depends on how this U.S. effort tells us what the term  honest and unbiased partner means.    We realize Israel does not want the United States to be a  partner or an unbiased and honest broker. Israel wants the  United States to be biased toward all its stands. Despite the  fact that more than two years have passed since the Madrid  conference, these have prevented the achievement of the aspired  peace. We, as Arabs, continue to wait for the United States to  translate its role as an honest and unbiased partner in the  peace negotiations into pressure on more than just the Arab side  alone--pressure that sometimes has reached the point of  cheapness, as happened in the drug list issue--and also pressure  the Israeli side. Indeed, the Israeli side was encouraged by  the continuous U.S. and Western support of its aggression,  occupation of the Arab territories, and disavowal of Arab  people's rights to continue its intransigence and refuse to  comply with the bases of the peace process. Without these  bases, it is hard to imagine the establishment of a just and  comprehensive peace in this region.    Syria has always welcomed and encouraged effective U.S.  efforts to push the issue of a just and comprehensive peace in  the region forward. Syria continues to pin hopes on an honest  and unbiased U.S. role, based on its conviction that there is no  room, in any way, to depend on Israeli intentions to achieve  this peace.    The obstacles placed by Israel for more than two years of  negotiations have shown the accuracy and soundness of Syria's  position that Israel is not serious about peace, which should be  comprehensive and just in order for it last.    What Israeli officials are announcing these days in terms of  preconditions and rejection of full withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories, as stipulated by UN resolutions, reinforces  the conviction that the Israeli stand shows no signs of hope  concerning the future of the negotiations.    Therefore, the way to achieve an actual and meaningful  activation of the peace process depends, as we said earlier, on  the U.S. secretary bringing something new with him.    We do not think we are exaggerating when we say a priority  task for the first sponsor of the peace process is to use its  influence on the obstructive Israeli side in order to reinforce  the chances for achieving a just and comprehensive peace.</p>

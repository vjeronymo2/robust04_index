			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Frankfurt's soft side - FT Guide to Civilised Breaks / David Waller takes a walk through the pleasant suburbs beyond 'Mainhattan' THE GERMANS have a special word to describe Frankfurt. They call the city a durchlauferhitzer, a heater where water goes in one side cold and comes out hot at the other end. What this means is that people come to Frankfurt not because they like the place, but because they hope to advance their careers. They spend a couple of years working in a bank before heading back to any number of more congenial cities several steps up the career ladder. The image encapsulates a dislike of Frankfurt shared by Germans as much as by foreign business visitors. The city has negligible charisma and the casual visitor is likely to come away with memories of little more than the airport and the drug addicts who - until very recently - used to inject After 18 months living in the town, I can say that the impression is not wholly justified, even though I know people who make special trips to the airport on Sunday afternoons just to look at the departure board to remind themselves of all the other places they could be, or who drive two hours to Strasbourg just to go shopping in the nearest Marks &amp; Spencer. If you ignore the inconvenient shopping hours - shops close at 1pm on most Saturdays and at 5pm on weekdays - Frankfurt is a highly convenient place to live and work, mainly because you can live within a five or 10-minute walk from the office at what, by international standards, are less than exorbitant rents. Sport, culture, music and food and drink are available in abundance, on your doorstep. But the natural surliness of the Hessian people, the abrasiveness of the city's highly competitive workforce and the ugliness of the town centre combine to make Frankfurt the sort of place not worth visiting for its own sake, especially if, for the same money, you could fly to any number of other European cities. On the other hand, if you have to come to Frankfurt anyway, it is worth bolting on a day or two to have a look at what it has to offer. Similarly, if you are working for any length of time it is worth knowing where to go to escape the concrete drabness of the city centre, all too hastily rebuilt after the old mediaeval town was razed by allied bombers in March 1944. In among the shopping precincts you can find Goethe's House - or rather an immaculate replica of the house where the great poet was born and spent his childhood, rebuilt after the original was destroyed by incendiary bombs. The planks of the floors creak authentically, the nails are in exactly the same place as they were before - giving a good impression of old Frankfurt. The Romerplatz, the historical centre of the city where the Romans had their settlement, where Charlemagne built a fort and where, for hundreds of years, the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned, should be visited, but only for about five minutes. It is overcrowded with tourists gaping at the (replica) mediaeval houses. Walk away from the square to the nearby St Bartholomaus church, built in the 13th century, and climb to the top of the sandstone spire for excellent views of the 'Mainhattan' skyline. For those keen on arts and culture there is almost a superfluity of museums and concert halls. The south bank of the River Main is known as the Museumsufer, with seven museums lined up next to one another. Of these, the most significant is the Stadel which houses one of Germany's finest collections of oil paintings; the others include a film museum, a museum of postal services, of ethnographics and arts and crafts. Across the river is a museum celebrating Frankfurt's Jewish community, which thrived until the Nazi era and gave the city the nickname Jerusalem am Main. More haunting is the old Jewish cemetery in the north-east of the city where one can see the graves of early members of the Rothschild banking family and capture a sense of this once powerful, wealthy community. Perhaps it is worth leaving the museums for a rainy afternoon, of which there are many during Frankfurt's lugubrious winters. But in spring and summer Frankfurt is best explored on foot. Within minutes you can be in the Westend, where bankers and advertising executives live and work in elegant turn-of-the-century villas on calm, tree-lined streets. Take a turn around the Gruneburg park where on hot summer days bank employees strip off and sun themselves during their lunch-hours. Across the autobahn behind the park you catch a glimpse of the Bundesbank, another ugly building but home to Europe's most powerful institution. The walking tour should continue eastwards, away from the financial centre through the elegant Holzhausen district and, if you are feeling energetic, all the way to the Nordend. This part of town is not touched by big business and was relatively unscathed by bombs during the war. Accordingly it has a calm, slightly bohemian and definitely middle-European atmosphere, very different from the stress and strain of the city centre. There are kneipen galore, taverns where one can enjoy the best of German gemutlichkeit. This is untranslatable but you will know what it means sitting outside a little tavern on a summer's evening eating sausages and green sauce and drinking the potent apple-wine (Ebbelwei), both local specialities. The best place to do this is at the eastern end of the Bergerstrasse in the east of the city. Sachsenhausen on the south bank of the river is famed for its Ebbelwei. Although it is highly commercialised, this can be forgotten after a Bembel of Rauscher (jug of strong apple-wine). Within the city centre itself, the Fressgasse and the nearby Opernplatz are the only places where it is pleasant to sit outside and sun. If you want exercise, hire a bike and cycle along the Main. Better, take you bike on the train to Hanau and it will not be too long before you are in the Bavarian countryside. It is often said, somewhat cruelly, that the best thing about Frankfurt is that it is so easy to leave. It is certainly true that within an hour to 90 minutes the Rheingau, the Mosel, the Taunus mountains and the Odenwald, Heidelberg and Wurzburg are all within reach.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE / BUDGET SCOREKEEPER;  </P> <P> HE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE THE SKUNK AT A PICNIC;  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE CHIEF DISTILLS LAWMAKERS' DREAMS INTO FISCAL  REALITY.  </P> <P> Robert Reischauer has a toy skunk in his office. Lift its tail, and what do you  see? The letters C-B-O.  </P> <P> CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- is used to being the skunk at Capitol  Hill's picnic. Its job is to translate the lofty dreams of lawmakers into the  hard currency of taxing and spending. And, in these days of perennial federal  deficits, the numbers usually don't add up.  </P> <P> "We keep score," said Reischauer, who has been in his job as head of the  Congressional Budget Office for a little longer than a year. "More often than  not, that makes us the bad news bears."  </P> <P> But, for all its nagging of Congress, the CBO is its most trusted source of  nonpartisan analysis and reliable budget forecasts. The outspoken Reischauer, a  49-year-old liberal economist and only the third director in the CBO's 15 years  of existence, is determined to maintain that tradition.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I have to curb my tongue," he said. "But it's absolutely critical to  our success that CBO be seen as having no ax to grind."  </P> <P> That is especially important now that contentious budget summit negotiations  are under way between the Democratic-dominated Congress and the  Republican-controlled White House.  </P> <P> The White House, known its for rose-tinted economic thinking, has further  strained its credibility in recent months by being forced to admit that its  deficit projections earlier this year were off by at least $20 billion, and  probably closer to $50 billion. The CBO's original forecasts, in contrast, are  proving to have been relatively close to the mark.  </P> <P> As a result, the CBO is riding high again after several years of waning  influence. It lost clout in 1987 under the revised Gramm-Rudman budget law. It  was hurt even more when an institutional and political stalemate between the  House and Senate left it without an official director for more than two years.  </P> <P> "CBO's credibility was never low, just its influence," said Stanley Collender,  a longtime budget analyst who is at the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. "Bob  has helped bring it back as a player."  </P> <P> Reischauer, a graduate of Harvard with a doctorate in economics from Columbia  and the son of Edwin O. Reischauer, famed Japanese scholar and former U.S.  ambassador to Japan, seems to have been born to be CBO director. He was present  at its creation, signing on as its first employee under Alice M. Rivlin, who  brought him along from the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, when  she was named the CBO's original director in 1975.  </P> <P> He stayed at the CBO through 1981, rising to become deputy director. After  that, Reischauer was a senior vice president at the Urban Institute until  returning briefly to Brookings in 1989, before leaping back into the fray at  the CBO.  </P> <P> "We believe that we have found the best person for one of the most challenging  jobs in Washington," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said  at the time of Reischauer's appointment last March.  </P> <P> Typically, Reischauer makes a joke of his decision to return to a government  post. "My wife says I keep celebrating my mid-life crises by taking big pay  cuts." The CBO director receives a salary of $89,000.  </P> <P> Blessed with a playful and self-deprecating wit, Reischauer works well with  both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. He has managed to repair much  of the damage done to the CBO's prestige during the period when it lacked a  director and was forced to rely on acting officials.  </P> <P> "It wasn't hard," he cracked. "Compared to nobody, I'd have to be at least a  little bit of an improvement."  </P> <P> Reischauer acknowledged that his colorful personality, helpful as it may be to  restoring the CBO's high profile, also has gotten him in hot water on occasion.  Earlier this year, on the day after President Bush's budget was released, he  was quoted prominently as saying: "It's a 'Play It Again, Sam' budget. We've  seen this before."  </P> <P> "I heard from members about that," he said. "It was perceived as partisan. I  didn't mean it in a partisan sense, but I've learned how careful you have to be  in this job."  </P> <P> And Reischauer can't imagine doing anything else right now. "For someone who  cares about policy analysis, this has it all . . . . As long as the budget is  the name of the game, I've got the best seat in town."  </P></p>

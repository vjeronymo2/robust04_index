			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 14 June TASS -- Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] has  mustered the best forces from among its military prosecutors,  security service officers, tax inspectors, and finances [as  received] to look into the allegations of corruption inside the  Defence Ministry, which appeared in the local press.    Reporter of one of the local newspapers charged the leaders  of the Defence Ministry with corruption and the desire to get  rich at the expense of the Army. The Defence Ministry responded  by publishing a statement saying that the Kanat project,  mentioned by the reporter, was designed to help finance the  Republic's armed forces.    According to Colonel Isayev, the sale of obsolete military  equipment within the frame of the Kanat project earned the  ministry about four million U.S. dollars, all of which went to  create and maintain the Republic's new army. The army is paid  from the state budget less than one fourth of the money it needs  to operate normally.</p>

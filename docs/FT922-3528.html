			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hint on company tax rate THE government raised the prospect of a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 20 per cent for small companies yesterday, following its policy of aligning the levy with the standard rate of income tax, David Owen writes. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said such a move might be possible, under questioning from Mr Chris Smith, a Labour frontbench Treasury spokesman. Mr Smith had asked for an indication of the government's future plans on corporation tax, since it appeared to be its intention to expand the 20p income tax band introduced in the last budget until it became effectively the standard rate. Mr Dorrell said the small-companies rate of 25 per cent reflected the importance the government attached to ensuring a low marginal rate of tax for wealth creation. Mr Smith also used yesterday's Commons debate on the corporate tax-related clauses of this year's finance bill to attack the government for its 'appalling' manufacturing investment record. Proposing an amendment to lift first-year capital allowances to 40 per cent from 25 per cent, he said the Tories had 'neglected and denigrated the importance of manufacturing for far too long'. The amendment was defeated with a government majority of 108 (339-231).</p>

The driver, Flanagan, a four-year veteran of the Police  Department, was struck in the forearm and both hands. Shea, a one-year-veteran,  was hit in the thigh and calf.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drives to Hospital  </P> <P> Despite his wounds, Flanagan never lost control of the car and drove to the  hospital, police Lt. Charles Massey said. Neither officer saw the assailant or  attempted to fire back, the lieutenant said.  </P> <P> After the shooting, police spent several hours searching the low-income housing  development and the neighborhood surrounding it. However, officers were unable  to find a weapon or suspects, Massey said. There was no known motive for the  shooting.  </P></p>

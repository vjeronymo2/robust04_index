			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Agreement was reached  today on the prospect of an inter-Korean summit which has been  proposed by South Korea to help relieve the tension on the  peninsula.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Premier  Kang  Song-san said that his government will send a high-level  delegation for the pre-summit talks.    Kang Song-san today notified his South Korean counterpart Yi  Yong-tok that the DPRK has accepted Seoul's proposal for a  preparatory meeting on June 28.    He said a seven-member DPRK delegation, to be headed by an  official of vice-premier level, will travel to the truce village  of Panmunjom for the meeting.    "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made  the idea of a summit more mandatory than at any other time,"  Kang said in the message.    He said that this high level meeting of the two sides will  be  an historic event. "It will give the 70 million Korean people  the joy of reconciliation and unity and renew hopes for a  country of peace and unification," added Kang.    "It has been the DPRK's consistent policy to remove distrust  and confrontation between the North and the South and open a new  phase of national reunification independently and peacefully,"  said the message.    On June 18, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited  the DPRK on June 15-18, relayed to South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam an oral message from DPRK President Kim Il-song, saying  he was ready to hold a North-South summit with Kim Yong-sam  unconditionally and at any time or place.    Then on Monday [20 June] Yi Yong-tok suggested to Kang  Song-san that a preliminary contact be made to discuss detailed  arrangements for the summit, to be held at Panmunjom at 10:00  A.M. local time on June 28 (Tuesday).    A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's  reply,  saying that the message came within the quickest timeframe. "It  was in agreement with our proposal and this suggests that they  are sincere in approaching the summit," he added.</p>

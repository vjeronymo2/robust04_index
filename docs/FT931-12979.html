			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Government to set up urban development corporation for Plymouth docks THE government is to set up an urban development corporation to help regenerate the rundown docklands of Plymouth, Anthony Moreton writes. It will spend Pounds 45m in an area which includes vacant Ministry of Defence land. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, did not say whether the funding would be new money or recycled from other parts of his department's budget. It will be the 12th development corporation set up in England. At the same conference in London, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said a decision on whether to extend the five-year-old initiative to aid the industrial valleys of south Wales, would be taken 'in the next few weeks'. He added that the area had performed significantly better than the UK over the past five years as far as unemployment, clearance of derelict land, new factories and new private-sector investment were concerned.</p>

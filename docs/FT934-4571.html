			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US-EU Airbus deal likely to be extended After a year of fruitless negotiations, trade officials in Geneva appear to have found a formula which will extend the bilateral US-EU deal on state support for the European Airbus to all Gatt members. The formula marks an important breakthrough in an area which had threatened to become a serious obstacle in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. The aim is to revise Gatt's existing code of fair practice on trade in civil aircraft by December 15, in parallel with the Uruguay Round negotiations. The new approach, proposed by the Swedish chairman of the sub-committee discussing extension of the Airbus agreement, is based on the draft round accord on subsidies, modified and supplemented to take account of the special requirements of the aircraft industry. Trade officials said yesterday the approach had won the support of all the main participants in the negotiations, including the US and EU, though much of the detail - including acceptable levels of state support - remained to be agreed. A revised text is now being prepared for discussion early next week by the code's 22 members (the EU counting as one). It proved more difficult than expected to 'multilateralise' the bilateral pact, which applies only to large aircraft and to US and EU support systems. The accord, signed last year after eight years of trans-atlantic feuding, prohibits subsidies for aircraft production and caps development support at 33 per cent of spending. It also places curbs on indirect supports, such as those derived by US manufacturers from government defence and aerospace contracts. If finished on time, the revised aircraft code would be incorporated into the Uruguay Round package applicable to all Gatt's 112 members. Three important competitors - Taiwan, China and Russia - are not currently Gatt members but may be obliged to sign up to the code as a condition of joining the world trade body.</p>

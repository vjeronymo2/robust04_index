			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / German airmen set for Bosnian role GERMAN air force crews were yesterday preparing to join their Nato allies in enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia, following a decision by Germany's constitutional court to clear their involvement in military operations outside the Nato area. The court's decision, immediately welcomed by Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, ends for the moment a dispute in the coalition government about the legality of allowing German troops to serve outside Nato. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union had insisted that the constitution did not prevent Germans serving in combat roles outside Nato. But the liberal Free Democrat party, junior coalition partner, which politically supports the CDU in deploying German troops outside Nato territory, wanted the constitutional court to decide whether deployment would be legal. Article 24 of the constitution allows German troops to fight alongside Nato allies. But until recently successive governments had interpreted the section to mean German troops were to be confined to combat within the Nato area. Instead of tackling the constitutional issue head-on, the court, in what amounts to a temporary ruling, said Germany's credibility as a reliable partner in Nato, and its international standing, would be undermined if Germans were withdrawn from the Awacs reconnaissance operations. The issue of whether it would require a constitutional amendment to deploy German troops in combat outside Nato territory in other circumstances has been postponed. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and a Free Democrat, said 'our soldiers have clear legal backing and that's the decisive point.' But the reputation of the Free Democrats has been damaged by the affair. Its decision to refer the issue to the constitutional court had virtually paralysed the government and provoked widespread criticism about Germany's inability to play a responsible role in the post-Cold War era. The opposition Social Democratic party, which has its own internal divisions on Germany's military role outside the Nato area, said it would challenge the court's decision.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOUND TO CHARGE 2 IN BOY'S DEATH  </P> <P> Citing insufficient evidence, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office  said Tuesday it will not file charges for now against two teen-agers who had  been suspected of killing Jason Matthew Lea, a 9-year-old Upland boy whose body  was found last week at the bottom of a cliff.  </P> <P> One of the two, Wayne O. Hobbs, 19, was ordered released after he and Richard  LaLonde, 18, were placed in custody at the sheriff's substation in Walnut  Sunday when they surrendered. LaLonde, however, was expected to remain jailed  on an outstanding probation violation stemming from a crime he committed as a  juvenile, police said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Hearnsberger said that, after reviewing the case, there  was "insufficient evidence" to charge the two young men with the Lea boy's  death -- in part because the Los Angeles County coroner's office has not yet  completed its investigation and has not yet determined precisely how Jason  died.  </P> <P> An autopsy was conducted, but it failed to reveal a cause of death. Tests were  continuing, according to Hearnsberger.  </P> <P> Two other teen-agers, ages 16 and 17, also were taken into custody in  connection with the investigation. They are being held at San Bernardino County  Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> Jason disappeared on July 29 after leaving his home in Upland, in San  Bernardino County, on his bicycle.  </P> <P> Witnesses have told police that he was last seen that night with several  teen-agers. His bike was found outside a popular video arcade on Foothill  Boulevard in Upland.  </P> <P> Jason's partly decomposed body was found Friday by the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's San Dimas Search and Rescue Team at the foot of a 200-foot cliff on  Glendora Ridge Road, near the Mt. Baldy ski area, just inside the Los Angeles  County line. The ski area is familiar to police as a "party rock" where  teen-agers often gather for late-night revelry.  </P> <P> Upland Police Capt. Martin Thouvenell, one of the initial investigators on the  case, called the decision to release Hobbs and LaLonde "unfortunate."  </P> <P> "We felt there was enough there to go forward, but (the district attorney) did  not think the evidence was there yet because of the delay at the coroner's  office," Thouvenell said. "If it's a natural death then we don't have a  homicide. So we'll just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Despite recent television reports suggesting that Jason was under the influence  of LSD after his abduction and may have overdosed, Thouvenell said he has no  evidence confirming such stories.  </P> <P> "People are looking for some bizarre circumstances here, some satanic cult-type  thing," Thouvenell said. "The reality is probably much simpler than that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father Is a Lawman  </P> <P> Relatives of Hobbs, whose father is a San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy,  and LaLonde could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But friends -- many of  whom had insisted that the accusations against the two teen-agers were a  mistake -- expressed relief that charges were not filed against them.  </P> <P> "I feel real happy because I knew he was innocent," said Mike Kasbeck, 15, who  lives down the street from Hobbs and went skateboarding and snake collecting  with the older youth. "I feel sad that he got dragged into it, though. It just  doesn't seem fair."  </P> <P> Kasbeck said he had talked to Hobbs on Friday, the day Jason's body was found,  and recalled that the teen-ager mentioned he had lent his white Ford pickup  truck to one of the two juveniles in custody.  </P> <P> "He was telling me, 'Don't ever let anybody borrow your car, because it will  only get you in trouble,' " said Kasbeck, noting that Hobbs was popular among  younger friends who lacked transportation. "I figure he was trying to be nice  and loaned (the suspects) his truck so they could have a good time. And then  they went and messed his life up."  </P> <P> Hobbs' attorney, Barry Plotkin, said that while the truck may have been  involved in the episode, his client did not willingly lend it to anyone.  </P> <P> "My client did not take part in this thing," Plotkin said.  </P> <P> Kasbeck said that Hobbs' parents, Diane and Gary Hobbs, were also convinced of  their son's innocence when he spoke with them Monday night.  </P> <P> "They were sad about the whole thing but knew Wayne wasn't guilty," Kasbeck  said. Hobbs' surrender Sunday night had been arranged by his parents and  detectives, officials have said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile Tuesday, sheriff's spokesman Pat Hunter said authorities plan to  transfer the two suspects still in custody from San Bernardino County Juvenile  Hall to a maximum-security juvenile facility in East Los Angeles. Although the  teen-agers are from Upland, the case is being handled by Los Angeles County  officials because Jason's body was found just west of the San Bernardino County  line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hearing Postponed  </P> <P> The suspects, whose identities are being withheld because of their age, were  scheduled to be arraigned Monday. But a judge postponed the hearing until  Thursday to give their attorneys time to review police reports.  </P> <P> Investigators have released little information about a possible motive in the  crime, saying only that the four teen-agers were acquaintances who hung out at  Upland Bowl together.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jenifer Warren contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Incorrectly Informed"] </F>   [Text] The Defense Ministry has admitted having  incorrectly informed parliament about the procurement of the  "Cerberus/TSPJ" Tornado defense system and problems in the  development of the top-secret jammer and repeater jammer.  Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) developed the project, which costs  more than 700 million German marks [DM], with the Israeli arms  firm Elta. "As a result of imprecise descriptions of the  situation, it was possible at times to give the impression" that  there is "no firm contract" beyond the delivery of the first  series of 60 devices, the Defense Ministry admits in a  confidential "situation note." However, what is correct is  "that from the very beginning, there has been a commitment to  buy 110 system units from the Israeli side."    Social Democratic Party Deputy Horst Jungmann in the past  has  criticized innumerable inconsistencies in the procurement and  accused the ministry of "deliberate deception." However, there  is still no end to the tricks. While the approval of another 50  devices has so far been made dependent on "proof of their  effectiveness in troop tests," now one only speaks of  "integrated company and official tests" in test labs, even  though in the budget the military pushed through a DM1-million  test stand for testing Cerberus in the troops.</p>

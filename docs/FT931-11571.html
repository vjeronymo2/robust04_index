			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The equation that didn't add up: UK banks are rethinking small-business policies, which could lead to more expensive loans The UK government's inquiry into whether high-street banks are spoiling the chances of an economic recovery by making loans to small businesses prohibitively expensive did not end as expected. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, started the inquiry amid a wave of public antipathy to banks. But it ended with the conclusion that they have not behaved as badly as many of their customers think. The inquiry was completed last week with the announcement that banks will allow businesses with turnovers of less than Pounds 1m to make complaints to the banking ombudsman, as personal customers already can. In spite of a public belief that banks had not passed on interest rate cuts to small businesses, it found that they had only slightly widened the gap between base rates and loan interest rates. Yet behind this facade of stability, the banks are engaged in a fundamental rethink of small-business lending, which could lead to far more expensive and restrictive loans. The 1980s lending that led to talk of an 'enterprise culture' has gone so wrong that banks are now questioning the nature of the market. Barclays has been writing off bad loans to small businesses at the rate of Pounds 1m a day for 18 months. The problem of small-business lending has big implications for British bank profitability. When banks faced growing competition in the personal and large corporate sectors of their business in the 1980s, small corporate lending appeared the last bastion of easy profits. Building societies were offering rival cheque accounts to personal customers, while big companies with better credit ratings than banks obtained money directly from wholesale markets. In contrast, there was slim competition in small-business lending. Fewer than 1 per cent of the 2.9m businesses with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 1m are estimated to sell debt to obtain working capital, a process known as factoring. And in spite of speculation about competition from foreign banks, Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland still provide the bulk of financial services to 84 per cent of the market. Not only were there few rivals, but there also appeared to be little risk. Banks thought they could charge higher margins than they would get on large corporate lending without much threat of losing their capital. Much lending was secured on properties of business owners, which were rising in price. Businesses that failed presented little risk, while most thrived in the late 1980s boom. This happy equation has since fallen apart. As businesses have failed and property prices fallen, lending secured on property has become unsecured. Banks have also found that some of the money they theoretically lent as working capital was used to substitute for equity in undercapitalised businesses. They had not followed loans closely enough to discover this. The result was that money ploughed into the fabric of small businesses - disguised as 'hard core' overdrafts - was impossible to get back. Banks now grumble that the return on their loans, which seemed generous at the time, was not enough to cover this sort of risk. 'We have been lending much too cheaply, because we have actually provided risk capital,' says Mr David Lavarack, Barclays' head of small business. As banks have reassessed small- business lending, they have been faced with the most worrying fact - they have no reliable way of calculating profitability. In theory, banks should allocate capital by assessing the risk of different forms of business, their profitability over a business cycle, and overheads. By doing so, they will not be over-influenced by profits during economic upswings, or recession losses. In practice, banks are finding this extremely difficult. Overheads are hard to calculate when different businesses are carried out through branches. And financial data are not good enough to monitor rewards over past cycles. 'Banks are about five years behind other large corporations in their financial management,' says one clearing bank director. The finance directors of several banks are now working on producing better profit measures. Meanwhile, banks are trying to increase profitability in two ways. First, they are trying to reduce risk. They are changing how they assess the risk of loans, and trying to monitor companies once loans are made. Although banks insist that managers have always been taught to look at cash flow rather than loan security, the message is now being reinforced. 'I am a strong advocate of staying in touch. We and our customers benefit from them pulling out financial data,' says Mr Lavarack. National Westminster has devised training courses for its managers so they can assess the competence of small-business owners more strictly. 'Often everything is resting on a single man's shoulders,' says Ms Jane Bradford, NatWest's head of small business. Second, they have raised charges on services, such as cheque-clearing, and re-examined loan margins. It is this process, carried out over the past 18 months, which led to the Treasury inquiry. Mr Terry Smith, a banking analyst at Collins Stewart, says banks are testing the market without a sense of what price it will bear. 'They do not actually know the level of demand,' he says. Banks have traditionally tried to raise charges and loan margins as surreptitiously as possible. But this has become harder because of increased public scrutiny, which has forced the banks to publish charters for small-business customers, and to start notifying them of charges before they are levied. They have nonetheless been fairly effective in managing to hide from public view the size of their increases in charges. Barclays and National Westminster have disclosed that their average margin on small-business loans has risen from 2.9 percentage points above base rate to about 3.5 points over 18 months. But the level of fees and charges associated with these loans has been rising much faster. Mr Smith estimates that NatWest's commission income rose by 27.9 per cent and Barclays' rose by 18.2 per cent in 1991, while the overall value of transactions in the banks' clearing system fell by 0.9 per cent. He argues that small businesses probably bore a disproportionate amount of this rise, because there was stiffer competition among banks for personal customers. There are still few alternatives to banks for smaller businesses. Even if they can seek loan finance elsewhere, most small businesses rely on banks' clearing services. While most personal customers get free banking if in credit, business fees are rising. 'There is not a lot of choice out there, and most people are with one bank or another,' says Mr Stan Mendham, founder of the Forum of Private Business. Banks have made moves to offer equity finance to small companies through venture capital. But they have little appetite for taking equity stakes in a lot of small businesses. Some bankers now talk of the government having to provide tax breaks if they are to lend again to poorly capitalised businesses. But Mr Mendham argues that neither small businesses nor banks can abandon each other in a time of adversity. 'I think most businesses would prefer the devil they know, as long as the relationship improves,' he says. The fuss over charges may indeed fail to break up the old relationship between banks and small businesses. If the banks get higher returns, and small businesses can complain to the banking ombudsman, both sides may gain enough from the latest inquiry to satisfy them. But the severity of losses sustained by the banks could lead to a break with the past. This depends on banks' new methods of assessing loan risks. For the first time, the assumption that small-business lending is an easy source of profits is being questioned. For now, banks will struggle along. But it is not certain that their old bonds with small companies will ever wholly recover from the wounds of recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            HIGH STREET BANKS: THE COST FOR SMALL BUSINESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank lending to small businesses  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Amount of     Number of     Amount of    Number of                      lending       accounts      lending      accounts                     (Pounds m)                  (Pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base rate related     37,226        966,950       35,061       848,183 Managed rates          1,789        157,028        2,225       159,373 Fixed rates            5,977        416,022        6,312       363,046  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                 44,992      1,540,000       43,598     1,370,602  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------           AVERAGE SIZE OF BORROWING  ------------------------------------------------                        Jan 1991       Nov 1992                        (pounds)       (pounds)  ------------------------------------------------ Base rate related       37,900         38,400 Managed rates           11,400         14,000 Fixed rates             14,400         17,400  ------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 PROPORTION OF LENDING IN MARGIN BANDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Margin over            June 1991    Nov 1992      Jun 1991     Nov 1992 bank rate              (per cent)   (per cent)    (per cent)  (per cent)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.2 per cent              21            20           56          35 2-4 per cent              59            61           40          61 4-6 per cent              16            16            3           3 6-8 per cent               4             3            1           1  &gt;8 per cent               -             -            -           -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

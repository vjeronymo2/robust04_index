This proposal is intended to clarify that the Uniform Rules' provisions relating to ex parte communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, this proposal would clarify that the ex parte provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the APA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by January 11, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments be directed to: Communications Division, 250 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219, Attention: Docket No. 94&hyph;21.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 916 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. 73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989) required the OCC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the ``agencies'') to develop uniform rules and procedures for administrative hearings. The agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on June 17, 1991 (56 FR 27790) and promulgated their final Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in August 1991 (OCC, 56 FR 38024, August 9, 1991; Board of Governors, 56 FR 38052, August 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37975, August 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38317, August 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37767, August 8, 1991). On November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60094), the Board of Governors proposed to amend one aspect of the Uniform Rules adopted by the Board of Governors relating to ex parte communications to clarify that those rules parallel the requirements of the APA. The OCC now proposes the similar amendment. The OTS, FDIC, and NCUA are considering a similar amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, &sect;19.9 of the Uniform Rules prohibits a party, the party's counsel, or another interested person from making an ex parte communication to the Comptroller or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When the Uniform Rules were proposed, the joint proposed rule (56 FR 27790, 27793) explained that the proposed rule regarding ex parte communications would adopt the rules and procedures set forth in the APA (5 U.S.C. 551(14) and 557(d)) regarding ex parte communications. The OCC did not intend at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decisionmakers. The APA's ex parte communication provision restricts communications between an interested person outside the agency and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d). Intra-agency communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits investigative or prosecutorial staff at an agency from participating or advising in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel. The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Uniform Rules as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, did not mention the separation of functions concept explicitly. Consequently, it could have been interpreted to apply the ex parte communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the agency head, ALJ, or decisional personnel and any party, the party's counsel, or another person interested in the proceeding. The OCC did not intend this provision to limit the OCC's investigatory or prosecutorial staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to, or terminations of, existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the ex parte communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would clarify that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition on ex parte communications to communications to or from interested persons outside the agency, 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). ACUS, Model Adjudication Rules (December, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the OCC hereby certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would make a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively. Thus, it will not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the proposal is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

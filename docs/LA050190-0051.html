			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: TIE-UP ON THE PARTY CIRCUIT  </P> <P> The Scene: The U.S. premiere of Pedro Almodovar's "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!," a  last-minute addition to the American Film Institute Film Festival, Thursday at  the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza. For the uninitiated, the movie, steeped in  controversy, was awarded an X rating by the Motion Picture Assn. of America,  but Almodovar refused to recut the scenes in question and chose to release the  movie unrated. (It opens at the Goldwyn Pavilion Friday.) After gorging on  screen sex, drugs and violence on screen, filmgoers partied at the Twenty 20  Club.  </P> <P> The Buzz: No, it wasn't about the rating or what Almodovar calls "the moment"  which generated the original X, but about the film's content -- the story of an  actress who is kidnaped, beaten and held captive by a mental patient and then  falls madly in love with him.  </P> <P> Quoted: "Oh, it's a fun-loving, cute, adorable rape fantasy. I think it's  pretty morally questionable," said actor Barry Miller, of TV's "Equal Justice."  </P> <P> Overheard: "This movie actually says worse things about women than 'Pretty  Woman.' "  </P> <P> Understated: "I feel misunderstood," said Almodovar.  </P> <P> Who Was There: "Tie Me Up!" stars Antonio Banderas and Loles Leon, Miramax  Films (the movie's distributor) executives Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Russell  Schwartz, your usual assortment of agents, film production and studio  executives, plus a few strange-looking performance artists.  </P> <P> Dress Code: For both sexes, dark suits worn with T-shirts or shirts buttoned up  to the top button. No one asked, but actress/model Lauren Hutton volunteered  that hers was Armani.  </P> <P> Chow: A large X-shaped chocolate cake with marzipan fruit on top, as well as  canapes and other desserts. People drank Calistoga water, diet Coke, and  Absolut vodka sometimes straight, sometimes with juice.  </P> <P> Exit Line: From an anonymous, youngish male agent -- "This is not the kind of  movie this town thrives on, but it's well made. Hollywood is about dollars and  this isn't a movie about dollars, it's about real visionary movie-making  skills."  </P></p>

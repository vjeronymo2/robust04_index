			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan on  Wednesday [1 Jun] threatened to take legal action against the  Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] for allegedly circulating a  forged copy of an original memo written by Premier Lien Chan to  state-run enterprise executives and government officials who are  KMT [Kuomintang] members, urging them to let KMT legislators  take a greater part in government construction projects.    Two groups of legislators from the DPP, Taiwan's major  opposition party, on May 25 and May 31 separately showed local  reporters the document they claimed Lien issued as a Kuomintang  member.    The DPP claimed the document is clear evidence that the  KMT-controlled administrative branch is trying to convey  benefits to KMT members, and asked Premier Lien to step down.    The Executive Yuan issued a stern warning to the DPP on  Tuesday and emphasized that the document is fabricated and  intends to mislead the public. It also vowed to track down  those involved in circulating the document.    Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui, speaking in his capacity  as  KMT chairman before the decision-making Central Standing  Committee, demanded that an investigation be made into the  incident to clear Lien's name.    Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh told the committee that the document  displayed by the DPP does not conform to the original written by  Lien, either by content or by the date it was circulated.    Wu Chung-li, the deputy director-general of the Government  Information Office, announced later in the day that the original  Lien document will be publicized on Thursday.</p>

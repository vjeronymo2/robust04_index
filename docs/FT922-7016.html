			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: GM to raise Dollars 2.14bn in largest US stock offering GENERAL MOTORS was last night in the process of raising Dollars 2.14bn gross through the largest stock offering by a US company as its investment banking underwriters priced the company's global issue at Dollars 39 a share and increased the number of shares on sale by 10 per cent. The selling price compared with GM's close on the New York Stock Exchange last night of Dollars 39 1/4 , down Dollars  1/4 . The size of the offer was increased from the 50m shares originally planned to 55m because of investor interest, but this was short of the maximum 57.5m General Motors said it might issue if there was sufficient demand. The company's underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley, will now sell the issue on to investors. Some 40m of the shares will be offered in the US, 6m in the UK, 4.5m in Asia and 4.5m in other international centres. The gross spread on the issue - the difference between the selling price and the price paid for the stock by the underwriter - is 97.5 cents. The selling concession - the discount offered to selling groups  - is 63.5 cents and the reallowance is 10 cents. Delivery of the shares is scheduled for May 28. The price setting followed the completion on Monday of a roadshow in which the automobile manufacturer sold itself to potential investors on three continents. The offering is a test of investor sentiment towards the company, which lost Dollars 4.5bn last year but over the past few months has changed its top management, announced plans for 21 plant closures and 70,000 job losses, and begun overhauling is North American management structure. The central question facing potential investors is whether these changes, coupled with a slow recovery in the depressed US auto market, will be sufficient to restore the company's earnings to respectable levels at a time when it faces ever increasing competition from Japanese manufacturers and American rivals Ford and Chrysler. The offering is GM's first issue of common stock since 1955 and the largest issue by a US company, excluding the Dollars 2.8bn rights offering to existing shareholders made last year by Time Warner. The next largest offering was a Dollars 1.46bn issue by Consolidated Rail in 1987. The GM issue has been helped by the upward sweep of the US stock market since the start of the year and the relative strength of 'cyclical' companies, such as motor manufacturers, whose performance tends to track the economic cycle.</p>

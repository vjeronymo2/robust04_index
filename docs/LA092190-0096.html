			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PASSENGER IN CAR IS SHOT, KILLED NEAR GALLERIA  </P> <P> A 20-year-old man was shot and killed late Wednesday as he rode in a car on  Hawthorne Boulevard near the South Bay Galleria.  </P> <P> Torrance police are searching for a suspect who they say flashed a gang sign  before firing three shots at a nearby car in the 17500 block of Hawthorne  Boulevard at about 11:50 p.m.  </P> <P> The victim, Daryl James Webb, who was in the front passenger seat, was a  Compton native stationed with the Air Force in the Las Vegas area, a relative  said.  </P> <P> He was home on leave to visit his family and friends.  </P> <P> Webb and three friends had gone to the South Bay Bowl, a Redondo Beach bowling  alley just south of the Galleria, Torrance police said.  </P> <P> When they were leaving, they noticed a man and woman in the parking lot, police  said. Webb's group drove south on Hawthorne Boulevard and then made a U-turn  into the northbound lane, said Torrance Sgt. Ron Traber. The couple were in a  car near them, Traber said.  </P> <P> Some comments were exchanged. The suspect then flashed a gang sign and fired at  the car in which Webb was a passenger, police said.  </P> <P> Webb was pronounced dead from gunshot wounds at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> The suspects' vehicle was a 1982 or 1983 light-blue, two-door Chevy Monte  Carlo, Buick Regal or Oldsmobile Cutlass, police said.  </P> <P> A relative said Webb had no gang affiliations. In fact, she said, he was  studying law enforcement in the Air Force and hoped to become a lawyer.  </P> <P> Webb is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and an 11-month-old son.  </P></p>

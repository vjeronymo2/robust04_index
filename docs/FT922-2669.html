			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Faupel to Pounds 1.2m A FALL in interest payable from Pounds 924,000 to Pounds 745,000 enabled Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, to report pre-tax profits up by 8 per cent to Pounds 1.21m in the year to March 31. The rise from Pounds 1.12m was struck on turnover 24 per cent ahead at Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 21.3m). Operating profits slipped from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 1.95m. Mr Iain Brown, chief executive, said that demand in the textiles sector was flat, but that Faupel's investment was in stock - mainly from China - not plant and machinery, giving it an advantage over domestic producers. The company also had a 'good spread of customers', such as BhS, Milletts, Laura Ashley, Selfridges, John Lewis, Harrods, JD Williams and Empire Stores, he said. As for signs of any general economic upturn, Mr Brown had 'seen half a robin on the lawn, but it flew away'. The household textiles division accounts for turnover of about Pounds 7m. The non-fashion garments side, which had turnover of about Pounds 16m, had a good autumn season, though the spring season was more 'difficult'. In April Faupel 'took the hard decision' and made a Pounds 431,000 extraordinary provision against its 19.6 per cent investment in New World Electronic Products, the infra-red security lighting company which went into receivership. The directors have recommended maintaining the final dividend at 3.05p for a same-again total of 4.9p, payable from earnings of 10.22p (9.44p) per share.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Nigerian poll appeal filed NIGERIA'S electoral commission filed an appeal yesterday against a court order blocking official declaration of the winner of presidential elections on June 12, Reuter reports from Lagos. The court order, which put in doubt a plan by the ruling military to hand over to civilians, has left the country in political uncertainty. The high court in Abuja, the federal capital, issued the order forcing the NEC to suspend announcement of poll results. Unofficial and incomplete returns then showed Mr Moshood Abiola, a southern businessman, way ahead of Mr Bashir Tofa, a northerner and his sole rival.</p>

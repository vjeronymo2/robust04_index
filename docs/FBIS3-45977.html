			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bern, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Otto Stich, president  of the Swiss Confederation, said here today that his country is  very much interested in further expanding its economic ties with  China.    Meeting with Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National  People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, here this afternoon,  Stich said China, which has a long history, exerts important  influence on the world and is playing an important role in the  United Nations.    China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, he  said, adding that the U.N. role in safeguarding the world peace  is never like what it is playing now.    He said China's role in the international security is of  great importance to the world peace and security.    Stich expressed his satisfaction with the growth of  Switzerland- China relations and spoke highly of China's rapid  economic development.    He said Switzerland is very much interested in further  expanding its economic ties with China. "The two countries have  cooperated well in the UNESCO. We hope such cooperation will be  extended to other areas," he said.    Stich said he welcomed China restoring its status as a  signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT).    Qiao expressed thanks for it, saying that this will not only  benefit China's domestic economic growth, but also help promote  the convergence with international economy and cooperation and  the world peace as well.    He told Stich that this morning he held talks with his  German  [as received] counterpart Gret Haller and met with head of  Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Flavio Cotti and exchanged  views with them on bilateral ties and issues of common interest.  This will play a positive role in increasing mutual  understanding and promoting the growth of bilateral ties, Qiao  said.    He said after the establishment of diplomatic ties between  the two countries in 1950, bilateral ties have been normally  developed.    Following the implementation of the policy of China's reform  and opening up, such ties have been progressing steadily. "We  are satisfied with the development of bilateral economic ties  and trade. The exchanges between the two countries in culture,  science and technology are fruitful," he said.    Qiao said Switzerland is a country with high working  efficiency and one of the highly developed countries in Europe.    "It is our hope that bilateral ties will be boosted in  various fields under the care of the president," he said.    "We welcome more Swiss friends including members of the  Federal Assembly and personages from all walks of life to China  for visit. China is also willing to know more about Switzerland  and draw on the latter's successful experiences," he said.    Strengthening personnel exchanges between the two sides will  bring benefits to facilitating mutual understanding. At the  same time, he said China welcomes more Swiss entrepreneurs to  China for investment.    He said China pays great attention to maintaining its  domestic stability. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council, it is willing to work together with all developing  countries and developed countries including Switzerland to  safeguard the world peace and promote the progress for the  mankind.    "It is our consistent view that maintaining the world peace  is closely linked with China's economic construction.    "So long as the world is peaceful and China is stable and  united, its economic construction is hopeful," he said.</p>

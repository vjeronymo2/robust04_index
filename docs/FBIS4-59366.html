			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Tayyash: "Shaykh Sa'd Urges Yemenis To </F> Learn From Wounds of Invasion of Kuwait"]    [Text] Kuwait -- Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Salim  al-Sabah, Kuwaiti heir apparent and prime minister, has urged  the warring parties in Yemen to "end the fighting, spare the  nation's blood, and return to dialogue as a means to resolve the  dispute."    In a meeting with a small number of Arab journalists,  including AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's, in Bayan Palace yesterday, Shaykh  Sa'd said: What is happening in Yemen saddens every Arab.  Kuwait will not rejoice to see a northerner taking up arms  against his brother in the south, or vice versa, despite the  position Yemen adopted during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,  namely its failure to condemn the aggression, keeping silent  about and helping it, and cooperating with the Iraqi regime.    He added that "Kuwait will not hesitate to issue a statement  expressing Kuwait's -- the government's and people's --  condemnation of brothers taking up arms against one another."  He pointed out that Kuwait supports any Gulf or Arab endeavor  aimed at resolving the dispute. But as a result of Arab  disunion, all endeavors have become weak and are unable to  crystallize an executive formula to end Arab disputes.    The Kuwaiti heir apparent stressed "the need to go back a  little and learn from the lessons and wounds of Iraq's invasion  of Kuwait." He said that "Yemeni citizens are suffering a great  deal as a result of the conflict, which is unjustly shedding  Arab blood. They need a real stand assuring them that everyone  supports them against any aggression." He added: "As a Kuwaiti  Arab, I had hoped I would hear such stands, telling us as  Kuwaitis and Arabs: You are not alone...we support you...we are  against aggression and for the return of legitimacy. I register  here the courageous stands adopted by the brothers and friends,  especially the position adopted by the custodian of the two holy  mosques [King Fahd of Saudi Arabia], whose position was  characterized by manhood, courage, and matching words with  actions."    Asked about the security situation in Kuwait, the Kuwaiti  heir apparent said that "security has been among the  government's top priorities since liberation. We will not allow  anyone to carry out any action that endangers the homeland's and  citizens' security or shakes confidence in the security  services' capability under any justification."    He also said that he "shares with the Kuwaitis their  security  concern over the situation represented in the existence of the  Iraqi regime as a source of threat to Kuwaiti security and its  unwillingness to implement Resolution 833 stipulating border  demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq." He stressed that "the  brothers' and friends' continued support for the just Kuwaiti  demands and their insistence on implementing all UN resolutions  reassures the Kuwaiti people and reduces the gravity of the  Iraqi threat."    On cooperation between the government and the Kuwaiti  National Assembly, Shaykh Sa'd pointed out that "the new  formation of the Kuwaiti Government embodies the government's  determination to implement its strategy concerning Kuwait's  future and to step up cooperation with the National Assembly."  He said that "what is being debated in this connection does not  reach the point of a dispute. It reflects differing views among  the sons of one country. Those in charge of the executive  authority and the legislative authority are passengers of one  ship called Kuwait, and no one wishes to sink this ship.  Everyone wants to lead it to the shore of safety."    The Kuwaiti heir apparent said that his government's  conditions for clearing the Arab atmosphere were mentioned in  the government's statement, which includes the following:    A. The emphasis on Iraq's implementation of the Security  Council resolutions.    B. The release of the POW's and those held by the Iraqi  regime.    He pointed out that "Kuwait is not setting impossible  conditions to clear the atmosphere. But before starting to  clear the atmosphere, the cause must be eliminated." He said  that "Kuwait has begun steps in this connection represented in  the tour of the Arab Maghreb states by the first deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, during which he discussed Kuwaiti  rights."    Shaykh Sa'd emphasized that "Kuwait has learned numerous  lessons from the Iraqi aggression. The scheme was not limited  to Kuwait. It was a scenario for an expansionist plan, but God's  will aborted it." He said that "we should remember before  clearing the atmosphere that the Iraqi aggression still exists.  And if the brothers in the Gulf believe -- even `25 percent' --  that Iraq has no expansionist ambitions, they are completely  wrong. Because the Iraqi regime is still working to complete  its forces in order to fragment and weaken the unity of the Gulf  Cooperation Council and then implement its expansionist schemes.  The brothers in the Gulf must realize this reality and apply  lessons we have all learned from the invasion. The picture of  the Kuwait aggression must be clear to all. And we must  cooperate to avert danger by unifying our aim, uniting ranks,  and joining forces."    He declined to speculate about the Kuwaiti position if Iraq  agrees to normalize relations with Israel in return for lifting  the international blockade. He said "Kuwait will deal with new  developments as its strategy and known fixed positions  supportive of right and peace dictate."</p>

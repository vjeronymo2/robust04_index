			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / German industry problems remain THE agreement reached on Friday in the Saxon capital of Dresden between Germany's metal and electrical employers and the country's powerful engineering union, IG Metall, provides a formula for ending a strike which could have paralysed what remains of eastern German industry. Yesterday, both sides were debating on the regional level whether the Saxon compromise reached by Gesamtmetall and the union could be applied to the metal and electrical sectors of the other four states. If so, workers will be balloted today and if 25 per cent support the agreement, the strikes in this sector are expected to end on Wednesday. But strikes in the steel sector, centred mostly in Berlin-Brandenburg, could continue after the breakdown yesterday evening of separate talks between the steel employers and the local IG Metall branch over this year's wage rises. Regardless of the outcome in both cases, the Saxony compromise leaves unanswered how eastern German industry can become competitive and how productivity can improve. For those small German and foreign companies already located in east Germany, the agreement offers little chance for further investment which could lead to the creation of new jobs in the region. Investments will be soaked up by a spiralling wage bill. The Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Forecasting (DIW) recently showed that for 1993, eastern Germany's gross domestic product will exceed DM201bn (Pounds 81.7bn), while the wage bill will exceed DM248bn. In western Germany, this year's GDP is estimated to total DM2,223bn, and wages DM1,555bn. In practice this means the small and medium-sized companies will find it increasingly difficult to generate profits in eastern Germany. Productivity in the metal, electrical and steel sectors in east Germany is already lagging behind its western counterparts by about 70 per cent, which means that unit labour costs in the east are 70 per cent above west German levels. Through the strike weapon, IG Metall reinstated, in a modified form, the basis of the March 1991 contract, signed with the employers, which will equalise eastern and western wages from mid-1996, instead of 1994. The principle of collective wage bargaining in the region has also been upheld. Above all, the union used the strike to attack the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of eastern German industry. Many of the targeted enterprises were under the Treuhand. If the agency manages to privatise sections of this remaining core, thousands could lose their jobs. This will push up the unemployment rate, which, taking into account job creation schemes and short-term work, is about 30 per cent of the region's labour force. By targeting these enterprises, and later the privatised sector, IG Metall wanted to ensure the future unemployed received higher unemployment benefits. But the strategy has left little room for creating investment which would lead to jobs. Indeed, this policy will not only reduce the union's eastern membership, it will deprive east Germany of the stimulus for growth and competitiveness.</p>

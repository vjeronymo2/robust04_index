The SIP was submitted by the State on May 27, 1993 to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Lamar, Colorado.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by May 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be addressed to: Vicki Stamper, 8ART&hyph;AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Pollution Control Division, Colorado Department of Health, 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, Colorado 80222&hyph;1530.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Vicki Stamper, 8ART&hyph;AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466, (303) 293&hyph;1765.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Lamar, Colorado was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act) upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  (See 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 40 CFR 81.306.) The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D of title I of the Act. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the Colorado moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Lamar PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on this proposal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Those states containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512, 13543&hyph;13544.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> II. This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In this action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Lamar plan revision which was due to EPA on November 15, 1991 and submitted by the State on May 27, 1993. EPA believes the attainment plan for Lamar meets all of the applicable requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991 as required by section 189(a)(2)(A) of the Act, EPA made a finding pursuant to section 179 of the Act that the State failed to submit the SIP and notified the Governor in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP was submitted on May 27, 1993, EPA found the submittal to be complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified the Governor accordingly in a letter dated June 14, 1993. This completeness determination corrected the State's deficiency and, therefore, terminated the 18-month sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

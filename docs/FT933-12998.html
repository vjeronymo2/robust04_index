			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Europe recession hits Honeywell HONEYWELL, the US electronic control systems group, reported a drop in net income and revenues for the second quarter. Sales were Dollars 1.45bn, down from Dollars 1.49bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 71.4m, or 53 cents a share, including an after-tax gain of Dollars 13.9m, or 10 cents, from the settlement of a lawsuit with Unisys. The gain was offset by special charges of Dollars 13.3m after taxes to improve productiv-ity. In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 81.8m, or 58 cents a share, including Dollars 7.4m, or 6 cents, after-tax from litigation settlements. Second-quarter operating profit, excluding special charges, was Dollars 131.7m, compared with Dollars 152.3m last year. 'We are delivering solid financial performance in the face of very difficult business conditions worldwide,' said Mr Michael Bonsignore, chairman and chief executive. In addition to a cyclical decline in the commercial aviation industry, the company's difficulties have been compounded by the deepening recession in Europe, especially in Germany, he added. 'Despite the difficult environment, we expanded research and development investment by 15 per cent,' Mr Bonsignore said. During the quarter, Honeywell purchased Dollars 64m in shares as part of its five-year, Dollars 600m share buy-back programme. Honeywell's space and aviation business was down sharply in the quarter, with operating profit of Dollars 48.5m on sales of Dollars 424.7m, compared with an operating profit of Dollars 61.4m on sales of Dollars 460.9m in the same period last year. First-half income was Dollars 128.7m, or 95 cents a share, against Dollars 50.7m, or 36 cents, last year. Sales were Dollars 2.89bn, against Dollars 2.97bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / EC set to agree on working hours EUROPEAN Community plans to limit the working week to 48 hours are set to be agreed next week, following high-level negotiations between the European Commission and the British government, whose opposition has blocked the proposal for three years. UK officials confirmed yesterday that 'it is likely that we will not vote against' the working time directive when employment and social affairs ministers meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday. Britain last year secured a partial opt-out, giving it a 10-year grace period to implement the 48-hour week, whereas its 11 partners would have to comply within three years. But the UK would, for the first time, have to give legal protection to workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours, and to bring in legislation on mandatory time off. Throughout the long tussle over this flagship of the EC's Social Charter, the British government has insisted it would not accept any obligation to limit working time, either now or in the future, claiming the measure would add Pounds 5bn to the costs of UK industry. But following talks between Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, and British ministers, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is understood to have sanctioned abstention on the directive. The UK, however, is still fighting for total exclusion from the rules for all work at sea, and for doctors in training. Britain will also come under pressure on Tuesday over EC plans for mandatory works councils in big, trans-European companies. Its 11 partners are agreed in principle to go ahead with the measure under the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty if Britain - which is exempt from these more ambitious provisions - continues to hold it up. The directive would oblige companies with more than 1,000 workers in more than one member state to set up elected works councils, which wold have to be consulted on investment, relocation and jobs plans. The UK is flatly opposed to obligatory consultation of workers, but is negotiating in detail the directive's provisions, keeping open the option of an eventual compromise. If its partners were to go ahead with their own plans, British companies would still be among those most affected. More than 100 UK companies in continental Europe would fall under the proposed rules, and multinationals based in Britain and on the continent are likely to face pressure from their workers to offer the same consultation rights in the UK as in the rest of the EC. The European employers federation, UNICE, has attacked the cost of organising the consultation meetings required by the directive. However, senior Commission officials insist that the cost would not be more than Ecu10 (Pounds 7.78) per year per worker, and would be offset by increased productivity flowing from improved industrial relations.</p>

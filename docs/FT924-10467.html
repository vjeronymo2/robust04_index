			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology: Man with a mission - John Young, who retires today as head of Hewlett-Packard, gives Louise Kehoe his thoughts on US industrial competitiveness John Young is vacating the corner office on Hewlett-Packard's 'executive row' this week, but he is not giving up his 10-year crusade to boost the international competitiveness of US industries. 'Securing America's technological leadership is one of the most critical issues we must address in order to ensure the health of our economy and our nation's competitiveness,' says Young. It is a message that the HP president and chief executive has delivered many times over the past decade. Young's calls to make technology leadership a national priority have been given a new edge, however, by his recent decision to publicly endorse Bill Clinton, the democratic presidential candidate. A life-long republican, Young shocked colleagues when he joined Clinton at a campaign rally in Silicon Valley last month. It is now evident, however, that Young has been instrumental in shaping Clinton's 'private sector-led, government-encouraged' National Technology Policy. By choosing sides, Young has made competitiveness an issue in the race for the White House. His action has also sparked rumours that he may be slated for a role in the cabinet of would-be president Clinton. This is not the first time that Young has been viewed as a prospective candidate for political office. In the past, however, he has defused such talk by insisting that he 'already has a job'. No more. Young, 60, retires after a 15-year stint at the helm of Hewlett-Packard during which the company has been transformed from a manufacturer of electronic instruments and calculators into one of the world's leading computer suppliers. Annual revenues have grown from Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 800m) at the beginning of his tenure to an expected Dollars 16bn this year. Yet as he ends his career at HP, it is Young's dogged efforts to persuade successive US administrations to recognise the critical role that technology could play in putting American industry back on to a growth track that are commanding attention. Young began his mission in 1983 when he was drafted by President Reagan to head a commission on industrial competitiveness. Although the commission succeeded in drawing attention to declining US technological leadership, its call to action was rebuffed by the Reagan administration. Bitterly disappointed, but determined to move forward, in 1985 Young formed the Council on Competitiveness, a private-sector, bipartisan group which includes industry leaders, academics and labour representatives. (Not to be confused with Vice President Dan Quayle's council of the same name, which critics charge is a 'haven for special interests' because it has halted the implementation of numerous environmental and other regulations.) In a seminal report published last year, the council called for Bush to 'announce his intention to increase dramatically the share of federal research and development expenditures that support critical generic technologies'. The president responded by approving joint projects between industry and the federal laboratories. Young also gives the president credit for 'some real progress in moving from a science policy to a science and technology policy,' and hails the administration's acknowledgment of the role of the government in supporting generic pre-competitive research and development as a 'landmark change'. Young regards much of the competitiveness agenda as bipartisan. He has been won over, nonetheless, by Clinton's enthusiastic response. 'America cannot continue to rely on trickle-down technology from the military to maintain competitiveness in its high-tech and manufacturing industries,' argues the democratic candidate. Clinton has pledged to refocus the work of the federal laboratories on technologies that enhance industrial performance; establish education and training programmes for highly skilled jobs; create a civilian research and development programme; and offer tax incentives for private-sector research and development. One democratic proposal that has excited Young is the plan to invest public funds in a '21st century infrastructure', a national communications network that would serve as a 'technology driver'. This would set a fast pace for related developments in the private sector. Yet isn't there an element of self-interest in an electronics company executive championing technology? 'Technology is key to winning the competitiveness battle,' Young maintains. 'The health of America's high-tech industry isn't only the concern of that industry, because technology has benefits that cut across different industries and drive national productivity and economic growth.' The whole country, rather than just the high-tech industry, or indeed HP, would be the beneficiaries, he asserts. Declining competitiveness has a direct impact on individuals, Young stresses. 'Our ability to increase our standard of living and that of our children is at risk,' he says. With republicans and democrats apparently agreed upon the importance of pursing industrial competitiveness, why is Young backing Clinton? 'It is not just a matter of technology policy, it is a matter of leadership,' says Young. Clinton, he believes, has the ability 'to get over this gridlock that we have in Washington (between the administration and Congress) and make changes.' Little wonder that some people in Washington believe Young will be invited to join Clinton's cabinet, if he is elected. Betraying at least a mild interest, Young observes that 'the worst thing that could happen would be for Clinton to win and the liberals to take over his agenda. The best thing we in the business community could do would be to give him our support for a centric position'. So will Young go to Washington to help Clinton be a 'centric' president? 'It is hard to comment on something that is so speculative,' he demurs. After 15 years on the firing line in the electronics industry, Young says that he would like to take six months to decide 'what I want to do with the rest of my time'.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (5): Bridging the generation gap - More ambitious schemes THE concept and definition of business parks has evolved rapidly since the reflective buildings of the late 70s and early 80s. Then, the term 'business park' was applied to almost any group of buildings at a density of around 18,000 sq ft to the acre with some kind of landscaping and better than average provision of parking. Now, the new 'true' business parks are unlikely to be sited on less than 100 acres and will include many additional facilities for the occupants and the local community. Early parks, in out of town locations, were unable to compete with town centres in terms of places to eat, drink, shop and all the other amenities. In addition, there were few attempts to offer accommodation for professionals such as solicitors and accountants, let alone workplace nurseries and creches, health clubs or hotels. The new generation of business parks - dubbed the 'fourth generation parks' by some - will offer a full range of ancillary facilities alongside top quality and flexible buildings. The 650-acre Kings Hill project at West MaIling, Kent, is one of the most-often cited 'fourth generation' business parks. Its US developer, Rouse and Associates, already has more than 200 business buildings housing 4,000 tenants under its belt on the other side of the Atlantic. Very low density - only 12,500 sq ft will be built on each acre - the emphasis at Kings Hill will be on quality; of both buildings and the environment. Rouse is now at work on the first phase of B1 space. Total space after a 10-year development programme will run to some 3.8m sq ft. This first phase of some 150,000 sq ft will include a US-style 'flex' building of between 30,000 sq ft and 40,000 sq ft. A 'flex' building is single-storey, finished to shell and core and capable of multi-occupation by a group of users ranging from light production to full office use. Each occupier has their own front door. It is, says Mr. Roger Saper of Jones Lang Wootton, a 'bit like a cucumber - it can be sliced up in any combination.' Kings Hill will also include housing and on-site amenities of many types, sporting, recreational and perhaps even educational - there is already a link-up in hand between an American college and local educational establishments which would establish a facility offering a broad range of courses. Arlington's Solent Business Park forms an integral part of the Whitely local plan and could also be considered a 'fourth generation' park, according to Mr Ian Warboys of Strutt and Parker. This is because it is at the hub of what is becoming a substantial new community. Equidistant from Southampton and Portsmouth on the M27 motorway the park runs to 145 acres with a further 50 acres for subsequent development. Among various amenities are a hotel and it is adjoined by a variety of housing - from five- to six-bedroom 'executive' homes down to two-bedroom terraced houses. The local plan also designates adjacent areas for schools, a golf course, woodland, a sportsground and nature reserves. Another park to fit the 'fourth generation' tag is the development of the former 320-acre airfield and race track at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey by Trafalgar House jointly with British Aerospace. Here, planning has been obtained for 750,000 sq ft of B1 space on the first 50 acres. Amenity elements of the development will include a supermarket and hotel and 25 acres has been set aside for housing. However, some consider that it is wrong to classify business parks by generation - or by when they just happened to be built. Some parks have evolved with the changes that have taken place in demand patterns, architecture and the thinking of the planners over the past 10 years. Arlington's Aztec West at junction 16 of the M5 six miles from Bristol ranks as one of the largest, most developed business parks in Europe. On 157 acres, more than 1.1m sq ft has already been built and another 350,000 sq ft is under construction. A further 20 acres are available for expansion. Aztec West (The A-Z of Technology) was a bold concept when ESN started building in 1980. It was a first generation flagship. Then came the second generation with its mixed use or 'fudged to confuse the planners' - 'high-tech' buildings. The third generation was born wIth the introduction of the B1-use class in 1987. Examples of all of these phases of evolution are to be seen at Aztec West which was acquired by Arlington in 1987. But the park also now offers a 90-bedroom hotel, shops, restaurants, a public house, an exhibition area and other communal facilities housed in the central Aztec Centre. Landscaping is first class and there are large housing projects at nearby Bradley Stoke. Intensive and meticulous on-site management including post occupancy evaluation of occupiers' levels of satisfaction and on-going needs are also necessary for the smooth running of a big business park. Arlington has an on-site team at all its business parks and makes a point of keeping close to its end users. Aztec West, then, one of the pioneers of business parks - although launched as a 'science park' - can justifiably claim to have made a smooth transition from the first generation into the fourth. There is unlikely to be a rush to begin new fourth generation parks. These very large projects are likely to take 10 years to build. And the amount of front-end investment in obtaining planning, drawing up the master plan and putting in the vast amount of infrastructure required before building can start at all is, says Mr John Heawood of Debenham Tewson and Chinnocks, 'mind-blowing'. Economic prospects over the next decade are uncertain and there are very few players with the necessary financial muscle.</p>

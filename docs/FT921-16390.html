			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound climbs back into favour STERLING inched its way back into the bid books yesterday as the D-Mark came under greater pressure due to price deregulation in the Soviet Union. Many traders who arrived early yesterday - anticipating the much-hyped 'great sterling crisis' - were relieved to see more buyers than sellers for the UK currency. However, most of the market's big players were still on holiday and next Monday is widely regarded to be the real testing day for the pound. Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer and market analyst at Sumitomo Bank, said: 'People are waiting to see what will happen. If the Soviet situation gets worse, then the D-Mark will weaken, letting sterling off the hook.' Sterling gained almost 2 pfennigs on the previous close in London to end at DM2.8513. The pressure on the D-Mark took some of the heat out of sterling's position within the European ERM. The German currency finished at 44 per cent of its permitted divergence above the central Ecu rate, compared with 54 per cent before the new year holiday. However, the easing was not enough to lift sterling from the floor of the EMS grid, where it languished for the whole day. Sterling also closed higher against the dollar, up from Dollars 1.8678 to Dollars 1.8740, but in New York the pound fell to Dollars 1.8665. During the day the dollar came under pressure from a stronger yen and the general economic malaise in the US. The yen moved up on expectations of concessions to US President George Bush when he visits Tokyo next week. The recent cut in Japan's discount rate has only strengthened traders' opinions that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will calm Mr Bush's fears of protectionism with a promise to keep the yen firm. However, with the Japanese market closed, moves were slightly exaggerated in a generally thin business, traders said. Statistics published in the US yesterday also continued to justify bearish sentiment on the dollar. The purchasing managers' report, which analyses the trading expectations of US companies, showed that economic growth had been sharply lower in December than during the previous month. It dropped to 46.5 per cent, the first time it has fallen to less than 50 per cent during the past six months. By the end of trading in London, however, the dollar was beginning to claw its way back. The US unit ended at Y124.55, compared with Y124.95 at the previous close, and a low during the day of Y123.75. The dollar closed virtually unchanged against the D-Mark at DM1.5218 after a session low of DM1.5110. In New York, heavy D-Mark selling gave the dollar, yen and pound an early boost. The more suspicious traders bounced rumours of intervention to ease ERM pressure, while others put the movements down to mere speculation. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.5302 and Y124.38.</p>

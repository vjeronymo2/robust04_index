			<p>BFN     [Text] Chancellor Vranitzky has guaranteed that no nuclear  power plant will be put into operation in Austria in the event  of its entry into the European Union. Vranitzky told ORF  [Austrian Radio and Television] that Austrian policy is very  clear. It was laid down in a joint statement that the  production of nuclear energy is always based on the political  decision of the country in question. According to Vranitzky,  the same applies to the disposal of nuclear waste. Therefore  Austrian politicians are responsible here. For Vranitzky, these  are clear guidelines.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bibby seeks Pounds 14.6m via cash call - Barlow Rand holding will be reduced from 86.4% to 79% J BIBBY and Sons, the industrial and agricultural group, yesterday launched a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise Pounds 14.6m to reduce borrowings and widen its share base. The issue of 11.32m new ordinary shares at 132p each will reduce the stake of Barlow Rand of South Africa, its controlling shareholder, from 86.4 to 79 per cent. Cazenove will place most of Barlow Rand's entitlement of 9.79m shares with investors. The shares closed down 3p at 160p yesterday. The group said there was an understanding with the Stock Exchange that Barlow Rand would reduce its holding. It was also announced that pre-tax profits for the six months to March 30 were virtually static at Pounds 16.97m (Pounds 16.76m) on reduced turnover of Pounds 227.59m (Pounds 286.16m). Borrowings rose from Pounds 32.5m in September to Pounds 62m for the end of March, representing 43 per cent of shareholders' funds. The group was forced by the Companies Act provision to bring its off-balance sheet debt - Pounds 21m associated with its rental company  - back on to the balance sheet. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said: 'We were unfairly caught by the change in the law. However, although I am perfectly happy with 43 per cent gearing, I plan to reduce it so we can take advantage of acquisition opportunities.' The group has spent Pounds 27m on acquisitions and Pounds 18m on capital investment, particularly on agricultural plant and equipment, in the past three years. The relative strength of sterling hit the science division's profits, which fell to Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 6.75m). The group is looking to expand its science arm via acquisition, and is studying six companies with a view to buying one of them. Mr Mansell-Jones said he thought the recession had 'bottomed out' but that it would not happen fast enough to affect results for the full year. Operating profits increased in paper and converted products from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 3.67m, and in materials handling from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 6.94m. Earnings rose to 9.82p (9.56p) and the interim dividend is increased to 2.85p (2.75p).</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Thames TV calls for share deal suspension SHARES in Thames Television, the independent production company, were suspended yesterday at the company's request. An announcement is expected on Thursday. The suspension followed an FT report on talks about a possible acquisition of Thames by Pearson, the publishing, oil services and investment banking group. But 'other matters' are also involved, according to the company. Before the suspension, Thames shares had risen to 221p, up from Monday's 189p close. The suspension price values Thames at Pounds 109.6m, a rise of 17 per cent since Monday's close. Pearson shares closed yesterday at 410p, up 6p. Thames said the shares had been suspended 'pending a further announcement concerning this morning's press report of talks between Thorn EMI and Pearson and other matters affecting Thames Television's financial results for the year ended December 31 1992.' Thorn EMI owns 58.9 per cent of Thames. In 1990, when Thames still held the ITV weekday franchise for the London region, Thorn EMI and BET, which between them held 56 per cent of Thames, put the combined stake for sale. There were no takers, because of uncertainty over the outcome of the imminent franchise auction. The two companies withdrew the shares from sale, and Thorn EMI bought out BET in 1991. Thames lost its franchise in the auction. Since then, it has become an independent production house, selling its programmes to the ITV network and other broadcasters. It also owns Reeves, a US production company, and has stakes in the UK Gold channel and the Astra satellite. Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, said it was keen to expand in media businesses, including television. It already owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire Television and 17.5 per cent of BSkyB.</p>

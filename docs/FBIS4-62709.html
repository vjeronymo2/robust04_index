			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's minister of finance Hryhoriy </F> Oleksandrovych Pyatachenko by Serhiy Vlad; place and date not  given: "Does The Payments Crisis Have Only Drawbacks?"]    [Text] When finance minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko  maintains that budget policy has had a considerable effect on  the improvement of the inflation climate in Ukraine, it is  difficult to disagree with his statement. Because the payments  crisis has not only drawbacks, but, however paradoxical it may  sound, it also has its pluses. It forces one to reduce budget  expenditure as much as possible, which stabilizes the state's  monetary circulation. Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko  tells what came of this policy in the first quarter.    [Pyatachenko] As is known, budgetary receipts were in line  with the structure of the plan for socioeconomic development in  1994 and had to account for about 40 percent of the total annual  revenue. It was, therefore, necessary to take advantage of the  Supreme Council's permission to grant credits amounting to 10  percent of quarterly expenditure.    During the first quarter, the budget received 67.5 trillion  karbovantsi [K], including K8 trillion from the National Bank in  the form of credits to cover the intra-annual gap between the  receipts of revenues and the need to carry out expenditure. In  the first quarter, the expenditure constituted K64.1 trillion.  Thus, you can see that the revenue was K3 trillion 400 billion  greater than the expenditure.    [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, the budget did not receive  all those revenues, which had been expected....    [Pyatachenko] The value-added tax came to K12 trillion 96  billion, or, to put it differently, to 110.6 percent of what had  been planned. Taxes on the profits of enterprises contributed  K13.5 trillion or 121.6 percent of what had been expected.    The situation is much worse with regard to the receipts of  excise duty. It was expected that K4.3 trillion would be  contributed, but only 1.6 trillion (36.5 percent of plan) was  recorded. This is due to the fact that we established  exceedingly high rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages,  television sets, and a number of other goods. This situation  will change in the second quarter, because the rates have been  lowered. The state must regain its lost ranking in product  sales. Besides, we received more taxes on citizens' profits  than had been planned, despite the considerable decline in  production.    [Vlad] Not only in terms of prices, but also in terms of  commodities....    [Pyatachenko] In terms of prices, everything is fine because  the price factor has played its role, as well as the payment of  much higher wages than planned, but you are, indeed, right about  the commodities.    [Vlad] In the first quarter, the profit from the external  economic activity was to amount K6 trillion, but in fact....    [Pyatachenko] K2.4 trillion, or 40 percent. Besides, the  budget only received 10 percent of the capital earned through  implementing the privatization program.    [Vlad] Despite the more or less satisfactory statistics you  are quoting, the financing, on the part of the state, of the  social sphere in the first quarter seems not to have stood up to  criticism....    [Pyatachenko] We planned to allocate K13.3 trillion for the  social protection of the population, but only allocated K7.9  trillion. Support for the state's sociocultural institutions  was somewhat better....    [Vlad] What did defense industry expenditures amount to in  the first quarter?    [Pyatachenko] It was expected that we would remit K4.7  trillion, but, in fact, it received only K2.4 trillion.    [Vlad] What can you say about crediting industrial  enterprises from the budget?    [Pyatachenko] In order to give support to those enterprises  that underwent a profound payments crisis, the National Bank  issued a credit of K11 trillion for three months at an interest  rate of 120 percent. However, this is outside the budget.    [Vlad] Everything that the budget failed to finance in the  first quarter has already gone down the drain? Well,  inflation....    [Pyatachenko] What we could not do for lack of time, we will  catch up with in the second and third quarters.    [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, in the past, budget  expenditure was covered at the expense of credits and the  credits -- at the expense of budget receipts. Is this tactic  undergoing a change?    [Pyatachenko] A radical change. This is already a strategy,  rather than a tactic. We no longer grant credits. Financing  from the budget is done exclusively within the limits of  receipts. The National Bank's emission is in conformity with  the "ceiling" of the increase in the gross domestic product.</p>

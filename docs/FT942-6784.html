			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Three bootleggers jailed for cross-Channel racket Three men who ran a cross-Channel smuggling ring, selling cheap French beer, wine and champagne in Britain, were jailed yesterday. The men were the ringleaders of an 11-man gang which made at least 42 trips on the Dover-Calais ferry in three months, Cardiff Crown Court was told. Vanloads of cheap drink were brought into the country and sold illegally at Sunday markets and corner shops in south Wales. Two undercover teams of Customs officers tracked vehicles between Kent and Cardiff in an operation codenamed Chancer. Eleven men admitted their part in a conspiracy to evade paying duty on beer and spirits. Mr Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, said it was estimated that Pounds 70,000 of unpaid duty was involved between January and April last year when the gang was operating the ring. Cases of beer, wine and champagne were brought to a rented warehouse in Cardiff before being distributed to traders. 'It was a fairly slick operation,' said Mr Thomas. Mr Ricardo Nichols, a former market trader, Mr Richard Spencer, a shopowner and licensee, and Mr Raymond Tout, were jailed for terms of nine, four and three months respectively. Judge Michael Burr said the gang had used 'an army of helpers' in an organised conspiracy to flout the law and try to make easy money. He ordered six other men to carry out community service and conditionally discharged two others who had played a lesser role. After the case Customs investigators said that the gang made up to four cross- Channel trips a day, mainly to a hypermarket near Calais. The gang went into business only three weeks after the new Customs laws came into force on New Year's day last year. The investigators added: 'We hope these jail sentences will be a big deterrent to help tackle this widespread crime which is causing concern to the retail industry.' Two weeks ago, three bootleggers from Wolverhampton were jailed for six months after admitting evading duty on beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes worth more than Pounds 73,000.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA SETS CURFEW IN KOSOVO;  </P> <P> ETHNIC STRIFE: TANKS PATROL THE STREETS OF THE PROVINCE TO PREVENT CLASHES  BETWEEN ALBANIANS AND SERBIANS.  </P> <P> The government imposed a nighttime curfew Wednesday in Kosovo province, where  more than two dozen people have died this year in ethnic clashes.  </P> <P> The official Tanjug news agency said Soviet-built tanks and armored personnel  carriers patrolled the streets of most Kosovo towns to enforce the 9 p.m. to 4  a.m. curfew.  </P> <P> Tanjug said Yugoslav authorities decided Tuesday that the curfew is needed "to  defend the constitutional order and prevent violence."  </P> <P> MIG-21 fighters streaked at low altitude over several towns, and small groups  of heavily armed soldiers patrolled villages, sources in the region said.  </P> <P> Thousands of Serbs had rallied for three days in Kosovo Polje, a suburb of the  provincial capital of Pristina, demanding a curfew and protesting what they  claimed were threats by ethnic Albanian "separatists and terrorists."  </P> <P> Ethnic Albanians make up 90% of the population in Kosovo, a province of the  Serbian republic. They oppose moves by Serbian leaders to more tightly control  the province.  </P> <P> One person died Tuesday and dozens were injured in clashes between security  forces and tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian demonstrators demanding free  elections, an end to a year-old state of emergency and the release of political  prisoners.  </P> <P> Since January, 28 ethnic Albanians have been killed in ethnic unrest, according  to official figures. The same number were killed in all of last year.  </P> <P> During the curfew, "movements and gatherings of people for the purpose of  demonstrating" were strictly forbidden, said Belgrade Radio.  </P> <P> Some small protests were reported during the day, mainly involving ethnic  Albanian schoolchildren and youths who taunted riot police in several towns.  </P> <P> A journalist who spoke by telephone from the region said nearly all ethnic  Albanian students boycotted classes and at least 30,000 workers continued a  two-week-old strike to protest what they described as "police repression."  </P> <P> Serbian students at Pristina University demanded that authorities "guarantee  their safety" from ethnic Albanians, Tanjug said.  </P> <P> The students also demanded that all university officials who supported past  demonstrations by Albanian students be fired and threatened to "continue their  education outside the province" if the demands are not met, Tanjug said.  </P> <P> The students also want authorities to jail the leaders of seven new opposition  movements. The Serbs accused the students of inciting demonstrations and  strikes by ethnic Albanians last month.  </P></p>

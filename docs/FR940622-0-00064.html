			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Managed health care plans cannot deny a hospital permission to examine or treat their enrollees. They may only state what they will and will not pay for. However, regardless of whether a hospital is to be reimbursed for the treatment, it is obligated to provide the services specified in the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter contended that hospitals should not be allowed to pass along the costs of any civil monetary penalties to the Medicare or Medicaid programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree; these penalties are not reimbursed by the Medicare or Medicaid programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. OBRA 90: Peer Review Organization Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above in section II.D. of this preamble, Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency Cases, and in several responses to comments, before imposing civil monetary penalties and exclusions, section 1867(d)(3) of the Act requires that we request the appropriate PRO to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized and report on its findings before the OIG may impose a civil monetary penalty or exclusion. [Note: PRO review is not required in cases where a delay in effecting a sanction would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or in situations where medical review is inappropriate, for example, in cases where an individual was denied a medical screening examination.] The Secretary must provide the PRO with at least 60 days for the review. The PRO is required to provide reasonable notice of the review to the hospital and physician involved. The PRO is also required to provide them with a reasonable opportunity for discussion and an opportunity to submit additional information. This provision is effective for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the possible termination phase of a case's development, the HCFA regional office has the responsibility and authority to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance. Termination procedures provide for an opportunity for the provider to comment. During this phase, the HCFA regional office is not required to instruct the PRO to offer the affected hospital an opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information. Subsequent to this phase, the OIG has the responsibility and authority to direct that the PRO conduct an assessment. In conducting such as assessment, the PRO is required to offer the affected physician and/or hospital an opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information before the PRO issues its report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adding a new paragraph (g) to proposed &sect;489.24 to implement the statutory provision that PROs have at least 60 days to make their assessments and to specify that PROs must provide affected physicians and hospitals reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of review and opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we are adding a new &sect;489.24(h) to clarify that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment to the physician or hospital (or both where applicable), or the affected individual, or his or her representative. However, we specify that the PRO physician's identity is confidential unless he or she consents to release his or her identity, in accordance with the PRO disclosure regulations set forth at &sect;&sect;476.132 and 476.133. If the case goes to litigation, the PRO is required to provide expert testimony and it is preferable, but not required, that the testifying physician be the same physician who reviewed and reported on the case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated earlier, the statutory change requiring PRO review applies only in situations involving civil monetary penalties and exclusions. Termination proceedings pursuant to section 1866 of the Act as a result of violations of the anti-dumping provisions of section 1866 and section 1867 do not require PRO review. We note that a facility could be the subject of a termination proceeding and also be assessed civil monetary penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Summary of Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this interim final rule with comment period, we are adopting as final the provisions of the June 16, 1988 proposed rule, as amended by the revisions discussed below and clarifications discussed elsewhere in this preamble. (To accommodate changes to the Code of Federal Regulations since the publication of the June 16, 1988 proposed rule, proposed paragraphs (k) through (q) of &sect;489.20 have been redesignated as paragraphs (l) through (r).) Unless otherwise noted, revisions are based on our evaluation of public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA and VA: We made no revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Hospital discharge rights notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have revised this section to eliminate the requirement that the beneficiary or his or her representative acknowledge receipt of the ``Message'' by signing the acknowledgement statement on the ``Message.'' We have also eliminated the requirement that an acknowledgement of the ``Message'' be retained by the hospital. Instead, we will rely on hospitals to determine how they can best comply with the requirement that each beneficiary be provided with a discharge rights notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Hospital responsibility for emergency care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are revising the proposed regulations as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 489.20(m): We have clarified &sect;489.20(m) to eliminate any implication that a hospital may improperly transfer a patient as long as it is done with prior arrangement. In addition, we are requiring that when a hospital has reason to believe that an individual was transferred in violation of the requirements of &sect;489.24, it will report the violation to either HCFA or the State survey agency, rather than to both, as required by the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

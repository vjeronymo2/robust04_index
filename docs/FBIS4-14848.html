			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 2 April, TASS -- President Nursultan  Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is of the opinion that a Euro-Asian  Union (EAU) which he suggests and which, in his view, could be  more effective than the structure of the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS), should be patterned after the European  Community. Nazarbayev said this in an interview given in Alma  Ata [Almaty] to the Japanese newspaper MAINICHI on the eve of  his forthcoming official visit to Tokyo. The visit begins on 6  April.    The EAU idea, MAINICHI quotes Nazarbayev as saying, is based  on the recognition of only full membership of states, with each  of them undertaking to abide by jointly adopted decisions.    "More than 300 joint documents have been adopted over the  period of the CIS existence. However, no results are seen,  because a number of states partially reject some of them,  interpreting the contents of agreements in their own interests,"  Nazarbayev explained.    Touching upon his forthcoming trip to Japan, the president  of  Kazakhstan emphasised that he intends to discuss aid to people  who suffered from nuclear tests in the area of Semipalatinsk and  expects a positive response from the Japanese leadership.    In addition, Nazarbayev is to call on Japan to take an  active  part in a Kazakhstan-suggested international conference on the  fate of the Aral Sea, a likely disappearance of which threatens  with a tremendous damage to the environment, and not only to  that of the Republic.</p>

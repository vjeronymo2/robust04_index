			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Budget deficit piles pressure on Italy THE Italian Treasury yesterday announced the 1992 budget deficit had overshot earlier estimates by L11,000bn and had totalled L163,150bn (Pounds 74.27bn). The overshoot had been widely expected since projected revenues from privatisation had failed to materialise. The deficit, equivalent to nearly 11 per cent of GDP, means the government will be under pressure to introduce a mini-budget before the end of June. With the Amato government under increasing political threat and the need to introduce electoral reform, the momentum for privatisation could slow, according to foreign bankers and local analysts. A slower pace in privatisation is likely to place even more pressure on the government to find alternative resources to hold down the public sector deficit. Privatisations had been scheduled to raise L7,000bn in 1992, largely from divestitures in the banking sector. Delays and changes in the privatisation plan held back these sales. This year the government also plans to raise L7,000bn from privatisation; but this revenue will come from a mixture of assets which should have been sold in 1992 and a scaling down of the sell-offs planned when the 1993 budget was drawn up last September.</p>

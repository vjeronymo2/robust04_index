			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KITE-FLYING QUARTET HAS HIGH TIME IN NEW SPORT  </P> <P> After work on Mondays and Wednesdays, Tom Allen and three of his buddies head  out to Playa del Rey to fly kites.  </P> <P> But these are not lazy afternoons, and these are not cheap toy store kites.  </P> <P> The four men make up what they call Team BOHICA Kite Squadron, apparently the  only stunt kite-flying team in the Los Angeles area competing under the  auspices of the American Kitefliers Assn. The association, which is based in  Rockville, Md., and has about 2,000 members, promotes competitive and  recreational kite flying.  </P> <P> The four men have been practicing together only for about a year, yet placed  first as novices in a local contest in San Bernardino in April and finished  second as intermediates in a regional contest in San Diego last month.  </P> <P> The team hopes to participate in a national contest in San Francisco in  September in the open, or experienced, category and at the American Kitefliers  Assn. conven tion in Hawaii in October.  </P> <P> The men are modest about how quickly they have become competitive at making  their $150 specialized kites dance in the sky.  </P> <P> "It's such a new sport that everyone moves up fast," Allen said.  </P> <P> While kite flying has been around for centuries, competitive stunt kite flying  has only been around for about four years, according to Jim Miller, president  of the American Kitefliers Assn.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Miller said he was surprised to hear that there was a  team in Los Angeles. He said most of the teams are in San Diego, the San  Francisco Bay Area, the Midwest and the East Coast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Prizes  </P> <P> Miller said some cash and prizes have been awarded to contest winners, but  stunt kite fliers are still far from becoming highly paid professionals.  </P> <P> "This is strictly an amateur sport," he said. "So far, most competitors are  individuals who are footing the bills themselves."  </P> <P> Team expenses include about $2,000 for equipment and $10,000 to $15,000 a year  for traveling to competitions.  </P> <P> Miller said the future of the sport will depend on sponsorship of the events,  similar to what is happening in professional beach volleyball, where beer and  liquor companies provide prize money in exchange for the publicity.  </P> <P> "We don't really know how much spectator interest there is," he said. "When we  perform at a beach, we generally gather a small crowd. But a commercial sponsor  is going to want to see a big crowd."  </P> <P> Until that happens, competitors such as Team BOHICA (a semi-bawdy acronym) will  have to pay their own expenses or try to find a sponsor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seek Sponsor  </P> <P> "That's what we are trying to do now," Allen said at a recent Monday afternoon  practice. "We have all our equipment now, but we'd like someone to sponsor us  and pay our expenses to the competitions. We're hoping for individual donations  or a major sponsor who wants its name on our team shirts."  </P> <P> The four men said they have no illusions of quitting their jobs and someday  making a living flying kites. They are in it, they say, for the fun.  </P> <P> "It gets the adrenaline flowing," said a smiling Jorge Plasencia, one of the  team members.  </P> <P> Three of the four men, Allen, Plasencia and Ralph Pieplenbos, work together at  Citicorp TTI in Marina del Rey. The fourth member, Bill Crandell, is a  carpenter and a boyhood friend of Pieplenbos.  </P> <P> In team competition, the four men stand side by side, synchronizing the  movement of their kites with dual lines. The lead kite has a line about 135  feet long, with each adjoining kite line five feet shorter. The shortest line,  about 120 feet long, is the fastest, usually the most difficult to control and  usually experiences the most crashes.  </P> <P> "I can't meet these guys for lunch, so I got the short line," Crandell joked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Graphite Frame  </P> <P> The kites are made of rip-proof nylon on a frame of graphite. The bat-shaped  kites have a wingspan of six to eight feet. On a windy day, a kite is large  enough to lift a small child.  </P> <P> Stunt kite-flying competition resembles ice skating or gymnastics in that  specific routines must be performed and points are awarded based on difficulty  and accuracy.  </P> <P> One complex routine is called the Black Hole. It starts out with the four kites  aligned in the air as close as possible to each other and to the ground. The  four kites rise skyward in a single line, then two kites breaking to the right  and the other two to the left. The two kites on each side hook back toward the  middle, heading toward each other.  </P> <P> Just as they are about to hit, they break away from each other. Then the two  kites on each side wrap around each other and then unwrap before making a  ground dive. Finally, all four realign parallel to the ground and make a left  turn.  </P> <P> "The competition and potential prize money is one thing, but we're all doing  this for fun," Allen said. "If you don't have fun, then it's not worth doing."  </P></p>

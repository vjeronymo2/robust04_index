			<p>BFN     [Text] Pursuant to instructions from brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani yesterday visited the  families of the victims of the spiteful missile aggression. He  extended condolences on behalf of the brother president.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani had earlier inspected the  situation of the people at the site of the ugly, odious crime  committed by the forces of apostasy and secession when a missile  fell on the homes of secure citizens.    The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that brother Lt.  Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has instructed the competent  authorities to reconstruct the houses that were destroyed at the  expense of the state, and to give 100,000 riyals in aid to each  affected family.</p>

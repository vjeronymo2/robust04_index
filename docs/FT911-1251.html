			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / France and Soviets in joint move on Mideast FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, yesterday threw their joint weight behind creation of a Palestinian state and proposals for a Middle East peace conference. After talks with Mr Mitterrand, who was in Moscow on a one-day visit, President Gorbachev said that failure to resolve the Middle East conflict swiftly could 'once again spill over into difficult, acute situations' such as the Gulf war. At the same time, the Soviet Union confirmed that foreign minister Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh would visit Israel this week - the first head of Soviet international diplomacy to visit the Jewish state since Moscow severed diplomatic ties in 1967. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, is also to return to the Middle East later this week. Mr Baker said he intended to meet Mr Bessmertnykh, 'so that we can continue to try to co-ordinate our efforts to promote a peace conference jointly sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union'. The US is seeking to promote both face-to-face negotiations between Israel and each of its Arab neighbours and direct discussions between Israel and Palestinian representatives. Mr Baker said this would be 'a very broad conference of a nature and type that has never before taken place'. The Soviet foreign minister, on a four-day tour starting tomorrow, will visit Jordan, Egypt and possibly Lebanon. A foreign ministry spokesman said Mr Bessmertnykh hoped to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel, while willing to talk to Arab states directly, has opposed an international conference or any discussions involving the PLO. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are unwilling to participate in the initial stages of any conference, while Syria has said it would only join talks sponsored by the United Nations. In Moscow Mr Mitterrand said he would campaign in his own country and the international community for as much assistance as possible to 'help President Gorbachev and perestroika'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An exchange of prisoners of war took place this  afternoon at the UN Protection Force checkpoint near Lipovac.  The Croatian side handed over 11 prisoners, mainly members of  the Stit [Shield] terrorist group. One of the prisoners refused  to go over to the Serbian side. In addition to eight people  from the Sombor group, another five prisoners were released from  Serbian prisons. Thus the agreement signed by Panic and Franjo  Greguric in Budapest in 1992 has been realized.</p>

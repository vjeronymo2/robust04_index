			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Possible signal from senior judicial officers Sir, The enthusiasm with which Lord Justice Bingham's most welcome appointment as Master of the Rolls has been greeted may (temporarily) mask an important signal from the government and our senior judicial officers. In the Caparo case, Lord Justice Bingham was one of two appeal court judges later unanimously overruled in the House of Lords, who ruled that auditors' duty of care should be extended to existing investors in a company. The other overruled judge was the present Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor. Clive Boxer, consultant, Davies Arnold Cooper, 6-8 Bouverie Street, London EC4Y 8DD</p>

She reported the blaze and attempted to control it with a fire  extinguisher, but the blaze spread to the other five cars. Heat from the  explosion damaged two additional cars nearby and a building 50 feet away, Van  Voorhees said.  </P> <P> The fire was contained by 4 a.m. Its cause is under investigation.  </P></p>

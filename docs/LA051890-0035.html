			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> APHIDS INFLICTING HUGE LOSSES ON ORGANIC FARMS  </P> <P> Organic farmers in Ventura County stand to lose millions of dollars in crops  this year because of the worst outbreak of aphids in a decade.  </P> <P> Growers, who blame the outbreak on drought conditions, say that crops most  endangered by the insect are organically grown lettuce, broccoli, cabbage and  celery.  </P> <P> "In the mountains, all the vegetation is dry up there, so they come after our  crop in stronger numbers," said organic farmer Dean Walsh. "This is the worst  year we've had in 10 years."  </P> <P> Up and down the central coast, organic farmers are trying to exterminate armies  of the tiny, winged insects. They say they are severely hampered, however,  because -- unlike other farmers -- they do not use pesticides.  </P> <P> "We've had an aphid problem like we've never seen in our lives," said Mary Ann  Sprinkle, a spokeswoman for the Carpinteria chapter of California Certified  Organic Farmers. "Aphids are on things I've never seen them on before."  </P> <P> There is only a small contingent of organic farmers in Ventura County. Fourteen  farmers till 1,200 acres, producing between $10 million and $15 million of  vegetables and fruit, growers estimate.  </P> <P> Without organic solutions to the aphid outbreak, "you're looking at a  multimillion-dollar loss for the county," said Bob Scowcroft, executive  director of the California Certified Organic Farmers, which represents 630  growers.  </P> <P> While other farmers can spray chemicals to rid their produce of the pest,  organic farmers say they are almost powerless to prevent the damage aphids can  wreak. They are turning to nontoxic methods to kill the irksome insects: soapy  water, and other bugs.  </P> <P> Organic farmers have been spraying their fields with soapy water by hand to  wash aphids off their crops. They also have introduced ladybugs and lacewings,  which feed on aphids, into their fields to reduce the aphid population.  </P> <P> Walsh runs the largest organic farm in Ventura County, a 540-acre ranch in  Camarillo, and a 280-acre farm near Lompoc in Santa Barbara County. His farm  ships about 1 million cartons of organic vegetables to domestic markets each  year.  </P> <P> The green bugs suck vegetables dry, ruining produce that is ready for market.  Even vegetables believed to be clean of bugs have made their way to supermarket  stands, only to be found sprinkled with aphids.  </P> <P> About 10% to 15% of Walsh's green vegetables were lost to hungry aphids last  month when 15 acres were infested, he said. Harvested crops had to be dumped  after supermarkets discovered the insect and rejected the produce.  </P> <P> While organic farmers blame lack of rain for the aphid outbreak, county  agriculture officials refrain from attributing the outbreak only to the  drought. They say the bugs are returning as part of a seasonal reproductive  cycle, but admit the population is unusually large this year.  </P> <P> Phil Phillips, a pest management specialist with the University of California  farm adviser's office in Ventura, said lack of rain has broken down the  resistance of crops to predatory insects such as aphids. Moreover, plant  physiology changes during periods of drought and actually makes them more tasty  to their enemies, he said.  </P> <P> "The plant, when it's under stress, produces more proteins in the plant sap. In  doing that, it produces a more nutritious meal," Phillips said. Hungry aphids  see it as "akin to eating filet mignon as opposed to hamburger."  </P> <P> Aphids leave tell-tale signs of their feasting, Phillips said. After the bug  has sucked a plant dry, its leaves curl under or wrinkle.  </P> <P> The only spray organic farmers can use is a soapy insecticide that dries out  aphids, but it has only a "mediocre" deterrent effect, Phillips said.  </P> <P> Recently, organic farmers have begun planting other crops to divert aphids away  from commercially grown vegetables. They are planting alfalfa, mint and  marigold flowers, Walsh said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Walsh farm is bracing itself for another attack on the cucumber  and tomato harvest next month, Walsh said.  </P> <P> "Before there were farmers, there were aphids," he said. "We're always  preparing for them."  </P> <P> CONSUMER TIPS  </P> <P> Agriculture officials say the most common signs of aphid infestation are:  </P> <P> * Aphids that are visible on the skin or outer leaves of vegetables or fruits.  </P> <P> * Wrinkled, curling or deformed leaves that indicate aphids have been sucking  the juices out of the plant.  </P> <P> * Discoloration, such as small yellow specks, particularly on the outer leaves  of cabbage.  </P> <P> * A sticky, filmy residue on the outer leaves and skin.  </P> <P> Produce that does have aphids can still be eaten, growers said. They add that a  thorough rinse of the vegetable usually gets rid of the bugs.  </P></p>

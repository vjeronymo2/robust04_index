			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francesco Gerardi: "Disunite, so as to Win!"] </F>   [Text] At the end of the "Cotroceni Round" -- as the  dialogue initiated by the Presidency with the leaders of the  parliamentary parties was called -- we wonder if, somehow, the  breaking up of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] was  the actual goal. We had in mind a number of elements, including  the political discrediting of the chairman of the CDR by the  spokesman of the Presidency; the attack on the Convention, which  was considered (also by the Presidency) as an extremely  heterogenous political formation; the partisan position, the  authoritarian and discriminatory manner in which President  Iliescu interprets the political game, his rather circumstantial  statements; the real disinterest of the "chosen one of the  nation" (or his concern only for the eyes of the world) in  finding effective solutions for emerging from the prolonged  political crisis. However, this new attack of the ruling party  against the Opposition failed lamentably and succeeded only in  making bilateral relations even more tense. The Opposition, that  is, the CDR plus the Democratic Party [PD], refused to fall into  the trap of any kind of separate discussions with the Presidency  and, indirectly, in a disguised manner, with the ruling party,  thus demonstrating that it is a coherent and orderly force,  which is perfectly motivated to achieve a common goal: the  formation of a new parliamentary majority which can support a  stable and effective government. This "stubbornness," this  spirit of a selfish opposition, this change of tactics might  create the impression that they have surprised the Presidency  and the Party of Social Democracy of Romania [PSDR], which are  accustomed to resolving much more rapidly and "once and for all"  the problems posed by their adversary (there were enough  examples during the past two or three years). All the more so  since President Iliescu has felt that he was "obliged" to state  that his intention (and that of the institution which he  represents) was misunderstood: the goal was only to achieve a  political pact -- "or whatever you would call a document which  aimed at an agreement on the framework for the civilized  development of activity, of life, and of political  confrontation, if you wish"). That is, something which could be  defined "possibly, as a code of ethics for our political life"  and which envisages, for a long period of time, the cooperation  of the parties in a "climate which is favorable for all." After  the PDSR, at the request of the president, presents a first  draft of such a document, things will be clearer. Now,  everything is in the stage of good, sincere intentions. On the  other hand, after it let it be known that, at present, it has no  thought of sharing (democratically appropriated) power, but, in  addition, together with all its "lame ducks," that is, the PSM  [Socialist Labor Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the  PDAR [Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party], and the PUNR  [Romanian National Unity Party], it would form a "monolithic  family," a sort of "united left" (from the center to the extreme  and back), the PDSR announced its availability for a dialogue  with the CDR, first of all, on a general level, "based on the  differences which are smaller between us and the CDR, such as,  for example, in the field of foreign policy. Then we will go  toward an area which can mean a political pact, based on certain  elements, possibly an agreement on an economic strategy for the  next decades. Finally, there might also be a discussion about a  pact on governing." (Adrian Nastase said this!) So, if you had  any fears, be at peace; we will have many victories, at least  for the next few decades! Exactly like it was with the deceased,  disguised, and reformed Romanian Communist Party, some people  say.    Joined together, the two explanations of attitudes, of the  Presidency and the PDSR, do nothing but create a breathing space  (or stall for time), so the tactical register could be changed.  Since, recently, the "Trojan horse" of Cotroceni, that is, PUNR  Senator Viorel Salagean, said: the PDSR should form a government  with the PUNR and certain parties in the Convention, such as:  the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], the PL  '93 [Liberal Party '93], or the PAC [Civic Alliance Party],  obviously supported in the Parliament by other parties,  including the PD. In addition -- and pay attention to this! --  according to the "certain" information which Mr. Salagean has,  the PD is planning a pact with the PDSR "which is not just  possible, but will happen very soon." There has been talk since  last fall about the involvement of the PNTCD in the government;  about the courting of liberals; and even about the  "reconciliation of the Siamese twins." So there is nothing  completely new in this -- except for the fact that the leaders  of the PNTCD have repeatedly declined the "offer" of the PDSR  and we do not know why they would change their opinion now and,  moreover, why they would compromise themselves by a misalliance  with the "provincial party" of the garrulous inimitable one, Gh.  Funar, (who, with the PRM party leader, [Corneliu] Vadim Tudor,  forms the ultranationalist tandem of Romanian politics). As for  the PD, its detachment from the CDR and its rapprochement to the  PDSR -- that is, the re-establishment of the 1990 National  Salvation Front -- would compromise it once and for all. But, we  do not believe that, after so much energy has been spent in  redefining itself politically and rebuilding the image which it  lost after the rash coexistence in 1990-91, the PD would have  forgotten the Fall of 1991 when "someone" put a "knife to its  throat" and, for the sake of the "rasol" [boiled meat], would  dig its own grave. During the past two years, Petre Roman  demonstrated that he learned a lot about politics (first of all,  from his own mistakes, and then, from others), that his  performance on the Romanian political stage is not over, and  that it is not by chance that EURONEWS, in a report at the end  of 1993, calls him a "politician of high caliber," along with  Ion Ratiu, who, if properly utilized, could change the image of  Romania in the world.    The conclusion? The recent statement of the PUNR (?!)  senator, Viorel Salagean, was only a new attempt to sow discord,  suspicion, and dissent, and to dismember the political forces of  the Opposition. If this does not succeed, there will certainly  be other attempts. More refined and improved. The current Ruling  Party will use all possible maneuvers to wear down its  adversary, because only in this way can the agony be prolonged.  And along with this, our misery, the suffering of an entire  nation that is not completely awake.</p>

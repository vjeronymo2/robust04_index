			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Walker trial in its final stages The judge in the trial of Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker group, yesterday warned the jury that fraud on a company was not a 'victimless' crime, John Mason writes. Beginning his summing up, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin said the money at issue sometimes came from shareholders who were entitled to expect a company's accounts to be honest. The prosecution claims that Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, fraudulently boosted the company's profits in 1984-89. The two men deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. The judge's summing-up will continue until October 17.</p>

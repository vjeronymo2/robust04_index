			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Wages and migration in America: a lesson for Europe IT WILL take more than the abolition of national border controls to raise international labour mobility within the European Community. The combination of distinct national cultures, histories and languages is likely to mean that the current low levels of cross-country migration within Europe, relative to that between US states, will persist for some years after 1992. But not, perhaps, for ever. The US evidence suggests that a single market for European goods and services, combined with a single currency, may lead to persistently high national unemployment differentials unless workers are prepared to move between regions; and empirically, in the absence of border controls, unemployment is the main reason for migration. The fabled mobility of Americans explains why the US has not been plagued by persistent high regional unemployment differentials. The current high unemployment regions in Britain, Germany or Italy also had the highest jobless rates a decade ago; but the US does not have a regional unemployment problem. Yet the US does have persistently fast and slow growing states, as the upper charts show. Those states which had the slowest employment growth rates in the 1950s and 1960s - New England, the mid-Atlantic and the rust belt states of the mid-west - also tended to have the slowest employment growth over the past two decades. The fastest growing states over the past 40 years have been those blessed with sun, oil or both. Swings in the fortunes of particular industries and commodities, combined with a high degree of regional industrial specialisation, also mean that individual states regularly diverge from their long-run growth paths. Slow growing Massachusetts had one of the fastest growing employment rates in the first half of the 1980s as its high-technology industries benefited from the rise in defence procurement. Fast-growing Texas was hit by the fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s: employment in Texas fell, unemployment rose and relative wages declined. Yet state unemployment rates quickly returned to their long-run average levels, even though the shocks to employment are not fully reversed. Mr Olivier Blanchard and Mr Lawrence Katz of MIT and Harvard University find that negative employment shocks lead to a rise in unemployment and a small decline in labour force participation. But this effect disappears after five to seven years. It is out-migration of unemployed workers, rather than in-migration of companies attracted by low wages, that explains how US states adjust to regional shocks. Mr Blanchard and Mr Katz, in a forthcoming Brookings Institute paper, estimate the average response across all 51 states to an employment shock. They find that a fall in state employment of 1 per cent in the first year is reflected in a rise in the unemployment of 0.32 per cent and a fall in participation of 0.17 per cent: of the 100 workers who lose their job, 30 stay unemployed, five drop out of the labour force and 65 leave the state. But this migration eventually erases the effect on unemployment and participation rates. Falling relative wages do attract some new jobs into the state, but the effect is weak and the fall in employment is never fully reversed. Europe can expect to suffer similar swings in national regional fortunes. The single market programme is likely to encourage a similar pattern of regional industrial specialisation within Europe; and monetary union will prevent national governments from using exchange rates to offset demand or supply shocks which adversely affect national industries. How will Europe cope with these demand shocks? Probably not very well. The US evidence suggests that European workers will have to be more prepared to travel, accept greater swings in their relative wages than occurs between US states, or, alternatively, suffer persistently high unemployment. That there is both more migration and wage flexibility between US states than between British regions does not bode well for the future.

trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

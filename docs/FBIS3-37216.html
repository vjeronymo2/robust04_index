Filatov supported the position of Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev who said that force against Bosnian Serbs can be  used only in extreme situations when all other means of conflict  settlement prove unsuccessful.    Earlier today, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said  that Russia is against air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Grachev spoke out against solving the Bosnian problem by  force. The war experience of the United States in Vietnam and  the Soviet Union in Afghanistan shows that inter-ethnic  conflicts should be settled by political means, he added.    "If the bombing takes place, it will do no good to anyone,"  the Russian defence minister said. He stressed that Russian  peacekeepers will stay in former Yugoslavia and continue their  mission.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC PROPOSES NEW PREFIX FOR X-RATED CALLS  </P> <P> The state Public Utilities Commission proposed Friday that phone companies be  required to use a prefix other than the commonly used 976 for services with  sexually explicit material, that they supply such services only by  presubscription and allow commercial customers to block those calls.  </P> <P> The action was hailed by attorney Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates, who  represented 12 groups that sought changes to protect consumers and prevent  children from "running up bills of thousands of dollars" with the expensive  entertainment and information calls.  </P> <P> The tentative PUC decision, which is up for a final vote on March 22, expands a  1987 ruling that allowed residential customers to block the 976 calls.  Businesses and schools have sought the option because many of their phones are  easily accessible but not constantly monitored.  </P> <P> Recorded and live messages intended for adults only would be limited to a  separate telephone prefix.  </P> <P> The commission said businesses requesting blocking before a specified cutoff  date will pay $1, but will pay $15 later. It also limited costs to no more than  $5 for the first minute and $1 for each additional minute, with a $20 maximum  charge per call.  </P> <P> Gnaizda said the change in per-minute charges was the most innovative aspect of  the PUC ruling. Pacific Bell, he said, had sought to charge $10 for the first  minute and $5 for each additional minute.  </P> <P> The largest monthly bill for 976 service known to Gnaizda was $6,000. "Many of  them (bills) were in the $5,000 to $6,000 range. So that's not surprising at  all," he said.  </P> <P> But Gnaizda was skeptical about the PUC plan to have phone companies use three  different prefixes to distinguish between services with sexually explicit  material that would be harmful to children, and to provide such messages only  by presubscription.  </P> <P> "They'll never be able to define it," he said.  </P> <P> The commission also said that introductory messages must be used to warn  callers of the price of the call and give them a chance to hang up without  charge.  </P> <P> "While this (revised settlement) does not constitute a perfect 900 service, in  our judgment it will produce a service with substantial benefit for  California," the PUC said in a statement.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to disconnect dial-a-porn," said Pacific Bell spokesman Jim  Herold. "But until we have legal authority to do that, we've designed our new  900 service to solve the problems some consumers have had with 976."  </P></p>

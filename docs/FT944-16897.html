			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro plans more cuts Ontario Hydro, a Canadian electric power utility, is considering cutting staff by at least 2,000 in 1995, on top of reductions totalling 10,500 in 1993-94. The utility said its projected CDollars 700m (USDollars 522.3m) profit for 1994 and estimated results for 1995 to 1997 fall short of its debt service and repayment commitments, intensifying cost reduction pressures. The cuts will fall most heavily on the nuclear power division.</p>

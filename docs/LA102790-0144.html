			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS PHASE-OUT OF NOISY OLD PLANES  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators agreed in last-minute discussions Friday to  require the federal government to phase out flights of noisy older aircraft and  dampen the racket in the skies over the nation's airports by the turn of the  century.  </P> <P> The accord, expected to receive final congressional approval today, will allow  Los Angeles International Airport, Orange County's John Wayne Airport and other  regional airports to retain existing local noise controls and possibly to  impose new ones.  </P> <P> The conference committee agreement would also allow local airport officials to  levy a "head tax" of up to $12 per round trip to pay for expansion or  construction projects. The so-called passenger facility charges are expected to  generate as much as $1 billion nationally every year for airport improvements.  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner hailed the compromise bill, saying  it "represents the strategic vision this country needs to boost our economy and  meet consumer demand in the 1990s and into the 21st Century."  </P> <P> Both the noise policy and the passenger charges were key parts of the  Administration's legislative agenda, as outlined in Skinner's national  transportation policy last spring. The compromise agreement, which will be  folded into the broad federal budget package scheduled for final action today,  brings to a close a week of talks between Senate and House negotiators on  legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> Under the compromise, the government will be required to develop a federal  noise policy that would force out older and noisier "Stage 2" aircraft by Dec.  31, 1999. About 2,000 of the nation's airplanes are classified as Stage 2,  which denotes a second-generation plane with engines that are noisier than more  recently developed Stage 3 planes.  </P> <P> The anti-noise policy would permit the Transportation Department to review --  and apparently accept or reject, at its discretion -- future local restrictions  on Stage 3 aircraft.  </P> <P> In recent years, regional airport officials have imposed varying restrictions  governing Stage 2 aircraft noise in their communities. Those local policies  have become a recent source of irritation between federal and local aviation  authorities.  </P> <P> Federal officials and airline carriers have said that the "patchwork" of local  noise policies has made it difficult to manage the national air transit  network.  </P> <P> The compromise would allow existing noise ordinances at local airports to  remain in place under a grandfather clause included in the legislation.  Officials from LAX and John Wayne have lobbied lawmakers not to do away with  their noise policies.  </P> <P> The agreement would also allow local officials to impose new restrictions on  Stage 2 planes, although it would require them to provide the FAA with 180 days  advance notice.  </P> <P> The agreement would require that the fleets of the nation's carriers must be  85% Stage 3 planes by July 1, 1999, and 100% by the end of the century.  </P> <P> The provision of the legislation authorizing passenger facility charges will  change existing federal law, which prohibits airport officials from collecting  a passenger tax to finance local construction projects.  </P></p>

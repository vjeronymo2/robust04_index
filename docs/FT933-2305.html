			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK urges 'Trinidad terms' BRITISH officials said Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, would use his first visit to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank later this month to call on industrialised countries to adopt the 'Trinidad terms' for reducing the official debt of the poorest developing countries. The scheme was first put forward by Mr John Major when he was chancellor three years ago. The Trinidad terms envisage that the stock of official debt owed to western governments by poor developing nations carrying out market-oriented economic reform programmes should be reduced by two- thirds. An important aspect of the terms, which were designed mainly to help African countries, is that the reduction should apply to the entire stock of official debt rather than to selected maturities. Mr Major and Treasury ministers have been campaigning this year for the general adoption of the Trinidad terms by all big industrialised countries. The US has dropped its objections to the scheme since President Bill Clinton entered the White House.</p>

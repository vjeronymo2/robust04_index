			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Clinton's viewpoint A WEEK from now Mr Bill Clinton will be president of the US. Whether his elevation represents the decisive break with the free-market economics of his two predecessors is, as yet, far from clear. What is clear, however, is the change he represents in attitudes to government itself. Unlike Mr Reagan or Mr Bush, Mr Clinton believes in it passionately. What is more, as a Democrat facing a Democratic Congress, he has the capacity to act on that belief. Yet to govern is to choose. Mr Clinton will have to make his choices soon. The new president wants to achieve the economic regeneration of the US. Yet Mr Michael Boskin, outgoing chairman of the council of economic advisers, argues in his annual Economic Report of the President that the US is not in economic decline relative to most other advanced industrial countries. He is right. Of industrial countries, only Japan's overall economic performance has been notably better over the long term. Mr Boskin is not a pseudonym for Dr Pangloss. He admits the 'deplorable' quality of secondary education, an excessively costly healthcare system that fails to insure many Americans, and continuing high levels of poverty. It is to Mr Clinton's credit that these are the main items on his agenda. Unfortunately for him, some of these problems - the poor quality of secondary education, for example - may be beyond the power of even the most determined president to remedy. Meanwhile, those that might be remediable - incomplete health insurance, for example - are likely to add a huge burden to a budget already drowning in red ink. The more Mr Clinton chooses to increase public spending, the less he will be able to reduce the yawning fiscal deficit. That is no trivial matter, however, since the fiscal deficit is the single most important remediable cause for the low US rate of capital accumulation. Strongest economy To make the new administration's dilemma worse, Mr Richard Darman, the outgoing budget director, admitted last week that the US fiscal deficit was more likely to widen than narrow, on unchanged policies. In view of Mr Clinton's ambitions for public spending, his promise to cut the budget deficit in half in his first term is likely to suffer the same fate as similar promises from his predecessor. Fortunately for the new president, what he inherits is not in all respects as unhealthy as the fiscal arithmetic. The US economy is virtually certain to be the strongest in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries this year. A relatively strong US economy, combined with dismal performance almost everywhere else, is the opposite of what the hapless Mr Nicholas Brady had to face throughout his term of office. It will help give Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Mr Clinton's nominee as US Treasury secretary, the platform from which to 'reassert leadership in the G7', as he desires. Mr Bentsen may even find himself pushing, if not on an open door - the Bundesbank's never is, where expansionary policies are concerned, at least on one that is not locked and bolted. It is encouraging, moreover, that so senior a figure in the forthcoming administration recognises the importance of active international engagement. Mr Clinton's domestic agenda was, it once seemed, likely to crowd out international concerns. Perhaps that danger has been overstated. Religious attachment The fundamental question is not whether the US should be engaged, but how. What, in particular, should it try to do in the G7? It must not repeat past experiments with exchange rate co-ordination. The monetary effects of those attempts were probably the most important single cause of Japan's bubble economy and its aftermath, which also explains the Bank of Japan's unwillingness to pursue expansionary monetary policies today. There is little more chance of achieving exchange rate co-ordination with the principal European economies. Given the almost religious attachment to fixed exchange rates of so many of them, this may be surprising. The exception, however, is Germany and it alone is in a position to bind the European currencies to the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Nevertheless, economic pressures ensure that Germany will move still further towards expansionary policies. The Bundesbank may well move fast enough to save what is left of the ERM. Even so, the Bundesbank's movement remains too slow for the German government. This continued inability of the German government to co-ordinate with the German central bank makes talk of international co-ordination seem rather ambitious. But some things must be attempted. Two items, in particular, should be on the top of the agenda: greater help for reform in the former Soviet Union and completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Mr Clinton cannot escape these responsibilities. There can be no purely domestic US presidency and no lasting domestic success without an effective international engagement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Although he has not joined any political party since  he left the PRN [National Reconstruction Party] in 1992,  President Itamar Franco has made up his mind to participate in  this year's elections. He has already told some of his friends  that, being a politician, he does not plan to remain aloof from  the race. According to the president "this is part of the  presidential system and democracy."    On the last day of Carnival, Franco said that "should"  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso become a candidate,  he, Franco, would support him. Although his statements to this  effect have prompted negative reactions, the president insists  that the finance minister is the ideal candidate. He does  emphasize, however, that he will give Cardoso his explicit  support only after the latter makes up his mind to run for  president. People who are close to the president have said that  Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho could be the  president's second choice.    Franco, who has been in politics for more than 30 years and  is one of the founders of the MDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement], is also planning to influence the elections in Minas  Gerais State. To this end he has been holding frequent talks  with Governor Helio Garcia. An old local politician who is  close to both the president and the governor has said: "Minas  Gerais will set an example of unity."    Last week, Deputy Israel Pinheiro Filho (PRS) [Social Reform  Party] -- who is also from Minas Gerais -- was running around  Congress pushing yet another proposal: to get dissatisfied  members of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and  the PFL [Liberal Front Party] to join forces with the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] to support one candidate on  whom they could all agree. He believes that this group could  establish a new party which the president could join. This,  however, is not in Franco's plans. He believes that being  nonpartisan he is free to support any candidate he wants.    Time and again Cardoso's name crops up as Planalto Palace's  ideal candidate. The reason is simple enough: Even those who,  until recently, looked upon his good standing with the president  with rabid envy, now consider him a magician. The main cause  for the mixed feeling of awe and admiration is the fact that the  people do not hold the minister directly responsible for the  high inflation.    One of Franco's friends wondered: "How can a man under whose  management inflation is as high as it is now walk the streets of  Rio de Janeiro and be cheered?" He added: "This means that  whether he wants it or not, he is a prime candidate. Therefore,  why shouldn't he have the president's support?"    Six months ago Franco did not display the enthusiasm and  willingness to participate in the elections that he now has. He  was dispirited, overwhelmed by too many problems, and counting  the days left before he could step down. Now, as he has said  himself, he has returned to Brasilia "reinvigorated" after the  Carnival celebrations.    After a survey of his administration which will be released  in the course of an advertising campaign called "The  Administration Puts the House in Order," Franco has been in a  good mood, and is determined to stand up more for his  administration, be it during trips to inaugurate projects or at  Government House. According to high-ranking government  officials, this could give Franco the credentials he needs to  influence his own succession.</p>

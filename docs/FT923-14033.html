			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Irish president raises issue of neutrality PRESIDENT Mary Robinson of Ireland yesterday urged an open and honest debate on the country's long-standing policy of neutrality. During a rare address to the two houses of parliament, she emphasised the importance of European union for Ireland's future. 'We are a country which has held on principle to a policy of non-involvement in military alliances; yet we have a proper sense of responsibility to our partners. How do we balance these things? We need to debate this honestly, aware that the balance we strike and the approach we take can be both constructive and exemplary,' she said. Irish opponents of the Maastricht treaty fear it will lead to Irish troops being sent abroad in aggressive as opposed to UN peacekeeping roles.</p>

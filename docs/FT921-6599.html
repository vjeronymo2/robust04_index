			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / BTR chief defends corporate leadership THE BANK of England and the Institutional Shareholders' Committee were 'doing a disservice to investors by encouraging them to think of themselves as owners' according to Sir Owen Green, chairman of the conglomerate BTR, yesterday. Speaking at the annual investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Eastbourne, he robustly attacked institutional investors' attitudes to corporate governance. Debating with Mr Mike Sandland, chairman of the ISC, he denounced concepts such as audit committees and independent non-executive directors. 'The word independence sticks in my gullet,' said Sir Owen, whose company has been one of the most successful in Britain over the past 20 years. 'I don't think there is very much wrong with corporate governance as it stands,' he said. There might be a problem with institutional investors growing so large that they could not easily sell investments in companies they did not like, but that, he said, was a fiscal problem rather than one of corporate governance. Mr Sandland, an investment manager with Norwich Union, said shareholders should assume the responsibilities of ownership. Institutional investors should show their commitment by registering votes and playing a full role as active shareholders. Sir Owen said shareholders would be better regarded as freeholder landlords than owners of public companies. 'It is different in concept from the ownership of goods and chattels,' he insisted. In one respect, however, Sir Owen supported in principle a recent pronouncement of the ISC, which represents the view of various kinds of institutions including pension funds. He agreed that the chairman of a company should not be the chief executive as well. Even here, however, he suggested that the ISC had 'copped out'. Too many important people had influenced the ISC, which continued reluctantly to accept the combination of the two roles subject to safeguards and conditions. 'It ought to be stopped tomorrow,' Sir Owen said.</p>

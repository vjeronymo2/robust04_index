The 22-week course was completed in record time so the  officers could be in South Africa in time for the April  elections, the ZIANA news agency reported on Thursday [24  March]. The initial four-week phase equipped army officers with  the knowledge and skills necessary for planning and supervising  live firing.    The second phase, of five weeks, equipped them with basic  knowledge of conventional warfare and the employment of platoon  weapons and other support arms within a company setting. They  were also provided with practical experience in the handling of  a platoon in the field.    A third phase covered aspects of counter-insurgency and  military law.    Reviewing officer Maj-Gen Philip Sibanda said Wednesday's  graduation ceremony was a milestone in the history of the  African sub-continent because the Zimbabwean Army had trained  officers from the African National Congress and Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] simultaneously.    The officers and others who were being trained elsewhere in  Zimbabwe would form the nucleus of South Africa's post-apartheid  defence force. The officers are due to return to South Africa  on Saturday.</p>

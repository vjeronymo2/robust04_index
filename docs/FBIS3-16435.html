			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow March 16 BUSINESS-TASS -- Russia's giant  natural gas supplier Gasprom thinks that a new reduction of gas  deliveries to Ukraine are "quite likely" in early April.    The thing is that Gasprom's European partners get less than  their due because Ukraine "draws away" some of the gas during  its transit via Ukrainian territory, sources in Gasprom told  ITAR-TASS today.    The pressure of gas in the pipelines leading to Western  Europe and particularly to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey is lower  than designed although Gasprom has resumed feeding as much gas  as agreed and more into the pipeline - 470 million cubic meters  a day. The extra deliveries are designed to compensate Ukraine  for the termination of natural gas deliveries from Turkmenistan  (80 million cubic meters a day).    Ukraine has failed to conform to one of the most important  articles of the agreement reached between the Ukrainian  governmental delegation and the Gasprom leadership.    Under the agreement, Gasprom resumed the deliveries of the  stipulated amount of gas until April 10 pending termination of  Ukraine's unlicensed use of natural gas from the export pipeline  passing through Ukraine. Ukraine also promised to work out a  specific mechanism of repaying its debt for the supplies of gas  to Ukraine in 1993-1994 and to begin to pay off the debts.    Other articles of the agreement also have yet to be  fulfilled. Ukraine has remitted less than a fraction of one  percent of its 1.5 trillion arrears to the Gasprom account, and  according to Russian experts, its financial potential is  well-nigh exhausted.    There is one way of offsetting Ukraine's indebtedness to  Russia - through the switch to joint ownership of the  underground gas storage facilities and main gas pipelines on the  Ukrainian territory, according to Gasprom. Regrettably, the  agreement in principle on this reached during the negotiations  in Moscow has met with no support on the part of the Ukrainian  leadership.</p>

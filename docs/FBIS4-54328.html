			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter An Hui-chang] </F>   [Text] The government on 26 May reconfirmed the position  that the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  should be observed and decided to resolutely deal with it if  North Korea ignores our efforts for the implementation of this  declaration.    The government decided this at a meeting of the Unification  and Security Policy Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister of National Unification Board [NUB]  Yi Hong- ku held on 26 May.    Kim Hyong-ki, an NUB spokesman, said, "The participants in  the meeting agreed that if North Korea refuses to clear away the  suspicion of its nuclear development and continues to enforce  the nuclear program, our efforts to abide by the  denuclearization declaration will meet with grave challenge."    The meeting noted that North Korea is persistently pushing  ahead with its scheme to reach a package solution to its nuclear  issue linking it with the establishment of diplomatic relations  with the United States and the signing of a peace agreement.  The meeting made it clear that the issue of replacing the  Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be discussed  between the North and the South along with the issue of  political and military confidence- building between the North  and the South. The government also reconfirmed its policy that  it will continue to link the nuclear issue and the economic  cooperation for the time being.</p>

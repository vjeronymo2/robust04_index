(Doggone, Mary J, Brooks, Nancy A., 1985). Over 3,000,000 women of childbearing age in the United States have some type of disability. Many women with physical disabilities have been discouraged by their families, friends, and health providers from considering the option of parenthood. Until very recently, women with many types of physical disabilities have not been encouraged or facilitated in exercising that option by health care providers and others. Medical professionals have often discouraged pregnancy for women with physical disabilities because of the limited understanding of the effect of bodily changes during pregnancy, labor, and delivery on existing impairments. This priority addresses reproductive issues confronted specifically by women with physical disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some aspects of women's health maintenance that are an ordinary part of life for most women pose significant problems for women with physical disabilities. Dependent upon the type of disability, fertility may be unaffected but pregnancy may be an increased risk and require high-risk management; genetic counseling may be suggested; symptoms of chronic disease or impairment may or may not be exacerbated; delivery may be difficult; and urinary infections, decubitus ulcers, and autonomic hyperreflexia during labor and delivery may be present. (Asrael, W., Huberman, B.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NAACOG Update Series <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 5, Lesson 11, 1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Women with physical disabilities often require specialized obstetrical attention for a number of possible concerns. The interaction of drugs may have a more severe impact on their systems, such as the canceling effect of antiseizure medications and oral contraceptives, or the multiplying effect of antispasmodics on other drugs with depressive side effects. There has been little research on the long-term effects of oral contraceptives and other hormonal treatments for women who lead sedentary existences and who often have compromised circulatory systems. (Nosek, M.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Journal of Women's Health <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 1, No. 4, 1992). Concerns revolve around the ability to conceive, the special problems and risks if any, during pregnancy, the impact on the disability itself, and the methods of delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elaine Carty and Tali Conine, ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rehabilitation Nursing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 13, No. 2, 1988), looked at six important areas of stress that pregnant women with physical disabilities experience. Three are role related: accepting the new role of childbearing and the impending responsibilities of parenthood, accepting extra nurturing and assuming a more dependent role, and dealing with fatigue and limitations on activity in the perinatal period. Psychosocial issues cannot be separated from the woman's general well-being.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

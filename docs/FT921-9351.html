			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Observer: Running out of road When any industry goes through a difficult period, it is inevitable that the changing of the guard is done at the double. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Britain's construction industry. In many ways Sir Eric Pountain, the man who transformed Tarmac into one of Britain's biggest construction companies, personifies the changeover. Like Wimpey's Sir Clifford Chetwood, and Bobby McAlpine of Alfred McAlpine, Pountain is preparing to hand over the management reins to a much younger generation. Neville Simms, Tarmac's new group chief executive, is just 47. Nevertheless, there is a feeling that despite the present chairman's considerable contribution to Tarmac over the years, he should have handed over earlier. Pountain is a bit like former Burton boss Sir Ralph Halpern. He was very good at his job at first, but didn't know when to stop. As a housing man, he drove Tarmac's profits ever higher on the back of Mrs Thatcher's 1980's housing boom. This led to an over-investment in land at inflated prices and Tarmac is now sufferring the hangover. The other strategic error was to over-expand in the US when other competitors, such as Redland and RMC, were expanding into Europe. There is an element of luck in all business decisions, but in 'Our Eric's' case there is a sense that, despite being the Midlands' most celebrated businessman, he lived too long on his past reputation.</p>

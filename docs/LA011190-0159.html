			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY;  </P> <P> HOTEL TAX HIKE OPPOSED  </P> <P> A plan to boost the hotel room tax from 10% to 12% in unincorporated areas of  Los Angeles County was opposed Wednesday by a Marina del Rey hotel owner and  local chamber of commerce officials who warned that the increase would be bad  for business.  </P> <P> Abraham M. Lurie, president of a partnership that owns the Marina Beach, Marina  del Rey and Marina International hotels, told a county Small Craft Harbor  Commission meeting that a portion of the hotel tax revenue should be used to  promote tourism at the marina.  </P> <P> The lack of promotion has hurt occupancy at his hotels, he said.  </P> <P> Lurie told the commissioners that his two largest marina hotels continue to  suffer substantial losses. He urged the commission, an advisory group to the  Board of Supervisors, to support state legislation to create a pilot program  that would divert some hotel tax revenues to marina tourism. Lurie argued that  filling more hotel rooms would generate additional funds for the county from  hotels, restaurants and retail sales.  </P> <P> After Lurie's testimony, the commissioners delayed action for one month on a  recommendation to the supervisors.  </P> <P> The supervisors recently approved the 20% increase in the transient occupancy  tax, but final action was postponed until Wednesday's public hearing.  </P> <P> The tax increase would bring the county hotel tax to the 12% level charged by  the surrounding cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Culver City. It would  generate an estimated additional $300,000 a year for the county.  </P></p>

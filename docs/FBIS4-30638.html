The session has returned the  draft law on property in land for further elaboration to the  standing committee on protection of nature and environment. As  the newspaper informs, the SGH session has adopted a resolution  on measures connected with making additions and amendments in  the law on administrative-territorial units and their governing.    The newspaper publishes an information about staying in the  country of the parliament delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  headed by the president of the Senate M. Ruchupan. As the  newspaper informs, the parliament delegation of Thailand held  negotiations with the chairman of the State Great Hural N.  Bagabandi on the issues of mutual cooperation of parliaments of  the two countries.    The newspaper carries recommendations of the second national  conference "For Normal Childbirth". The conference was  organized by the Ministry of Health jointly with the UN Fund for  Population Activities and the World Health Organization. The  recommendations concern creation of conditions for normal  childbirth of pregnant women, protection of health of newly-born  child, family planning.    On the eve of the national holiday Naadam, which according  to the tradition is celebrated in the days of celebration of  the anniversary of the people's revolution of 1921, the  newspaper publishes an interview with the well-known wrestlers  P. Sukhbat, T. Bayarsaihan, holders of the title "Elephant".  The most probable winner of the coming national wrestling  tournament, as they consider, is "Giant" B. Baterdene, who is a  constant winner of the biggest tournaments of the last years.  The newspaper notes that in 1994 68 wrestlers will participate  in the national wrestling tournament.    The Mongolian trade union newspaper "HODOLMOR" devotes its  last issue to the best publications of Mongolian and foreign  press. The newspaper publishes a material of journalist G.  Jamyanbn, which was published earlier in the newspaper of the  Mongolian capital "ULAANBAATAR". In this article the journalist  writes about changes and reforms taken place in the country  since March 1990. In the journalist's view many  representatives of the former authoritative regime have  preserved their positions or have taken the opportunity to  become rich during privatization of property. As the  journalist considers, also representatives of democratic forces  are doing the same.    The newspaper republishes an article from the Belgian  newspaper "AM-WOOB". The author of the publication German  journalist Z. Waife shares his impressions about his colleagues  who studied in their [word indistinct] the Moscow High Party  School, in particular, about the Mongolian journalist L.  Purevdorj. Holding earlier high posts at the Defence Ministry  and getting the rank of general, now he has become the  Democratic Party member, notes the German journalist. In his  view, L. Purevdorj should not be blamed for quitting the  Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, what has become an  ordinary thing in the former so called socialist countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Kravchuk received today (Percy  Barnevick), chief executive officer of ABB, a multinational  concern. (Mr. Barnevick) came to Ukraine for the first time.  The purpose of his visit is to expand cooperation with our  country, first of all in the sphere of nuclear engineering.  This cooperation was initiated last year, during President  Kravchuk's visit to Switzerland. What can it bring for us?  President Kravchuk and Mr. Barnevick talked about this with the  journalists after their meeting.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] After we signed the tripartite  agreement and the Supreme Council ratified START I and Article 5  of the Lisbon Protocol, the world's attitude toward Ukraine  changed for the better. Last week, I had a telephone  conversations with Bill Clinton, Mitterand, Kohl; and all of  them, with no exception [words indistinct] heads of the state  and governments said that the question is not whether assistance  should be extended, but that it should be applied to specific  programs. So, the task is to come up with specific programs.  All those conversations had a common point: Our countries are  ready to give you aid, but it is up to you to support your  programs regarding their technical, technological, or legal  aspects, and then submit them to those countries and the World  Bank. So, ABB has a priority in this area, because we have been  working with this concern for more than a year. I met with its  president in Zurich last year in Switzerland. Since that time,  we have been concentrating on the problems facing Ukraine. The  concern has concrete proposals. They also include establishing  an investment fund in nuclear engineering, and the Ukrainian  engineering in general. The issue of hard currency investments  is very important for us. Thus, the task of freeing Ukraine  from dependency on energy is a leading priority. Another  priority is agriculture. One should act very quickly here, but  equipped with programs so that we could see things in  perspective. To sum it up, I would like to say that such a  powerful company as ABB can do very much for Ukraine. Following  today's meeting, I am convinced that specific plans, programs,  and intentions are on hand. [end recording]    [Ukrainian translation of Barnevick's words] I think that  improvement of reliability at nuclear power plants is one of the  prime tasks, because nuclear plants will help reduce dependency  on oil and natural gas. This was the topic of our conversation  with the Ukrainian president. We were discussing not only the  technical side of this issue, but also the possibility of  creating a special investment fund. We have some experience  acquired by the first joint venture. Now, we are considering  setting up several more similar ventures in Ukraine. Ukraine is  one of the countries where we could do a lot.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander </F> of the Northern Command, by Arye Kiesel; date and place not  given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mordekhay] Hizballah is  not an invincible enemy. It must be understood that the terrain  is hilly. Hizballah men come out of the villages on roads we  are not watching. They cross mountains, river beds, rocks, and  come within dozens of meters of our troops. They make use of  the poor visibility and rough terrain, and the result on our end  is painful. We have a problem with pinpointing intelligence on  them, and we do not always have answers or information when they  go on an operation, from where, and their goals.    [Kiesel] Does that mean that we will have to live with the  harsh reality of having victims?    [Mordekhay] No. Their method of operation presents a  difficulty. This is a type of guerrilla that comes out of areas  that are not under our control, from civilian terrain of which  they make full use. We will find ways and methods to hurt them.  Last year, we carried out thousands of operations that proved  themselves.    We are dealing with 130 km of a very hilly border. It is not  all that simple. Hizballah does not have any bases or training  sites. They work out of mosques and from inside a civilian  population that is often held hostage. We cannot harm the  population, but we will find ways to hurt Hizballah.    Compared with events in the security zone, one must remember  that the northern settlements live in full security. Not a  single Katyusha has been fired at the north since July.  Furthermore, all attempts by terror squads to reach the border  fence or get near it have been thwarted.    Last year was very painful for Hizballah. They suffered 126  fatalities from our activity -- the highest figure ever -- and  there are certainly more fatalities and casualties we do not  know of.    [Kiesel] Is a war being waged in south Lebanon?    [Mordekhay] I never said that. There is a confrontation,  there are battles, clashes, and exchanges of fire. I do not  call this war. Anyone who wants to extend the definition of war  or call it that is welcome to do so. War has certain  characteristics which are not present here. In the security  zone, we are constantly dealing with the situation.    [Kiesel] The deputy chief of staff called it war.    [Mordekhay] I know what the chief of staff and his deputy  mean. They do not mean war in the broad sense of the word,  where both parties employ their full forces; we certainly do  not. There are exchanges of fire, clashes, and casualties.  There are daily incidents. In a war you use all the means  available to win.    [Kiesel] Does last week's incident in which four soldiers  were killed and five injured in a Hizballah ambush indicate an  escalation?    [Mordekhay] There has been a significant escalation in  Hizballah activity over the past two weeks. They have been  planting bombs and shooting antitank and Sagger missiles. The  political process has an impact on Hizballah. It fears that the  process with Syria is making progress, and that this would  reduce their freedom of operation in the future, hence they are  trying to demonstrate their force. When their activity dropped,  they encountered pressure to resume activity. Also, without  doubt, they are seriously influenced by the unprecedented scope  of their recent arms and equipment procurements.    [Kiesel] Does the equipment come from Iran?    [Mordekhay] Absolutely. Iran sent dozens of Sagger missiles  and hundreds of mortar bombs, as well as many other means,  backing, money, guidance, and training, which led to a  significant escalation.    [Kiesel] Does this mean that they have surprisingly  recovered from Operation Accountability?    [Mordekhay] Absolutely. They suffered more than 100  fatalities last year, but they filled out the ranks with new  recruits. A vacuum was created after Operation Accountability.  Lebanese residents called on the government to send in the army  to help. The Lebanese Government tried to send in a battalion,  but the Syrians prevented it from taking steps against  Hizballah. As a result, Hizballah gained strength, started  rebuilding itself, and -- enjoying an incredible cash flow from  Iran -- in fact, strengthened its hold in the villages. Until  Syria allows the Lebanese Government to deploy its Army freely  in south Lebanon, Hizballah will have a good time.    [Kiesel] How deep is Hizballah-Iran cooperation?    [Mordekhay] Very deep and very tight. We know they are  exchanging information, training, and advice. The Hizballah  leadership travels to Iran for guidance, explanations, and  ideas. They do not go there for vacation or to visit massage  parlors, but to be trained.    [Kiesel] Your description indicates that the terror attacks  cannot be prevented.    [Mordekhay] They can be reduced, but not totally eliminated.  Our activity, in most cases, aims to reduce their freedom of  operation and make them pay a price before they reach their  goal, before leaving a base, or during contact with them. In  the vast majority of the incidents we do manage to hit them from  a distance.    [Kiesel] Why is the Air Force not employed to prevent  ambushes such as happened last week?    [Mordekhay] The Air Force has its limitations, it cannot  discover such ambushes. We use Air Force assault helicopters  against specific targets. I do not believe, however, that the  Air Force can significantly change the state of affairs here.    [Kiesel] Do you not feel that in fighting Hizballah the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] has its hands tied for fear a  retaliation of katyushas could be fired at the northern  settlements?    [Mordekhay] Absolutely not. No one has tied our hands. The  political guidance we receive is very clear to us. We are  serious people. We do consider the implications of our activity  on the settlements of the north. We saw what happened when the  situation deteriorated and they were hurt. [passage omitted]    [Kiesel] Do you believe that, once we reach agreement with  them, the Syrians will curb Hizballah and discipline them?    [Mordekhay] I have no doubt about this. If Syria used its  influence, it could significantly reduce the Hizballah military  operability. It could stop the transfer of means to them. It  could allow the Lebanese Army to deploy there. The Lebanese  Army has done that throughout Lebanon, but has not lifted a  finger in the areas adjacent to the security zone.    Syria is a key player. Syria acting the innocent last week  and saying that it does not take part in Hizballah activity is  not acceptable to us. Acting naive like this is unbecoming of a  rattlesnake, not even one that breeds in Damascus. Had it  wanted to, Syria could curb and significantly stop Hizballah.  It is a question of a Syrian decision. If they wanted, the  Lebanese Army could be stationed there, and it could cooperate  with the IDF in dealing with Hizballah, removing them from the  villages, and closing down the military supply routes from Iran.    [Kiesel] Do you know for certain of a terror act that the  Syrians knew of in advance?    [Mordekhay] We cannot establish a direct link between a  Syrian order or instruction and a terror act; the connection is  merely circumstantial. Yet, Hizballah would like to fire  katyushas at Israel, but it does not dare because it understands  there are agreements which should not be deviated from. What  reason did they have to abstain from activity for 10 days during  the Clinton-al-Asad summit? These were the quietest days I can  recall. There is a hand that guides Hizballah, and it comes  from Syria.    [Kiesel] Do you believe al-Asad aims for peace?    [Mordekhay] Al-Asad understands the international and Middle  Eastern strategic situation. At the same time, al-Asad has in  no way dropped the military option. Along with conducting the  political process, the Syrian military buildup continues. I  believe al-Asad wants to attain Syrian interests and national  goals in peaceful ways. If he fails, all options are open.    [Kiesel] The Intelligence Branch appreciates that he wants  peace. Major General 'Uzi Dayan, however, said that if the  political process gets stuck, a limited military operation is to  be expected in 1994. What do you think?    [Mordekhay] I would not put a time frame on this, not even  in terms of years. A process starts and no one knows when it  will end or where it will lead. It must be understood that the  other option -- the military option -- exists on the level of  the ability in the field and on the conceptual level. When will  it be used? When someone feels there is no other way.    [Kiesel] Do you mean that you do not rule out a Syrian  military move, should all other options fail?    [Mordekhay] Our working assumption should be very clear:  Syria is able to do it. The question is when. Knowing the IDF  and Northern Command's power, I would urge him to think twice  before making a move of a military nature. I believe he is  aware of this. We have the power, and we have proved we will use  it against anyone who tries to put our existence at risk.    [Kiesel] Has the Northern Command been asked to prepare  withdrawal or redeployment plans for the Golan Heights?    [Mordekhay] No. No one in the command, including myself, is  engaged in any plans that have political bearings. All of the  plans I deal with, all the preparations, are within the scope of  providing an answer in case someone does something, God forbid.  Nothing else is happening in the Northern Command.    [Kiesel] If Syria means peace, would you recommend getting  off the Golan Heights?    [Mordekhay] This is a political issue. I believe a military  man should not, and must not, comment on such issues. When the  Israeli Government has thoughts and potential scenarios, it will  apparently present them to the people in charge of the Army and  the territory in the command. We will present our assessments  then. The problem is that the Golan Heights is too small for  waging a modern war and reducing damage. If the threat is  eliminated, or if there is another threat, we will have to  examine the meaning and make political decisions. [passage  omitted]</p>

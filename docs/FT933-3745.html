			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Travel: The other face of the mystic orient - South-east Asia / Victor Mallet rides the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express SOMEONE has to say it. South-east Asia in the 1990s is about as exotic and mysterious as Margate in winter, writes Victor Mallet. This became clear to me as I approached the inner sanctum of the ancient temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I was ready to be awe-struck. I was not ready for the electronic burbling noises: a Khmer woman seated on a wall was concentrating ferociously as she played her hand-held 'Game Boy.' Over in Borneo, my climb to the top of Mt Kinabalu, the highest mountain in south-east Asia, was marred by the unwanted company of two coachloads of Koreans. It is hardly surprising that the Kinabalu friendly warbler which hopped about happily at the feet of the first climbers in the middle of the last century is now not very friendly and rarely seen. My certificate suggests that I am at least the 72,406th person to have reached the peak. In south-east Asia, people spend much of their time buying things in shopping malls, sitting in traffic jams and watching soap operas on television. Forests are cut down to make way for condominiums. Hills are demolished and taken away to be used as cement for motorways and skyscrapers. So you can ignore all the obligatory guff about (I quote) 'the exotic and mysterious east' in the brochures published by the new Eastern &amp; Oriental Express train company. Thailand may be 'a land of water lilies, bright green rice fields and swaying palm trees,' but it is also a country of polluted rivers, urban sprawl and probably the ugliest capital city in the world. As for the southern town of Hat Yai - 'a commercial centre known for its naughty night-life' - it is a concrete jungle full of seedy brothels for visiting Malaysians. Not that south-east Asia is dull; nor is it uniform. In the course of a 42-hour, 1,943-kilometre journey up the Malayan peninsula, the E &amp; O can transport you in great luxury from order to chaos - from Singapore, in other words, to Bangkok by way of Kuala Lumpur. Each of the three countries on the route is undergoing an economic boom. But each has chosen to handle its good fortune in a different way. Singapore believes in discipline and control. Everything works. The airport functions so smoothly, and passengers are whisked away so promptly, that you wonder where everybody is when you first fly in. Chewing gum is banned because it is messy and it used to interfere with the closing of the doors on the subway trains. Citizens are urged in government advertising campaigns to be polite, flush the toilets and have more babies. They generally obey. Managers of high-rise hotels forbid you to open the window of your room. Information is restricted. Thailand is the opposite. It is undisciplined and chaotic. Traffic jams are so nightmarish that the government advised people last year to carry provisions and portable toilets in their cars. There are hundreds of laws, but few people obey them. Prostitution is illegal and even the mildest love scenes are censored at the movies. But you can walk out of the cinema into a brothel owned by the police, or participate (if you wish) in a live sex show. Armed with this information, you can settle down in the bar of the E &amp; O express with a beer - or a Dollars 180 bottle of Dom Perignon - and engage in the debate that often dominates expatriate conversations in south-east Asia: which is better, Bangkok or Singapore? The arguments can be passionate. Residents of Singapore are torn between praising the island's convenience and cleanliness on the one hand, and claiming, on the other, that it is much more interesting than it seems. In support of the latter line of thought, a commodity broker once told me how his boss, visiting from London, died in his hotel room after being drugged and robbed by a transvestite prostitute. Bangkok loyalists are equally ambivalent. They abhor the pollution and corruption of Thailand, but regard Singapore as impossibly humourless and sterile, a sort of shiny Swiss hospital parked in the tropics. (Kuala Lumpur, psychologically as well as geographically, comes somewhere in between). What all of south-east Asia has in common is the urge to make money. The leisurely, nostalgic journey on the E &amp; O, with its wood-panelled interior inspired by the 1932 film Shanghai Express, is aimed more at the visitor than at local tycoons. Among those who most enjoyed the trip I took were a wealthy tourist couple from New Zealand and a pair of Surbiton teachers on honeymoon. Meanwhile, the managing director of a Thai company had a habit of rushing to the observation car at the back of the train with his short-wave radio to find out the yen/dollar rate. Fun for some, perhaps, but hardly exotic. Victor Mallet was a guest of Eastern &amp; Oriental Express, a sister of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. Address: Sea Containers House, 20 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PF, tel: (071)-928-6000, fax: (071)-620-1210. The train travels each way between Singapore and Bangkok once a week. Passengers can board or alight at other main stations on the way. Excursions are also planned to places such as Malacca in Malaysia and Kanchanaburi, the site of the Death Railway's bridge over the river Kwai in Thailand. Fares start at Pounds 740 per person for a sleeping compartment and meals one way between Singapore and Bangkok. Single occupancy supplement: Pounds 370 for sleeping compartments. State compartments cost Pounds 1,020 per person (single supp Pounds 510).</p>

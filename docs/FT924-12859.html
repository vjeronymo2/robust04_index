			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Terry Smith to join Collins Stewart MR Terry Smith, the analyst embroiled in a legal dispute with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew over the publication of a book on UK company accounts, is today joining one of London's youngest stockbroking firms, Collins Stewart. He will be joined by his longstanding colleague, Mr David Pountney, who resigned on Friday from his job at P&amp;D as analyst of merchant banks and financial companies. Last Thursday, Mr Smith's final appeal against dismissal from his job as head of UK research at P&amp;D, owned by Union Bank of Switzerland, was turned down. 'I have now been formally sacked', he said. Collins Stewart is 51 per cent owned by the merchant bank, Singer &amp; Friedlander, with the remaining shares held by its four founders, led by Mr Leigh Collins and Mr Andrew Stewart. Mr Smith's dispute with P&amp;D reinforced worries that the creation of integrated financial houses, combining stockbroking and merchant banking, had threatened analysts' independence. 'I am joining Collins Stewart in part because there should be fewer conflicts of interest', Mr Smith said. The firm is primarily an agency stockbroker. Set up on May 1, 1991, it specialises in broking UK equities. Mr Smith will once again work as an analyst of banks, having been rated the leading analyst in that sector in polls of investment institutions from 1984 to 1990.</p>

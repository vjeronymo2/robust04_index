			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS;  </P> <P> *** 1/2 CARLA BLEY "FLEUR CARNIVORE" WATT: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM ONE STAR  (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Recorded live at Copenhagen's Montmartre club in 1988, "Fleur" moves away from  Bley's recent and somewhat predictable group efforts ("Night-glo," "Sextet")  back to more ambitious territory. Here, the composer/arranger/keyboardist has  her 15-piece ensemble create backdrops -- steamy, rhythmic jungles, downtown  traffic jams heavy with horns and animated scenes of cocktail chatter -- while  alloting generous chunks of improvisational space. Though some of the solos  sound a bit belligerent for Bley's well-considered themes, good individual  efforts abound: Trumpeter Lew Soloff displays strong logic on the title cut  while Bley-mate and bassist Steve Swallow shows off melodic smarts on "Healing  Power."

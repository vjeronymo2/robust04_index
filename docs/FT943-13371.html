			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Major underlines food VAT denial The prime minister yesterday appeared to rule out an extention of valued added tax to food. For the first time Mr John Major used the word 'ever' to underline his denial that he could see no circumstances in which VAT would be extended to food. Mr Major's reply came under persistent questioning from Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader, who accused the Tories of having a 'fatal attraction' to extending the tax to other goods and services. She pressed Mr Major to say if he agreed with the view of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that 'far too many goods and services' are exempt from VAT. Mr Clarke's views on VAT were contained in a letter to one of his constituents which was leaked by Labour. Mr Major urged Mrs Beckett to examine Mr Clarke's comments in full instead of 'selectively misquoting what he said'. Pressed to name one thing on which he would never put VAT, Mr Major said he could 'conceive no circumstances ever when food would be subject to VAT'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday wrote to the prime minister asking him to 'clear up the conflicting statements' over VAT. He said: 'The chancellor said no sensible minister would give categorical assurances over extentions to VAT. 'The prime minister contradicted the chancellor when he attempted to rule out circumstances in which he would impose VAT on food - but not on newspapers, children's clothes, or bus and train fares.' Labour now plans to press Mr Major to rule out further extentions of VAT to children's clothes, newspapers, books, and rail and bus fares.</p>

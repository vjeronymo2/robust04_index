			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the union's structure. A close vote could even bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency, although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that such an outcome was unlikely. The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had 245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work in the Yorkshire area. This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial crisis. A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal structure. Mr John Walsh, agent and assistant general secretary of the Yorkshire area, dismissed in January but still in post pending an appeal, has said that he has been victimised for campaigning against the transfer, saying it will be detrimental to the union. Mr Walsh believes the union's national headquarters in Sheffield is virtually penniless. He said: 'I think it will be almost down to the reserve fund by now and that can only be used to back up the pension schemes. It has fixed assets probably of about Pounds 2m but it can't sell the building because nobody wants it.' The NUM executive has said in a letter to Yorkshire members that a merger will avoid an increase in contributions and save the area and the national union Pounds 200,000 in administrative costs alone.</p>

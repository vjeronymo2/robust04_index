			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Stocks continued their lackluster performance last week with the uncertainties  of recession, war, inflation and deflation casting ominous clouds over the  market, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San  Diego Securities.  </P> <P> San Diego stocks -- which did not participate as the Dow Jones Industrial  Average soared toward 3,000 this past summer -- are, however, joining an  overall downward trend with most selling at or near their lows for 1990.  </P> <P> A handful of stocks did manage to make good gains during the past week.  </P> <P> The largest percentage gainer of the week was Charthouse Enterprises, up 21%,  following a favorable forecast that was presented at a meeting of analysts and  money managers last week in San Francisco.  </P> <P> PS Group was up $2.25 on Monday on the announcement that Warren Buffett of  Berkshire Hathaway fame had won permission to increase his affiliate holdings  in excess of 20%. PS Group's board agreed to modify a stockholder rights  package that clears the way for the purchase.  </P> <P> Molecular Biosystems gained $.50 on Monday as it announced the submission of a  pre-marketing approval application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for  Albunex, its ultrasound imaging agent. The submission followed 2 1/2 years of  testing in the United States, Europe and Japan.  </P> <P> The week, however, had some major casualties. Intermark, a $2-billion holding  company with interests in 14 companies, made a new low of $3, down from its  1990 high of $10.75. Since its recent merger with majority-owned Triton Group  Ltd., whose shareholders received 1.4 shares of Intermark for each Triton  share, the stock has dropped from $5 to $3. The stock has now dropped 40% in  less than a month.  </P> <P> Cubic was down $.75 this past week as it announced the phasing out of  operations of its communications subsidiary in Oceanside and a layoff of up to  85 people  </P> <P> Besides Intermark, the only other new low registered was Beeba's Creations at  $5.  </P></p>

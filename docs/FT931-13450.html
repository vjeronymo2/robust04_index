			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The good, the bad, the uncertain: Hopes of recovery in the UK economy have given way to a familiar picture of mixed economic indicators Britain's chancellor of the exchequer has a way with words. Last Sunday, Mr Norman Lamont popped up on television to announce that there were 'many encouraging signs' of improvement in the UK economy. By yesterday - after news of falling retail sales in December, declining industrial output in November and the sharp jump in unemployment to just under 3m - it was beginning to look as if accident prone Mr Lamont had fallen back into the trap of seeing green shoots of recovery where none exists. The truth is, as ever, more complicated. To set against this week's gloomy data, the Treasury could point to strong car sales in December, robust growth in recent months of cash and bank notes in circulation, and a rebound in business confidence since sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Whitehall also took comfort from reports of increased house sales in December, although house prices as measured by the Halifax and Nationwide building societies continued to fall last month. Not all mortgage payers have yet benefited from the sharp 3 percentage point fall in bank base rates to 7 per cent since September because some building societies, which adjust their mortgage rates annually, have still to respond to the cut in the cost of borrowing. This could mean that a further stimulus to demand is in the pipeline, holding out the prospect of some future growth. But no amount of accentuating the positive could alter the fact that the strong hopes of a turnaround - symbolised by the rush of shoppers to the sales immediately after Christmas - had given way to the familiar pattern of mixed and usually depressing signals that has characterised the UK economy for the past two years. Economic recoveries are typically patchy. That this applies within sectors as well as across the economy was highlighted by Tuesday's distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which found that large retailers did well in December while smaller companies employing fewer than 100 did poorly. But Britain's recession has been so long and so severe that special factors may be making recent trends particularly difficult to interpret. Many economists have been puzzled about the recent strength of demand for big ticket items such as cars or durable household goods at a time of depressed demand for consumer credit, generally weak consumer confidence and rising unemployment. One explanation is that people in work have been avoiding new borrowing commitments after the traumas caused by high interest rates in the late 1980s and using their savings to buy carefully selected bargains at a discount. But Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, the City investment bank, suggests that some of the newly unemployed may also be helping to support this spending. His theory is that they are using redundancy payments and running down savings with a view to obtaining means-tested benefits such as the monthly mortgage interest payments. The Department of Social Security has rules to prevent such behaviour. But that does not mean the practice does not take place. Furthermore, some large purchases such as the replacement of a company car with a new family car would conform with DSS rules. There are also doubts about how much reliance to place on business confidence indicators. Over the past month, surveys from the Institute of Directors, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the British Chambers of Commerce have pointed to a recovery in business confidence in the final quarter of last year. Sterling's devaluation and the interest rate cuts have gone some way to offsetting the gloom felt by business during the September currency crisis. But it is a moot point how far such increases in confidence reflect improved business conditions. Confidence surveys ask about the future, looking ahead a quarter in the case of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and 12 months in the case of the chambers of commerce. According to Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, businessmen may be anticipating when they respond to surveys. 'People want to think the recovery is here,' he says. 'Many members are receptive to the idea that we may have the fundamentals in place to come out of recession. But they are not yet seeing recovery in terms of orders or cheques in the post.' If true, such indicators are clearly a fragile base for hopes of recovery, which is one reason why December's sharply higher unemployment caused such concern. The official government figures came immediately after the British Chambers of Commerce reported that both the manufacturing and service industries expected to continue shedding labour in the first three months of this year, According to Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, the BCC president, the prospect of rising unemployment constitutes a downside risk for the economy which could adversely influence sentiment more than any optimism deriving from increased exports following sterling's devaluation. Even before Thursday, economists such as Mr Sudhir Junankar of the CBI, were warning that sentiment was in the balance and that there was no reason to expect the economy to turn up before the spring. The past week's statistics have increased fears that rising unemployment in the months ahead will chill these limited hopes and could trigger a downward spiral of falling confidence, reduced demand and still higher unemployment. The stage has therefore been set for an intensified debate about the future direction of economic policy in the seven and a half weeks to the Budget on March 16. Already, many City economists and members of the Treasury's recently constituted panel of seven independent economists have been calling for interest rate cuts to boost growth. One factor that could influence the debate is the obvious disenchantment of Mr John Major, the prime minister, with the ERM. With Britain set to stay outside the ERM for a year at least, some of the government's advisers in the Bank of England and the Treasury may be inclined to cast envious eyes across the Atlantic at the US experience, where sharply lower interest rates appear to have triggered a recovery without sparking inflation. Advocates of lower UK interest rates argue that there is little risk of activating the traditional spiral of rising costs and wages because higher unemployment is exerting downward pressure on pay. According to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the City investment house, pay settlements in the UK are currently averaging 3.25 per cent. On the other hand, the Bank will be advising the government that Britain cannot risk pushing short-term rates down to US-type levels of about 3 per cent for fear of causing a sharp fall in sterling which would boost inflation through higher imported goods' prices. There is a growing mood in the City that 5 per cent base rates are needed to boost the economy. But any speculation about an early and substantial cut in rates would seem to be premature. The government may want to wait for another month's economic data, the Bank of England's first quarterly assessment of UK inflationary pressures, which is due to be published next month, and the budget itself. Before this week's bad news, Mr Lamont insisted that he had only limited room for manoeuvre if the government was to keep within its target range for underlying inflation of 1 to 4 per cent during the life of this parliament. Having made much of his dogged struggle to bring inflation down from nearly 11 per cent, it is unlikely that the week's developments will have persuaded him to change his mind.</p>

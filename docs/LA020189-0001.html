			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> UTILITY MERGER STRONGLY OPPOSED BY SAN DIEGANS  </P> <P> San Diegans are strongly opposed to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s proposed  merger with Southern California Edison, but they also have serious doubts about  a public takeover of the utility, a Times poll has found.  </P> <P> Significantly, however, nearly half of those questioned said they are undecided  about SDG&amp;E's merger plans, despite months of acrimonious public debate.  The large percentage of undecided residents offers advocates of both the merger  and the buyout an opportunity to mobilize support behind their respective  proposals in the coming months.  </P> <P> Even so, the poll suggests that SDG&amp;E and Edison executives may face a  tougher selling job than supporters of a public takeover of the utility by the  San Diego County Water Authority. Among San Diegans who have made up their  minds on the issue, the merger is opposed by a 4-to-1 margin, while the public  buyout option was disapproved by only a very narrow margin.  </P> <P> A major factor for those who are undecided will be which option is more likely  to produce lower utility rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Merger vs. Buyout  </P> <P> When asked which alternative they would prefer if rates were guaranteed to go  down, the poll's respondents favored the merger over the buyout by 45% to 28%.  Concern that governments are ill-equipped to run utilities -- raising the  specter of higher rates -- was the major reason cited in opposition to  municipalization of SDG&amp;E. However, by a 3-to-2 margin, those polled also  expressed skepticism about the likelihood of utility rates being reduced under  an Edison takeover.  </P> <P> San Diego's historical anti-Los Angeles bent surfaced as one of the major  reasons why people oppose SDG&amp;E's merger with Rosemead-based Edison.  Disapproval of the public buyout plan, meanwhile, stemmed in part from the  widespread concern that municipalization would increase bureaucracy and be an  unwelcome government incursion into private business.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that San Diegans have over the years consistently criticized  SDG&amp;E for high rates and mismanagement, the poll showed that, by a more  than 4-to-1 margin, people prefer its present structure to either the merger or  a public buyout.  </P> <P> "If people had their druthers, SDG&amp;E would stay the same and these two  other proposals would just go away," Times pollster I.A. Lewis said.  </P> <P> The Times poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday of 719 people  throughout San Diego County. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or  minus 5 percentage points.  </P> <P> Public sentiment won't determine whether or not the merger occurs, but it will  be an important backdrop to the Public Utilities Commission's review of the  SDG&amp;E-Edison deal. The public's attitude also could influence the position  taken by local politicians on the issue.  </P> <P> Proponents of both the merger and a public buyout said they were encouraged by  the poll's findings. Not surprisingly, both sides also argued that the results  bode ill for their opponents.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 thing that comes through in those numbers is that the public doesn't  want this merger with Edison," said San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who has  vigorously opposed the proposed merger since it was announced last fall. "The  fact that people are most interested in what happens to rates also is good from  the standpoint of a public takeover. If people vote their pocketbooks, that's a  battle we'll win."  </P> <P> On the other side, Michael Peevey, Edison's executive vice president, dismissed  the strong opposition to the merger as "not very surprising, given the  hostility of some politicians and other people" who, he contends, have  dominated public debate on the subject so far. Predicting that the opposition  will lessen "when we make our case," Peevey drew encouragement from the poll's  finding that San Diegans prefer the merger over a buyout, assuming both options  would insure lower rates.  </P> <P> "That's extremely pleasing, because what it says is, all things being equal,  the public would like to see SDG&amp;E stay under private ownership," Peevey  said.  </P> <P> With extensive governmental reviews of SDG&amp;E's future ownership just  beginning, the Times poll showed that those studies, which could last as long  as two years, have an enormous potential for shaping public attitudes.  Forty-five percent of those questioned said they neither support nor oppose the  $2.4-billion buyout offer from Edison's parent company, SCEcorp., while 50%  were undecided about the possible public takeover by the County Water  Authority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lopsided Margin  </P> <P> However, among those who have made a decision, the merger faces overwhelming  opposition, although attitudes toward municipalization are relatively evenly  split, the poll revealed. SDG&amp;E's merger with Edison was opposed by a  lopsided 44%-11% margin, with two-thirds of the opponents saying they "strongly  disapprove" of the merger. In contrast, the possibility of a public takeover of  SDG&amp;E drew a 27%-23% negative response.  </P> <P> The merger's potential impact on local utility rates was the major explanation  offered both in its support and opposition. Asked for the most important reason  why they approve of the merger, 56% of the respondents said they believe that  it would produce lower rates. On the other hand, 49% of the merger's opponents  said they fear that Edison's takeover of SDG&amp;E would raise rates.  </P> <P> Rates played an equally significant role in determining attitudes toward the  municipalization proposal, with 43% of that plan's backers arguing that public  ownership of SDG&amp;E would lower rates, making that response the No. 1  answer. Among opponents of municipalization, 23% said they believe utility  rates would increase under public ownership, a finding that ranked third in  that category.  </P> <P> The two leading objections to a public takeover, the poll found, are the belief  that governments are ineffective in running utilities and that municipalization  would increase government bureaucracy, answers offered by 53% and 35% of the  respondents, respectively.  </P> <P> Another 16% described the public takeover plan as inappropriate government  interference in private business, 10% said it would reduce local governments'  tax revenues and 6% predicted it would lower the community's charitable  donations by removing a major corporate donor. In regard to another question,  public officials' plans to spend more than a million dollars in taxpayer money  to study the feasibility of municipalization was opposed by a 37%-20% margin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Municipalization Issues  </P> <P> Behind lower rates, the next most important reasons given in support of  municipalization were that public officials might be more responsive than  private utility executives (40%) and that it would help protect local jobs  (30%).  </P> <P> The merger proposal, meanwhile, drew strong support from people who said they  believe that larger companies generally are more efficient and that Edison has  access to more reliable energy supplies than SDG&amp;E -- answers that again  reflect hopes that the merger would generate lower rates.  </P> <P> San Diego's longstanding antagonism toward Los Angeles was strongly reflected  in the attitudes of merger opponents. The prospect of a Los Angeles-area  company controlling a San Diego utility was cited by 46% of those questioned as  the major reason they oppose the merger, making that factor second only to  rates. Another 28% said they disapprove of the merger because they believe it  would eliminate local jobs.  </P> <P> The obstacles faced by Edison's public-relations campaign aimed at winning over  converts to the merger plan were illustrated by a poll finding that many San  Diegans distrust the company. Although Edison executives have pledged to seek a  10% rate reduction for existing SDG&amp;E customers within six months of  approval of the merger, the poll showed that, by a 49%-33% margin, people do  not take the company at its word on that promise. Similarly, only 5% of those  surveyed expressed a favorable impression of Edison, compared to 24% for  SDG&amp;E and 12% for the County Water Authority.  </P> <P> The poll also showed that, although the merger-versus-buyout debate has been  Page 1 news for months, it is far from the top item on the public's agenda.  When asked to list the problems that they believe should receive public  officials' top priority, the utility issue ranked fourth, with only 10%,  preceded by crime (45%), the homeless (17%) and sewage (12%).  </P> <P> Reinforcing the turnaround in public attitudes toward SDG&amp;E, the poll  detected a longing for preservation of the status quo with the utility -- an  option recently described by San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts as "getting  the toothpaste back in the tube."  </P> <P> Asked whether they favor keeping SDG&amp;E as it is, approving the merger or  proceeding with a public buyout, 58% of the respondents expressed a preference  for not changing SDG&amp;E's ownership. Given that choice, only 14% said they  view the merger as the best alternative and 12% favored a public buyout.  </P> <P> "What that tells the politicians is that the smartest thing would be to oppose  everything," pollster Lewis said. "The status quo may not really be an option  any longer, but it's obvious that that's what people would like to see."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIMES POLL ON SDG&amp;E TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Which of the following factors is the most most important reason why you  approve of SDG&amp;E's merger with Southern California Edison?

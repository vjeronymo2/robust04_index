			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Thai PM takes aim at military THAILAND'S interim government will attempt to reduce the military's role in politics and business before new elections later this year but will avoid confrontation, according to Mr Anand Panyarachun, the prime minister. Mr Anand said his objectives were to increase participation of businessmen and the public in politics and to lower the profile of the army, which has played a prominent role in government since the end of the absolute monarchy 60 years ago. 'We have to take moderate and gradual steps,' Mr Anand said. He was appointed prime minister to resolve a political deadlock after troops shot dead pro-democracy demonstrators in May. Mr Anand's cabinet has already replaced Air Chief Marshal Anan Kalinta, former interior minister, as chairman of the Communications Authority of Thailand, which controls international telecommunications, and questioned the validity of a Thai-Malaysian fibre-optic cable contract he approved while in office. At the same time, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the military supreme commander, has been criticised by his employees and the media in his role as head of Thai Airways International, the national airline whose shares are due to start trading on the stock market next month. Critics of the military want him and other military commanders to be punished for the shootings. Mr Anand said the military was accepting that the role of the armed forces in Thai society was changing. He said he expected to call elections soon, probably for September.

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: The magic of Merce - Alastair Macaulay discusses the American choreographer's latest works, commissioned in Europe Merce Cunningham is an American artist, and so much of his sensibility is profoundly American that it seems amazing that he is taken seriously elsewhere. He is a figurehead of the New York School, of American modernism, of abstract expressionism; and he is parent and grandparent to numerous dance-makers who have learnt from him, broken away from him, and launched new mini-styles of their own. But Cunningham's two last commissions came from Europe. Last spring, the Rambert Dance Company gave the premiere of his Touchbase. Though Cunningham used mainly his own dancers when creating its dance material, he still has not had his own company perform it onstage. Then, this winter, his company presented his new Enter at the Paris Opera, which had commissioned the premiere. A long work (60 minutes), Enter looked utterly locale-specific (new performing-arts jargon term) - ie it made such use of the breadths, depths and heights of the Palais Garnier stage that you wonder what on earth it will look like anywhere else. New York will find out soon, and it will see Touchbase too. Both will be part of the company's annual March season at City Centre Theatre. What was most striking about Enter at the Opera was the immense space high above the dancers, and how powerfully the dance occupied that space, addressed it, radiated up into it. Here are secrets, usually associated only with ballet, but which no other choreographer today understands half so well: how dance occupies not just the stage space in which it is performed, how it projects not only straight out into the auditorium, but how it acquires full scale by addressing itself to the dimensions of the whole tall (largely empty) box of stage space. Cunningham's dancers have this scale partly because of the pulled-up and stretched qualities of Cunningham technique, but also thanks to his sense of dance as gesture. His dancers seem to carry high blocks of air above them as they move, and to release energy along multi-dimensional paths. Cunningham knows how to makes his dancers register as individuals in a big theatrical way, without fake heroics. What a human sense of architectural proportion: and this sense is one reason (though only one) why he is called a classicist. At the same time, Enter demonstrated - more powerfully than any ballet I have seen there - the astounding depth of the Opera stage. If there is one passage that I and many others could never forget from the Paris performances of this work, it would be how Cunningham has his dancers rush downstage in a stream, one after another, and pass rapidly across the front and off - only to reveal a male-female couple moving very, very slowly at the back of the stage. It is as if a telescope had suddenly switched from a racetrack to the surface of the moon. Near; then far. Blurring speed; then hushed slowness. The contrasts - unmissable - are breathtaking. Much of Enter's movement involved a degree of wildness, falling, fragmented phrasing and animal attack: qualities that have interested Cunningham increasingly in recent years. Amid this marvellous company, I must single out Frederic Gafner for the solo, both luxuriant and paradoxical, in which he tilts, curves and arches every which way and then suddenly bursts forth into vivid jumps. Cunningham himself only performed in Enter, giving himself two brief solos. The second was jauntily inventive, but he performed it in that 'There's life in this old buzzard yet' manner that can be so objectionable in this ageing, once-great dance star. But in his first solo all Cunningham did was to stand still, on three different points at the back of the stage, each time for about a minute. Sometimes the younger dancers came and danced in front of him, and he just stayed there impassive. Sometimes there was nothing to look at but him. Cunningham is 73. His feet are gnarled by arthritis, his knees and upper spine are not what they were, and his face is a web of lines. But as he stood there, like some pillar that had been there as long as the Palais Garnier itself, he was as wonderful to look at as an oak in winter; or a ship's timber washed up by the tide. A new collection of essays written on Cunningham between 1944 and 1992, 'Merce Cunningham - Dancing in Space and Time,' edited by Richard Kostelanetz, has just been published by A Cappella Books, US, and by Dance Books, UK. The Merce Cunningham Dance Company has its next New York season in March. A November season at Sadler's Wells is scheduled.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] After 45 days of investigation, the Civil Police  Drugs and Narcotics Headquarters in Rio Grande do Sul State have  broken up a ring of cocaine traffickers from Bolivia. The  ringleader was Odamir Davi Bertuol, 28, an engineer and owner of  the Edifa condominium management company in Porto Alegre. His  office was used as a narcotics contact and sales point. Two  kilograms of cocaine were seized when the five people were  arrested.    Every 15 days the group brought in 10 kilos of cocaine,  reaping a $30,000 profit on each shipment. Chief Mauricio  Finkelstein, of the narcotics headquarters, requested and  obtained an order for temporary detention of those involved.  They include Almeida Faviero dos Santos and Marcos Barcelos de  Menezes--the latter worked three years at a secret  cocaine-refining laboratory in the Bolivian jungle.</p>

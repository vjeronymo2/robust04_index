			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY TO REMOVE PARLIAMENT'S RED STAR  </P> <P> The red star that has perched on the roof of the Hungarian Parliament building  for four decades will be winched down over the weekend as the country prepares  for its first free elections since the Communist takeover in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Ten feet across and weighing 1.6 tons, the red steel star on top of the  building's dome will be replaced, weather permitting, by a copy of the weather  vane that adorned the neo-Gothic building in pre-Communist times.  </P></p>

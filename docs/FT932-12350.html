			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Sigh of relief on pensions: EC employers have escaped a 40-year bill EMPLOYERS across Europe are entitled to breathe a collective sigh of relief. They are unlikely to be asked to pick up the bill for more than 40 years of paying men lower pensions than they offered women workers. Moreover, they are not violating women's contractual employment rights if they raise their retirement age to 65 to match that of male employees. Yesterday, the European Court of Justice's chief adviser, the advocate general, unequivocally said that employers need only equalise pensions from May 1990, the date when the court first ruled that men and women must have equal retirement ages. It is estimated that full retrospection would have cost British employers Pounds 50bn, Dutch employers Pounds 30bn, Belgian employers Pounds 15bn and Irish employers Pounds 500m. While the ECJ may decide to go against the advice of its advocate general, it typically does not. A final decision from the court is expected in June. The cases at hand stem from an earlier one, Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange, which was a watershed in occupational pensions. It has forced employers in most European Community countries to revamp their pension scheme rules. In Britain, according to the National Association of Pension Funds, 89 per cent of employers have equalised retirement ages, 59 per cent by raising the age at which women can retire to 65. In the Netherlands, where private employers offered lower retirement ages, scheme rules are also being adjusted. However, among the key questions about equalisation not answered by the Barber judgment are: If unequal pensions were illegal, then it could be argued they had always been illegal and employers should pay men retrospectively the more generous pensions paid to women; Whether pension benefits so contractual that an employer could not equalise pension ages by worsening benefits for women and effectively cutting their pay; If it is permissible to offer men and women different lump sums on retirement. The ECJ in February heard arguments in four cases, two of them British. One of these involved the pension scheme of Coloroll, now in liquidation, while the other, Neath v Hugh Steeper, involved a former employee of an artificial limb manufacturer who took early retirement and received a lower lump sum than a woman would have earned. The two other cases were from Germany and the Netherlands. Yesterday the advocate general advised that where pensions are received as a lump sum upon retirement - then to be used to purchase an annuity  - employers must not discriminate. Because women on average live longer than men, they need a bigger lump sum to buy an annuity to provide them with an equal income for the rest of their lives. According to consulting actuaries Clay and Partners, the average British woman lives 20.5 years after retirement at 65, while men will on average only live 16.5 years past that date. Thus women need roughly 25 per cent bigger lump sums or must accept a 25 per cent reduction in monthly payments. In the US, where unisex annuity rates are the law, insurance companies which sell the policies have simply cut the benefits they offer men to the lower level of women. 'The European Commission, in its brief to the court, asked that they take into consideration the US Supreme Court decision,' said Mr Geoffrey Furlanger, partner at actuaries William M. Mercer in Brussels. In Denmark, where more than 90 per cent of pensions are paid in lump sums, the effect could be significant. Mr Adolph Adolphsen, deputy director of the Association of Danish Insurance Companies, said the advocate general's recommendation would affect single people because married people's benefits are calculated jointly. For single people, it will result in higher pensions for women and lower for men. Mr John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co and the lead lawyer on the Coloroll case, said the judgment was good news for employers. However, a significant number of schemes, have not equalised. Mr Cunliffe said the greatest effect of the ruling is likely to be on German employers who have been unable to raise women's retirement ages since the Barber judgment. This is because they have not yet put into effect laws which raise state retirement ages for women to 65 and their occupational pension laws require employers to maintain the same ages as the state.

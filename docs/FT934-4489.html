			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Observer: Decline and fall Last week's sudden announcement that Paris's Grand Palais - the vast, Crystal Palace-type building near the Champs Elysees used for block-buster art shows - is closing for FFr250m of emergency repairs, is somewhat embarrassing. Among the 20 exhibitions planned for 1994 were January's highly successful SIME salon of museums; March's Salon du Dessin drawings fair; and September's glamorously expensive Biennale des Antiquaires antiques show. Even more distressing than this blow to exhibitors and sponsors is the consequent buffeting of French pride. After all, the Palais was conceived as a monument to the brilliance of modern French engineering in the 1900 Universal Exhibition. France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon, now admits that the Grand Palais was a jerry-built affair; four different architects had a go and the roof was still leaking 70 years later. The only bit of the building which has been ruled as structurally sound and will remain open throughout the enforced closure is the police station, responsible for guarding President Mitterrand in the nearby Elysee Palace.</p>

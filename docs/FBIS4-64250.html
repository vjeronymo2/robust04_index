			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "dan": "VGOe's Buchner Has Resigned"] </F>   [Excerpt] Linz/Vienna -- "I will remain a member as long  as the VGOe [United Greens of Austria] exists," [VGOe Chairman]  Josef Buchner said, who announced his resignation from all VGOe  functions at a press conference in Linz on Friday [29 April].  The reason for his resignation is his bitterness about  statements by former party colleagues, who have claimed that the  VGOe has shifted to the right under Buchner's leadership. "This  is not true," Buchner told DER STANDARD, "I will not let anyone  slander me." [passage omitted]</p>

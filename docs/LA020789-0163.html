			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> S.C. COACH 'NORMAL' BEFORE FATAL ATTACK, DOCTOR SAYS  </P> <P> South Carolina coach Joe Morrison's vital signs were normal moments before he  collapsed in a shower after suffering a massive and fatal heart attack,  according to the doctor who examined the coach.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Peele, an orthopedic consultant for the Gamecock football team, was  called to examine Morrison by Gamecock trainer Terry Lewis after Morrison had  trouble cooling down after playing racquetball at Williams-Brice Stadium.  </P> <P> "I came over and looked at his heart and checked his blood pressure, and he  didn't have any complaints of chest pains," Peele said Monday night. "They all  were normal.  </P> <P> "I went out to a phone to talk it over with his cardiologist," he said. "Before  I got back, he collapsed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CPR Administered  </P> <P> Peele said he and Lewis began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on  Morrison, 51, who was rushed to Providence Hospital, where he was pronounced  dead at 9:03 p.m. on Sunday.  </P> <P> Peele said he examined Morrison about an hour after the coach finished his  weekly racquetball games.  </P> <P> "He had no complaints of chest pains," Peele said during a telephone interview.  "His cardiologist didn't think it was probably significant since he had had  chest pains in 1985."  </P> <P> Morrison had a history of heart problems and had been hospitalized in the past  for that condition. He underwent surgery for the removal of a blockage in a  coronary artery in March, 1985.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REGGAE'S PIONEER POET HAS PICKED UP HIS PEN AGAIN;  </P> <P> MUSIC: LINTON KWESI JOHNSON TOOK A BREAK BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID HE'D RUN OUT OF  THINGS TO SAY, BUT EUROPE THOUGHT OTHERWISE.  </P> <P> There's a simple reason why Linton Kwesi Johnson's appearances this week will  be his first Southern California performances in five years.  </P> <P> Johnson, the British "dub poetry" pioneer whose politically charged poems set  to fluid reggae arrangements were among reggae's most dynamic recordings  between 1978 and 1984, was afraid he had run out of words.  </P> <P> "I actually had put music aside for about four years," Johnson said during a  phone interview from Vancouver. "I hadn't been writing; I stopped because I  thought basically I had dried up."  </P> <P> But the lack of fresh material after his last studio album, 1984's "Making  History," hadn't lessened European appetites for Johnson's live performances.  The demand was so great that the poet joined forces with his regular  collaborator, bassist-producer Dennis Bovell, for a 1988 tour celebrating  Johnson's 10-year career. Bovell and the Dub Band are also backing Johnson on  the current tour, which includes a date tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in  Solana Beach.  </P> <P> Johnson wasn't inactive during his dry spell, serving as arts editor for the  now-defunct Race Today magazine and doing journalistic work for British  television and BBC radio. But that return to concert activity had an unexpected  benefit: It got Johnson back in the writing groove, and now he plans to record  a new album this summer.  </P> <P> "When I mentioned to a fellow poet from the Caribbean that I had started  writing again, he said, 'Nonsense, you must have been writing in your head,' "  Johnson recalled.  </P> <P> "Which basically was true -- I had been thinking about ideas for poems, putting  things down on paper, but never really completed anything and . . . well, the  muse has come back to me, let's put it that way.  </P> <P> "I think I just had too many distractions, because poetry needs time for  meditations. I was running here and there, traveling around doing reports on  television. There was absolutely no time to sit down and apply my thoughts and  ideas."  </P> <P> Johnson, 37, was reared in rural Jamaica and migrated to London in 1962 to join  his mother. He earned a degree in sociology and began writing poetry after  forming a writers workshop during his involvement with the Youth League of the  British Black Panther Party in the early '70s.  </P> <P> He first experimented with blending his words with music with the Rasta Love  percussion group in 1972. While working for Virgin Records later in the decade,  Johnson suggested the label finance a demo recording of his work. That led to  the "Dread Beat An' Blood" album released under the name Poet &amp; the Roots  in 1978. Four more albums for Island followed, and a live double album was  released in America in 1986 by Shanachie.  </P> <P> Johnson's work influenced a number of later poets, including the late Michael  Smith and Mutabaruka, and his charged analyses of social conditions in England  opened a window on life in black Britain.  </P> <P> In many respects, his albums were analogous to Gil Scott-Heron's politicized,  poetic commentaries on the American scene during the '70s, and can be seen as a  British reggae bridge to the black consciousness being forcefully expressed by  rap artists today.  </P> <P> "I can't say I'm a big fan of any of these rapping artists, but I can identify  with some of the sentiments that they're expressing," Johnson said.  </P> <P> "I think none of them have come near to Grandmaster Flash's 'The Message.' I'm  encouraged by the fact that, even in some of the dance hall things in Jamaican  reggae, there's this movement back to social consciousness and social issues."  </P> <P> While he's less involved in the music world as a whole, Johnson does keep tabs  on the reggae world. And he likes what he sees.  </P> <P> "The reggae scene is quite healthy and vibrant," he said. "Just before  Christmas, the Dub Band and I went to do a gig for Solidarity in Poland, and  they're into reggae in a big way.  </P> <P> "There were thousands of young Polish kids wearing (the Jamaican colors) red,  gold and green, and they have their hair in dreadlocks. Reggae is now a world  music."  </P></p>

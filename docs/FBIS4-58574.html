			<p>BFN     [Text] Since 1800 today, the Alliance of Palestinian Forces  has been holding an expanded central meeting in the hall of  martyr Samir Darwish at the building of the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] to study  the current political situation, particularly the agreement  'Arafat signed with terrorist Rabin in Cairo today in the  presence of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the U.S. secretary  of state, and the Russian foreign minister.    Before the meeting, PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril  made a statement in which he said: Our people were not  surprised by what they saw in Cairo when the detailed agreement  was signed between 'Arafat and Rabin. What happened is an  actual translation of the capitulatory deal 'Arafat accepted in  Washington. He added: This is a day of sadness for our people  and our Arab and Islamic nation. The agreement completely  avoided mentioning Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian  people, the first of the two qiblahs, and the third holiest  mosque. He added that the agreement was also void of the right  to repatriation and self-determination and did not mention the  large-scale settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Ahmad Jibril also said in his statement: The agreement was a  total surrender by 'Arafat regarding the security file and the  economic file. He said: Today, Our people staged a  comprehensive strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in response  to the agreement, pointing out that some parties, which support  the agreement like Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and Hanan 'Ashrawi  announced that the agreement was a capitulatory one.    Ahmad Jibril also said: We, in the Alliance of the  Palestinian Forces, are meeting to assess what happened because  there are requirements now, practical requirements on the ground  in Gaza and Jericho. He then pointed to statements made by  terrorists Rabin and Peres on 'Arafat's upcoming duty to oppress  the intifadah. Ahmad Jibril stressed that the Alliance of the  Palestinian Forces will not create battles with the upcoming  forces of oppression unless 'Arafat completely insists on  clashing with the popular forces. He also asserted that the  alliance will continue its jihad and militant program, and that  time will prove that 'Arafat is unable to conquer the intifadah  which will escalate.    Ahmad Jibril also pointed out that the agreement that  'Arafat  signed is much worse that the Camp David accords. He asserted  that our people are aware of what happened in Cairo today. He  added: We are determined to continue our plans and to deal with  the collapse that 'Arafat and his supporters created. We say  that the agreement is not bounding for the Palestinian people.  Ahmad Jibril added that these agreements are null and that the  future will show who is right. He said that this capitulatory  agreement 'Arafat signed today will completely fail within three  months.    In a similar statement, 'Imad al-'Alami, member of the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said that the agreement is  not binding for the Palestinian people, describing it as a  poisoned dagger directed at the heart of the Arab and Islamic  nation. He asserted that what happened today was not surprising  and that the agreement is null and void and will not bind our  people. He added that Palestine is not owned by those who sold  themselves to the devil, including the 'Arafatist leadership,  which disowned our people's revolution, struggle, and all the  Islamic and Arab values.    Our people adhere to the firm principles of our Arab and  Islamic nation in Palestine and to their full right to every  inch of our land, Palestine. He said: We will not tire, and we  are not pessimist. We are optimist because the people are  steadfast and do not disown the martyrs' blood. Regarding the  role of 'Arafat's police, 'Imad al-'Alami said that these police  will not silence the sound of bullets which will continue as  long as there is a usurped right in Palestine. The Alliance of  the Palestinian Forces is still in session.</p>

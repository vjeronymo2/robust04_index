			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic reform from Yeltsin needs a miracle, says Fyodorov Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance and a long-standing critic of the present administration, yesterday said that 'without some sort of miracle' President Boris Yeltsin's government was unlikely to undertake comprehensive economic reforms. Some Russian ministers have suggested that this week's dramatic collapse of the rouble could be the prelude to a stabilisation programme, but Mr Fyodorov, a leading proponent of market reforms before he left the cabinet, disagreed. 'I think with the current government, all we can expect is a scenario of drifting mediocrity,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'I doubt whether there will be real reforms, whether real stabilisation will begin.' On these grounds, Mr Fyodorov, who has served as Russian representative to the World Bank, urged western countries and western financial institutions not to extend further credits to Russia. 'Who needs the money?' Mr Fyodorov, one of Russia's most respected economists, asked. 'We have more money in Russia than in some western countries.' Arguing that Russia is hobbled by a lack of political will rather than of capital, Mr Fyodorov said that by giving financial assistance to Mr Yeltsin's government, the west was repeating the mistakes it made in its dealings with the Gorbachev administration. 'It is like the late Gorbachev period, when everyone was throwing money at him to no purpose,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'You are supporting a person and forgetting the country.' As a long-time backer of radical market reforms, Mr Fyodorov has been a frequent critic of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank governor, whom President Boris Yeltsin sought to oust yesterday. But Mr Fyodorov dismissed Mr Yeltsin's move as 'a search for scapegoats'. 'The problem is not with Gerashchenko or with Dubinin (Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting minister of finance who was sacked yesterday),' Mr Fyodorov said. 'The question is whether there will be a reconsideration of the government's policies. 'I think Mr Gerashchenko is the best survivor, I don't believe he will be pushed out,' Mr Fyodorov said. While he is dubious about the chances the current government will be converted to radical market reforms, he suspects members of the administration have learned the principle of taking care of oneself. Like other senior Russian politicians, Mr Fyodorov suspects significant insider trading took place when the rouble collapsed on Tuesday. 'Some people may have been trying to help the budget,' he said. 'But other people were trying to help themselves . . . I think many people may be planning to leave the government soon.' Mr Fyodorov also rejected the argument that the collapse in the rouble may help the economy by making Russian exports more competitive. 'The rouble is undervalued now, and it was undervalued two weeks ago (before the recent collapse),' he said. 'Its ridiculous when you have the GDP of a country the size of Russia that looks like the balance sheet of Barclays or Natwest.' But, notwithstanding his pessimistic outlook on Russian central government policy, Mr Fyodorov was confident that foreign investment would continue to flow into Russian industries with export capacity.</p>

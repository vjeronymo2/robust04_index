			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: No time to put his feet up - More at ease than he has been for months and unfettered from his erstwhile tormentor, Dieter Bock is now able to make his presence felt at Lonrho Mr Dieter Bock was yesterday exhausted but more at ease than he had been for months, having won his long battle against Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive at Lonrho, the international trading group. At tea time on Thursday, Mr Rowland, who had been Lonrho's driving force for 33 years, agreed to give up his executive duties at the end of the year and to stand down from the board altogether next March. In his first interview since establishing himself firmly in control of the international trading group, the German property financier did not hide his delight: 'It will take some time to really relax and move forward without the burden of having someone on my back,' he said. He had no doubt that the agreement with Mr Rowland was binding. 'He may try to hurt me with words, but I can cope with that.' Mr Bock stressed that the title of Lonrho president, which Mr Rowland will take next spring if shareholders agree, carries 'no power'. The title of president had been offered to Mr Rowland because 'the board did not want to humiliate him'. He added that opinion within the company was divided on whether Mr Rowland would bother to continue coming in to the office: 'I think he will come from time to time.' He also denied that he had made a significant concession to Mr Rowland by agreeing to scrap an arrangement which gave him a substantial degree of control over Mr Rowland's 6.5 per cent Lonrho share-holding. Mr Bock had previously had the power to force Mr Rowland to sell him the shares on leaving the company or at the end of 1985. A new arrangement has now been put in place giving Mr Bock the right to buy the shares only if Mr Rowland wants to sell them - and that right expires once Mr Rowland leaves the board. However, Mr Rowland's Lonrho shareholding continues to be held in an escrow  -or independent - account. Until he leaves the board they can only be sold through the company's stockbroker, James Capel, and only if Capel takes the view that the sale will not damage the company. Mr Bock's main disappointment over the past year has been his inability to dispose of peripheral assets, which he blames on the obstructive tactics of Mr Rowland. 'There have been almost no disposals this year,' he said. Mr Bock's most ambitious reorganisation attempt so far at Lonrho has been a plan to create the world's biggest platinum group by merging the company's South African platinum interests with those of Gencor, the mining conglomerate. This however was blocked earlier this year, though there are conflicting explanations of who was responsible for the impasse. Mr Bock's close colleagues blame Mr Rowland. Other Lonrho executives say that there was a widespread view on the company's board that the implicit value being put on Lonrho's holding in Western Platinum was too low. Mr Bock said yesterday that his highest priority was to resume negotiations with Gencor so that both companies could increase the returns they earn from their platinum interests. Lonrho will henceforth have only four divisions: gold and coal mining in Africa; hotels in the UK and internationally; agriculture also in Africa; and international trading activities. Everything else will eventually be sold or closed down. Many Lonrho employees expect Mr Bock to merge Lonrho's hotels with the continental European Kempinski chain, in which he has a significant interest through his private companies. Mr Bock said that such a move had been discussed and rejected - though he said that the possibility of fusing the two chains might be re-examined at some point. Whatever his plans, any sale of the Metropole Hotels would be complicated by the presence of the Libyan government as a 33 per cent Metropole shareholder. Mr Bock professes to be embarrassed by the Libyan link which Mr Rowland forged. Though how easy it would be to sever that tie is unclear. Perhaps the biggest one-off boost to profits will come from cutting central administration costs, which Mr Bock said could be reduced by 'more than Pounds 10m'. Once Mr Rowland departs, there should also be a Pounds 5m saving as the group no longer has to pay his salary of more than Pounds 1m and millions of pounds of other expenses directly related to him. These costs relating to Mr Rowland include Pounds 850,000 of business expenses, the Pounds 2m annual costs of running a Gulfstream jet, and even Pounds 230,000 of contributions to the school fees of the dependants of various African politicians. Mr Bock said, however, that by the end of the past financial year on September 30, he had made good his 'promise' to City of London analysts that the group's operations would cease being net consumers of cash. In fact, he said he had been extremely surprised at how good Lonrho's financial controls had turned out to be. As a result, he is fairly confident that he will not discover too many skeletons in the company's cupboard as he extends his influence over the group. However it is widely believed within the company that Mr Rowland's departure will probably lead to the disclosure of other company secrets. That there are some of these is certain, given that he ran the company as a personal fiefdom, with enormous personal discretion over the use of millions of pounds of company funds. One recent example of a hidden liability was the disclosure that Lonrho had granted an indemnity to Mr Graham Jones, the former employee of Mr Mohamed Fayed who allegedly defected to Lonrho and is now being sued by Mr Fayed. Other disclosures may simply be embarrassing rather than financially costly  -there is allegedly a whole room of secret Lonrho documents in the charge of one of Mr Rowland's minders. The stock market yesterday took the view that any unforeseen liabilities will be outweighed by the additional profits to be earned as Mr Bock reorganises the company. Lonrho's share price rose 12p to 144 1/2 p, as 28.6m shares were traded, far more than the normal. Investors will be further reassured by Mr Bock's most surprising statement of yesterday that - contrary to widespread speculation - he had no intention of selling his Lonrho holding of 18.8 per cent and would instead be selling all his private interests over the coming two years, to concentrate all his time and energy on Lonrho. 'It is such a marvellous company, that I want to devote myself too it', he said. 'To a large extent the real value has not been unlocked.'</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Macro 4 advances to Pounds 10.5m - Currency movements account for about half of profits increase MACRO 4, the mainframe computer software group, yesterday reported higher full year pre-tax profits and turnover, helped by currency movements which accounted for about half of the gains. Profits at the pre-tax level increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 10.5m in the 12 months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 22.3 per cent to Pounds 23.3m. Net interest income was flat at Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.29m). Earnings per share rose by 18.9 per cent to 31.5p and a final dividend of 11.48p makes a same-again 17.75p. However, the comparative dividend included a special 5p payment. The group's share price gained 10p to close at 663p. The overseas proportion of turnover increased to 80 per cent (76 per cent), of which 39 per cent originated in continental Europe and 36 per cent came from the US. Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said currency movements, particularly the dollar, had a significant impact on the consolidated results which were based on a year-end exchange rate of Dollars 1.49 compared with Dollars 1.90. On a like-for-like basis, turnover would have increased by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 21.2m and pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 9.54m. Group cash balances continued to grow and totalled Pounds 19.75m (Pounds 15.6m) at the end of June, including Pounds 1.56m to cover a delayed tax payment. The Pounds 4.14m increase reflected the strong cash generative nature of the group's activities and came despite higher dividend payments in 1992 which included the 5p special. Mr Kelly said the group had continued to make progress 'despite continued difficult trading conditions.' He said cancellations were continuing to impact the installed revenue base, but were still being outpaced by new sales. All of the group's subsidiaries managed to improve their turnover and contribution to profits in local currency terms 'despite less than buoyant local economic conditions, strong competition and extended decision cycles.' During the year the group set up its own subsidiary in Spain, replacing a series of unsatisfactory agents, and has begun to launch a range of products for the AS/400 mid-range computer market to complement its core mainframe software products designed to run on any IBM or IBM compatible machines.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (8): Crash clean-up - Quentin Peel examines the environment ONE OF the ironies of German unification is that the appalling pollution which used to poison the air of East Germany has dropped dramatically - not because of any great clean-up campaign, but because half the industries which caused the problem have closed down: cleaner air has come hand-in-hand with unemployment. And yet the inheritance of environmental havoc wreaked by the former communist regime, and by the Soviet army of occupation, promises to be a burden on the impoverished communities of the east for decades to come. If the whole of East Germany was an environmental disaster area, the state of Saxony can claim to be the worst affected region of all. Dr Dieter Angst, the appropriately-named state secretary for the environment in Dresden, says that in the west environmental debates are largely ideological. 'There we were just debating about figures after the decimal point,' he says. 'Here we are talking about tonnes. We are carrying out emergency repairs to the environment here, not preventive treatment.' The problems he has to tackle are all too obvious. In the north and east are the huge expanses of opencast brown coal mining: great lunar landscapes, dotted with abandoned machinery, pits, and pools of stagnant water, where nothing has ever been contemplated to return the land to nature. In the south and west, the mining devastation has been caused by the desperate search for uranium to supply the Soviet nuclear weapons' programme in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s - rape-mining, they call it in the Erz mountains. Dr Gu Hasel, a geologist in the mining industry, tries to explain how it happened. 'At first we could see how things were being allowed to collapse and deteriorate,' he said. 'But then we got used to it. We had no opportunity to compare our conditions with the outside world. So then you ceased to notice it any more.' The uranium mines (run as a 'state within a state' with virtually their own laws and permits by the Soviet-German Wismut enterprise) sold arsenic-rich radioactive tailings for road repairs and farm construction. Some went into the floors of milking parlours. 'It was only when they realised the milk was radioactive that they traced it back to the mines,' Dr Hasel said. 'They simply did not care. It was criminal irresponsibility.' In spite of the industrial closures, air pollution is still far above western and European Community norms. By 1996, Saxony has to reach the EC standard of a maximum of 2,500 mg of sulphur dioxide per cubic metre of foul air from its brown coal-burning power stations. At the moment, Dr Angst says, the level is somewhere between 3,300 and 12,500 mg. Leipzig and Chemnitz are the worst affected. Yet the most urgent environmental problems with which the state government must deal are perhaps the least obvious: providing clean drinking water, and sewage treatment systems. Where drinking water is concerned, both surface water and underground reservoirs are heavily polluted by chemicals, heavy metals, and nitrate fertilisers - the highest priority for treatment. If anything, the sewage problem is worse. At least 90 per cent of the population has access to water mains. Most have no proper sewage treatment system at all. Dr Angst calculates the entire cost of environmental repairs to the land alone at DM11bn; he has an annual budget this year of DM684m. More than DM500m of that goes on sewage treatment, clean air programmes, rubbish collection and disposal. Yet the only pollution which is the responsibility of Bonn is that caused by Wismut. Everything else is supposed to be paid for by the Saxony government and the bankrupt local communities. 'Our first task is to avert the immediate dangers, which means cleaning up the water and air,' says Dr Angst. 'I don't have to recultivate the brown coal mining areas immediately. Nor should we borrow for these long-term projects. 'But the popular feeling is that, after years of ignoring it, suddenly everything must be done, and done by the state. The thinking is coloured by this situation where the state did everything: this incapacity, this abrogation of decision-making, is still all-pervasive. People don't and won't think how they should resolve their problems themselves.' Bringing the eastern environment up to western standards is going to be a very long and expensive haul, and one which will fall overwhelmingly on the public purse. It will take 10 years at least to reach those standards on clean air; as far as the land and water are concerned, it will probably be a battle lasting 30 years.</p>

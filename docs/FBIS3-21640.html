This seizure, which can be described as the most important  so  far this year, took place approximately 80 km from Cancun, on  the beaches of Acumal, where the bundles were dropped into the  sea from an aircraft. Apparently, the bundles were to be  illegally transshipped in a 30-meter-long fiberglass boat that  had a radio with a marine band and other frequencies.    The boat and the cocaine are under Navy guard in Cozumel.  The Federal Judicial Police are investigating the origin of the  cocaine.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / People: Big names for small business taskforces The small businesses which suffer most from the burden of red tape have drawn scant comfort from the announcement of the chairmen of the seven government taskforces which will look into the question of deregulation. Their appointment follows the announcement by the government in early February of a campaign to review the 7,000 items of legislation affecting businesses. The seven are Duncan Bluck, a director of John Swire and Cathay Pacific Airways, to head the communications and transport taskforce; Chris Spackman, managing director of Bovis Construction in charge of the construction taskforce; Malcolm Bates, deputy managing director of GEC (engineering); John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome (chemicals and pharmaceuticals); Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the MMC (financial services); Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of Kingfisher (other services); and Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office (food, drink and agriculture). The DTI says it chose people who could command respect in the industry sectors they were to examine and anyway small business owners probably would not have the time to act as chairmen. It expects task force members to spend half a day a week but chairmen will probably have to devote more time. Small business organisations are not convinced. 'The targeting is wrong because these people won't be aware of the problems affecting the 97 per cent of businesses which employ fewer than 20 people,' said the Federation of Small Businesses. The DTI says it expects small business representatives to be among the task force members and Nigel Whittaker says there are small business people among the 8-10 people on his shortlist. The task forces, which will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, Michael Heseltine's special adviser on deregulation, have six months to complete their work.</p>

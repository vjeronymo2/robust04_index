			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REYNOLDS TO DROP MISLEADING ADS THAT MENTION SMOKING STUDIES  </P> <P> The nation's second-largest tobacco company today agreed not to run ads  misrepresenting the results of studies linking smoking and health problems, the  Federal Trade Commission said.  </P> <P> The settlement by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the maker of more than 20  cigarette brands including Winston, Camel and Salem, was in response to an FTC  complaint that Reynolds made false and misleading claims about a smoking study  funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  </P> <P> The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, a federal health  agency based in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> The agreement is the latest in a series of setbacks for Reynolds. In the past  18 months, it has dropped plans for several new cigarette brands, under  pressure from the government or consumer groups or both.  </P></p>

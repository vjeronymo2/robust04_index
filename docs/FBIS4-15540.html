			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of Russian deputies who have just returned  from a trip to Yugoslavia intends to seek changes in the  procedure for delivering humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia even  before the economic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro are  lifted. The deputies demanded that the permission required to  deliver aid be replaced with a simple notice of delivery. This  statement was made by the leader of the deputies' group Russian  Way, Sergey Baburin, at a news conference Friday. The  delegation included mostly deputies from the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia, Agrarian Party, Russian Communist Party and  groups Russian Way and New Regional Policy.    Baburin pointed out that changing the procedure for  delivering humanitarian aid would enable Russia to intensify aid  to the people of Serbia without waiting for the lifting of the  sanctions. In their statement, the deputies pointed to the need  to intensify the activities of the Russian government and the  parliament to lift U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia.    As has already been reported, the issue was included in the  agenda of the State Duma's session this week. It was proposed  to recommend to the Russian president and government to decide  on Russia's participation in the sanctions, boost humanitarian  aid to Yugoslavia, including oil and gas supplies, and intensify  bilateral economic cooperation.    Deputy Viktor Veshnyakov of the Liberal Democratic Party  faction supposed Russia should be ready to enter the Yugoslav  market, including that of defense systems, immediately after the  sanctions are lifted.</p>

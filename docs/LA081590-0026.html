			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Linda's Sings the Blues: Linda's, the Melrose Avenue restaurant and nightclub  where many of Los Angeles' top pianists and singers held forth, closed Monday.  Owner Linda Keegan blamed the closure on diminished patronage -- caused in  turn, she said, by the 1988 Writers Guild strike, negative publicity resulting  from a three-day Internal Revenue Service seizure for non-payment of taxes in  April, and a lack of on-street parking. Keegan is looking for both a place to  live -- she resided at Linda's -- and a place to work. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

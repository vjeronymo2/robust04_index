			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Going public for a higher profile - The planned flotation of ED&amp;F Man Considering how close ED&amp;F Man is to two of the sweetest things in life  - chocolate and money - its low profile with the public comes as some surprise. However, after more than two centuries of relative anonymity during which time it has developed from a sugar broker to an international trader in agricultural products and financial services, Man has decided to brave the demanding world of outside shareholders and City analysts. Its proposed stock market flotation, planned for September by way of a placing and public offer sponsored by Schroders with James Capel as broker, is expected to value the company at about Pounds 450m and raise Pounds 80m of new capital. Although existing shareholders will sell no more than 15 per cent of their holdings, between 25 and 30 per cent of the enlarged company is likely to flow into public hands. The immediate benefits of the flotation are twofold. First, it will enable Man to sever its remaining ties with Philip Morris through the redemption of about Pounds 40m-worth of preference shares. The US tobacco and food giant has been seeking to divest its shareholding in Man since 1990 when it accidentally inherited the stake during its takeover of Jacobs Suchard. Man will also be able to pay down debt and continue its investment in upgrading and expanding its fixed asset base. But Man's management is clearly more interested in the long-term advantages of being a well-capitalised public group. 'The flotation will help us greatly in the marketing of our fund management products,' says Mr Colin Barrow, managing director of Man's fund management division. Other benefits include the likely upgrading of its credit rating, currently triple-B plus, and a more sound financial footing for the long-term development of the group. Although Man has leading market positions in soft commodities, including sugar, cocoa, molasses, peanuts and pepper, its fund management division, which specialises in futures funds using quantitative investment techniques, has played an integral part in its transformation into a diversified business. The cashflow earned from the fund management and financial brokerage businesses has been ploughed into the commodity side, paying for the processing and distribution facilities which have helped to enhance the quality of the group's earnings. The profit before tax derived from financial services has far outstripped agricultural products for four of the past five years, during which time the group's pre-tax profit has grown by 75 per cent to Pounds 66.7m in the year to March 1994 from Pounds 38.1m in 1990, and at a compound growth rate of 15 per cent a year. Although the group's strong profit record and its adherence to stringent risk management policies will clearly impress potential new shareholders, Man's management still needs to slay several dragons in order to obtain its desired rating, which is believed to be targeted in the low- to mid-teens. This would be a considerable achievement since it is probable that Man will be listed in the food manufacturing sector, where the prospective price-earnings ratio is just under 12. The most difficult task ahead for Man is to overcome the City's prejudice against companies with large commodity operations. After all, memories of the old Berisford group and Dalgety's unhappy experience with Gill &amp; Duffus still linger, and some food manufacturing analysts are hardly relishing the thought of having to follow a company whose earnings visibility, in their view, will be cloudy at best. This stance arouses some bemusement at Man. 'It is a curiously London phenomenon that one has to be defensive about commodity operations, as it is in effect an industrial activity,' says Mr Barrow. 'We have huge factories in addition to being merchants, we don't take large market positions, we are a global and recession-proof business.' Another concern which potential investors are likely to have is that a stock market listing will provide a route for Man's management to sell the rest of their shareholdings. However, the company plans to have a five-year employee incentive scheme in place before the flotation, which should allay such worries and also safeguard the partnership culture which has always been part of Man. Mr Barrow is also surprised by questions about the quality of the funds which Man has under management and the perception among some analysts that they could flow out at any time. Of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) which Man has under management, more than 20 per cent is contractually committed for a period of seven to eight years, he says. In addition, about 70 per cent is invested in so-called 'guaranteed' funds where the focus is on the longer term. In view of the interest from the general public so far - there have been just under 8,500 requests for prospectuses and application forms - Man should be feeling quietly confident about its flotation. But given its 200-year trading experience, it is unlikely to start celebrating until the boat comes in.</p>

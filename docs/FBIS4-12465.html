			<p>BFN     [Text] Qabrikha came under heavy machine-gun fire from the  Israeli occupation forces' positions this morning. Two citizens  were injured in the attack.    Israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance sorties over the south  at low altitude, especially over the Iqlim al-Tuffah area. The  first sortie was carried out at 0900 and the second at 1030,  when the planes dropped thermal balloons but were confronted  with antiaircraft fire.</p>

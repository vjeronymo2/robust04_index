			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Beijing promises to work on Pyongyang: The visiting Japanese prime minister's concern over N Korean nuclear sites China yesterday told Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the visiting Japanese prime minister, it would continue initiatives to persuade North Korea to open its nuclear sites to inspection, in an effort to avoid an international crisis, but Beijing counselled patience. Mr Hosokawa, in two hours of talks with Chinese prime minister Li Peng, spoke of Japan's 'grave concern' over North Korea's reluctance to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been rebuffed repeatedly in its attempts to gain access to Pyongyang's nuclear facilities. 'Japan is gravely concerned about the situation, and the possibility is increasing that the matter will be referred to the United Nations Security Council. I believe the international community is losing patience. The role of China is very, very important,' said Mr Hosokawa. Premier Li's undertaking, that China would try to persuade North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, was accompanied by the standard Chinese line that 'the international community should take more time to settle the issue.' Mr Li added cryptically that it was important to 'give North Korea what it wants.' The Chinese official appeared to be suggesting that the US should accede to Pyongyang's demand for some form of diplomatic recognition. Indications that Beijing might be prepared to increase pressure on Pyongyang reflect deepening concern among the Chinese leaders over the possibility of the dispute spiralling out of control. China is anxious to forestall a sanctions process in the security council, under which it might be obliged to take action against its ally and neighbour. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and one of its few international 'friends'. But Beijing also recognises that international patience is wearing thin and that the prospect of UN-sponsored action is drawing nearer. For several months, Chinese officials have been urging the international community to avoid backing North Korea into a corner. The Japanese are making no secret of their increasing alarm over developments on the Korean peninsula. A spokesman for Mr Hosokawa told foreign reporters in Beijing on Saturday that Tokyo feared a nuclear North Korea would have a 'domino effect' throughout Asia. Japan has pledged to support the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely, but the Japanese official said that, if North Korea joined the nuclear club, there was certain to be strong pressure domestically for Japan to do the same. 'We have to defend ourselves,' he declared. Mr Hosokawa, on his first visit to China as prime minister, also raised the sensitive issue of Japan's wartime past. The visiting premier, in a speech to parliament in Tokyo last August, went further in apologising for Japanese brutaltiy than had any of his predecessors. Mr Li was reported to have expressed satisfaction with those remarks. Other issues raised by Mr Hosokawa included China's defence spending, which is to increase by more than 20 per cent, according to this year's budget. Japan wants more 'transparency' in China's military spending, much of which takes place through budgetary items other than those marked as for defence. Mr Li attributed China's defence budget increase to inflation and to the needs of a modernising a military which lagged behind other sectors. The two sides reviewed Japan's aid programme to China, which amounts to Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 5.2bn)in cheap credits in the five years to 1995. Mr Hosokawa, reflecting Japanese concern about the environmental threat posed by China's rapid industrialisation, expressed the hope that additional funds would be allocated to pollution-control. The Japanese premier, who is to leave for Shanghai tomorrow, also met Chinese President Jiang Zemin yesterday and lunched with Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier in charge of the economy.</p>

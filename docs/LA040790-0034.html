			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KITARO STRIVES FOR HIGHER PLANE  </P> <P> Fitting that Kitaro's two-hour set Thursday night at the Universal Amphitheatre  opened with rear-screen projections of the Japanese New Age keyboardist's name,  corporate sponsor and the nine titles on his new "Kojiki" album on to a white  scrim hiding the stage set. It was fitting because the blend of triumphant,  emotional peaks with muted passages sounded like the soundtrack to a film or  long-form video that has yet to be made.  </P> <P> But give Kitaro credit -- this wasn't New Age as an exercise in creating vapid  melodic paeans to the stress-less life, but music striving to reach a higher  plane. Kitaro's apparent goal was attaining the sonic majesty of a Western  symphony orchestra.  </P> <P> The triad of taiko drums at the apex of his pyramid-shaped stage set was one of  Kitaro's few nods to his Japanese heritage. His favorite synthesizer tone  brought to mind the piper Zamfir pushing his "20 Golden Hits" album. And the  recurrent theme throughout the "Kojiki" album, as played in its entirety during  the first half of the performance, sounded like a variant on the tune  "Greensleeves."  </P> <P> The structured arrangements didn't give Kitaro's highly professional backing  septet much opportunity to shine, although violinist Charlie Bisharat injected  some visual and musical personality as the leader's chief melodic foil. The  only variety came in a pair of full group percussion jams and two older pieces  in the second half of the set when the band's sudden shift from full crescendo  to a brief, soft coda was quite effective.

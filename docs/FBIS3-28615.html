			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S.  imperialists on February 6 and 7 mobilized overseas-based combat  flying groups in an exercise of long-distance mobility and  deployment in South Korean bases, according to military sources.    The exercise held with the support of KC-135 tanker planes  was an extremely reckless war gamble aimed at examining  overseas-based flying groups' capability of quick movement and  deployment and entry into a war according to the war scenario of  the U.S. imperialists.    In separate action on February 7, formations of Japan-based  fighter planes of different types flew above the operational  zones in Yongwol and Pyongchang in an exercise of surprise  attack and intensive bombing.    Such war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists, timed to  synchronize with the heinous anti-DPRK campaign they have  launched on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of  the DPRK, are premeditated acts of provocation designed to  render the situation on the Korean peninsula further strained.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Property valuation Trafalgar House's three rights issues in short order have at least enabled it to write down its assets to a realistic level. Some of these revisions, though, have thrown up further questions about the subjectivity of property valuations - in particular, the swingeing writedowns taken on Trafalgar's joint venture developments at Paddington Basin and Chiswick Park. Previously, Trafalgar had booked these on the basis of their projected values on completion, relying on forward assumptions about yields, costs, and interest rates. But doubts about how quickly these projects can be finished have led Trafalgar to revert to a current valuation basis for these sites. Using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' red book, Trafalgar House has now cut the carrying value of its share of the Chiswick Park development from Pounds 38m to Pounds 8m. This is all perfectly prudent. But in the case of Chiswick Park, it will leave its partner, Stanhope, in something of a quandary. How each partner chooses to value an investment in a joint venture is a matter of subjective opinion which can legitimately vary according to accounting policy and timing. The joint venture company itself last valued the whole Chiswick Park site at Pounds 50m. It would appear decidedly odd if Stanhope did not follow Trafalgar House's lead. At least it does not have to worry about its carrying value until its next year-end in June. Its first priority is to raise Pounds 160m of badly needed equity finance.</p>

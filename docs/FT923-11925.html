			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese yields tumble as rates ease JAPANESE government bonds yesterday reached levels not seen for nearly three years as the Bank of Japan allowed money market interest rates to drift lower. The tumbling bond yields are the latest sign that investors expect the authorities to react soon to the steady weakening of the Japanese economy by relaxing their monetary stance still further. Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark bond No. 129 dropped to 5.11 per cent from 5.17 per cent on Monday. At the same time, the futures contract rose tentatively above the psychologically-important 104.00 level, before slipping slightly. Further evidence of underlying economic weakness from depressed industrial production, consumer demand, and sluggish monetary growth, is behind the long rally in the government bond market. Yields on the No. 129 have fallen over 30 basis points since quarterly GNP figures were announced in mid-June. The plunge in the stock market, with the Nikkei stock average falling below 16,000 in late-June, also encouraged market participants. Three months ago, as the Nikkei first dived, the bond markets took fright at the state of the Japanese financial system. Since then, bond investors have recovered their equanimity. The slump in stocks has forced life assurers and investment trusts to increase investments in the bond market. Life and non-life insurers, net sellers during the first half of 1991, turned net buyers of Y2,118bn in public and private bonds. Investment trusts bought a net Y1,909bn, as a bulk of new funds were bond funds, reflecting the decline in investor confidence among individuals. Foreign investors purchased a net Y4,983bn, mostly in Treasury bills. Bond market participants have also been focusing on the yield gap to have emerged among bank debentures, issued by the three long-term credit banks - Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. Yields on the debentures have traditionally been the same, and were considered by institutional investors as interchangeable. However concerns over the deteriorating loan portfolio at NCB, the smallest of the three banks, have lifted NCB's five-year debenture yield to around 5.3 per cent, 20 basis points higher than IBJ's. The three long-term credit banks have been responsible for most of the long-term industrial financing since 1945, and have been allowed to issue debentures to procure long-term funds. The yield differentials point to the growing maturity of the bank debenture market, as investors become more aware of credit risk, said Mr Marshall Gittler, fixed income analyst at Merill Lynch in Tokyo. While investors are looking for the Japanese discount rate to fall further, last week's rise in the German discount rate has raised uncertainty over the timing of monetary easing due to the effects on currency movements. Economists believe the Bank of Japan will be reluctant to move until the government decides on its fiscal stimulus package.</p>

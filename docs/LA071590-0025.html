			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITE POLES: READERS RAISE MORE BURNING ISSUES  </P> <P> Congressman (Robert) Dornan views our nation's flag as "the ultimate expression  of the Judeo-Christian ethic." Obviously, Dornan does not really understand the  religions to which he appeals for support in his attempt to prohibit flag  burning.  </P> <P> While some Christian churches revere icons or relics, all aspects of Judaism  and most Christian churches oppose the glorification of material objects,  including flags. Instead of respect for material objects, Judeo-Christian  ethics teach respect for ideals and principles, such as the liberties found in  our nation's Constitution.  </P> <P> Some of the opposition to the constitutional amendment that would have banned  flag burning had nothing to do with civil liberties. Instead, religious  opposition feared an attempt to deify the flag. After all, how can you  desecrate something unless it is first declared sacred?  </P> <P> DAVID E. ROSS  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

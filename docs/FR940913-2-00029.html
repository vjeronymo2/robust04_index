			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Evcon filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated May 11, 1994, in accordance with section 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. The Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 14, 1994, Evcon's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 35916. Evcon also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Evcon Petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of the waiver to Evcon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Evcon's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Evcon requests the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time delay when testing its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces. Evcon states that since the 30-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in a 1.0 to 2.0 percent improvement in overall energy efficiency, the petition should be granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Evcon indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these exceptions for its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the blower controls incorporated on the Evcon furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the Evcon AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts Evcon from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 30-second delay. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> It is, therefore, ordered that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Evcon Industries, Inc.

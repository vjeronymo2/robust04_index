			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from "The RPC Television News"] </F>   [Text] An explosive attack today on Via Italia in the Punta  Paitilla area of Panama City injured one person and damaged  nearby property. Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) have arrested  two suspects.    Unidentified individuals planted a bomb in a Jeep Cherokee,  which caught fire when the device detonated. The explosion was  deafening and the shock wave made nearby buildings tremble.  Residents were confused and scared.    The incident took place on Via Italia in the Punta Paitilla  area of Panama City around 0800 today. This footage was filmed  a few minutes after the violent explosion. The driver and owner  of the vehicle is Jewish Panamanian businessman Aaron Schwartz,  age 39, who miraculously survived the attack but is currently in  serious condition at Paitilla Hospital.    The fire department responded efficiently but the vehicle  with license plate 521054 could not be saved. According to  eyewitnesses, Schwartz turned the key in the ignition of his  vehicle, thus activating the bomb, which exploded seconds later.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] The man came out of  the building, got into his vehicle, a Cherokee, started it, and  five seconds later there was an explosion. That was it.    [Ortega) Did you carry him? Was he seriously injured?    [Speaker] When he stepped out of his vehicle it was already  on fire. He was asking for help and nearly falling. He asked  to be taken to a hospital. I was nearby so I grabbed him and  took him to Paitilla Hospital. [end recording]    This is the first time a car bomb has been used in Panama to  kill someone. According to the police, this is not a technique  employed by Panamanian criminals.    [Begin PTJ official Ildefonso Suira recording] PTJ  laboratory  personnel are currently trying to determine the type of  explosive used in this vehicle. I could also tell you that we  currently have two individuals under investigation. They are  Colombians. They are under arrest, and we are trying to  determine their link to the case. [end recording]    According to reports, Aaron Schwartz had reported received  death threats after he witnessed a kidnapping attempt on 13 May  at the building where he lives, Tamanaco Building, in Paitilla.  Aaron Schwartz is the cousin of Colon Free Zone businessman  Saul Schwartz, who was kidnapped in Panama in June 1993 by a  group of unidentified individuals who asked his relatives for a  huge ransom. Saul was later released.    Only four seconds passed between the time the vehicle was  started and the explosion. The pavement on Via Italia clearly  shows the impact of the explosion. The authorities are trying  to locate the perpetrators of this incident and to determine if  there are other links to the crime.    Explosive experts found shrapnel in the area, and unofficial  reports indicate that a fragmentation grenade was used in the  attack. The rear door of the Cherokee has not been found. It  apparently flew into the air following the violent explosion.    The truth is that these kinds of attacks make the community  uneasy. Aaron Schwartz remains hospitalized at the Paitilla  Hospital and is in critical condition. Our team of journalists  tried to locate his wife at their Tamanaco Building apartment.    [Begin recording] [Ortega] We are from RPC Television.    [Schwarz' wife] No, no, I cannot speak to anyone now.    [Ortega] We want to know about your husband's health. How is  he? [end recording]    The Cherokee station wagon also suffered the effects of the  shock wave. Attacks with explosives are common in Colombia.  These condemnable criminal actions are now taking place in Via  Italia, Panama City. The police must take strong action against  the criminals who are terrorizing society.</p>

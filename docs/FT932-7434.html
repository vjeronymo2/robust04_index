			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / City watchdog starts to win friends: The state of support for the proposed Personal Investment Authority A FEW months ago conventional wisdom in the City had it that the awkward and contradictory efforts by regulators to create a new umbrella body for retail financial services were heading nowhere. Proposals for the Personal Investment Authority, which would include the members of the self-regulatory bodies Fimbra and Lautro, and a few others, pleased no one. The life insurance members of Lautro and the independent financial adviser members of Fimbra jockeyed for control of a board which at one time was proposed to consist of 30 people. Meanwhile, the life insurers said they would not join unless the financial services arms of banks and building societies joined as well and the banks complained, in turn, that their interests would be under-represented. The efforts by each industry to have its members dominate the new body created widespread scepticism that the authority could be an effective regulator. But lately a big change has occurred and the authority's odds of a healthy birth have dramatically improved. Industry officials are saying privately that the Treasury and Bank of England have quietly let it be known that they are determined to see an authority emerge. This new tone was accompanied by a version of the Riot Act, read to the authority's formation committee last December by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Large told the committee that the SIB would not approve a self-regulatory body which did not raise standards of investor protection. He also spelled out exactly how that should be done. His comments produced howls from sectors of the industry, but relatively enthusiastic expressions of support from the banks, which said Mr Large was at last describing an organisation they might join. So the committee, which itself consists of representatives of the constituent parts of the industry, had to find a way forward which would keep the banks on board while forestalling revolt among independent financial advisers. Sir Brian Jenkins, senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a former Lord Mayor of London, retained as a consultant to find a way forward, has come down hard on the side of tougher regulation. While offering a modest compromise on the touchiest issue of all - minimum capital requirements for advisers - he has urged a series of other tough requirements, including: Firms must be able to provide adequate explanations of lapse rates for any distribution channel which have been over 20 per cent for the previous two years. Firms must provide adequate explanations for a turnover of over 50 per cent in salesmen, advisers or tied agents in either of the previous two years. Firms handling client money must have at least two executive principals. Salesmen and advisers must pass competency exams. While Sir Brian's report seems to have earned the endorsement of the banks, support for it among advisers, particularly smaller ones, is much less certain. Mr Trevor Humphreys of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association, whose members are independent financial advisers, said the compromise on capital adequacy would probably be opposed. 'My initial reaction is that we have fought hard to get rid of the European Community capital requirements,' he said. If a member's business plan raised questions in regulators' minds about its future, 'then the regulator should tell the member to get his plan in order'. Requiring capital guarantees were beside the point, he said. Mr Humphreys said, however, the association firmly supported the need for higher standards, provided they did not constitute 'overkill'. The association's stance suggests that a lobbying effort to weaken some of the proposals is about to start. Bankers believe that the extent to which it is successful will reflect the level of political support for advisers in parliament and in the Treasury. But even if independent financial advisers are unhappy with the proposals, there is the widespread view in the industry that there is little they can do about it. If the majority of the industry - banks, life insurers and large independent adviser networks - all vote to join the new body, the small advisers will be left in Fimbra, an organisation whose finances are already precarious.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chairman of the State Duma's committee on  legislation and legal reform Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian faction)  told Interfax the Duma would be sure to endorse a draft bill on  the compulsory ratification of plans to enter NATO's Partnership  for Peace [PFP] program.    Last week Isakov, who authored the draft bill, found that  the  Russian constitution allowed the State Duma to map out Russia's  line in international affairs. Earlier, only the president was  privileged to plan foreign policy moves. On behalf of his  faction Isakov came out with two foreign policy bills -- on the  ratification of plans to join the Partnership for Peace program  and on the lifting of economic sanctions against Serbia.    Isakov told Interfax that practically no factions and groups  in the State Duma opposed the idea of compulsory ratification.  Even the Russia's Choice faction, which integrated, among  others, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, saw the pro's and  contra's of the Russian integration into the program and was  willing to play the NATO card in its own interests.    The endorsement of a foreign policy bill would set a serious  precedent and that was what put the reformist factions Russia's  Choice and Yabloko on the alert. Nonetheless, Isakov hoped the  national interests would prevail.    So far, Isakov said, the President and his Foreign Minister  saw the parliament's role in foreign policy-making as  insignificant. The bombing raid on Serb positions in Bosnia,  rather than the political lineup in Russia, motivated the  decision to put off plans to join the NATO program. Isakov saw  the attack on Serb positions as a blow on Yeltsin, Kozyrev and  the whole of Russia.</p>

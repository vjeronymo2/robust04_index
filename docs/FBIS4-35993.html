			<p>BFN     [Text] The user trial of India's surface-to-surface  missile Prithvi [Earth] commenced today. The launch began at  the interim test range at Chandipur-on-Sea in Orissa at 1144  hours [0614 GMT] today. The first launch in the series fully  met the mission's requirements. Our correspondent Rizwana  Akhtar who witnessed the launch reports:    [Begin Rizwana Akhtar recording] Prithvi, India's  surface-to-surface short-range missile, was successfully  launched from the interim test range at Chandipur this morning.  The missile executed a perfect takeoff at 1140 hours [as heard]  soaring into the clear blue sky followed by a trail of fire and  smoke. The missile was clearly visible to the naked eye for a  short time before disappearing. In the morning when countdown  began, there was an air of expectation and people clamored to  get a vantage position to witness the launch. The tense  atmosphere was broken by a surge of spontaneous applause.  Scientists of the DRDO [Defense Research and Development  Organization] who have helped develop the missile and officials  monitoring the launch were jubilant at the success and were seen  congratulating each other. The silver-white Prithvi with red  stripes is smaller in size and dimension than the Agni [Fire]  missile. But the sense of achievement of mission accomplished  was greater than any I have seen before. [end recording]</p>

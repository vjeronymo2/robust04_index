			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japan speaks up for Asia region - Tokyo's backing for a South Korean to head the WTO Japan, increasingly torn between the US and Asia, has plunged into the campaign for dynamic Asia-Pacific economies to gain a bigger voice in the world trading system. The Tokyo government's recent decision to back Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, as candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation, marks a startling break with past reticence. Japan never openly declared support for a particular candidate in the searches for previous director generals of the WTO's predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Its decision to come out in the open and support Mr Kim, rather than fall in with the consensus, is the latest example of Japan's tentative attempts to set its own agenda on international affairs. 'The global trading system should not be run by just a handful of nations from Europe and North America,' explains a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Japan is not, he hastens to add, seeking a specifically Asian regional voice for the WTO, which it wants to be as global in its influence as the next man. Yet it is 'welcome for an Asian to raise his hand'. This marks another step in the shift of the country's formerly US-centred trade and foreign policy towards Asia, its fastest growing export market and investment destination. Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia; now the balance is the other way. Fresh from defying Washington over bilateral trade, Japan, under its new Asian-oriented prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, is busy cultivating its nearest neighbours. Until the world's second largest economy offered its support to Mr Kim, the South Korean was an outsider in the race for the WTO, despite his formidable record as a negotiator in the Uruguay Round. Against him are ranked Mr Carlos Salinas, former president of Mexico, likely to receive US support as a big player in the North American Free Trade Agreement; and Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister backed by the European Union. Apart from Japan, Mr Kim has backing from Australia, keen to lift the profile of the budding Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, and of course from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). They back Mr Kim for very similar reasons. An Australian trade ministry official says: 'We are dealing with a different Gatt, with an enlarged membership, and in which a large share of the growth is coming from Apec. We don't want it to be too Euro-centred.' Yet privately, senior Japanese diplomats admit that even with support from Japan and Australia, Mr Kim may still be an outsider in the WTO race, due to be settled by consensus, probably by the end of November. Why, then, back him? One theory, held in European diplomatic circles, is that Japan may be prepared to negotiate over Mr Kim in exchange for some other form of recognition of Asia-Pacific economies' importance in the WTO. The truth, explains a senior retired Japanese diplomat, is much simpler. Tokyo can hardly say No to a South Korean candidate - who was after all put forward by his own government - at a time when Japan is striving to purge its wartime record in Asia. This, plus the growing importance of Japan's Asian export markets, has led to a sharp rise in the political influence of the Foreign Ministry's Asian affairs bureau. 'It is almost taboo to say No to Korea,' he explains. Not that Japan's trade and foreign policy is as passive as it used to be. An independent line was clear when Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister, refused in February to follow the time-honoured tradition of caving in at the last minute to US bilateral trade demands, in this case for numerical targets for import penetration. To this must be added Japan's clearest statement yet, at the end of last month, of the conditions under which it wishes to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. A smaller example is its willingness over the past week to deepen trade links with Taiwan, thereby risking China's anger. All in all, it adds up to a Japan that looks as if it wants to take a more vigorous role in shaping the WTO than it did in Gatt.</p>

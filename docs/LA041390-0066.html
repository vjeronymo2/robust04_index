			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NATIONALISM AND RACIAL MADNESS' -- A PARTIAL TEXT OF APOLOGY  </P> <P> Following are excerpts from a joint statement by East Germany's Parliament on  Thursday:  </P> <P>  We, the first freely elected parliamentarians of the GDR (East Germany), admit  responsibility as Germans in East Germany for their history and their future  and declare unanimously before the world:  </P> <P> Immeasurable suffering was inflicted on the peoples of the world by Germans  during the era of national socialism. Nationalism and racial madness led to  genocide, particularly of the Jews in all European countries, of the people of  the Soviet Union, the Polish people and the Gypsy people.  </P> <P> Parliament . . . admits responsibility on behalf of the citizens of this land  for the humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children. We  feel sorrow and shame, and acknowledge this burden of German history.  </P> <P> We ask all the Jews of the world to forgive us. We ask the people of Israel to  forgive us for the hypocrisy and hostility of official East German policies  toward Israel and for the persecution and humiliation of Jewish citizens in our  country after 1945 as well.  </P> <P> We declare our willingness to contribute as much as possible to the healing of  mental and physical sufferings of survivors and to provide a just form of  compensation for material losses.  </P> <P> We are for giving persecuted Jews asylum in East Germany.  </P> <P> We wish to integrate Germany in a pan-European security system in such a way  that our people are guaranteed peace and security.  </P> <P> We are aware that the changes in our country would not have been possible  without new thinking and perestroika (program of reform and restructuring) in  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The East German Volkskammer (Parliament) acknowledges that East Germany shares  guilt for the crushing of the "Prague Spring" (reform movement) of 1968 by  Warsaw Pact troops. Because of fear and cowardice, we failed to hinder this  violation of international law.  </P> <P> The . . . Parliament of East Germany asks the people of Czechoslovakia to  forgive us for the injustice done.  </P> <P> The East German people, through their peaceful revolution in the autumn of  1989, removed the dividing effects of the inhuman inter-German border.  </P> <P> Now the two parts of Germany should grow together and thus promote the creation  of a pan-European peace order within the framework of the CSCE (35-nation  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) process.  </P> <P> We declare solemnly once more our unequivocal recognition of the German borders  with neighboring states that resulted from World War II.  </P> <P> The Polish people in particular should know that their right to live within  safe borders will not be questioned by territorial claims from us Germans,  either now or in the future.  </P> <P> We confirm the inviolability of the Oder-Neisse border with the Republic of  Poland as a foundation for the peaceful coexistence of our peoples in a common  European house. This should be confirmed by treaty by a future pan-German  parliament.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / People: Sir Sydney Lipworth to be chairman of Zeneca Pharmaceutical company Zeneca has ended a long search for a chairman to replace Sir Denys Henderson when he retires at the company's annual meeting next May. His successor is Sir Sydney Lipworth (above), the former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Zeneca was demerged from chemicals company ICI last year and yesterday's appointment increases the difference between the two. Sir Denys, currently chairman of both and an ICI man all his working life, is replaced at ICI by Ronnie Hampel, also a company man. South African-born Sir Sydney has been a director of at least six companies, ranging from BAT Industries to J. Rothschild Holdings. Furthermore, Sir Sydney will be a part-time and non-executive chairman, with Zeneca chief executive David Barnes solely in command. Sir Sydney, 63, is already a non-executive director of Carlton Communications, deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank and chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. He graduated from the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and practised as a barrister before moving to the UK in 1964. He was a director of Abbey Life Assurance group before he co-founded Allied Dunbar, now one of the UK's biggest insurance companies. Sir Denys is 62 next month, the normal retirement age for Zeneca. He said in January that he would take over the chairmanship of the Rank Organisation when he left ICI and Zeneca.</p>

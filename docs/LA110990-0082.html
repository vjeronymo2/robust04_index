			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN SLAYING  </P> <P> A reputed Oxnard gang member denied he killed a 17-year-old clerk after  exchanging dirty looks with a passenger in the victim's car in a gang-related  incident of "mad-dogging."  </P> <P> Jessie Casares, 20, pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court  Wednesday to charges of murder and possession of a firearm in the Oct. 22  shooting death of William F. Leadbetter of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Casares also denied a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, which  stemmed from an earlier conviction for possessing a dagger, Deputy Dist. Atty.  Donald C. Glynn said.  </P> <P> William was driving along 5th Street with a passenger, Joey Ramirez, 20, an  alleged member of the Trouble Street El Rio gang, when the two passed a car  driven by Casares, an alleged member of the rival Colonia gang, police said.  </P> <P> Casares and Ramirez began exchanging dirty looks or "mad-dogging," police said,  and both cars pulled into the parking lot of a coin-operated laundry. Casares  got out of his car and began shooting a .25-caliber pistol, hitting William  once in the eye, police said.  </P> <P> Judge Steven Hintz ordered Casares held in lieu of $250,000 bail pending a  preliminary hearing next month.

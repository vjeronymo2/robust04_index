			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Tiphook's finance director resigns The exodus from Tiphook continued yesterday with the resignations of the troubled transport leasing company's finance director and company secretary. Half of the group's ten board members had resigned in March. Tiphook said the latest departures reflected clashes of management style with the new chairman, Mr Ian Clubb. Mr Andrew Chandler, finance director, is likely to receive compensation of about Pounds 100,000, as he had a one-year contract. This compares with compensation payments of Pounds 2.68m in the year to April 1994, during which the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 331.1m. Mr Philip Price, company secretary, was not a director, and it is understood that his compensation will be significantly less. Tiphook played down the significance of the departures, which were described as amicable. Mr Clubb, the former finance director of BOC Group, only recently took over as chairman, following his appointment in June. He was seen as wanting to stamp his authority on the finance systems of a company which has in the past found it hard to predict revenue streams. Mr Chandler had just returned from the US, where he and Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's chief executive, have been talking to the lawyers representing plaintiffs in a Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) class action suit against Tiphook. The US investors claim they were misled when they bought Dollars 700m of bonds shortly before Tiphook's transformation from a high-flying container leasing company into a substantial loss maker. Tiphook said there were no developments to report from these meetings, and that they were not connected to Mr Chandler's decision to leave. He is to work until the end of November. Mr Chandler was himself a sudden appointment, replacing his former boss Mr Roger Braidwood, who left 'amicably' in August 1993 and received Pounds 560,000 in compensation. Tiphook said recruitment of a new finance director was 'already under way', and a new company secretary was due to join 'shortly'. It is understood that Mr Montague will shortly be served with a bankruptcy petition, over a Pounds 2.3m loan from Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Montague claims he is in no financial difficulty.</p>

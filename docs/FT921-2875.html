			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Spending boost would build for long-term prosperity The Liberal Democrat manifesto said: Be warned - this manifesto may not be what you expect. This manifesto does not promise good times just around the corner. It does not avoid difficult questions out of fear of unpopularity. It simply tells the truth; the truth about what Liberal Democrats believe has to be done in order for Britain to succeed. Britain's prosperity Emergency programme should reduce unemployment by at least 600,000 over two years. Increased spending on public transport, housing, hospitals, schools, energy efficiency and conservation, education and training. Support for transport infrastructure. Freeze on business rates this year. Training incentive for firms through levy equal to 2 per cent of payroll, from which they would deduct their expenditure on training. Employers to release employees under 19 for minimum of two days a week further education and/or training. New regional development and local enterprise agencies. Tecs to provide business services, acting as effective voice for business at local level, and overseeing training of those in employment. Encouragement for decentralisation of banks and other financial institutions. Immediate increase in government science budget to 0.35 per cent of GDP and raise it steadily thereafter. Tough action against monopolies, mergers and financial raids. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will be combined with the Office of Fair Trading and made independent of government. A Restrictive Practices Act will penalise anti-competitive behaviour and end price-fixing by cartels. We will encourage greater competition in the banking sector. Break-up of monopoly providers of services such as BT and British Gas. We will permit access by private operators to the British Rail track network. We will liberalise the coal industry. Encouragement for decentralised wage bargaining. Substantial increase in investment in schemes to encourage innovation in industry, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in manufacturing. We will reform corporation tax and the taxation of savings to achieve even treatment for different forms of savings. Encouragement for long-term approach to private investment. We will reverse the burden of proof for acquisitions away from the target company towards the predator, and require companies to ballot shareholders on bid plans . We will reform company law to require greater disclosure of information such as expenditure on research and development. We will define the responsibilities of non-executive directors and insist that all publicly quoted companies have them on their boards. Encouragement for small businesses and the self-employed, by relieving the administrative burden, legislating to make interest payable on overdue debt, and encouraging Tecs, chambers of commerce and local enterprise agencies to reorganise to form a network of business-led one-stop shops. We will encourage, and if necessary legislate for, banks to treat small businesses fairly by agreeing contracts for services. Encouragement for flexibility in working patterns. Legislation to establish the right of every private sector employee in a substantial company to have access to a share in ownership and/or in the profits they help to create. The right for every employee to participate in decision-making in their enterprise. We will set up a new Industrial Partnership Agency to help companies and employees find the precise forms of partnership which suit them. We will change the ways economic policy is made and implemented. Our key changes are: An operationally independent Bank of England to become the Central Bank of the UK. Moving sterling to the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism as soon as possible, helping stable progress towards lower interest rates. Taxes and public spending to be set to reach a 'savings target' for the nation over a period of years. We will set a target as a total of private- and public-sector savings, and adjust fiscal policy to achieve the target over the medium term. We will publish a draft Budget four months before the final version. This will make it easier to measure the impact of economic policy on the environment. Independent National Statistical Commission to collect and publish statistics and improve their quality. Working towards European economic and monetary union, including the establishment of an independent European Central Bank and a single European currency. We will renounce the Conservatives' Maastricht opt-out' clause, accept the timetabled approach to EMU, and renegotiate the Social Chapter with a positive British input. The environment Liberal Democrats will: Reform land use planning so that the protection of the natural environment becomes a major feature of the planning system. Improve public transport, reduce traffic congestion, and encourage pedestrianisation and cycling schemes. We will make compensation for excessive commercial noise more widely available. Provide grants for recycling schemes, introduce regulations on the use of packaging materials. We will use market mechanisms, where feasible, to reduce pollution. Direct controls will still be needed in some cases. We will: Set targets for cutting pollution. Introduce a system of tradable emission licences. Create a new Department of Natural Resources with sole responsibility for environmental protection. To conserve energy we will: Support a Community-wide Energy Tax on all energy sources. Invest in energy conservation and efficiency. We will set new energy efficiency standards for homes, offices and factories, and for products such as light bulbs, fridges and cookers. Double government spending on renewable energy research. Aim to phase out nuclear fission power stations by the year 2020 and will not proceed further with the construction of the Sizewell B PWR. By expanding provision and quality of public transport and reducing dependence on the private car, we will improve travel efficiency and protect the environment. We will achieve this by: Investment in public transport. Immediate improvements in the rail network. A reduction in fuel consumption. Long-term increases in petrol prices phased in gradually by applying Energy Tax to petrol, while graduating Vehicle Excise Duty and Car Tax according to fuel efficiency. We will scrap the remaining tax breaks for company cars and apply tougher limits to permitted emissions. Making concessionary fares on local public transport widely available and a variety of road-pricing schemes. Approving major motorway or trunk road investments only where it can be demonstrated that alternative transport provision cannot meet the need at lower eco-nomic and environmental cost. Expanding airports outside the south-east, while at the same time freezing further development at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Britain's skills A single Department of Education and Training, a National Qualifications Council to co-ordinate a single system of academic and vocational courses for 14-19 year olds, and a Higher Education Standards Council. A fully independent HM Inspectorate of Education and Training. We will: Guarantee pre-school education for every child and introduce a National Record of Achievement. Reduce class sizes and reward academic and vocational achievements. Broaden post-16 education and improve Special Educational Needs provision. Phase out the Assisted Places Scheme and review the charitable status of independent schools. Increase the number of students in higher education to 2m by the year 2000. Establish a proper career structure for research fellows and Pay Review Body for academic and non-academic staff to halt the brain drain. Britain's people Our priorities are: A decent level of health service funding. Resources for preventive medicine, health education and occupational health. An effective Patient's Charter and a comprehensive no-fault compensation scheme. New National Inspectorate for Health to guarantee a quality service. Providing housing We will: Introduce housing cost relief weighted towards those most in need and available to house buyers and renters. This will replace mortgage tax relief for future home buyers. Boost house building and renovation. Improve tenants' rights to better standards of repair and maintenance. Take urgent action on homelessness. Protecting people Liberal Democrats will: Give local authorities the powers to develop comprehensive community crime prevention programmes. Put more police officers on the beat. Establish a Ministry for Justice, merging the relevant functions of the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department. Radically reform conditions inside prisons. Incomes for all Our objectives are to simplify and integrate the two systems, to mount a determined assault on poverty and dependence, and to protect our citizens from want. We will work towards the eventual creation of a new Citizen's Income', payable to all irrespective of sex or status. Our immediate priorities, which will act as steps towards the Citizen's Income, include: Immediate improvements in benefits - increasing Child Benefit by Pounds 1 per week. Income support for under-25s at the full rate, an increase of Pounds 8.50 per week. Increasing the basic state pension immediately by Pounds 5 a week for single pensioners, and by Pounds 8 a week for married couples. Basic pension to be uprated every year in line with average earnings, to be paid for by abolishing SERPS. A statutory framework of protection, including employee representation on occupational pension trusts. Further improvements in benefits. Unifying income tax and employees' National Insurance contributions. Making the investment needed to end the recession, using the money borrowed by the Conservatives to pay for their pre-election tax cuts. We will also raise the basic rate of income tax by one penny in the pound to pay for the improvements essential to education. Equal opportunities Liberal Democrats will: Fight discrimination by incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law and then extending it into a full UK Bill of Rights. Guarantee equal pay for work of equal value. Introduce a flexible 'decade of retirement' for men and women, in which people may choose to retire and take a state pension at any time between ages 60 and 70 (the value of the pension increasing with the age of retirement). Protect the rights of ethnic minorities. Britain's partners Liberal Democrats will take decisive steps towards a fully integrated, federal and democratic European Community. Our vision of the new Europe is of a federal community, where power is exercised at the lowest level consistent with good governm ent. For us, federalism means decentralisation: passing powers down more than passing them up. Our priorities are: Economic and monetary union including establishment of independent European Central Bank and single European currency. We will renounce the Conservatives' opt-out' clause and accept the timetable for Emu. Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Further moves to European union, and enlargement, must depend on the institutions of the EC becoming truly democratic. We will: Set out the rights of the European citizen. Increase the democratic powers of the European Parliament. Introduce fair votes for the 1994 British elections to the European Parliament. Make the Commission more accountable. Increase democracy and accountability in the Council of Ministers. Sharing security We will: Develop common European Community foreign and security policies. Instigate a comprehensive review of UK defence policy. Establish an Arms Conversion Agency to help arms manufacturers to diversify and convert out of the defence field, funded by savings made in the defence budget. Maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent. Propose new disarmament initiatives covering all categories of conventional and nuclear weapons. Britain's democracy We will: Introduce proportional representation for all elections. We propose the single transferable vote, by which electors cast their votes in multi-member constituencies based on natural communities. Introduce fixed-term Parliaments of four years. Reform the House of Lords. We will maintain a second chamber as a Senate, primarily elected by the citizens of the nations and UK regions.

We will decentralise power to the new national and regional governments.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Little relief seen for investors after Maastricht vote THE poor performance of French government bonds yesterday underlined that Sunday's narrow vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty will bring little early relief to bond market investors. For the market to flourish, France must still succeed where the UK and Italy failed: defending its hard-pressed currency within the EMS while delivering lower interest rates demanded by a weak domestic economy. The Bank of France certainly disappointed bond market optimists yesterday by keeping its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per cent, a level which has prevailed since December. But the foreign exchange markets dictated that interest rates could not be cut. The franc closed the day at FFr3.42 against the D-Mark, still too close to its EMS floor for any unilateral easing of interest rates. Indeed, the Bank of France was rumoured to have intervened in support of the franc. 'The credibility of the 'franc fort' policy remains under severe strain,' commented Mr Philip Tyson, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. The risk of a devaluation has already been partially factored into French government bond prices. The yield spread over German bonds at the benchmark 10-year maturity stood at 112 basis points at the close yesterday, from a low of 40 basis points at the start of this year and 58 basis points before Danish voters rejected Maastricht. Analysts believe the French may be able to cut interest rates unilaterally by perhaps  1/4 percentage point this year if pressure on the franc eases. But any further cuts will depend on the pace of interest rate reductions in Germany. There is also a danger that politics will again unsettle the foreign exchange and bond markets in the run-up to parliamentary elections next spring. The conservative parties which urged the French electorate to vote No on Sunday may be more likely to accept a devaluation as an unavoidable cost of lower interest rates. Alternatively, the Socialist government may feel compelled to embark on a reflationary fiscal policy to combat high unemployment. But, in spite of the risks, there are strong reasons to believe the franc can be defended. On most measures France offers better economic fundamentals even than Germany, boasting lower inflation and a lower budget deficit. In contrast to the UK, the French trade balance shows a healthy surplus. The German government, in particular, has a strong political incentive to keep the franc within the system and keep France in the fast track towards a single currency. A devaluation of the franc would also be more damaging to German industry than a devaluation of sterling or the lira. If a devaluation can be averted, logic dictates the yield spread between French and German government bonds should fall to the levels seen earlier this year. Indeed, the yield spread could narrow to less than 40 basis points. After all, the current crisis could be an opportunity for Paris to build a valuable store of credibility, a commodity in short supply in London and Rome.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers rounded up about 175 Palestinians in the West Bank and forced  them to sit blindfolded and bound for up to 16 hours in a soccer stadium, Arab  and Israeli witnesses said. Many were in their pajamas after being seized  overnight in Hebron, apparently on suspicion of planning an action against  Israeli authorities, Israeli sources said. Dozens of the Arabs were later moved  to detention centers while the rest were sent home, the witnesses said. At the  United Nations, a spokeswoman said the Security Council, acting on a request by  Tunisia, will meet today on the continuing violence in the occupied  territories.  </P></p>

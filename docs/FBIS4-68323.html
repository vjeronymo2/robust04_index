			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonard Nikishin, under the rubric "Crisis of </F> Genre": "Russia Has Given the Astro-Vehicle to America;" first  paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] A third of a century separates us from 12  April 1961, when the first space flight was performed. Over that  span of time, the world has changed in a way no one could have  known, and space operations, with their broad scope, have lost  their romantic aura and are being viewed today from pragmatic  standpoints. But they won't have to answer to that criterion  forever.    Twenty-five years ago, the steps taken by Armstrong and  Aldrin on the Moon destroyed the propaganda myth about our  preeminence in space, and since a similar Soviet program (highly  secret) had crumbled completely, our leaders had to quickly save  face with something else. The helping hand turned out to be  excellent: an orbital station, an "outpost for man in the  Universe."    They rivetted it together hastily, as we say. At that time,  in the early '70s, the design bureau of Academician Vladimir  Chelomey was slowly developing the Almaz manned station for  military purposes (which ultimately was of no use to the  military). The drawings for the structure of the living quarters  had already been done. In Sergey Korolev's design bureau, those  quarters were quickly filled with gear from the Soyuz  spacecraft, and the Salyut-1 station was practically ready.  Brezhnev, with obvious relief, announced that we were  "travelling a different path, one that is step-by-step and  focused," in the exploration of space.    The Americans had achieved the political objective of  recovering the country's prestige, and with the end of the  Apollo flights, they no longer thought about the Moon. But our  fixation on orbital stations lasted decades. There was no  particular mystery about it: here it turned out to be possible  to have a propaganda gain, demonstrate the "power of socialism,"  strengthen "international friendship" in orbit, etc. Serving  that aim were, primarily, the Salyuts, which followed one after  the other, and, later, the Mir station. Of course, their  numerous crews also performed scientific and technical research.  The cosmonauts conducted observations of Earth and photographed  it, they experimented with the production of new materials and  biopreparations in microgravity, and space medicine garnered  experience. In no way do I wish to cast aspersions on that  research -- but it's important to note here that the results of  that research turned out not to be commensurate with the immense  amount of spending for the development and operation of the  orbital stations. In addition, virtually nothing was later used  by the national economy.    It was Yuriy Andropov, after he became general secretary,  who  raised the question, "Why are they up there circling around?" At  his behest, the creation of a special commission got under way;  but the general secretary died soon after, and with him the  things he initiated. Then, during the years of perestroyka,  Yegor Ligachev got interested in the same thing, but he was soon  distracted by more important matters.    That's how orbital stations came to last to this day. The  cosmonauts go aloft, stay in orbit, come down, and receive their  stars in the established manner. And although the political gain  today is -- let's put it this way -- minimal, the democratic  authorities haven't set out to change anything here. Foreigners  have worked successfully on the stations -- some for free, some  for money that, for them, by and large, is insubstantial.    But the main thing is this: today, as it was two decades  ago,  everybody is busy. NPO Energiya, the Khrunichev Plant, the  Progress Plant, the Center for Cosmonaut Training, the numerous  medical professionals keeping track of the health of the  celestial travellers, the space-forces officers, and -- as the  last general secretary said -- so forth, and so forth.    That huge infrastructure operates at virtually the same tilt  as in the days of the "great space victories," and it gets by on  virtually just as much. And you won't find anybody who can  explain clearly why this is being done. Oleg Baklanov, it's  true, shared his uncommon thoughts on the pages of the newspaper  DEN about the "karmic striving of Russia to the stars."    But in general, the golden days of the pioneers of space  have  already passed. And no matter how favorably inclined those in  authority are toward it, they can no longer provide that endless  flow of money. Buran, along with Energiya, had to be mothballed.  They haven't managed to replace the ageing Mir with the Mir-2.  And to tell the truth, the manned space flights were quietly  winding down naturally. But something happened that broke the  course of events.    The program for developing an orbital station in the United  States has been in existence for 10 years, but its has never  gotten off the drawing board. In a country with a flourishing  economy, the state did not consider it possible to force  expensive operations with fuzzy goals. Congress was stingy, and  that's not surprising, in light of the strong criticism from the  public. In fact, it's hard to consent to spending billions on  something that is, as the NEW YORK TIMES put it, merely  "adventures, and nothing more."    And here is where the Americans didn't so much luck out, as  luck out incredibly. Russia showed up with its "karma."    An agreement was signed at the governmental level on the  creation of the Alpha international orbital station with Russian  participation. In fact, its proprietor will be the United  States, which is giving Russia $400 million between 1994 and  1997 for its contribution to the effort.    So what would seem to be so bad about that? International  cooperation in the performance of such complex, expensive  projects is a sacred matter. The question is, To what extent  will we be participating, and how much will we be compensated  for it?    The first stage of the creation of Alpha involves the  development of the large fuel/energy unit and the living unit  (base unit and service unit). And, of course, the transport  systems. Russia is doing all that -- the Americans are limited  to small units with science gear (and their expenses are cut by  up to $2 billion a year). They are not rushing with their living  module, leaving its development for after the year 2000.    And that's all for $400 million. By comparison, the  Khrunichev Plant has concluded several contracts for launches of  satellites atop the Proton rocket. The contracts are worth $600  million. The annual cost of leasing Baykonur from Kazakhstan is  about $150 million. "We're getting out of a tough spot today,"  Yuriy Koptev, director of the Russian Space Agency, blurted out,  "and for three kopecks we're selling what it took decades to  produce."    It's hard to blame the Americans -- why would they pass up  an  intellectual product that is incredibly inexpensive and swims  right into their hands? But the question is, Why are we doing  it? After all, the development, manufacture, launch, station  flight control, and station supply -- all that goes far beyond  the bounds of what is, in this case, the insignificant sum of  $400 million. Everything can be explained simply: it's as hard  to get extensions of that work in the context of a national  program as it is easy to get money from the government for an  international program. Just don't violate the agreements. It's  strange that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin didn't see any of that  when he was signing such an important document in the United  States or when he was making substantial concessions to the  Americans by restricting the transfer of cryogenic rocket-motor  technologies to India.    The beginning of the operation of Alpha will be preceded by  extensive operations by the Americans on the existing Russian  orbital station Mir. American research equipment and gear is  being installed on the Priroda and Spektr modules. Thus, the  time will soon come when the station will be operated in the  interests of the Americans. They will spend a total of nearly  two years on Mir, and the cost of that will also come in at  about $400 million; strictly speaking, that money will probably  also go for support of those flights.    In general, the Mir station and all the designs adopted in  the course of its development are of great interest to the  Americans. In actuality, they are now completely revising it.  The developers of the station's onboard systems were sent  questionnaires containing 50-70 items. That unique transfer of  know-how was indirectly stipulated in the contract, although in  another place in the document, it said that the Mir station and  the Space Shuttle (which nobody intends to acquaint us with) are  national systems.    It's not hard to understand the interest displayed by the  other side for our space technologies. In this country, there  was a golden rain in that area; but in the United States, after  the end of the Apollo program, there was never adequate  government financing, private investment couldn't cover  everything, and the best personnel, unlike with us, were  certainly not concentrated in the space sector.    The interaction between the two sides is unique. All the  joint documents, protocols, etc., are prepared by the Americans  and signed in English only. At the same time, according to  employees at the Russian Space Agency and NPO Energiya, the same  small group of specialists went on the working visits to the  United States, and they firmly attached themselves to those  trips. Certainly not all of them speak or read English, and not  all of the technical questions are within their competence. But  they sign everything.    The scope of the work is large. The Alpha station in the  final version is an entire space "settlement" with a set of  national modules, although modestness here, as they say, would  only be decorative. But the Americans are no longer arguing --  they have removed the main burden from themselves.    But we're still operating with the same spending mechanism.  One wonders when reading the decree of the Council of Ministers  of the Russian Federation titled "On State Support and Supply of  Space Operations in the Russian Federation." It's as if written  right from the decrees of the Central Committee and the Council  of Ministers of the '70s, except that they were classified.  Support, permit, allocate, disseminate... The last word pertains  to all sorts of privileges -- the Russian Space Agency, of  course, did not forget itself. There's even a markup for the tax  "for classification" (it is still there, it seems). Not 15  percent, as before, but 20.    It is felt that the impending, substantial budget spending  does not scare our "marketeers," who, in concerns about space  matters, have suddenly become (to the joy of the intellectual  opposition) "state-men." But for which state?</p>

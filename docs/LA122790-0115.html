			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCER SURGERY FOR BLOCK;  </P> <P> SHERIFF: THE 66-YEAR-OLD'S PROSTATE AILMENT IS ANOTHER BLOW IN HIS DEPARTMENT'S  DOWNBEAT YEAR. HE PLANS TO RETURN AFTER SIX WEEKS.  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department weathered a tumultuous year marred by a  corruption scandal and brutality complaints, disclosed Wednesday that he has  cancer of the prostate gland and will undergo surgery next month.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old Block, who was reelected last spring as head of the nation's  largest sheriff's department, told a news conference that he expects to recover  fully from a malady that doctors have diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, or a  gland-related cancer in his prostate.  </P> <P> "I am in exceptionally good health otherwise, and after a recuperation period  of about six weeks, I expect to be fully recovered and back to full duty with  the department," said Block.  </P> <P> Prostate cancer affects about one in 11 U.S. men, according to health  statistics. Block said his illness was first diagnosed about six weeks ago  during a routine physical examination that spurred further tests.  </P> <P> Since then, the sheriff said he has been undergoing hormonal therapy in  anticipation of surgery now scheduled for Jan. 7 at the Norris Cancer Hospital  &amp; Research Institute in the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. During  his recovery period, Block said, he will turn over day-to-day supervision of  his department to Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds.  </P> <P> "But I can assure you that after the first few days of recovery, I will be  requesting and receiving regular briefings as to what is occurring in the  department operations," Block said.  </P> <P> The surprise medical announcement was sent by Teletype to the department's  12,000 employees at sheriff's stations and other department offices. Edmonds,  52, the department's second-highest official, said that only a few family  members and Block aides were aware of the sheriff's diagnosis.  </P> <P> "He's well-prepared to undergo the surgery," said Edmonds, who was summoned  from vacation to attend the news conference. "He has a very good attitude about  it and his overall health is very good."  </P> <P> For the Sheriff's Department, Block's medical condition came as the latest blow  in a downbeat year -- a year the sheriff himself described Wednesday as a  "mixed bag of pluses and minuses."  </P> <P> The most traumatic event was the money-skimming scandal, which arose from  allegations that officers pocketed money seized during narcotics operations.  The scandal forced Block to dismantle the department's vaunted narcotics teams,  which had been responsible for some of the county's largest seizures of cocaine  and illegally obtained cash.  </P> <P> In the wake of a federal and local corruption investigation, six sheriff's  narcotics officers were convicted recently of conspiracy and theft. A seventh  officer also was convicted on a related money-laundering charge.  </P> <P> Two more trials are scheduled, and Block said the narcotics scandal may result  in additional indictments against deputies.  </P> <P> In retrospect, the sheriff acknowledged that the narcotics investigation  revealed "a breakdown of supervision" in some cases. But he staunchly defended  his administration in the scandal, blaming "a handful" of problem officers for  the corruption.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Block also defended his agency against criticism on other issues  that surfaced in 1990, including accusations that his officers engaged in  excessive force and unwarranted shootings and that a clique of deputies at the  Lynwood sheriff's station adopted street gang behavior to intimidate their  supervisors and citizens.  </P> <P> Block, who has already said he is investigating the Lynwood complaints,  disputed many of the allegations and dismissed other complaints as  unsubstantiated accusations that arise from lawsuits targeting law enforcement  officers.  </P> <P> Although the number of deputy-involved shootings has increased -- from 37 in  1989 to 46 through November of this year -- Block blamed the rise on an overall  increase in street violence in the county.  </P> <P> Homicides handled by his department have soared by 32% this year compared to  1989, and felony assaults have jumped 18%, the sheriff said. In addition, six  deputies have been wounded in street violence, compared to four last year, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, after skin cancer. One  out of every 11 men will develop it, most of them after age 65. About 30,000  men die from the disease each year, making it the second leading cause of  cancer deaths in men, after lung cancer. However, prostate cancer is often  curable when caught early. Many cases are detected during rectal examinations,  which are recommended annually for all men older than 40. The disease is  treated surgically. Radiation, hormone treatment and chemotherapy may be  prescribed as well. If the cancer has spread beyond the gland, cure is less  certain. But patients whose tumors are still confined to the prostate have a  five-year survival rate of 84%, according to the National Cancer Institute.  About 60% of prostate cancers are diagnosed at this relatively early stage.  </P></p>

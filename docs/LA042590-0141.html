			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-ISRAEL U.S. LOBBY CRITICIZES SECRET AID FOR JERUSALEM HOUSING  </P> <P> The head of the leading pro-Israel lobby in Washington has criticized the  Israeli government's secret financing of Jewish housing in the Christian sector  of Jerusalem, it was disclosed Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs  Committee (AIPAC), questioned the timing of the move into the Christian quarter  of East Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Dine delivered his criticism to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir through  an emissary.  </P> <P> He told Shamir the Israeli government is "doing great harm" to Israel's  standing with the Bush Administration and the American public, sources said.  </P> <P> Although American Jewish groups frequently disagree on a wide range of issues,  it is unusual for AIPAC objections to Israeli government action to be reported  publicly.  </P> <P> The State Department on Monday sharply criticized the Israeli government for  financing the purchase of a sublease on a hospice owned by a Greek Orthodox  church to be rented to new Soviet Jewish immigrants. Two weeks ago, about 150  Jews moved onto the site.  </P> <P> Israeli courts have ordered the Jews evicted, a decision the Bush  Administration has welcomed.  </P> <P> Dine called the move to buy a sublease on the hospice "a provocation," said the  sources, who provided information about Dine's statements only on condition  that they not be identified.  </P> <P> Dine's assertion paralleled the State Department's description of the purchase  as "an insensitive and provocative action."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is as it should be. The COLA model compares overall living costs in the allowance area with overall living costs in the DC area. If housing is more expensive because solar heaters are common in an allowance area but not the DC area and if overall utility costs are lower in the allowance area because solar heaters are used extensively but are not used in the DC area, the final comparison of overall housing costs will be equitable. No special consideration of capital improvement costs or reduced utility consumption is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters noted that employees in the allowance areas face extreme weather disturbances, particularly typhoons or hurricanes. The commenters stated that these weather disturbances create higher costs in home maintenance and insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer surveys the cost of home insurance. If insurance costs increase after a major natural disaster, the COLA surveys will reflect these higher costs. Other issues, such as the cost of repairing storm damage, are more difficult to address in the surveys. Although it may be possible to price the cost of repairing or replacing an item such as a window or a roof, it is difficult to know how often this must be done in each allowance area compared with the Washington, DC, area. In the employee survey, OPM asked about storm damage, home maintenance, and frequency of repairs. OPM plans to review this issue carefully in light of the results of the employee survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asserted that Federal employees frequently purchase disaster insurance (e.g., home insurance covering damage caused by floods, storms, or earthquakes) and criticized Runzheimer for not including the cost of these additional insurance riders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer interviews local insurance agents to obtain the cost of insurance in each area. In these interviews, Runzheimer asked agents about disaster insurance and whether it was typically purchased by homeowners in the allowance area. Runzheimer concluded from these interviews that such insurance is not typically purchased and, therefore, recommended against including it in the COLA model. OPM agreed. However, questions regarding disaster insurance were included in the employee survey. OPM plans to reevaluate this issue in light of the results of the employee survey and address this issue in its report to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter noted that Runzheimer was unable to obtain the price of home insurance on Guam because insurance companies had issued a temporary ``moratorium'' on the sales of new policies after Typhoon Omar. The commenter criticized Runzheimer for using 1991 survey data in place of the missing data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer discussed the Guam insurance issue with OPM as soon as the issue arose. Because there was no indication of the amount of any forthcoming rate increase or that rates would increase at all, Runzheimer and OPM believed that it was inappropriate to adjust artificially the 1991 insurance rates. To the extent insurance companies adjusted their rates after the moratorium, such rate changes were obtained in the following Guam survey and will be appropriately reflected in the results of that survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned how Runzheimer obtained survey data in Kauai after Hurricane Iniki because the Runzheimer researcher from the central office had not been allowed to visit the island. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the living cost data are obtained by either: (1) Local data collectors who are residents of the area or (2) by telephone research conducted from Runzheimer's central office. Senior personnel from Runzheimer's central office visit the allowance areas to monitor and review the survey process. These visits are conducted after the on-site data collection is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of the Kauai survey, all on-site data collection had been completed prior to the arrival of Iniki. The fact that Runzheimer officials from the central office were unable to visit the island is not significant because the data collector had done an excellent job, and the quality of the data collected was quite good. Because the prices surveyed were pre-Iniki, they were not influenced by any short-term perturbations caused by the hurricane. Runzheimer officials were able to visit Kauai as part of the summer 1993 survey, and a great deal of attention was given to collecting and analyzing data from that later survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also stated that because some utilities were not widely available for an extended period after Hurricane Iniki, the living cost surveys might show that utility usage was low. He said that this could bias the survey results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The utility usage factors that Runzheimer obtained on Kauai were based on a period prior to Iniki. Therefore, the hurricane did not distort the survey data. In the conduct of the most recent survey, Runzheimer paid close attention to utility usage rates to ensure that the survey results were not unduly influenced by the effects of Iniki. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters said that climate conditions (such as high humidity, high rainfall, sunlight intensity, airborne salt, snow, and cold weather) resulted in higher home maintenance costs in the allowance areas than in the Washington, DC, area. One commenter believed that some home maintenance expenses were incurred more frequently in the allowance areas but that Runzheimer considered only annual maintenance costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the employee survey, OPM asked several questions concerning home maintenance, such as painting and roof replacement. OPM is also studying these issues in a closely related, special research project. OPM plans to integrate the results of the employee survey with the special research and include this in its report to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Drop of 3% at Daiwa House DAIWA House Industry, a leading Japanese housing company, yesterday reported a drop in interim pre-tax profits due to a fall in financial revenues countering a rise in sales. For the first six months to September, Daiwa House posted a 3 per cent fall in non-consolidated taxable profits to Y43.8bn (Dollars 353m), on a 7.9 per cent rise in sales to Y464.6bn. Net profits edged ahead by 0.9 per cent to Y22.2bn. Slack housing sales were offset by improved housing rentals. However, the company blamed the fall in profits on a Y5.7bn decline in interest income. Orders of its housing construction division rose 1.4 per cent, while building redevelopments fell 20.9 per cent. For the 12 months to March, Daiwa House expects pre-tax profits to fall 0.6 per cent to Y90bn on a 6.5 per cent rise in sales to Y940bn. Hazama, a leading Japanese engineering and construction company, reported a sharp fall in first-half earnings due to sluggish private-sector orders. Non-consolidated interim pre-tax profits plunged 41.1 per cent to Y8.65bn on a 7.8 per cent fall in sales to Y277.8bn. Net profits slid 44.2 per cent to Y3.3bn.</p>

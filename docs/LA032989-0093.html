			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOSSAGE, NIPPER GIVEN UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE BY CUBS  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs Tuesday released Rich (Goose) Gossage, one of baseball's  premier relief pitchers.  </P> <P> The club said Gossage and another pitcher, Al Nipper, were given unconditional  release, trimming the team roster to 27 players.  </P> <P> Gossage finished the 1987 season with 289 career saves, 52 behind Rollie  Fingers' major league record of 341. Coming into last season, he had made 577  consecutive relief appearances.  </P> <P> But his career floundered with the Cubs, who acquired him from San Diego for  Keith Moreland in February, 1988. He had a 4-4 record last season and had a  4.33 earned-run average in 46 games.  </P> <P> Nipper, 29, came to the Cubs with Calvin Shiraldi in a trade with the Boston  Red Sox in December, 1987. He was 2-4 with 3.04 ERA in 22 games, including 12  starts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Unilever Drops Faberge Deal: Unilever, the European consumer products  conglomerate, said it has dropped plans to purchase the Faberge and Elizabeth  Arden lines of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances for $1.55 billion from  Riklis Family Corp. Negotiations broke down because the Riklis group sought  "significant changes in the structure and terms of the transaction, which would  have involved Unilever in substantial additional costs," according to Unilever  United States Inc., the U.S. arm of the British-Dutch household and consumer  products giant. Among some of the name brands of Faberge and its independent  subsidiary, Elizabeth Arden, are Chloe, Lagerfeld, Aqua Net and Brut.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> KASSEBAUM SEEKS 3RD TERM  </P> <P> Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) signed the necessary forms and paid the  $984 filing fee today to officially enter the running for a third six-year term  in the Senate.  </P> <P> Kassebaum, 57, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had said in  May that she would seek reelection, but she kept even her staff members in  suspense until the official announcement at her Washington office. The reason  for the suspense was that Kassebaum had pledged to serve only two terms in the  Senate.  </P> <P> Kassebaum, the daughter of 1936 Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon,  declined to rule out a 1996 reelection bid and said she got herself in trouble  by pledging to end her Senate career in 1990.  </P></p>

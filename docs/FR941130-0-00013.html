			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of those who commented on this issue expressed support for it. A state banking commissioner and a consumer group each commented that a one-year eligibility record date would help curb insider abuses. One person said the FDIC should not set an eligibility record date. Another person expressed support for the one-year eligibility requirement but suggested that it might not weed out professional depositors because many of them have deposits with savings banks for over a year. Another state regulator said a 90-day eligibility requirement might be sufficient. One bank said 180 days might be sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed Rule requested specific comment on whether the one-year period would be sufficient and on whether the date chosen should be based on the board of directors'/trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should be converted to the stock form of ownership. In general, those who commented on these issues were against extending the record date beyond one year and relating it to a board of directors'/trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should convert to stock form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments received on this issue, the Board has determined that the one-year period is sufficient and that, given the factual nature of the requirement, attempting to establish a starting period based on when a bank's board of directors/trustees first considered whether to convert to stock ownership would be very difficult to implement and regulate. Thus, the Board has decided to adopt the eligibility record date requirement of the Proposed Rule because, as stated in the comments, it properly protects the legitimate interests of core depositors and provides sufficient assurance that long-term supporters of an institution are given priority. Also, as stated in the Proposed Rule, the one-year period is a minimum time period. Converting State Savings Banks are encouraged to designate longer time periods if appropriate to encompass longer-term depositors in the local communities served by the bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Local Depositor Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Rule also included a required stock purchase preference for eligible depositors in the bank's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting bank. The FDIC proposed the Local Depositor Preference requirement to promote local community participation by long-term depositors in the conversion process and to ensure that the opportunity for local depositors to fully participate in the subscription offering in a mutual-to-stock conversion is not diminished by large purchases made by ``professional depositors''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC received numerous comments on this proposed requirement. Thirteen expressed support for the rule, contending that the preference would rightfully promote local control of the bank and limit the participation of ``professional depositors'' in conversions. They also noted that the Local Depositor Preference would give depositors in the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate in the conversion and reduce the problem of outside investors tending to put undue pressure on management to achieve a higher stock value more rapidly than may be feasible through safe and sound operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight of those who commented on the proposed requirement opposed it, asserting that the rule constituted an unlawful geographic discrimination. They contended that all depositors have ownership, voting and liquidation rights and, thus, a subscription purchase priority should not be related to where a depositor lives. Several of those who commented said that the rule should at least be modified to provide for long-term depositors who moved away from the bank; they and others criticized the 100-mile rule as unworkable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

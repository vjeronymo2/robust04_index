			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Anger at steel subsidy scheme Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, yesterday sharply denounced the steel subsidy package agreed by European Union industry ministers, as 'pure window dressing for the gullibles', and predicted dire consequences for Germany's private steel makers. The deal, which will allow a series of state aids for public-sector steel producers in east Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, worth nearly Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn), also sets capacity cuts of over 5m tonnes. Referring to yesterday as 'a black Friday for the private steel industry in Europe', he accused the EU of 'once again handing out subsidies to ailing state-owned steel makers at the expense of the taxpayers'. 'Capacity cuts will be made on paper only. In return, the Italian and Spanish steel producers will receive billions in subsidies,' Mr Vondran said. Private steelmakers in Germany argue that capacity cuts offered by Spain and Italy do not correspond to current output levels. Moreover, they add, subsidies will give a competitive edge to state-owned steel companies at the expense of the private sector. They warn this will force private steel companies to further cut capacity and lay off tens of thousands of steel workers. 'The politicians, including the German government, must decide if they are willing to have an efficient German industry destroyed by the industrial policies conducted in other European capitals,' he said. Mr Vondran also accused Bonn of betraying German private steelmakers by winning approval for subsidies for Ekostahl, the steel plant in eastern Germany. The Treuhand privatisation agency, which runs Ekostahl, welcomed the decision and said, 'It paves the way for restructuring the steel mill.' The Treuhand, backed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, had for the past nine months lobbied European Union countries to support subsidies totalling DM1bn (Pounds 393m) to modernise the plant in the eastern state of Brandenburg. Officials at the agency last night insisted that the subsidies would make Ekostahl more competitive, and would not be 'indefinite'. They added that the agreement was expected to restrict production to 900,000 tonnes of raw steel a year until 1999, when output can then be raised to a maximum of 1.7m tonnes a year. Officials added that the Brussels decision was likely to speed privatisation of the mill.</p>

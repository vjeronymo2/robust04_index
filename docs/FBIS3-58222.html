On Wednesday [12  January], there will be the no-confidence debate and vote, then  President Scalfaro will decide when to dissolve the chambers.  Giovanni Masotti reports:    [Masotti] This could be the final week for this brief and  troubled Eleventh legislature -- the last one of the First  Republic. The elections of 5 April 1992 seem like a very long  time ago. These elections brought about the formation of this  parliament, which has been rocked by the Clean Hands enquiry.    In the last few hours, further poisonous speculation has  been  aimed at the president and at the institutions. On Tuesday, an  event will be held that seems to symbolize the end of an era --  on the eve of Wednesday's no-confidence debate, the  parliamentary Immunity Committee will question [Maurizio]  Broccoletti, the former Intelligence and Democratic Security  Service [Sisde] treasurer, and it will examine the position of  the former interior ministers, [Antonio] Gava and [Vicenzo]  Scotti. The day after the no-confidence debate, Prime Minister  Ciampi could go to the Quirinale Palace [president's office] and  hand in his resignation to President Scalfaro without waiting  for the outcome of the no-confidence vote which has been  presented by Pannella. On Friday, the head of state could then  decide to dissolve the chambers.    In the meantime, all eyes are turned to the possible voting  alliances. There has been hectic activity on the moderate  front, which is trying to gather in its sparse membership. Bossi  has done a U-turn by announcing that federalism can wait, that  the Northern League is happy with regionalism so as not to  divide the Liberal Democrats and to beat Occhetto. Bossi's  declarations have been welcomed by both the Christian Democrat  neo-Centrists who are ready to ditch Martinazzoli and by  Berlusconi, who has been discussing the possibility of an  alliance with the League for a long time.</p>

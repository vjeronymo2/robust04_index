			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelting cuts hit alumina prices Recent prices of alumina (aluminium oxide) are below the operating costs of about two-thirds of western world refinery capacity. 'The (alumina) refinery sector has become a source of concern,' says Alcan, the Canadian aluminium group. Alcan points out that 'demand is fading' because producers around the world are cutting back aluminium output following recent meetings of trade representatives of the big aluminium producing countries. Delegates agreed that annual cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years were needed to bring the market back into balance. That would result in a drop of 3m to 4m tonnes in alumina usage. Ironically, many of the industry's bigger groups are vertically integrated: they dig up bauxite, they refine this ore into alumina, smelt this into aluminium and then make semi-fabricated aluminium products. 'The disparity between costs and market prices is causing integrated producers considerable consternation,' says Alcan in its latest Perspectives newsletter. 'Adding to the consternation is pre-existing dissatisfaction with the historically poor rate of return on refining assets as well as the fact that the refinery sector has become one more problem - along with smelting and rolling - with which management must deal rather than a source of cash to help offset losses elsewhere.' Alcan suggests that the price of readily-available alumina has dropped by about 25 per cent since the middle of last year, from USDollars 160 a tonne to Dollars 120-Dollars 125 a tonne. It quotes Resource Strategies, a US consultancy organisation, which estimates that the average production costs of 12 companies that operate refineries as well as smelters are Dollars 165 to Dollars 260 a tonne, 'before any allowance for a return on the capital invested in refinery capacity'.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Wielding the knife at Thanksgiving - Wall Street While most of the country was enjoying Thanksgiving on Thursday with traditional excesses of turkey and televised American football, thousands of employees of Philip Morris and NCR had little to celebrate. On Wednesday, the food and tobacco group announced plans to close as many as 40 plants and eliminate 14,000 jobs in a restructuring programme intended to reduceits annual operating costs by Dollars 1bn. On the same day the computer group, NCR, said it would offer 25,000 employees early retirement in an attempt to cut 7,500 jobs from its payroll. The layoffs and cost-cutting measures came as a shock to equity markets, primarily because investors believed that the long and painful restructuring of US industry - which has been a feature of life in Corporate America for the past two to three years - had been completed. Philip Morris and NCR, however, have provided a sharp reminder that companies cannot afford to relax their efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency. In an economy where sluggish growth, weak consumer demand and almost non-existent inflation has made price competition keen, companies have to stay fit and fast on their feet to thrive. This point was brought home by the fact that the restructurings at Philip Morris and NCR were not emergency measures to keep struggling businesses afloat. Philip Morris reported a profit of Dollars 4.9bn in 1992, the largest of any US corporation, and although its domestic tobacco business is under intense pricing pressures, its overseas tobacco and food businesses are in good shape. And, while NCR's earnings performance this year has been less than sparkling  -the company lost money in the most recent quarter, dragging down the profits of its parent, the telecommunications group AT&amp;T - computer industry analysts believe NCR is well-placed to prosper, having already made the strategic decision to shift its business away from mainframe and minicomputers toward 'open' networks of linked computers. None of this will be much comfort to the employees of both companies. Neither provided details on where the cuts would be made, which will have ruined Thanksgiving for the many thousands of workers who could lose their jobs in the restructurings. For millions of equity investors, however, Thanksgiving was not as distressing as it might have been, for after a shaky start, the stock markets weathered what could have been a difficult week relatively well. At one point on Monday, conditions were perilous. Bond prices had dropped sharply as investors in fixed-income securities continued to sell government securities amid new evidence of resurgent economic growth. The subsequent rise in bond yields to their highest levels since midsummer, and some heavy losses in overseas equity markets spooked investors in the stock markets, who drove the Dow down more than 40 points at one stage. At that moment, the gloomy prediction of some analysts - that rising bond yields would spark a sharp downward correction in share prices - looked as if it would be fulfilled. But the declines in bond prices on Monday did not carry through to the rest of the week, and an unexpectedly strong bond market rally ensured that stocks stayed mostly in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back with modest advances on the next two days, and were holding their own at mid-morning yesterday. Trading was quiet because the stock markets were closed on Thursday and shut down early on Friday, but the mood among investors was generally upbeat. The recovery in bonds, which lowered long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, from 6.38 per cent to 6.26 per cent, was not the result of a fundamental change in bond market sentiment. After all, there was nothing this week to ease fixed-income investors' concerns that interest rates are now on a steady upward path. Instead, bond prices rebounded on mostly technical considerations - the lack of fresh selling on Tuesday surprised dealers and investors who had sold bonds short in anticipation of further losses, and they were forced to buy bonds to cover their short positions. A decline in commodity and oil prices, the latter sparked by OPEC's failure to agree on production cuts, also supported bond prices. Even if it was technically-driven, the bond market's rally helped assuage fears among equity investors that rapidly rising Treasury yields might bring the long bull market in stocks to a halt. For that, at least, Wall Street could give thanks. Monday         3670.25 - 23.76 Tuesday        3674.17 + 03.92 Wednesday      3687.58 + 13.41 Thursday            Closed Friday         3683.85 -  3.63</p>

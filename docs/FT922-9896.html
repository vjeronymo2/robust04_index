			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Making a silk purse out of a sow's ear - Big changes to the traditional way of life down on the farm Turn off the M25 motorway near St Albans to the north of London and a short drive will bring you to Bowmans Farm. There you can spend a busy afternoon showing the children the farm animals, enjoying home-made ice cream or a full meal in the restaurant and stock up with fresh produce from the farm shop. Up to 200 children pass through each day on school trips and more than 60,000 visitors are expected this year. Bowmans now has more staff on hand to look after its human flock than are required to manage its three dairy herds, its sheep and pigs and its fields of Brussels sprouts and malting barley. For Bowmans, a 450 hectare farm 15 miles to the north of London, diversification away from traditional farming activities has proved to be big business. It started producing ice cream and yoghurt from its surplus milk five years ago and has now expanded farm-related business to the point where it accounts for half of its income and total turnover has risen to Pounds 1.5m. 'Normally the farmer tries to chase people off his land but we encourage them to come on,' says Geoff Lawrence, diversification manager at the 60-year-old farm. 'Most farmers would look at the number of people tramping about the place with horror but you have to get used to dealing with the public.' In recent years many farmers have had little choice. The European Community has been cutting the level of farm price support and subsidies while renegotiation of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (Gatt) has brought additional pressures. No fewer than 41 per cent of the 188,000 agricultural holdings in England and Wales have undertaken some form of diversification activity, according to a recent study by Exeter University. The average increase in the level of farm turnover was Pounds 22,000. But the contented Sunday afternoon tripper should beware of concluding that a new golden age of enterprise has descended on the British farm scene to replace the traditional rural idyll. 'The figure for average farm earnings from diversification is misleadingly high,' says Richard Butt, chief executive of the Rural Development Commission, which seeks to boost the rural economy. 'The level of earnings which produces that average ranges from Pounds 1m to a few hundred pounds. For many farmers, diversification produces a marginal income.' Two-thirds of farm diversification brings in less than Pounds 5,000. One-in-eight of farm businesses produces a loss and if family labour were costed at commercial rates, as many as four-out-of-10 farm diversifications would be making a loss. These statistics suggest that farmers need to approach the idea of diversification with caution. Is their farm close enough to a large centre of population or in a sufficiently attractive area to draw large streams of visitors? They must also take care to avoid setting up in the same business as every other farm in the area or at least make sure that there is enough demand for several competing farms to flourish. 'There is a tendency for everyone to latch on to the same idea; golf courses, mohair farming or snail breeding,' says Butt. Geoffrey Procter did decide to turn a quarter of Wide Open Farm, near York, into a golf course but only after 18 months of very careful study. Physical preparation of the site started a year ago and the first nine holes are due to open in June 1993 with the remaining nine due to be ready a year later. Articles in the farming magazines make creating a golf course sound easy but it involves a lot of careful preparation, says Procter. He called in specialists to design the course and expects to employ an experienced manager to run it. He calculates that his position, near a medium-sized town, will provide a steady flow of golf club members. Making the switch to a new form of activity can frequently involve a large capital outlay and a long delay before the new venture starts producing income. Procter describes the capital outlay on the golf course as 'frightening' but declines to say how much he has spent. John and Carolyn Pearce have spent Pounds 350,000 (including a Pounds 50,000 grant) on converting farm buildings into eight craft workshops, a gift shop and tea-room and offices on their farm near Bakewell in the Derbyshire Peak District. After selling off their dairy herd, the Pearces turned their 120-acre farm over to less time-consuming sheep. The sheep produce an income of about Pounds 6,500 a year while the gift shop, tea-room and rent from the workshops and offices bring in Pounds 400,000. As a spin-off from the building work, John Pearce set up in business trading reclaimed building materials and has turnover of Pounds 500,000 a year. It took two years from the time the Pearces sold their cows to opening the tea-room, including six months spent fighting the Peak Park planning authority for permission for a change of use of their buildings. The planning officers initially ruled against the change because the conversion would require the construction of a car park, but they were overruled. 'But is still took six months during which time we were living off our bank manager,' says Carolyn Pearce. But planning controls are a significant problem for many farmers seeking to diversify their business. Brian Moore was unsuccessful in his attempt to run an ice cream parlour from his farm in the village of Weeton, in the green belt near Harrogate. The planning authorities objected to the large volumes of traffic created by Moore's ice cream parlour. Moore fought against the planning ruling up the Crown Court and estimates he spent up to Pounds 150,000 on legal fees, part of which had to be met by selling some of his land. Moore says the ice cream parlour accounted for one-third of his business, with the rest composed of deliveries to local retailers, so it was essential that he kept it going. He sold the farm in Weeton and moved 30 miles across country to High Jervaulx Farm in Lower Wensleydale. 'I made sure I had planning permission for the ice cream parlour before buying,' he says. But the most important factor determining the success of diversification are the personality and the business skills of the farmer himself. 'While only a minority of farms will have a high order of entrepreneurial skills, they are used to running their own business and they are generally tough and resilient,' says Butt. 'Farmers are not used to selling because in the past, their output would have gone to a marketing board or into intervention stocks,' comments Pat Oakley, chief manager of agricultural finance and small businesses at Lloyds Bank. 'But there is a new generation of farmers who have been away to college and who are better prepared.' The changes which still face the farming community seem likely to demand all of their newly-acquired skills.</p>

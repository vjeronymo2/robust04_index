			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE EARLY strength in stock index futures petered out as worries over the worsening situation in the Middle East took hold once again, leading to a poor market close, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened just ahead of Tuesday's close, good buying activity led to an advance in the March contract and within half-an-hour of the market's opening it was trading at around 2,770, leading the underlying cash market higher. However, economic worries coupled with the then vague talk of military action in the Middle East led to a gentle retreat in March, and in the cash market. It continued drifting lower as speculation about the situation in the Gulf strengthened, and the contract fell to the day's low of 2,755 at around 3.30pm. Bargain hunters were seen at the close and March finished at 2,763, down 11 from its previous finish and around 7 ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 14. Turnover was 8,567 lots. Most of the activity in the traded options continued to centre on the index options which expire tomorrow. The FT-SE 100 option accounted for 8,822 lots of the market's total volume of 32,734 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE saw 3,965 lots transacted. Dixons, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option with 1,946 trades, followed by Hillsdown with 1,881.</p>

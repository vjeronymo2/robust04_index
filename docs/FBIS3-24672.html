			<p>Facing     increasing criticism from erstwhile allies as early  parliamentary elections loom nearer, Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar appears to have started his campaign by using media that  has come under his control to publicize himself in a favorable  light.  For example, the daily Republika, whose chief editor, Jan  Smolec, appeared on the 1992 election list of Meciar's Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) (Narodna Obroda, 2 May 1992),  published a highly sympathetic two-part interview in its 7 and 8  February editions.  In the interview, Smolec declared that  "independent Slovakia" is Meciar's "achievement as a statesman"  and contended that the daily's readers were "very disappointed"  in President Michal Kovac--a former top HZDS member now a rival  of Meciar--when Kovac "stood up against you," adding that readers  considered Kovac's advisers "obnoxious people."  Meciar, by way  of contrast, was presented in a friendly light, discussing his  recent vacation in the Tatra mountains "roaming the streets" of  villages, skiing, and meeting "young people."  Highlighting his  achievements as prime minister, Meciar contended that in December  1992 he alone took responsibility for building a new state, since  "responsibility frightened even some members of the HZDS" who  "left me all alone."  Meciar added that "if an authoritative  decision is to be made again," he "will not hesitate."      Meciar also used state-run Slovak Television and Bratislava  Radio, now headed by HZDS adherents, to defend his position  during a two-week political crisis, when his governing coalition  effectively lost its parliamentary majority through defections  over his continued leadership.  As opposition parties blocked key  government initiatives and threatened to oust him from power,  Meciar made a key 15 February appearance on a weekly television  program "Press Club" devoted to presenting the government's point  of view, thus enabling him to defend his control over the  privatization of large-scale enterprises, his call for early  elections in June, and his demand that defectors from his party  be stripped of their parliamentary mandates.  The same evening,  Meciar also appeared on Slovak Television's "Kroky" news program  to further explain his position, and, during a two-part 18  February interview with Bratislava Radio, he detailed his plans  to hold a referendum on these issues.  Meciar had prepared the  way for his easy access to the airwaves last year, when he  replaced television and radio officials with his own supporters,  after denouncing Slovak Television for providing a forum  exclusively for the government's opponents  (See the Trends of 8  December 1993, pages 25 to 27).

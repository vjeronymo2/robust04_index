Applicant also has applied to engage through Company in executing transactions with respect to the following contracts: Major Market Index options traded on the American Stock Exchange; Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Stock Index options, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index options, Long-Term Interest Rate options, Short-Term Interest Rate options, Long-Term U.S. Treasury Index options, and Short-Term U.S. Treasury Index options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange; and Deutsche Mark options, Swiss Franc options, Australian Dollar options, British Pound options, Canadian Dollar options, European Currency Unit (ECU) options, French Franc options and Japanese Yen options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined that the proposed FCM activities are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P.

Morgan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Applicant states that it would perform the proposed FCM activities in a manner consistent with these previous orders. Applicant also maintains that the Board previously has determined by regulation and order that the proposed options execution activities are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Manufacturers Hanover Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 774 (1990); 12 C.F.R.  225.25 (b)(15). Applicant states that it would perform the proposed options execution activities in accordance with this order and regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve this proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal would produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader range of services. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 21, 1994.

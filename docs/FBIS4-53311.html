			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [18 May] urged parliamentary cooperation in  speeding up the process of enacting an electorate redistricting  bill so that an upcoming general election could be contested  under the single-seat constituency system.    "Although I can invoke my authority to call a general  election even under the current multiseat constituency system  still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested  under the new system," Hata said.    Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the  House of Representatives Budget Committee.    Although the Diet legislated in January a package of  electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system  for the 511- member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat  electorates and proportional representation, it requires the  passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be  lawfully contested under the single-seat system.    At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are  speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat  constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates.    Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an  early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on  politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has  been reduced to a minority government."    However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill  must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to  firmly establish the (single-seat) system."    "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation  and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in  various elections," he said.</p>

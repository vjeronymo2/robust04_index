			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM support for talks' resumption - Northern Ireland MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday welcomed the decision of Northern Ireland politicians to restart talks with the government, saying it showed that the people of the province would 'not be bullied by guns, by bombs or by any other form of intimidation'. His remarks came the day after a fresh meeting between Ulster's main party leaders and Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Peter Bottomley (C Eltham), a former Northern Ireland minister, urged Mr Major to 'send a message to the Provisional IRA and the 'disloyalists' that the mindless, aimless use of bullets and bombs will not be as successful as parliamentary debates and normal political campaigning'. Mr Major replied: 'The whole House will share your view on that latter matter. 'I warmly welcome the decision of the Northern Ireland political leaders to start their talks again. It does give a clear and very welcome signal to all the people in Northern Ireland of their determination to find a political solution. That is very much needed.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A member of the Provincial Electoral Commission in  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Mr. Thozamile  Botha, says unresolved problems may prevent the holding of local  government elections in the country, even by May next year.  Speaking in Pretoria at a Department of Constitutional  Development and Provincial Affairs briefing, Mr. Botha said the  elections would definitely not take place in October and that  even the later date was questionable. He said voter  registration and ward delimitation were among the tasks that  have still to be completed before local elections could take  place. The negotiating council had earlier proposed that the  elections be held in October.</p>

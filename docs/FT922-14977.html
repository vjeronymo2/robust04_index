			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Increase in Colombian coffee production causing concern COLOMBIAN coffee growers are, as always, hopeful that progress towards the revival of the International Coffee Agreement will be made at negotiations in London next week, but the country's high production level is causing concern both among other producing nations and at home. The 1991-92 harvest is estimated at 16m to 17m bags (of 60 kg), 3m to 4m bags more than Colombia's traditional output level. Although the extended dry season may affect the secondary harvest beginning now, coffee stocks are likely to increase again this year, even if exports can be kept at 13m bags. Colombia's production problem is partly the result of the government's use of the National Coffee Fund to cushion the effect of low international prices. From the collapse of the ICA's export quota system in July 1989 until the beginning of this year, the government continued to raise the domestic price paid to growers, though at a slightly slower rate than inflation. In February, when the National Coffee Fund's reserves had dropped by over USDollars 350m, the domestic price was reduced for the first time. 'The lower price and the loss of the subsidy for fertiliser will have a big effect, though it cannot be seen immediately,' said Ms Soraya Otero of the Co-Operative's exporting group, Expocafe. However, a financial incentive to take older coffee plantations out of production for renewal could, in fact, raise output in the long term. Some experts argue that only the most efficient producers, and those with no alternative, will survive the present market. That means that the medium-scale farmer, who has accounted for a big share of Colombia's production, may be the most vulnerable. Colombia has raised its share of world exports to about 16 per cent in the last three years, by combining good quality with aggressive sales. But 'it's been a very difficult, uncertain market', said Ms Otero. 'Nobody has liked the way the business has gone and we all want an agreement'. Despite bigger export volumes, the National Coffee Growers Federation estimates that the country has lost over USDollars 540m in earnings, and coffee now contributes less than a quarter of foreign income.</p>

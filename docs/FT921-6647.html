			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Plight of the Pehuenches stirs Chile's conscience: The national debate over Indian rights SOME 22 Pehuenche Indian families face imminent eviction from their ancestral lands in the southern Andes unless the Chilean government provides enough money to buy the title deeds from the landowners of the Quinquen valley. In any other year, the incident would not even make a footnote to the long history of dispossession suffered by America's native peoples. But this is 1992, and the issue of Indian rights is enjoying unprecedented exposure 500 years after Columbus stumbled across the New Continent. The Pehuenches of Quinquen have become a cause celebre in Chile. Every politician worth his salt has made the trek up the remote highland valley to express solidarity with their plight. The negotiations over their future have robbed three top government ministers of their summer holidays. And the landowners, who obtained an eviction order from the Supreme Court against 150 'illegal squatters', are being grilled by the press. The title holders, a company of local businessmen called Sociedad Galletue, hold another weapon besides the Supreme Court mandate: they know President Patricio Aylwin's government will not dare expropriate their property for fear of raising the spectre of the mass land seizures that traumatised Chile's land-owning class during the Allende years. Sociedad Galletue has therefore held out while the government has progressively increased its bid. Ironically, the latest offer of Dollars 5m for 37,000 hectares of non-arable land is probably more than all the governments of Chile have ever spent on their indigenous population. The government has been drawn into the conflict because of the growing militancy of Chile's 500,000 Mapuches, the tribe to which the Pehuenche clan belongs. Late last year, Mapuche groups decided to end more than a century of land-poaching by white settlers. They invaded a dozen farms in the scenic Lake District, claiming back land that had historically belonged to their unprotected Indian reservations. The land occupations were shortlived; many Mapuches were thrown into jail. But their actions succeeded in sparking a national debate over Chile's forgotten Indians. The government plans legislation to protect Indian rights and establish a 'land-fund' to purchase some of the territory the Mapuches have lost this century, but time is running out for the Pehuenches. Chile's right-wing opposition has dismissed the government's project as a 'fashionable international bandwagon' and Sociedad Galletue says it will enforce the eviction order on March 3 unless the government pays Dollars 10m for the disputed valley. Mr Edgardo Boeninger, President Aylwin's chief-of-staff, admitted that negotiations remained deadlocked last week. The Pehuenches are living in constant fear of a surprise raid and have posted hilltop lookouts to warn of the arrival of Carabineros. These are Chile's paramilitary police, which have repaired the mountain track leading to the Quinquen valley to assist the fast deployment of troops. 'Quinquen', in the native Mapudungun language, means 'refuge', a name that underscores the Pehuenches' mystical connection to their land, which they hold in common as an integral part of their religion and culture. So it is not surprising that the Indian families have declined a government offer to relocate them in a nearby valley. 'Our land is not a negotiable issue,' said a Pehuenche mother last week. 'We cannot cultivate our traditions in a flower pot.' The Pehuenches' lives revolve around the collection of the pine nut of the Araucaria (monkey puzzle tree), which is roasted or ground into flour for bread. Sociedad Galletue also lived off the Araucaria, chopping it down for timber until a government decree in 1990 declared the millenary tree a protected species and banned its exploitation. Environmentalists claim Sociedad Galletue is seeking the eviction of the Pehuenches out of spite for having lost its main source of income. One owner, Mr Gonzalo Lledo, came near to suggesting as much in a recent press interview: 'The government need only revoke the decree that bans the exploitation of the Araucaria and the Pehuenches could live there for free.'</p>

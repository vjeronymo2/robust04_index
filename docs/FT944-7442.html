			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: US cable-TV group in Dollars 1.4bn buy - Deal lifts Continental Cablevision's network to 4m subscribers Continental Cablevision, the third largest US cable-TV company, is to buy the cable operations of Providence Journal in a deal valued at Dollars 1.4bn. Continental, which is privately owned, will take on Dollars 755m of debt and issue stock to Providence valued at about Dollars 645m. It is believed this will give Providence 18 per cent of Continental's equity. Continental also plans to go public when the deal is closed next year. The deal implicitly values the whole of Continental at Dollars 3.6bn. The cable properties of Providence Journal, a diversified communications company which is also privately owned, are in seven states across the USA. Five of them are close to Continental's cable operations, the companies said. The purchase will add 750,000 subscribers to Continental's network, giving it a total of about 4m. This still leaves it in third place after Tele-Communications Inc and Time Warner. Some 55 per cent of Continental will then be owned by the company's founder, Mr Amos Hostetter, and by fellow executives, with the balance held by institutions. The subsequent flotation is planned for the middle of next year. Continental refused to comment yesterday on reports that it had considered and then dropped a separate plan to give a substantial share of its equity to US West, the regional telephone operator. Continental has so far avoided the general move by the big cable companies into the US telephone market. Last month TCI joined forces with Comcast and Cox - the fourth and sixth biggest cable operators - and Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, to bid for mobile communications licences. Time Warner is entering the telephone market independently, and also has an alliance with US West. The latest deal illustrates the trend in the cable industry towards consolidation. This results from competitive pressures between cable and telephone operators and from recent government-imposed cuts in prices charged to cable subscribers.</p>

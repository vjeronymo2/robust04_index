			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by C.H.: "Think Global, Act Western; the Czech-EU </F> Trade Marriage"]    [Text] Over the last four years, Czech trade with European  Union member states has skyrocketed to the point that the EU is  the country's largest foreign trading partner, accounting for  nearly half of Czech exports in 1993.    The Czech Republic's export business has been turning more  and more toward developed economies, while trade with former  East-bloc countries and the former USSR has remained close to  the same levels or, in some cases, dropped off. From 1992 to  1993 alone, exports to the EU jumped 24 percent, accounting for  $5.5 billion US, while imports from the EU increased by 10  percent to $1.1 billion US.    Still, trade between the EU, the world's largest single  economy, and the Czech Republic is not completely free. And this  continues to irk some Czech leaders.    "We have never asked for [economic] assistance. We asked  only  for foreign trade. But unfortunately these barriers exist, and  will continue to exist for the near future," said Vladimir  Budinsky, chair of Czech Parliament's economics committee.    Petr Postulka, head of the EU division at the Ministry of  Industry and Trade's Foreign Trade Section, said that with the  recession in Europe right now, "It's not always easy to achieve  positive results, because the situation of the European Union is  not very positive."    But, he said, arrangements to fully liberalize two sensitive  trade sectors--textiles and steel--in which the Czech Republic's  goods traditionally undersell those made within the EU, should  be completed by the beginning of 1997. A free trade agreement  with the Czech Republic for most other industrial goods should  be signed by 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Minasov report under "In the State Duma" rubric: </F> "What Sort of Commission Is This, Creator?"]    [Text] As is well known, at S. Baburin's suggestion a  majority of State Duma members included on the agenda the  question of forming a parliamentary commission to investigate  the causes and circumstances of the events of September-October  last year. This was despite the perfectly reasonable argument  that an official investigation is being conducted.    "How do you explain your persistence in forming the  commission," I asked Baburin.    "We must call a spade a spade," he said. "There have been  many mutually exclusive political statements on this subject, so  deputies have agreed to investigate what's what themselves.  People are saying that Yeltsin was defending the constitution  in September-October last year, while most Russians hold the  opposite opinion, as they confirmed in the 12 December  elections."    It seems that Baburin is deliberately exaggerating the  election results while completely ignoring another result of 12  December -- the referendum on the draft constitution, which was  proposed by the presidential side and supported by Russians.    Let us turn to another State Duma deputy -- Pavel Bunich.  What does he think about the inclusion of the item about  forming a parliamentary commission on the agenda of the lower  house's plenary session?    "Dangerous tendencies are increasing in the State Duma. For  example, one can sense a predisposition toward the controversial  program of the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department  and Reform Foundation, which essentially returns us to a  command-distributive system. This could `galvanize' the  government and incline it toward implementing this doubtful  program.    "As regards the formation of a parliamentary commission to  investigate the causes and circumstances of the events of  September-October 1993, it is an attempt to provoke a conflict  with the president and General Prosecutor's Office. Baburin and  his supporters are using this commission to try to achieve a  global aim -- to prove that the president's actions were  anticonstitutional and consequently that it is time to oust him."</p>

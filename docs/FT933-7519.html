			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen plummets on intervention THE YEN'S powerful rise against the dollar was dramatically reversed at the start of US trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve intervened four times in support of its currency, writes James Blitz. The Fed's intervention on dollar/yen came after a long period in which dealers had been led to believe that President Clinton's administration was indifferent to the decline in the exchange rate, preferring to see a fall in the Japanese trade surplus. Both the timing and the intensity of the intervention took the market completely by surprise and triggered one of the sharpest moves seen in an exchange rate for a long time. Between 15.20 and 17.30 London time, the dollar moved from Y101.70 to Y104.50, a drop of nearly 3 per cent in the yen's value as market players frantically squared long yen positions. As London trading closed, the dollar's rise appeared to be showing no sign of levelling off. Dealers said the Fed intervention was well-timed and extremely aggressive. New York trading finished with the dollar at Y105.78. Mr Lawrence Summers, a US Treasury Undersecretary, said yesterday that the recent rapid rise of the yen was causing concern because exchange rate volatility by itself could hamper world trade. This remark was seen by one analyst as an important new indication that the US does not want to see any further rise in the Japanese currency. However, other analysts said the Fed's intervention may mask deeper intent. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the Fed may have started to get concerned by the inflationary consequences of a weak dollar. Alternatively, a deal may have been done behind the scenes by which Japan will give the US greater access to its markets in return for currency support. The results of Thursday's cabinet meeting indicate that Japan may be about to give way to US demands on a number of issues. 'A fiscal stimulation package is quite likely this autumn, and so is a cut in the discount rate,' said an analyst. European trading was dominated by another sharp rise in the value of the French franc, which gained almost 2 centimes to finish at FFr3.495 against the D-Mark. Another cut in the Bank of France's overnight lending rate, this time by 1/2 percentage point, may have been one cause for the franc's rise. But several bank dealers spoke of US hedge funds buying back the franc in recent days in an attempt to square their positions in the wake of recent speculation. One analyst spoke of having seen 'reasonably sized' flows from US hedge funds yesterday. Other currencies also profited on a day of D-Mark weakness, but sterling lost  1/2 pfennig to DM2.5400. The dollar was nearly  1/2 pfennig up at DM1.6865, and in New York it ended at DM1.6874.</p>

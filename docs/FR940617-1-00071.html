			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Comment on Sodium Oxychlorosene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22. One comment requested that sodium oxychlorosene be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the monograph for use as a topical antiseptic for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating localized infections, to remove necrotic debris in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> massive infections, as a patient preoperative skin preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and postoperative irrigant, and for the cleansing and disinfection of fistulae, sinus tracts, empyemas, and wounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment included a number of references that recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usage of sodium oxychlorosene (Ref. 1). The comment stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* the 25 years of marketing experience, the almost total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of complaints, the number of published articles, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unusual spectrum of organisms reported on, all attest to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and efficacy of this product.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has reviewed the data submitted and concludes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the available information does not contain any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well-controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxychlorosene. In addition, no meaningful scientific information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was presented in regard to safety. Clinical use for a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years may provide corroborative evidence but is inadequate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support safe use. A good example is hexachlorophene; this drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been used OTC for many years before more thorough safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies in animals showed that the drug was not as safe as had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been assumed. The agency concludes that the data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sodium oxychlorosene for OTC topical antiseptic use and therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> places this ingredient in Category III for both safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency's detailed evaluation of the data and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Published in vivo and in vitro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies, submitted by Guardian Chemical Corporation, Comment No. C126, Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Letter from W. E. Gilbertson,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA, to R. Rubinger, Guardian Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, Comment No. ANS3, Docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Comments on Triclosan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. A number of comments submitted data and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from microbiological, mutagenicity, metabolism, cross-sensitization, photo-sensitization, and drug experience studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on triclosan (Ref. 1). The comments stated that the data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information show that triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) is safe and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective and that triclosan should be placed in Category I for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in the categories that were defined in the previous tentative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final monograph, i.e., skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wound protectant, antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand scrub. In addition, one comment submitted information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triclosan (0.1 percent) for the treatment of diaper rash and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triclosan (0.1 percent) combined with benzocaine for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of sunburn (Ref. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment from the manufacturer of triclosan objected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency's expressed concern, as stated in the tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1231 and 1233), that there is a proliferation of products containing triclosan marketed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American consumer (Ref. 3). The comment argued that the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns were without factual basis and submitted sales data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held confidential under 21 CFR 10.20(j)(2)(i)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), showing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall sales of triclosan in the U.S. have in fact decreased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 1973 to 1977 and that sales for use in bar soaps and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deodorants have also declined from 1973 to 1977. The comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out that it has exclusive U.S. patent rights for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triclosan and that no license has been, or will be, granted under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these patents. The comment added that to the best of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge triclosan is not used in infant clothing, a use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned in the tentative final monograph at 43 FR 1231. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment stated that if triclosan is placed in Category I for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in antimicrobial soaps, it would limit sales of triclosan to OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in antimicrobial and deodorant soaps, underarm deodorants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and registered Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. In the future, sales might be extended to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved new drug applications. The comment also pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the statement at 43 FR 1233 about the EPA's Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special Pesticide Review preparing a report on the proliferation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of triclosan-containing products is in error, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneous statement apparently resulted from a miscommunication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between FDA and EPA staff. The comment concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns about proliferation raised by the agency in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative final monograph should not prevent triclosan from being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in Category I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Flotation puts Pounds 70m price tag on RPC RPC GROUP, the rigid plastic packaging company, yesterday confirmed its plans for a flotation in May. The float is expected to value the group at more than Pounds 70m, compared with its Pounds 33.4m management buy-out two years ago. The issue is expected to raise more than enough new money to repay Pounds 21.5m of preference shares, including Pounds 13.5m issued to former owners Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden at the time of the buy-out. Some existing shareholders may also sell part of their investments. The flotation involves a placing with institutions and an offer to the public through financial intermediaries. The prospectus will include results for the year to March 31 which are expected to show an advance on the Pounds 5m operating profit recorded in 1991-92. The group has little debt, having repaid Pounds 12m of buy-out debt from cashflow and invested another Pounds 12m in the last two years. RPC is chaired by Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, formerly a director of Rowntree Mackintosh, the confectionery group, who joined in January 1992. He is also a non-executive director of Argos and Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society. RPC's executive directors have all been with the group through a number of ownership changes. The company was originally part of Reed International, the publishing company, but was sold with Reed's other packaging interests to Reedpack, a buy-out vehicle, in 1988.</p>

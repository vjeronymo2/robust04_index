			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by KBS </F> anchorman Yi Yun-song--live]    [Text] [Yi Yun-song] There are increasing voices worrying  about the disarray in the government in dealing with the North  Korean nuclear issue. They worry because the departments and  officials of the government are expressing different views. We  requested an urgent interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  who returned home yesterday from his visits to China, the United  States, the UN Headquarters, and Japan.    How are you, Mr. Minister? You were on the spot when the UN  Security Council issued its presidential statement. How would  you appraise it?    [Han Sung-chu] The UN Security Council's action came in the  form of a presidential statement. It is more important how many  countries supported it and how strong the wording of the  statement is than the form itself, whether it is the  presidential statement or a council resolution. The permanent  member states, including China, and all the 10 nonpermanent  member states supported the presidential statement. Therefore,  the statement has considerable weight. With the participation  of China in the efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, the  success of the presidential statement is appreciable.    [Yi] The preconditions for the U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks were North Korea's acceding to the inspection and the  inter-Korean exchange of special envoys. There are views  expressed, from the government, particularly the Foreign  Ministry, that the envoy exchange can be withdrawn from the  preconditions. What really is happening to this issue?    [Han] The Foreign Ministry has never come up with that  policy. There is no change in our government's position. Our  position, as well as the U.S. position, remains unchanged that  the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can only be held  after the envoy exchange is made.    [Yi] North Korea rejected the UN Security Council's  presidential statement as soon as it was issued. North Korea  says that it cannot accede to the resumption of inspections.  Furthermore, it claims that it should normalize its nuclear  activities. What is the government measure to cope with this?    [Han] North Korea is very repulsed by the UN Security  Council's presidential statement. North Korea seems to be  perturbed by the participation of China in the issuance of the  statement. We will endeavor with continuous discussion and  cooperation with the United States, Japan, China, and all other  countries concerned, so that the objective of the UN Security  Council's presidential statement may be fulfilled.    [Yi] Attention is focused on the recent remarks by U.S.  Defense Secretary Perry, who said that North Korea has already  developed two nuclear weapons. What is your view of this?    [Han] Secretary Perry is concerned that his remarks are  often reported with exaggeration. He has never said, commenting  on the North Korean nuclear capability, that North Korea has two  nuclear weapons. One has no proof supporting one's statement on  the number of the nuclear weapons North Korea has. We have to  make efforts to prevent North Korea from making any further  development of nuclear weapons.</p>

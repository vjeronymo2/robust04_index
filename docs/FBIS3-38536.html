Both the White House and Downing Street were clearly  embarrassed by the publicity spree enjoyed by the Sinn Fein  leader, who flew home last night, and in London diplomats and  ministers could scarcely conceal their fury over Mr Clinton's  decision.    But with John Major due to meet the President in Washington  at the end of the month, officials on both sides of the Atlantic  tried to play down suggestions of a rift. Downing Street  insisted that relations were in good shape, although the  American ambassador to London admitted that the issue had caused  difficulties.    In Washington, White House officials felt disappointed and  let down by Mr Adams, who failed to deliver the concession that  had been expected as vindication of the President's  controversial decision. Mr Adams's congressional backers had led  key presidential advisers to believe that he would use his  address to a New York conference on Ulster to advance the peace  process, possibly by announcing a three-month ceasefire. In the  event, he merely repeated his calls for clarification of the  Downing Street declaration.    By the time he left, however, Mr Adams was coming under  strong pressure from embarrassed White House officials and his  own supporters, and in a final press conference he promised  prominent Americans who had backed his visit that they would not  be let down. He would apply himself to making concrete decisions  when he got home.    But Downing Street had already made clear that it was no  longer willing to wait for Mr Adams and that efforts to reach a  political settlement in Northern Ireland -- if necessary without  Sinn Fein -- were about to be intensified. Sir Patrick Mayhew,  the Northern Ireland Secretary, is expected to bring forward  fresh proposals, possibly including an Ulster assembly, in the  next two weeks.    In an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES today, Sir Patrick  indicates that his framework would involve simultaneous talks on  internal political arrangements for Ulster and on relations  between Belfast and Dublin. But he insists that talks on  crossborder co-operation would not lead to joint authority.    Senior ministers admitted yesterday that Britain had been  caught on the hop by the Adams visit: the Government believed  until late on Sunday [30 January] that Mr Adams would be allowed  into America only if he renounced violence. But officials said  it would have been difficult for anyone to counter the Adams  bandwagon once it had got under way -- during his 48 hours, Mr  Adams notched up eight television appearances, five press  conferences, newspaper interviews, and meetings with congressmen  and as well as speeches to enthusiastic audiences. He was said  to have "put a human face on the IRA" and was compared with  Clint Eastwood, Nelson Mandela and George Washington.    To cap it all, he challenged Douglas Hurd to a television  debate, a gauntlet ignored by the Foreign Secretary. Whitehall  officials said he would not be seen answering the Adams agenda.  "Mr Hurd should not be put on the same level as Adams," they  said.    Mr Hurd was also anxious to avoid a public row over Mr  Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa, although he made  Britain's displeasure plain in meetings with Vice President Al  Gore, Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, and Anthony  Lake the National Security Adviser. Officials said they had  been left in no doubt of "the offence not just to the British  Government, but to the British people and the people of Northern  Ireland." At the same time Raymond Seitz, the American  ambassador, was called to Downing Street to be told of Mr  Major's alarm, while Britain's ambassador, Sir Robin Renwick,  conveyed the same message to Washington. Mr Seitz is  understood to have been against the visit -- as were the FBI and  the Justice and State departments -- and the ambassador admitted  yesterday that there had been a tussle inside the American  Administration. He said Mr Clinton "took a chance."    By late on Tuesday, the President appeared to admit his  mistake when he said his idea of appointing a special envoy had  been overtaken by events and praised the initiative undertaken  by Mr Major and Albert Reynolds.    Mr Major meanwhile signalled his determination to press  ahead  with that initiative as Downing Street officials warned that the  peace process "cannot and will not wait for Sinn Fein."    The provisionals had been challenged to give up violence and  had not done so. They had been challenged to enter the  democratic arena and had not had the courage to do so. "While  Adams was telling the Americans he favored peace, his movement  was firing mortars in Northern Ireland. His smokescreen of  evasions and falsehoods has not deceived people."</p>

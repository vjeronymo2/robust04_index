			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F> Smadar Peri at the Prime Minister's Office in Ankara; date not  given]    [Excerpt] [Peri] Madam Prime Minister, in your first  meeting with President 'Ezer Weizman this week, you told him  that your top priority is the war against terrorism. Why?    [Ciller] We have a problem of internal terrorism, and I will  neither permit nor tolerate its continuing. We are the only  secular democratic state in the Muslim world. We have invested  more than 50 years in securing these achievements, and I do not  plan to allow those who murder women and children to spoil  things for us.    [Peri] You have already pointed to the common enemy:  Hizballah.    [Ciller] Definitely. Hizballah not only threatens Israel's  security but also that of Turkey. It is a real problem. I am  opposed to terrorism in the name of fundamentalism, and  Hizballah operates under that slogan.    [Peri] As the prime minister of a Muslim state, did you not  have reservations about announcing publicly that you are  interested in intelligence, security, and strategic cooperation  with Israel? Your neighboring states follow your every word.    [Ciller] I do not care. I am very interested in any form of  cooperation between us to uproot terrorism by Hizballah and  others. I am against anybody who tries to harm stability and  quiet. I do not care if they know that Israel and Turkey are  cooperating against Hizballah.    [Peri] What kind of strategic cooperation are you  considering?    [Ciller] In intelligence and security, and in any other  field in which there can be cooperation between professional and  experienced institutions and organizations.    [Peri] With your permission, let us try to analyze President  al-Asad's possible reaction to your remarks. Israel complains  about Syria's aid to Hizballah, and you are now in fact  proposing Israeli-Turkish cooperation against Syria.    [Ciller] I definitely support the peace process and good  relations with Israel. We are interested in assisting in the  process. In my view, Syria is a key state in the process. The  key to progress in the negotiations lies with al-Asad. That is  why we must find a way to make it attractive to him and convince  him that real peace pays.    The Syrians, however, abet terror in Turkey, and they also  bother you. We, for our part, are willing to do anything to  encourage Syria to take the path of peace. I get the impression  that Israel does not need to be encouraged in this.    I suggest bilateral strategic cooperation. With your  experience and expertise, it pays us to look for common points  and pool our resources.    [Peri] I am sure that Tehran is also interested in the plans  for Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation. You have a large  Iranian Embassy here. Have you tried to send out feelers about  a dialogue with Israel?    [Ciller] I do not believe I or my government should act as  an intermediary between Israel and Iran, unless both sides ask  for it.    [Peri] Do you actually conduct a dialogue with the Iranians  in Ankara? Do they not have reservations about the fact that a  woman is prime minister?    [Ciller] The main thing is that they do not interfere with  us. We have 24 ethnic groups in Turkey, and the terrorists  murder my citizens in cold blood. I am not prepared to accept  such despicable murders.    I will tell you something: Before each action, the  terrorists make sure they rid the area of journalists so that  there will be no witnesses or proof of their deeds. That was  the case in southeast Anatolia. They want to take over by force  and chip away chunks of Turkey for themselves, and they threaten  to murder the women and children of those who hinder them.    [Peri] And if you are prevented from selling water to  Israel?    [Ciller] I tell you: I will do whatever I decide with our  water. We have the water sources, and we will sell water to  whomever we like. Nobody will decide for me or dictate to me to  whom to sell our water. I am not prepared to accept threats.    We will sell water to Israel, and we are also prepared for  activity with Israeli antiterror experts.    [Peri] You are most likely following the reservations our  decisionmakers are having about President al-Asad. Israel does  not know what he really meant when he said "peace." Do you  understand us?    [Ciller] Definitely. I believe Syria could have helped in  the struggle against terrorism, but it prefers not to. What I  have just said is an understatement. I know that you complain  about precisely the same thing. The solution will be found when  we manage to convince al-Asad that he will be better off without  terrorism and that he will lose if he does not cooperate.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Navistar to restructure healthcare funding NAVISTAR International, the Chicago-based manufacturer of heavy trucks and diesel engines, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of 22m shares of common stock. The issue is to fund a retiree healthcare programme. The benefit fund, and the stock offering, are part of an unusual contract settlement reached earlier this year with current and former Navistar employees. The restructuring is expected to save Navistar Dollars 200m annually. The stock will have a par value of 10 cents per share and should raise about Dollars 500m. An additional 3m shares will be issued if the offering is oversubscribed. Navistar plans to place Dollars 300m of the proceeds immediately into the healthcare benefits programme and use the balance as working capital. However, all of the funds from the offering must be contributed into the healthcare fund within five years. The new stock issue will increase Navistar's outstanding shares by about a half. Upon completion of the offering, the company will have about 73m common shares outstanding. Navistar shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 20 1/8 at the close in New York yesterday.</p>

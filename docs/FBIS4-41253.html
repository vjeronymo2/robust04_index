			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- As a UNIAN correspondent learned on 22 June,  Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the  Republic of Belarus Volodymyr Zheliba sent a letter to Ukraine's  Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol. The letter, in particular,  indicates that for Belarus, Ukraine ranks second, following  Russia, as far as foreign political aspect is concerned, and  expresses concern at the state of Ukrainian-Belarusian  relations, at the absence of contacts at the top state level,  and also absence of proper trade and economic relations.    "We are convinced that the state of bilateral cooperation  must be considered at the high governmental level in the very  near future," believes Volodymyr Zheliba.    The letter also says that Ukraine occupies the second place  (14.9 percent), following Russia (69 percent), in trade and  economic relations with Belarus, however the establishment of a  joint trade house has been put off. No agreement has been  concluded between the banks on mutual settlements and credit  relations. Also, in the opinion of the Belarusian side, the  issue of liabilities between our states remains unsettled.</p>

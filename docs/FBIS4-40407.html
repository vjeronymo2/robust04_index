			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Itar-Tass diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 June -- The DPRK's departure from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been received with  great concern in Russia. This was stated at a briefing today by  Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of administration of the  Information and Press Department of the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry .    "Our fundamental position is well known and remains  immutable. Russia favors strengthening the regime of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and favors transparency of  nuclear programs so that no doubts or fears will arise  concerning the possibility of attempts to create nuclear  weaponry. It is especially important that a state which is a  member of the treaty and which has an agreement with the IAEA on  guarantees should honestly and consistently fulfill its  obligations. If this has not been done or is not being done,  then the international community has the right to react  appropriately," the Russian diplomat said.</p>

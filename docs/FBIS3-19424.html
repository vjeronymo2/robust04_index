The house approved giving the police rather  than a judge the right to decide whether to expel asylum-seekers  who try to stay in Switzerland illegally, or hold them in  detention. The new law will come into force in July. The house  also passed a series of recommendations aimed at boosting  cooperation and understanding between the different language  regions in Switzerland.</p>

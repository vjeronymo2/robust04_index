			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Retirement benefits The chancellor proposes to ensure that tax is charged on a benefit received from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (Furb) which has not itself been taxed in the UK. The chancellor intends is to stop such schemes, set up offshore, whose income and capital gains are wholly or partly tax-free, providing employees with a larger tax-free lump sum on retirement than would be provided by an onshore fund whose income and gains are taxable. The legislation would also apply where Furbs are marketed by insurance companies, and takes effect for all benefits received under arrangements made after today.</p>

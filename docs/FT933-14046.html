			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Italians calm row over role in Somalia THE Italian government yesterday sought to calm the row over the role of its 2,600-strong peacekeeping contingent with the United Nations in Somalia. In an effort to restore a dialogue, Italian diplomats will meet representatives of the UN and the US State Department in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, today. 'We must try to lower the temperature of the argument as soon as possible,' Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament. Mr Andreatta disclosed he had been in close contact with Mr Warren Christopher, his US opposite number, in an attempt to defuse tension over Italy's criticism of US military 'enforcement' tactics in Somalia. He said Mr Christopher had written him a 'friendly' letter yesterday. 'We are in Somalia and wish to remain there,' Mr Andreatta added. 'We are well aware that one has to shoot and use force. But it is still the sovereign right of a government to have differences of view on these issues.' It is the first time in recent years Italy has been in such open disagreement with allies and an international body such as the UN. The Mogadishu meeting follows two days of increasing tension between Italy and other members of the UN force in Somalia, headed by General Civek Bir, the Turkish commander, over the way the peacekeeping operation has moved towards peace enforcement. The row led Mr Kofi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, to call for removal of General Bruno Loi, the Italian commander, for defying UN orders. The Italian government replied by giving full backing to Gen Loi and threatening to pull out of Somalia. As a gesture of support for Gen Loi, it was announced yesterday he would be visited by Gen Mario Buscemi, deputy chief of staff. This suggests the Italian government will strongly resist the UN call for Gen Loi's early removal. Italian officials insisted such a decision anyway rested with them, not the UN. Despite the effort to improve relations, there was little evidence that differences between Italy and the UN had narrowed. The Italian military in Mogadishu and the Italian government believe the UN mission in Somalia has moved down a dangerous path, by relying on military muscle and by shedding impartiality to brand Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the main Somali warlord, as an outlaw. Mr Andreatta said sending in US helicopter gunships to attack and perhaps capture the warlord was the equivalent of the British bombarding Belfast to arrest an IRA leader.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Let the customer be your guide / A look at a marketing premise in practice - make what you sell, not sell what you make When Julian Rankin and Michael Osborn established their lighting business in London in 1985, they had definite plans for the future. They had set their sights on establishing their company as a manufacturer of well-designed, high-quality light fittings. But they encountered two problems. As a very small company, Ora Lighting had neither the manufacturing scale nor the marketing presence to take on its bigger rivals. More important, architects kept commissioning them to carry out one-off lighting design projects. 'Seventy per cent of our work was special-product development,' recalls Rankin, an industrial design engineer by training. 'We tried to steer away from that and impose our own standard ranges of products on the market. Up to a point we were successful, but we didn't have the marketing muscle and, as a small company, we couldn't produce in large runs anyway.' Realising they needed outside advice to resolve their dilemma, Rankin and Osborn signed up for subsidised consultancy advice under the government's Enterprise Initiative. They were put in touch with Mapa, a London-based marketing consultancy. The advice from the Mapa consultant was to go with the market rather than fight it. If Ora's customers valued the company for its skills in designing bespoke lighting arrangements, then why try to ram the standard designs down their throats? Once the decision was taken to concentrate on the 'specials', then Ora's promotional literature had to be modified to take account of this. Previously the company had emphasised its stock lines, but had few photographs and brochures illustrating its bespoke installations. This was remedied. At Mapa's suggestion, Ora stepped up its direct mail campaign, targeting existing customers to win repeat business and new ones to extend its client base. Rankin is in no doubt that the decision to take a more professional approach to marketing and to respond to the clear signals its customers were sending helped Ora survive the recession. At a time when many of its competitors have gone out of business, Ora, which now has 15 employees and turnover of Pounds 500,000, has record order books. Ora's initial approach to marketing is by no means unusual. Entrepreneurs frequently set up in business with an idea for a product or a service which they are convinced will take the market by storm. They may be lucky, but many fail. 'A lot of companies think they have something which is unique and are surprised to find someone else offering something very similar,' comments John Maclaran, a consultant with Mapa. 'They think they know who their customers are but they never talk to them to find out what they really want. It is a question of looking at the product from the other side.' But persuading business owners and managers to take a fresh look at their marketing can be difficult. 'Getting somebody to go out and ask their customers what they want is not easy,' comments Terry Mitchell, manager of the Milton Keynes Marketing Centre, which advises local businesses. 'There is a lot of pride involved for someone who has built up his own business. He doesn't want somebody telling him he has got it wrong.' Instilling a more professional approach to marketing is hampered by widespread ignorance of what marketing actually is. Many owners assume that marketing is synonymous with sales promotion and imagine that it is limited to advertising, mail shots and public relations. The marketing industry has not always been its own best advocate, confusing potential customers with jargon. 'I have people come in and say: 'We did some marketing once and it didn't work',' says Mitchell. 'What they have done is put together a brochure featuring a history of their company. Engineering companies are particularly good at that.' Marketing specialists commonly fall back on a description of their craft as helping people to make what they can sell instead of selling what they can make. Far from being a technique to be adopted at the end of the production chain, marketing is a discipline which goes right to the heart of a business, determining its field of activity and choice of products. It starts with market research in order to build up a knowledge of customers and competitors. It moves on to designing products or services to suit the market-place and pricing them at the highest level the market will bear. Only then does marketing take on its more familiar forms of promotion, advertising and selling. 'We tackle marketing as a strategic issue,' explains Maclaran. 'We review the existing business, look at their customer base and audit their publicity material. We find out where they fit on the market map and how they relate to their customers. 'We analyse the market and try to quantify how big a segment a client can realistically aim for. We look at the competition. People's objectives and the size of the market are often poles apart. We analyse their financial and operating information and try to formulate a marketing strategy.' Robin Phelps, co-founder and managing director of the 'florists' sundries' wholesaling business which bears his name, is typical of many business owners. 'In the late 1980s everyone was talking about marketing,' he says. 'We thought: 'What the hell is it all about?'' With signs of an approaching recession and increasing competition from cut-price suppliers, Phelps needed some answers. Help came in the shape of a mail shot from the Milton Keynes Marketing Centre, offering the advice of its experts. At the suggestion of Terry Mitchell, Phelps decided to establish a cash-and-carry outlet, so as to reach the smaller florists he could not economically serve from his main warehouse. These customers had begun buying their artificial flowers and other flower arranging materials from travelling vans. The cash-and-carry operation was started under a different name while an effort was made to strengthen the more upmarket image of the Robin Phelps name. The company developed - 'repackaged' - its own range of bouquets of artificial flowers for sale through petrol station forecourts. This has not worked out quite as Phelps had hoped, because the large petrol station chains switched over to centralised buying. But the company, which has 17 employees and sales of Pounds 750,000, is now hoping to develop other niche markets. Concentrating on a particular niche also proved to be the answer for Andrew Morris, an accountant based in Richmond, west London. Morris, a sole practitioner who trades as Ixer/Morris and employs a staff of four, says he, too, was concerned at signs of the impending recession. Worried more about its impact on his clients than its possible direct impact on his own business, Morris went to a 'roadshow' organised by the Department of Trade and Industry. He got talking to one of the advisers and realised he might benefit himself from some consultancy. 'The consultants' message was simple: identify your market and major on it,' says Morris. 'We had been a general practice, but we decided to concentrate on specifics.' Morris is unwilling to identify the type of client he now targets but says they are in the services sector. He stopped advertising in the local paper and the Yellow Pages and concentrated on the trade press. The outcome of this more targeted approach has been to allow a small expansion of Morris's firm. Without it, he says, he could well have been forced to lay off staff. Businesses which take marketing seriously often face painful choices. They may have to give up a cherished product to move into a more promising area. But the alternative to making what your customers want, could be making, and selling, nothing at all.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> BETWEEN 'R' AND 'X' LIES A REMEDY FOR RATING ADULT MOVIES  </P> <P> Richard D. Heffner makes an important point in his July 2 Counterpunch  commentary ("Guidance to Parents, Not Profits, Governs Movie Rating System"):  It will not work to have two ratings symbols that signify "adults only."  </P> <P> How could Heffner's Code and Ratings Administration presume to decide that some  "adults only" material is art and some porno? This would only create  nightmarish legal problems.  </P> <P> But it is disingenuous of Heffner to imply that the addition of a new  exclusionary "adults only" symbol between R and X is the only alternative to  the present arrangement. A friend who is a staff lawyer at a major Hollywood  studio has drafted this interesting proposal:  </P> <P> Why not add a new advisory (rather than exclusionary) R-21 rating that would  bear the same relationship to the current R as PG-13 does to PG -- and which  would therefore be no more problematic legally? Thinking of the new rating this  way, rather than as "an additional adults-only category," eliminates the  artificial complications Heffner has cooked up.  </P> <P> An R-21 rating would not be a perfect solution to the ratings mess. Some  newspapers and theaters and video stores might still try to make hay by banning  R-21 pictures. And some films (basically those with hard-core sexual content)  could still suffer the box-office stigma of the X. But at least this approach  would be legally unassailable.  </P> <P> DAVID CHUTE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

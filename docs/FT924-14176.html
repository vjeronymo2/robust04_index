			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Palestinians suspend hunger strike: Israeli minister agrees to investigate prison conditions PALESTINIAN prisoners yesterday suspended a two-week-long hunger strike which prompted widespread unrest in the occupied territories and raised fears that the issue could disrupt Middle East peace talks, which are due to resume in Washington on October 21. Many of the 12,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails had been carrying out the fast in protest at prison conditions. Last night a Palestinian lawyer representing the hunger strikers said agreement had been reached with the prisons authority to investigate conditions and the hunger strike would be suspended for one week while the agreement was implemented. Inmates of three prisons were reported to be continuing their fast until tomorrow when the investigation, ordered by police minister Moshe Shahal, begins. Earlier, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said during a visit to the occupied Gaza Strip that Israeli troops would use 'all our strength' to suppress unrest sparked by the hunger strike. 'The Palestinians must understand that the solution to their problems will be around the negotiating table and not in the streets and alleyways of the (occupied) territories.' At least two Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, were reported killed and more than 100 injured over the weekend in widespread clashes with the security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. Yesterday, an Israeli civilian working at a Jewish settlement in Gaza was killed by a Palestinian farm worker. Israeli officials expressed concern that the unrest marked a resurgence of the five-year-old intifada, or uprising, in the occupied territories. They accused Palestinian leaders of fomenting disturbances to disrupt the peace talks. Palestinians said the demonstrations were an expression of frustration that the year-old peace talks had so far yielded nothing to ease the conditions of the Israeli occupation.</p>

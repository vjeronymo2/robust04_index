			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 49. Additionally, there is no indication that in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(D) Congress intended to expand the definition of ``members of minority groups'' to include classes of persons other than racial or ethnic groups, such as those listed in the preceding subsection, Section 309(i). <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  We further observe that in no other Commission context, have we included disabled persons in the categories of groups that comprise our definition of minorities. Making such a change here, without clear statutory and legislative support to do so, would therefore be inconsistent with our traditional application of the definition, which we believe should be uniform in all licensing contexts. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(3)(C)(ii). Below, we revise our definition of ``members of minority groups'' to conform to this statutory definition. In interpreting this definition in the past, we have taken a restrictive view of the categories of minorities included in this definition and limited its expansion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Third Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Gen.

We wish to emphasized also, that it is highly likely that most firms owned by individuals with disabilities will be eligible to bid in the entrepreneurs' block and for an installment payment option if they meet the required gross revenues and total assets test. Such firms may also be eligible for ``enhanced'' installment payments and bidding credits if they qualify as small businesses under our rules. Indeed, absent a substantial record that demonstrates firms owned by persons with disabilities have any more difficulty accessing capital then any other small business, we find that we cannot accommodate the Karl Brothers request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 51. We also note that we have before us a Petition for Rulemaking filed by David J. Lieto (Lieto Petition), which requests that the Commission amend Section 1.2110 of the Commission's rules to provide that disabled individuals are within the minority group categories and are thus entitled to the benefits associated with being a designated entity under the Commission's auction rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> David J. Lieto Petition for Rulemaking, filed September 21, 1994, at 2&hyph;3. As stated above, we believe that our existing rules provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in the entrepreneurs' block, and that there is no direct statutory or record support for Lieto's request. Furthermore, Lieto has failed to provide a record comparable to that for women and minorities demonstrating that disabled individuals experience difficulties accessing capital that are unique to their status. Accordingly, we decline to initiate a rulemaking at this time, and hereby dismiss the Lieto Petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52. In response to numerous inquiries, <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  however, we revise the definition of ``members of minority groups'' slightly to conform with the definition of minority used in other contexts. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  Thus, &sect;24.720(i) shall read as follows: ``Members of minority groups include Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.'' <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  We have also been asked to clarify the meaning of particular categories in the definition of minority. Again, for consistency, we shall use the same category descriptions the Commission has relied on in other contexts. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  These categories are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We received several inquiries about the definition of ``members of minority groups'' from participants in the FCC PCS seminars, which provide an overview of the PCS rules and procedures.

In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Commission allowed a consortium of small businesses to qualify collectively for the preferences available to a small business if each business within the consortium individually satisfies the definition of a small business designated entity. The Commission defined a small business designated entity as any company that, together with attributable investors and affiliates, has average gross revenues for the three preceding years of not in excess of $40 million. We defined ``consortium of small businesses'' as a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture among mutually-independent business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  47 CFR &sect;24.720(b)(3). In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we concluded that consortia should not always be entitled to qualify for measures designed specifically for designated entities. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , however, we stated that for the auctioning of broadband PCS, it is especially necessary to allow small businesses to pool their resources in this manner to help them overcome capital formation problems. Thus, our rules provide that if a consortium's members are all small businesses ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , defined as companies that do not have average yearly gross revenues for the preceding three years in excess of $40 million), the consortium as a whole will qualify for designated entity provisions for small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 54. Omnipoint requests that the Commission allow small businesses to form a single corporate applicant (rather than a joint venture) and get the same treatment as consortia. BET requests that the Commission eliminate the preference available to small business consortia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 55. We believe the current preferences for small business consortia are adequate and necessary to ensure that small businesses have sufficient opportunities to participate in the broadband PCS auctions. Accordingly, we deny BET's request to eliminate the small business consortia preferences. As we observed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems and ensure their participation in the provision of broadband PCS. We believe that small, rural telephone companies, in particular, are expected to use this mechanism to compete in some of the smaller markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 56. We also deny Omnipoint's request that small businesses be allowed to form a single corporate applicant that would be afforded the same treatment as consortia. The concept of a consortium is that each small business participant remains a distinct corporate entity independent of other consortium members and that each member has rights and obligations similar, or equal to, those held by participants in other types of joint ventures. Allowing a group of small businesses to apply as one corporate applicant and receive the benefits or our consortia rule would disadvantage small, independent businesses wishing to bid as a group under our rule, but who cannot restructure as a corporate applicant and could tend to dilute each member's influence and insulate their responsibilities in the venture. We believe that such a change would also eviscerate our small business eligibility size requirement. We wish to clarify, however, that we intent to examine the qualifications of each consortium member to ensure that each is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  small business. In this regard, it is assumed that each concern should be an entity ``organized for profit'' and not for the sole purpose of qualifying as part of a small business consortia. This is consistent with SBA's long-standing definition of ``business concern.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  43 CFR 121.403(a),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small Business Size Standards <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 54 FR 52634 (Dec. 21, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57. On another issue, BET contends that the $40 million gross revenues standard fails to comply with an SBA requirement that any size standard proposed by a federal agency that varies from SBA's standard be ``proposed after an opportunity for public notice and comment'' and be ``approved by the Administrator [of the SBA].'' <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  We believe we have fully met our notice and comment obligations, both under the Administrative Procedures Act and the Small Business Act, in this proceeding. We solicited comment on a range of size options, and received comment that included SBA's recommendation for a $40 million gross revenues cap (which we ultimately adopted). Indeed, we recently obtained SBA's approval of the $40 million size standard. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)(A) and (C) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter to William Kennard, FCC General Counsel from Philip Lader, SBA Administrator, Nov. 9, 1994 (responding to Aug. 19, 1994 request for size approval). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

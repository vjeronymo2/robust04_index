			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television So far Carlton TV, which took the London weekday ITV contract from Thames in the government's demented auction scheme, has achieved an unimpressive record. Today they could begin to change that with Class Act a drama series starring Joanna Lumley as a wronged aristocrat whose husband disappears, leaving her with a prison sentence. She teams up with a female Australian burglar and a doubtful journalist, and their adventures form the backbone of the one-hour series. It is good to see Lumley reaping the benefits of 'AbFab', and encouraging to find that Class Act is produced by Verity Lambert. But what about the writer? On the one hand Michael Aitkens wrote 'Waiting For God' which I rate higher than 'One Foot In The Grave' (in its writing, anyway). On the other hand his most recent offering is 'Honey For Tea' which has been something like a disaster. We shall see (9.00 ITV). The last in Dawn French's series of comedy dramas, Murder Most Horrid II, finds our heroine playing a would-be torch singer in the gangland setting of London's east end in the 1960s (9.00 BBC2).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  will probably defer a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton  until he attends a summit of leaders of major industrialized  nations in naples in early July, a government source said  Wednesday. "Prime Minister Hata is unlikely to visit the United  States prior to the summit meeting," the source said.    Tokyo and Washington are currently trying to arrange a  meeting between the two leaders during the Group of Seven summit  slated for July 8-10 in Naples, or at another location in  Europe, the source said.    Japan, in bracing itself for the summit, has to work out  specific proposals to alleviate the global unemployment problem,  expand government investment, bolster the anemic economy, reform  its taxation system and proceed with deregulation, he said.  "Japan will make steadfast efforts to sketch out economic  measures to bolster private consumption," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov has  ended his contacts in Turkey and left the country. A new  cooperation protocol was signed that updates the action protocol  signed between the two countries in 1992.    Daskalov was received this morning by Mustafa Kalemli,  deputy  speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. President  Suleyman Demirel received Daskalov at the Cankaya Mansion.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was also present at the meeting.    Cetin and Daskalov signed a new cooperation protocol that  updates the action protocol signed by the two countries in 1992.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cetin said the protocol  envisions the development of cooperation in the military field,  and in the fight against drug trafficking, organized crime, and  terrorism. He pointed out that the Turkish minority in Bulgaria  constitutes a bridge for the friendship between the two  countries. Bulgaria has been acting in an exemplary fashion  regarding this issue in recent years, Cetin said, adding:  Turkey and Bulgaria are two important countries in the Balkans.  The Balkans today are the hottest and most problematic region  in the world. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is  a shame for humanity. We have a common understanding to make  every effort to prevent the spreading of the tension and of the  conflict. We also discussed the issues of the Caucasus, the  Middle East, and Iraq. We assessed in detail the effect of the  embargo on Iraq on the economies of Turkey and Bulgaria.    The Bulgarian foreign minister pointed out that his visit  showed that the two countries have the political will to develop  their bilateral relations. Replying to a question, Daskalov  said his country has incurred a loss of about $1.5 billion as a  result of the embargo on Iraq. He stressed that Bulgaria wants  the embargoes on Iraq and on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be lifted.    Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria is not opposed to the  deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina within the  framework of the relevant UN resolution.</p>

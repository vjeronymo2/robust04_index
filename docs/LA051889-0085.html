			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A LESS-GRAND OPTION NEXT DOOR  </P> <P> If you've got a hankering to live at the Galleria, but don't care to disclose  your financial status, there is a less-grand option.  </P> <P> The Sierra Lodge motel, next door to the Grand, rents rooms furnished with  king-size beds for as little as $32.95 per night. Instead of a marble lobby,  you'll have to settle for inexpensive mobile home-style paneling and a faux  brick motif. But your king-size bed may feature a fancy red Naugahyde headboard  and your walls come complete with framed posters of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon  and other scenic wonders.  </P> <P> A household of two requiring only one bed will pay $34.95 per night (about  $1,083 a month before tax) plus a $3 key deposit and a $20 phone deposit (both  refundable). Your monthly total comes to $1,061.45 before tax -- slightly more  than for a one-bedroom place next door at the Grand -- and you don't get a  kitchen. But utilities and color TV are thrown in free, you don't have to show  that you make more than $3,000 a month and, best of all, you can pay your rent  with a credit card. PAT DOUGHERTY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] For the first time, a person charged with terrorist  activities has been interviewed by Radio Programas del Peru in  his cell in Cachiche Prison, in Ica.    Gregorio Uribe Guillen, who is serving his sentence in  Cachiche Prison, said that the peace accord proposed by Abimael  Guzman is not a strategy for Shining Path [SL] reorganization.  Let us hear what he said:    [Begin recording] [Uribe] I wish to voice my resolute  support  for President Gonzalo's letters asking President Alberto  Fujimori for negotiations to reach a peace accord. The fact  that there are still acts of violence shows that the actions  have still not stopped, and I think this would be the best thing  for all concerned.    [Unidentified reporter] Is this to give you time to  reorganize and resume your struggle against the state of law in  a few years' time?    [Uribe] No. We are quite aware that this is not a strategy,  but rather something that is necessary for the Peruvian people,  for Peruvian society as a whole, to reach peace. It is not a  matter of strategy but something that is necessary. [end  recording]</p>

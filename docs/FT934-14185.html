			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): Starting from scratch - Eastern Europe - The success of mobile communications supports the 'leapfrog' theory that eastern Europe can skip generations of development and leap to the latest technology BUDAPEST, circa 1990. The lead character of the film hears his wife has given birth, rushes to a callbox and telephones the hospital. Wrong number: cut to seductive girl at the other end of the line. Telephones - erratic ones - are a staple of east European drama. Not for much longer. State-of-the-art French card phones, some with tone-dialling, are proliferating across Hungary's capital and taking the romance out of telecommunications. Modernisation is long overdue. Communist regimes, suspicious of free communication and keen on more tangible economic output, bequeathed creakingly inadequate telephone systems to their democratic successors. East European countries average 10-20 lines per 100 inhabitants compared with about 40 in western Europe. Some exchanges date back to the 1930s. Visiting western engineers with a yen for telephone history beg for a glimpse of the Jozsefvaros rotary switch in Budapest. Economic liberalisation has put the telephone systems of the region - never very sturdy - under even more strain. The foreign investors, private entrepreneurs and foreign traders of the new market economy are chatterboxes. The sheer volume of calls regularly overburdens telephone systems across the region. One day this spring, telephones crashed across parts of Prague and physical meetings came back into their own. Each individual's inconvenience adds up to a heavy overall economic burden. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of east European companies showed that substandard telecommunications was eastern Europe's most serious infrastructure obstacle to exports. Rickety telephones have burdened, and deterred, foreign investors, too. General Electric of the US blamed part of the 1992 loss at its Tungsram lighting venture to the cost of establishing microwave links to its plant in Nagykanizsa in western Hungary. For all the grumbling about telephones - without which many a social occasion in the region would be incomplete - development has begun. Most countries in eastern Europe have - or are constructing - new international switches, which enjoy a very rapid payback. The region's telephone utilities are also installing new digital switches and fibre-optic cable to create an overlay network for businesses, and to reduce the strain on existing analogue services. Business users prepared to pay a premium can now acquire a line of international quality in Prague, Budapest and several other cities. In this first phase, western manufacturers like Siemens, LM Ericsson, Northern Telecom, Alcatel and AT&amp;T have moved in to supply equipment. Some have been also been drawn into privatisations and joint ventures in order to win contracts. Nowhere is the link clearer than in Poland. The authorities and their advisers Bain &amp; Co parcelled up the telecommunications equipment sector into three parts for sale. Acquirers have preferential access to the Polish market and the policy has induced AT&amp;T, Alcatel and - just last month - Siemens to invest. Investment, and western firms, have also focussed on mobile communications. Hungary's recent tender for two concessions to operate GSM digital mobile networks raised nearly Dollars 100m in fees and promises another Dollars 400m in spending on network development over 10 years. US West, the regional Bell operating company, partnered national operator Matav to gain one of two concessions. Pannon GSM, a consortium teaming national operators from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, took the second. US West has been active elsewhere in the region, recently winning tenders to develop digital mobile networks in 10 Russian cities. The company also has stakes in existing analogue mobile concessions in Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics. In Poland, Ameritech of the US, France Telecom and local partners have invested Dollars 120m in their Centertel joint venture. Meanwhile, various Scandinavian operators are embarking on wireless communications development in the Baltic republics. Further south in the former Soviet Union, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Denmark and PTT Netherlands have combined to provide mobile phones in 21 Ukrainian cities. Penetration by mobile services has been rapid with the longest established provider, Hungary's Westel joint venture, serving 33,000 subscribers after just three years. Average usage is several times that in the west: many customers have no access to landlines and their mobile phone is their main means of communication. The relative success of mobile communications supports the 'leapfrog' theory: that eastern Europe can skip generations of development and leap to the latest technology - 'the only technical advantage which the Czech Republic has in telecommunications is that we have to rebuild the infrastructure almost from scratch,' says Mr Mihal Cupa, head of the strategy section of national operator SPT Telecom. The main effort, nevertheless, centres on the more prosaic task of providing more landlines for a population which cannot afford high mobile phone charges. And that is an expensive proposition. A report by the OECD calculates that Dollars 129bn is need to bring average line density to 35 per 100 by the new millenium. Some guesses put investment needs are as high as Dollars 320bn. Much of the funding must inevitably be local. Tariffs have increased sharply in every east European country and the rise is likely to continue. Price capping regulation, in Hungary at least, is expected to allow increases in line with general inflation rather than following the West in subtracting a few percentage points from the RPI. International institutions, primarily the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, have also favoured the telecommunications sector for lending. But the indebtedness of local telecoms operators threatens to become unsustainably heavy. Investment, moreover, is still proceeding far too slowly for east European countries to approach west European telecommunication standards by the year 2000. The shortfall, if it is to be narrowed, will have to be made up by foreign equity investment. The first powerful infusion is set to occur with the privatisation of more than 30 per cent of Matav, the Hungarian state-owned operator. The leading international telecoms operators bidding have until later this month to make their offers. Already Deutsche Telekom of Germany has formed a consortium with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US to emerge as the leading contender. France Telecom and US West may make a rival bid, advisers believe. Hungary's telecoms privatisation may be eastern Europe's first but it will hardly be its last. The Czech Republic has appointed JP Morgan, the US investment bank, to advise on the sale of a minority stake of SPT Telecom, the national operator, to outside investors. But privatisation in eastern Europe is complicated by legal and regulatory uncertainties - telecoms privatisation more than most. With less than a month to go before the submission of bids for Hungary's telecoms privatisation, it is still not clear how much the national operator will have to contend with local competition. Nor is title to real estate inherited from Hungary's former PTT clearly defined. No wonder, then, that estimates of the worth of Matav vary wildly. International Technology Consultants's valuation of Dollars 2,500 per line gave the Hungarian operator a value of Dollars 3.3bn. But the figure is just a starting point. ITC is the first to say that the privatisation format is complex and the regulatory framework fluid. Whatever the purchase price, investors will have to raise several billion dollars for subsequent development of the network and it is this sum to which the Hungarian authorities are paying the closest attention. Hungary has already attracted about Dollars 5.6bn in foreign investment since reforms began in 1988. And Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms minister, believes: 'With Matav's privatisation we have the opportunity to attract as much foreign capital again as has come to Hungary so far.' As that investment, and the inflow into the region as a whole, gather pace, eastern Europe's unpredictable communist telephones will become a historical curiosity. Few will mourn - apart from film scriptwriters, that is.  -------------------------------     COUNTRIES COMPARED  ------------------------------- The number of main telephone lines in eastern Europe:  ------------------------------- Bulgaria             2,250,000 Estonia                340,000 Hungary              1,100,000 Latvia                 640,000 Lithuania              820,000 Poland               3,600,000 Russia              22,000,000 Ukraine              8,000,000 For comparison: The UK              26,000,000  ------------------------------- Source: CIT, 1991 figures.  -------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nasty Serbs Have Not Yet Caused </F> Dutch Battalion Any Bother"]    [Text] Srebrenica -- So far, the NATO air strikes around  Gorazde have had limited consequences for the Netherlands troops  stationed in Bosnia. Defense Minister Ter Beek, who began a  four-day working visit of the Netherlands units on Monday [11  April], will probably have to alter his plans as a result of the  NATO air strikes.    The Netherlanders have not yet been faced with any  aggression  in the form of shooting or threats from the Serbs. However, on  Sunday and Monday, virtually all units were placed on a higher  level of alert immediately after the NATO air strikes. The  Netherlanders freedom of movement is being further limited by  the fact that convoys are finding it impossible to get through,  and the Serbs are not giving soldiers on furlough permission to  leave "their" territory.    In all likelihood, the 600 or so Netherlands troops in the  eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica will be caused the  greatest annoyance by the decision made by the Bosnian Serbs to  break off contacts with the UN peacekeeping forces. The Dutch  battalion in Srebrenica is dependent for supplies on the  Netherlands logistics unit in Lukavac, 120 km away. The Bosnian  Serbs must always issue their permission for such deliveries,  which have been called off over the next few days.    Even Minister Ter Beek is not being granted permission to  visit Srebrenica. The heightened state of alert means that  leave is being cancelled, partly for security reasons.    The supplies of the Netherlands troops in Srebrenica will  provisionally last for a good month. In the short term, the  Dutch battalion needs the Serbs to allow helicopter flights  between Srebrenica and the nearby enclave of Zepa, where more  Netherlands troops will soon be stationed.    On Monday, in central Bosnia, the area from which the  Netherlands transport battalion is operating, the Serbs closed  the important Sierra One checkpoint between Sarajevo and  Kiseljak, reported one Netherlands spokesman from Zagreb.  Netherlands convoys pass through this checkpoint on the way  from the Croatian port of Split to the Bosnian town of Busovaca.    Minister Ter Beek plans to visit this "home port" of the  transport battalion. The question is whether he will get that  far. Meanwhile, a group of UN military observers has been  trapped in the hotbed of Gorazde. They include Netherlands  Major Buisman. One spokesman in Zagreb said that the UN  observers have been placed under house arrest by the Bosnian  Serbs and may no longer leave the enclave. The Netherlands F-16  pilots in the Italian base of Villafranca are keeping themselves  ready to take part in any future action by the NATO air force.</p>

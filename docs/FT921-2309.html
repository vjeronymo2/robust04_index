			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: SSAB to kick off Swedish flotations THE Swedish government yesterday announced that the steel company SSAB would be the first of 35 state companies to be sold into the private sector. The state owns 60 per cent of the voting rights and 48 per cent of the equity in SSAB, which has been listed on the Stockholm bourse since 1986. The publicly-held shares are largely owned by domestic institutional investors. The state sale will be conducted through the issue of convertible debentures with an option to redeem them for SSAB shares by the beginning of 1994. A price has not yet been set for the issue, but the government hopes to raise between SKr1.5bn (Dollars 248m) and SKr2bn through the sale, which will be handled by Handelsbanken Fondkommission. A prospectus will be issued in May. About half the debentures are expected to be reserved for Swedish and foreign institutional investors to guarantee that SSAB will have a stable ownership structure. The rest will be offered to SSAB employees and the general public. Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said SSAB was too small to be offered through a share issue to the general public.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Granting an end to food trade gap - Farmers and markets are drawing closer When the first lorry load of lettuces passed through the Channel tunnel in early July, Michael Jack, Britain's horticulture minister, hailed a breakthrough for the UK's vegetable industry. The lettuces and celery from G's Fresh Salads in Cambridgeshire were bound for a Belgian supermarket, Delhaize le Lion, as one of the company's and, indeed, the UK's first deliveries of fresh produce direct to a continental chain. The export order grew out of an effort by John Major, the prime minister. A seminar at 10 Downing Street in January last year tried to bridge the UK's Pounds 5.6bn food and drink trade gap. Grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, to help farmers' co-operatives and small food companies get closer to the market, followed. G's Fresh Salads received a grant of Pounds 105,000 for three years. The grant helps pay for a full-time export manager. The company's sales overseas have grown from Pounds 2m last year to an expected Pounds 3m this year. 'It has enabled us to be much more highly organised and to get out and see our customers to find out what they want,' says John Shropshire, managing director. 'We have taken on people with language skills to cover virtually the whole of the continent.' Long insulated from the vagaries of the marketplace by guaranteed prices under the Common Agricultural Policy, Britain's farmers are often out of touch with what their customers want. 'Primary producers are masterly at planning production, but their marketing skills are undeveloped, particularly when they are producing an undifferentiated product,' according to Gillian Shephard, former agriculture minister, who launched the Pounds 10m marketing grants scheme in June. George Ray, who runs Central Egg Agency, a farmers' egg co-operative in Solihull, handles a product that is difficult to differentiate unless by stressing the high health standards imposed on battery egg production in the UK. He sought a way of selling surplus eggs on the world market when the UK is over-producing. 'Before, these eggs would just be dumped abroad at low prices by wholesalers who wanted to get rid of them,' he said. Ray has used his grant to launch an export drive by which the eggs are marketed overseas before the surplus arises, allowing deliveries to be as fresh as possible. He has cut out the middle man, making direct contact with customers. 'We've been going for nine months and we've far exceeded any expectations,' he says. He sends eggs to the Netherlands and Spain and hopes to break into the Hong Kong market. The grant pays half of the salary for an export manager and half his travelling expenses. For many small companies and farmers' co-operatives wishing to tap the export market, the grant provides the resources for a marketing drive. The grant can help organisations sharpen skills and redirect their marketing efforts. Stuart Edwards, managing director at Fenmarc Produce in Cambridgeshire, is using the money to organise three groups of potato growers in anticipation of the demise of the central Potato Marketing Board. Edwards has identified north Lincolnshire, north Norfolk, and Herefordshire as the areas with soil suitable for growing the type of potatoes he wants when the PMB is dismantled. The PMB, which sets quotas for growers, is due to be abolished in 1997, but potato producers are calling for the market to be deregulated before then. 'We are not making any dramatic changes, but we are starting to become closer to our growers so that we can relay to them the needs of the customer,' Edwards said. That means encouraging farmers to grow varieties for harvest at specific times of the year. Some farmers still have to be convinced that better marketing will help sell their produce. To try to overcome innate conservatism, the National Farmers Union is conducting a study into how producers might best use the grants scheme. As one official says: 'We can't eliminate the food trade gap overnight, but we have to realise we're in the single European market now.'</p>

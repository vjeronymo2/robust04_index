			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels strives for EC farm reform compromise THE Portuguese presidency of the European Community and the European Commission was yesterday trying to craft a compromise on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy through detailed, individual negotiations with farm ministers. These bilateral talks were aimed at isolating the nationally vested interests against which the commission has to square off its reform plan. When ministers met in full council on March 3, the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands piled in behind an unrealistic German shopping list of changes to the Brussels plan to question the reform's very principles, although the 12 had endorsed them last November. The commission is now trying to work with a cautious Portuguese presidency to limit the scope for filibustering, fearful that the chance for reform might easily slip away. The intractable row over farm subsidies within the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks, the hostility of most member states to new EC revenue demands, and a new spate of elections in the community, which mean that very few ministers who started the lengthy farm reform negotiations will be around to conclude them, are all factors feeding the commission's anxiety for a quick resolution. Brussels' officials say that if member states can be prevented from denting the central precepts of the commission's formula for reining in the CAP's overproduction and profligacy, they will push for a decision at a forseeably marathon farm council beginning on April 28 in Luxembourg. The reform plan is built round some 30 per cent price cuts on cereals, with full compensation - estimated at Ecu14bn (Pounds 9.9bn) - contingent on medium- to large-scale farmers taking land out of production. France, Germany and the UK are leading calls for more compensation for 'set-aside', and most want smaller price cuts. Before the farm council formally convened last night, member states were expected to push for a range of expensive concessions, including: Dried fodder: Brussels wants to abolish this Ecu1bn-plus subsidy to driers of grass. France and Germany want to keep it. Maize silage: If grain prices fall 30 per cent, the commission sees no reason to keep subsidising (cost Ecu800m-plus) maize for cattle-feed; France does. Sheepmeat: The UK wants greater compensation and higher headage limits for its bigger herds. The commission wants stricter quotas to stabilise expenditure already at Ecu2.2bn. Beef: Ireland is fighting plans to set limits on the record intervention buying upon which it depends, which has doubled the beef budget to Ecu4.7bn. Dairy: The main problem is Spain, Greece and Italy's demand for more share in a quota that will be cut about 4 per cent to ease the glut and Ecu6bn cost. The commission argues that intervention stockpiles are understated, because it spends over Ecu1bn turning butter into pastry and ice cream, and similar amounts turning skimmed milk into 'calf-milk replacer'. The commission wants to whittle away at these interests before putting a final package on the table, which under majority voting could be blocked only by two large member states and a smaller one.</p>

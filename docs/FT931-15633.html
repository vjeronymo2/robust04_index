			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Technology: Under siege - Massachusetts is fighting to maintain its position as a high-tech centre amid fierce competition As competition intensifies in the US to attract job-creating industries, the high-technology sector is being wooed from coast to coast. States like Michigan, Rhode Island, Texas and North Carolina are keen to lure companies, while the traditional centres of Massachusetts and California are striving to hold their own. High-tech companies, which offer good pay and usually pose little risk to the environment, are seen as particularly desirable additions to a local economy. Regional and state governments promise everything from tax breaks to rail links to convince these companies to locate within their borders. This is good news for companies in sectors such as software, telecommunications and biotechnology. But Massachusetts fears it may become a casualty of the battle. With an economy based largely on high-technology, the state has much to lose. Its redoubled efforts to maintain a hold on this area will be closely watched by competing states and high-tech companies alike. In the heady 1980s, the computer sector in Boston led a growth surge so buoyant that it was confidently dubbed the 'Massachusetts Miracle'. Companies in fields such as computers, telecommunications and environmental technology came to account for some 15 per cent of employment (excluding support industries). Overnight stars like Digital Equipment Corporation and Wang were the best known of the many new computer groups lining Route 128 north of the city. By the end of the decade, the area produced more computer chips than Silicon Valley. During the last few years, though, New England's computer bubble has burst. The failure of Wang and troubles at Digital have highlighted the difficulties facing the industry, and the once thriving Route 128 is now little more than an old highway lined with empty offices. Since 1984, some 44,000 jobs have been lost in Massachusetts' computer sector, which now employs 287,000 people. The pain of the industry's floundering has been partially countered by the emergence of non-electronics sectors. As in California, biotechnology companies have helped Massachusetts to fill the yawning job gap left when many computer companies closed their doors. Jobs in biotechnology have risen from virtually nothing to 14,000 in the past seven years, but still account for only 0.5 per cent of employment, though the total health sector (including biotechnology) makes up 13 per cent. The possibility of losing the high-technology battle was brought home to the state a few months ago when one Massachusetts-based biotech group, Alpha-Beta Technology, announced plans to build a Dollars 31m (Pounds 20m) manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, which provided favourable tax breaks. 'I think areas like Northern California and Massachusetts had become very complacent about high-tech,' says Patrick Leonard, president of Massachusetts-based Cambridge Biotech Corporation. 'Successful marketing from states like North Carolina has forced them to wake up and that's great for the biotech industry.' Massachusetts still has reasons to feel confident. Many of the elements which triggered the growth of the computer sector, such as high educational levels and plenty of venture capital, have been successfully fed into biotechnology. Home to two of the most prestigious universities in the US, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the state offers formidable advantages to high-technology companies in the research and development phase. 'Most of the high-technology companies started in Boston were formed with technology ideas out of academic research at Harvard and MIT,' says Garen Bohlin, chief financial officer at Genetics Institute, founded by two Harvard professors. Finally, the universities provide entrepreneurs for the industry. Attracted by the quality of life in Massachusetts, many graduates opt to stay in the area. Over the last five years, MIT graduates alone founded more than 100 high-technology companies in the state. Another advantage for the biotechnology sector is the large number of excellent hospitals in the area. 'The well-developed health industry is especially helpful when we move to clinical tests,' says Geoffrey Cox, senior vice-president of Genzyme Corporation, which recently dropped plans to leave the state. Massachusetts has successfully transferred many of these resources from the computer sector to biotechnology. Some biotechnology companies have begun to retrain former computer workers. 'There is a lot of overlap, and not only in skilled workers. A lot of the equipment and infrastructure used in the computer industry, like clean rooms, is quite relevant to biotechnology,' adds Cox. Another resource shift has been in the area of venture capital. 'A great deal of venture capital in the state has moved away from computers towards biotech,' says Ken Bate, chief financial officer of Boston-based Biogen. 'Boston has always been dependent on high-tech industries, and is much more entrepreneurial and risk-oriented than other cities in the US.' But Massachusetts' success in R&amp;D does not necessarily translate into jobs in high-tech manufacturing. 'Massachusetts is a high-wage state,' said Bate. 'So at that stage, it faces stiffer competition from other regions.' This presents a big problem for the area. 'We can't build an economy on research alone,' says Massachusetts governor William Weld. 'We have to capture the manufacturing, the marketing and the sales staff, too.' To prevent the loss of more biotechnology manufacturing facilities, the Weld administration has announced several new initiatives. Among them are a capital gains tax phase-out and other tax breaks, and assistance in getting around bureaucratic laws. Whether Massachusetts will succeed in its battle to hold on to biotechnology may still be doubtful. Other states are sure to give the region a run for its money and have enjoyed some success in luring companies away, as the Alpha-Beta example shows. One thing is sure - the biotechnology industry will enjoy the fight.</p>

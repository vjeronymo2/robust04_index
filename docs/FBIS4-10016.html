			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 Apr (PL) -- Today, the official daily  GRANMA warned about the magnitude and advanced technology of the  announced U.S. military maneuvers in Atlantic waters, commenting  that such exercises complicate the situation in the hemisphere.    GRANMA, mouthpiece of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC),  said  that once more the Atlantic and east coast of the United States  will be the scene of the Fleetex 2/94 Combined Exercise, whose  operational goal is the effective coordination of naval, air,  and ground forces in fulfilling different integral missions.    The U.S. Government, under the guise of calming residents  worldwide over possible deployment of its military forces, has  announced that the maneuvers are "routine" or "innocent  exercises," the newspaper indicated.    GRANMA added that it is very difficult to understand this  idea and, even more, passively contemplate the scene when this  supposed innocence includes approximately 13,000 soldiers (2,000  are Marine Corps assault forces); 23 warships, including one  nuclear aircraft carrier; and more than 100 attack and transport  planes.    GRANMA explained that according to spokespersons for the  U.S.  State Department, the new exercise has as its main objective the  approval for a large part of these forces to transfer to Europe.    The advanced technology of nearly all of the Fleetex 2/94  Exercise forces contradicts the common saying "there is a big  distance between what is said and what is done" because any  change in course or increase in velocity would reduce any  distance, particularly if it is a short distance, the newspaper  remarked.    The announced participation of an Argentine destroyer and a  submarine should be pointed out. Argentina is in fact joining a  dangerous military buildup in regions very distant from its  natural bases, GRANMA concluded.</p>

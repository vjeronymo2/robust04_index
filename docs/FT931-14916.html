			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Siemens issues veiled profits warning after fall in new orders SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday issued a veiled profits warning for the 1993 financial year as it revealed slowing earnings growth and a fall in new orders in the first quarter. While the full year's turnover is expected to rise 7 per cent to around DM84bn (Pounds 33.3bn), 'it will take major efforts to maintain the level of net income reached last year', said Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive. The group, which includes the successful KWU power plant subsidiary, and the stricken Siemens Nixdorf computer company, pushed up net earnings 9 per cent to DM1.96bn last year on sales of DM78.5 bn. Group orders in the first quarter of the current year fell 8 per cent, with domestic and foreign demand dropping 4 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Sales rose only 4 per cent and net profits were up 2 per cent at DM406m. Mr von Pierer attributed the fall in incoming business to the 'postponement' until later in the year of public telecommunications and power generation orders worth DM1.6bn. In spite of the slowdown - reflected in zero growth in world electrical markets last year - 'prophecies of doom are unwarranted', he added. However, Mr von Pierer expected flatter growth in new orders this year and further staff cuts. Some 3,000 of the 413,000 employed worldwide at the end of the last financial year had already gone and the total would be reduced to less than 400,000 by the end of September. At Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), where most of the 6,000 job cuts planned to be made by the end of 1994 will now come in the current year, the group expects 'weak growth and further price erosion', according to Mr Hermann Franz, the board member responsible for computers. Restructuring would continue and high extraordinary expenditure would be necessary. He reiterated that computers and semiconductors, which together lost more than DM1bn last year, remained core businesses within Siemens. Osram, Siemens' lamp producing unit, has signed an agreement to buy Sylvania of the US for an undisclosed sum. The merger has been approved by US anti-trust authorities and 'can go into effect in the near future', Mr von Pierer said.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Get off my show] - Radio THE FIRST thing you learn as presenter of Feedback, the correspondence column of the air on BBC Radio 4, is that radio is woven into the lives of the listeners in a way that television never has been and probably never can be. You have to sit down to watch television, and if someone moves Minder from 9.00 to 8.00 pm it may annoy you, but it makes little difference to your life. However, if broadcasters change the running order of the Today programme in even the smallest way they interfere with the morning ritual of shave/shower/breakfast or dress/cook/shop. Move Woman's Hour from the afternoon to the morning and you play havoc with a woman's daily routine and spoil her coffee break. It is made abundantly clear to the Feedback presenter that when radio chiefs do change the schedules, listeners feel as though someone has walked uninvited into their home and rearranged the furniture. They write not in irritation but incandescent with fury asking 'Whose radio channel do they think this is?' implying a possessiveness that nobody feels for a television network. It is probably radio's greatest strength. The second thing you realise is that 99 per cent of people only write when angry. This results in a phenomenon which, early on in the job, I named 'Kaleidoscope Syndrome'. Radio 4 controller Michael Green decided that instead of running the arts magazine Kaleidoscope solely in the evening, he would originate it in the afternoon and give it an evening repeat. From all over the country I was inundated with vituperation. 'Get this artsy-fartsy metropolitan rubbish off my radio,' snorted one, 'while I'm ploughing here outside Diss I do not want to know what that effete crowd are getting up to in London'. The programme was condemned as a hotbed of homosexuality (there had been two vaguely gay items in the first 10 days) and heaped with scorn: what was the point in listening if you could not get to the theatres and galleries reviewed? The letters came from north and south, men and women, young and old, and there were no counterbalancing expressions of welcome. It was clear that Feedback had to record this hostile reaction. Having done so I was cascaded with letters saying 'Hold on a moment, we like hearing about the London arts scene here in Alloa/Beccles/Cardiff. It's true we cannot get up to town very often but that is exactly why we need Kaleidoscope to keep us abreast of things. Hands off]' Others said there was far too little about gay matters anywhere in the mass media. Such letters eventually outnumbered the hostile variety, yet I doubt if any would have been written had those listeners not been enraged by the initial attack. People who are content with what they hear rarely bother to write, though they may well be in the majority. Yet listeners - and this is Lesson 3 - tend to believe, as soon as they hear three or more other people expressing views which endorse their own that 'Everyone agrees . . . ' Having heard three letters saying that Any Questions is now merely a political dogfight, and should be changed back to the old civilised discourse between intelligent non-political all-rounders, they write to Feedback asking 'Why oh why does the BBC persist so stubbornly in this idiocy when they have been told repeatedly that everybody dislikes it?' This was the pattern with the Woman's Hour move from afternoon to morning and with the change in Any Answers from a letters programme to a phone-in, both of which produced numerous hostile letters. When I discovered that in both cases the changes had resulted in enlarged audiences, and said so, I received sceptical letters asking 'Who says the audience is bigger? Who is doing the counting?' and claiming darkly 'I've never met anyone who has been polled by the BBC', as though the writers really believed that the BBC was determined to lower its ratings and then lie about them. And the favourite Feedback topics? This season it has been the plan to use Radio 4's long-wave frequency for a continuous news channel, leaving the familiar mixture (Letter From America, Desert Island Discs, Gardener's Question Time) solely on FM. The proposal is opposed passionately not only by users of portable radios and car drivers all over Britain, who have difficulty getting clear FM signals, but by many in continental Europe who are able to receive Radio 4 only on long wave. However, in the long term the matters which attract most letters are The Archers, the world's longest running soap opera and a series which could easily sustain a weekly correspondence programme on its own (Ruth's howling baby is currently causing the Feedback postman's back to bend, with the breast-feeders up in arms about the poor little mite being given a bottle), and English useage. One day I intend offering Radio 4 a series to be called 'Less Mistakes In English' sub-titled 'A New Criteria: Different To All Previous Series'. Only one thing infuriates the English pedant more than a change which has crept into English useage between his childhood and today - and that is hearing it on BBC radio.</p>

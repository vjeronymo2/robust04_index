			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japanese condemn linking 'fast track' to rice market JAPAN'S Agriculture Ministry yesterday condemned suggestions that the extension of the US 'fast-track' trade mechanism should be linked to the opening of the country's rice market to imports. Mr Akio Kyoya, a vice-minister of agriculture, said the ministry had heard US officials wanted the rice market opened to ensure that the 'fast-track' mechanism was extended beyond the end of May. 'The issues are totally irrelevant,' Mr Kyoya said, stressing that rice should be discussed in multilateral negotiations, not in the context of US domestic policy. The 'fast track' forces US Congress to accept or reject agreements without clause-by-clause amendments, and aims to ensure speedy passage of a Uruguay Round trade pact. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already decided, privately, that rice imports are inevitable. But the Agriculture Ministry, representing farmers' interests, was surprised last week when a senior official of the Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, also said imports might be allowed. Until then, the opposition party had publicly argued that the rice market must remain closed in the interests of 'food security', and the party is courting the farm vote for a general election, expected late this year. Recent public opinion polls have shown most Japanese support a lifting of the ban on imported rice, but the Agriculture Ministry has argued it would be foolish to make a concession while the European Community and the US cannot settle their disputes. But the ministry has also begun investigating means of compensating rice farmers who will be affected by imports. The policy is likely to include subsidies to encourage farmers to switch crops, as well as increased funds for farmers' co-operatives nationally. Meanwhile, Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, is preparing for a visit to Washington on Thursday which he would like to centre on Japan's growing international role, but which will probably deal with trade issues, including rice. Reuter adds from Tokyo: Japan strongly opposes a US proposal for a tenfold rise in import duty on minivans, Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said. 'We strongly oppose (the idea that) the US raise the import duty tenfold to 25 per cent. It might violate (Gatt rules).'</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Commerce creeps into the corporate card: Clay Harris reviews the good, the bad and the jovial in seasonal greetings from a range of companies SENDERS and recipients of corporate Christmas cards, take note: all European Community cards must be harmonised by 1997. That, anyway, is the message distributed in the interest of seasonal cheer by the accounting firm Blackstone Franks. Judging by this year's crop of corporate cards, harmony is a long way off in Britain alone, much less the rest of Europe. In choice of subject, and in addressing the thorny issue of how commercial a card should be, there is a healthy diversity. On the eve of the single market, Europe is on the mind of many senders - sometimes humorously, as with Blackstone Franks and the British Clothing Industry Association's Euro Snowman which 'must not be taller than 1.8975 metres' - but often mundanely, with the 12 EC members' flags displayed as tree ornaments or presents. Panasonic Europe plants the flags in a map that shows almost all the world, except Japan, its home. The Met Office, more originally, offers a weather map of north-west Europe showing conditions on Christmas Day in 1892. More senders this year appear to include a commercial message on their cards. It can be blunt in the extreme. Opinion Leader Research and VandenBurg Public Relations emblazon their name or initials on the front without a hint of the festive season. Few in the motor industry forgo an opportunity to plug cars (Citroen's card looks like last year's model). Westland has Father Christmas in an EH101 helicopter. Seagram London illustrates 'Get into the spirit of Christmas' with bottles of its brands hanging on a Christmas tree, while Guinness, showing a pint, proclaims: 'Not everyone's dreaming of a white Christmas.' For his own card, Sir Antony Tennant, the company's retiring chairman, sent a painting of Hop Pickers from the Guinness collection. Perhaps campaigning organisations can be allowed some leeway. Through deft editing of A Christmas Carol, the Maxwell/AGB Pension Schemes Contributors Association lets Dickens make its point about the ghost that still haunts the pensioners. Camra has a go at changes in the brewing industry, adding wishes for 'a concentrated new year'. But Northumbrian Environmental Management surely should have drawn the line somewhere short of featuring Father Christmas delivering a sleigh-full of parcels labelled 'liquid treatment', 'clinical incineration' and the like. Its sibling company, Northumbrian Water, reproduced a sylvan view of the Sunderland Bridge sewage works. The London Docklands Development Corporation keeps up the thread of its 'Knocker' and 'Docker' ad campaign. The present-giving taste of the former, of course, makes us shudder - 'five golden 'Eurovision greats' albums . . . two turtle neck jumpers (nylon)' - while the latter is bang up-to-date, at least to the late 1980s: 'five golden autumn leaves (pressed) . . . three French hens (free range)'. The Financial Times is in no position to condemn commercialism. Its card - which has sparked a lively internal debate - shows a robin in snow that has covered all but a pink corner of the FT. Some of the most successful cards use subtle allusions to the sender's line of business, literally in the case of Deutsche Bundesbahn's railway in the snow (pictured). The tree-top fairy (also pictured) casting a familiar legal shadow is an attractive, clever and distinctive card that does not overtly push the name of the sender, solicitors Lewis Silkin. A company as rich as De Beers has another solution. Its card features a Raoul Dufy painting which the company commissioned for a 1951 advertising campaign in the US. An industrial process itself can be made into art. Outokumpu Zinc's card features a photograph of zinc casting that could be a rushing stream in the Arctic spring. Thankfully, there are fewer cards from the fringes of blasphemy this year. An unfortunate exception comes from the advertising agency Grey London. The Immaculate Concept, a back-of-the-envelope sketch for an advert, concludes with 'cut to pack shot' showing baby Jesus in cot. The best religious card was the wood engraving (pictured) from the Design Council. But the US investment bank Goldman Sachs shows how good a purely secular card without any seasonal reference can be, reproducing a painting from its collection by the British artist Keith Milow. One way of making a card stand out from rows of cherubim is to give the recipient something to do. This year one could connect the dots with Phildrew Ventures, punch out a Christmas tree with ITV, make a turkey pop up with the PR agency Paternoster Partnership, open the windows on an 'advert calendar' to reveal names of FCA's clients or don red and green specs to appreciate the 3-D Father Christmas bursting from a Mills &amp; Allen poster hoarding. Finland's paper industry association offers a flimsy disc which, when played with a gramophone needle, offers 'compliments of the season to all Finnpap customers wherever in the world you may be'. Charity cards are now the rule, but PowerGen shows that its support of the children's books collection at the National Library for the Blind is not just a gesture. Its greeting is also printed in Braille. Hartstone Group has it all ways. Its card promotes Happy Kids on the front, notes inside that royalties on the sale of these products support the National Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and then says it will send no further cards. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder nowhere more than in Christmas cards. But this beholder has had enough. Enough Impressionists. Even Old Masters begin to pall unless they are reproduced as large and sumptuously as those from commodity broker Brandeis and management consultants Arthur D. Little. Enough bad puns from public-relations companies. And enough generic winter scenes of London, especially of Ludgate Hill with the now-removed railway viaduct. But focusing on a particular corner, as College Hill Associates does with its history of the City street in which Dick Whittington is buried, can make a recipient turn again.</p>

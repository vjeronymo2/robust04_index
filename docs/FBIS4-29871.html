			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The United States on  Tuesday [21 June] issued a statement welcoming Japan's current  efforts toward economic deregulation.    The statement, issued by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, said the  U.S. welcomes the ongoing government review of the laws and  regulations governing the Japanese economy.    It expressed hope that the review "will result in  elimination  of the wide range of unnecessarily restrictive regulations and  administrative procedures which burden and restrain the Japanese  economy."    In the past bilateral "framework" trade talks, the U.S.  presented Japan with specific reform proposals in the area of  deregulation, competition policy, administrative procedures and  distribution, the statement said.    It said the U.S. hopes these proposals will be incorporated  in the upcoming Japanese deregulation package.</p>

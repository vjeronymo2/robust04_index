			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH STARS ARE SKATING ON THIN ICE IN MINNESOTA  </P> <P> This is the land of 10,000 lakes and one failed National Hockey League team  that is a monument to mismanagement and miscalculation.  </P> <P> Hockey will outlast the North Stars in Minnesota because lacing on skates and  whacking a puck across those 10,000 frozen ponds are traditions passed on from  generation to generation.  </P> <P> The tradition is not only alive, but healthier than ever: The annual state high  school tournament, just completed, attracted sellout crowds for its  preliminary-round games and to the finals at the St. Paul Civic Center.  Round-the-clock telecasts showed roaring crowds, vibrant enthusiasm, lively  games.  </P> <P> The University of Minnesota Golden Gophers draw the same response, averaging  more than 7,000 fans a game, and the Western Collegiate Hockey Assn. playoffs  averaged 11,962 fans a game at the Civic Center.  </P> <P> It's the same game but a different scene in suburban Bloomington. There, the  North Stars skate before a crowd that might, if it's a Saturday and if there's  a giveaway and if the roads are free of ice, fill 10,000 of the Met Center's  15,093 seats. Starting with a base of 3,800 season tickets, one of the smallest  bases in the NHL, the North Stars this season have been averaging only 11,274  fans a game.  </P> <P> That's more than 3,000 below the NHL average but it's an increase over last  season's average of 9,795.  </P> <P> "Minnesota isn't the wrong place for hockey," said Jack Ferreira, the North  Stars' general manager. "It's just wrong for the Minnesota North Stars."  </P> <P> How could a professional hockey team go wrong in a state that is home to 45,000  registered amateur hockey players and the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame? How could  the North Stars miss in a state that has sent a steady stream of players to the  NHL and this season has 19 in the league?  </P> <P> It wasn't easy, but they've managed to extract nothing but fool's gold from a  gold mine.  </P> <P> The team has been on a financial and aesthetic decline since 1981, when it made  its only appearance in the Stanley Cup finals and lost to the New York  Islanders. The North Stars averaged 15,784 fans a game that season and topped  15,000 a game each of the next three seasons, but fans soured after getting too  many failed promises and postseason failures.  </P> <P> The team lost $6.5 million last season and $16 million over the past four  years, despite paying a paltry annual rent of $175,000 and keeping parking and  concession revenues. Its television revenues for 40 games this season will be  less than the $1.58 million a local TV station paid the Minnesota State High  School League to televise portions of the state hockey tournament.  </P> <P> "We were going 85, 86 (points) and every year we dropped season tickets," said  Lou Nanne, the team's general manager from 1977 to 1988 and now its president.  "We sold winning the Stanley Cup rather than professional hockey as  entertainment. Maybe we encouraged them to expect too much after we went to the  finals in '81."  </P> <P> Team owners George and Gordon Gund forced the issue in late January when they  announced they would sell the team or move it to the San Francisco Bay Area  unless the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission -- which owns Met Center  -- agreed to make $15 million in improvements to the building. George Gund, who  lives in the Bay Area, and his brother, Gordon, who is head of a financial  investment corporation in Princeton, N.J., assumed controlling interest in the  team in 1978 after their Cleveland Barons -- nee California (Oakland) Seals --  merged with the North Stars. Their net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion by  Forbes magazine.  </P> <P> The price they set for the franchise was $50 million. Not surprisingly, they've  gotten few offers.  </P> <P> One was from Minneapolis businessman and author Harvey Mackay, who has a  supporting cast that includes, among others, Carl Pohlad, owner of the Twins;  Northwest Airline, the Pillsbury Company, insurance companies and a TV-radio  station.  </P> <P> The other was from Compuware, a Michigan-based computer company. Compuware is  considered the more serious of the two and has the financial resources, but an  NHL insider said: "Once (Compuware officials) check over the books and see it  isn't going to work, they're going to withdraw their offer."  </P> <P> That would leave the Gunds with one option: moving to the Bay Area. Approval by  the NHL's Board of Governors would be required, and a meeting was held Monday  in Chicago to discuss the situation, but the team's relocation application  won't be formally considered until April. The governors showed their  receptiveness to a move earlier this month when they passed an amendment to the  league's bylaws that would allow a team to move with a majority vote by the  Board.  </P> <P> The Gunds referred questions about the team to Arthur Savage, who is Gordon  Gund's financial adviser. Savage wouldn't say whether the brothers prefer to  keep or sell the team, but he said they won't stay in Minnesota simply because  of sentiment within the NHL that a team can and should succeed there. "If  there's someone out there who would like to buy the team and keep the North  Stars there, let them have a try at it," Savage said. "If there isn't, we don't  feel we should be forced to stay there and be forced to lose $5 to $6 million a  year."  </P> <P> Although Oakland spurned Charles O. Finley's Seals in the 1970s, the Gunds  believe hockey will succeed this time around.  </P> <P> "That was 15 years ago. The Oakland A's were drawing 700,000 and the (San  Francisco) Giants weren't drawing, and this year they both combined to draw 5  million," Savage said. "The Warriors (of the NBA) sell out every game and  they're not even a playoff team. There's a big interest in sports. Our research  indicates the Bay Area will support a team." Savage said the area's avid  interest in amateur hockey has hurt the North Stars.  </P> <P> "There's so much other hockey that's available, from junior to high school to  college, and there's only so much room and so much time to devote to  professional hockey," he said. "This is more hockey country for the amateur  level than the professional level. Unfortunately, we have to make payrolls.  This is a business. They don't have to make payrolls in high school and  college. . . . There's too many choices, if you will. College hockey is equally  interesting to people there and it's much less expensive."  </P> <P> One of the North Stars' most costly mistakes was not hiring Herb Brooks as  coach in the early 1980s. Brooks, who was born in St. Paul, coached the  University of Minnesota to three NCAA championships and became an unassailable  hero when he coached the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to the gold medal at  Lake Placid, N.Y. He coached in Switzerland and then in New York before joining  the North Stars' bench in the fall of 1987. Brooks was not retained when  Ferreira succeeded Nanne.  </P> <P> "Letting Herbie go was a PR disaster," Nanne said, "but the owners said the new  manager should be able to pick his coach."  </P> <P> As absentee owners, the Gunds could not grasp the extent of Brooks' popularity.  Brooks would not comment about his stint with the North Stars, and about the  team's plight, saying only that he doesn't buy the theory that the team is the  victim of a hockey glut.  </P> <P> "Amateur and professional hockey can coexist in a real positive way," said  Brooks, a commentator for NHL telecasts on SportsChannel America. Nonetheless,  the North Stars' departure seems inevitable. The vacuum it creates probably  would be filled in the next wave of expansion, leaving another owner to learn  from the Gunds' mistakes.  </P> <P> Or repeat them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The Minnesota North Stars were one of six teams added to the NHL before the  1967-68 season -- the Kings, California (Oakland) Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins,  Philadelphia Flyers and St. Louis Blues were the others. The Seals moved to  Cleveland and became the Barons for the 1976-77 season, then merged with the  North Stars for the 1978-79 season. Since then, the team has played its home  games in Bloomington, Minn. If a Minnesota buyer cannot be found, the team  probably will move to the San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> WHERE HAVE ALL THE FANS GONE?  </P> <P> The Minnesota North Stars set a team attendance record in 1980-81, when they  reached the Stanley Cup finals. Since then, average attendance at North Star  games in Met Center has dropped considerably. In the same period, average  attendance at all NHL games has risen to record levels annually.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:5.74IN:2.22IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Season  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record, Playoff Results  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Minn.

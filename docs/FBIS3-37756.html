In the morning, he  held talks with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, as  a result of which eight documents were signed. As BELAPAN  learned, the documents concern, first of all, the state border  between the two countries. The border is to remain the same as  it was on 16 June 1940. During the talks, both sides agreed  that it is necessary to expand cooperation between the two  countries in various spheres of economy and politics. They  particularly expressed their willingness to reach an agreement  on mutually beneficial utilization of the Navapolatsk refinery  and the Ventspils seaport. Also discussed was the possibility  of establishing department stores in the capitals of both  republics. Latvian products will be displayed, for example, by  the Minsk supermarket Ryha. The situation of Belarusians in  Latvia was also discussed at the meeting.</p>

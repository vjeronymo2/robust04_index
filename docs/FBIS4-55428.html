			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Croatia's Adriatic oil  company has impounded 15,000 tons of oil the Slovenian firm  Petrol of Ljubljana has bought in Russia until the Slovenian oil  refinery in Lendava settles its outstanding debt of 1.4 million  Deutsche marks with the Adriatic oil. Croatia has also  suspended all light oil deliveries to Slovenia's only refinery  in Lendava until it has paid back the 8.5 million dollars it  owes to Naftaplin in Zagreb for light oil deliveries made so  far. The Slovenia-Croatia silent oil war threatens to seriously  undermine the already tense relations between the two  neighbouring countries which seceded from the former Yugoslav  federation in 1991. Relations between the two sides are  especially burdened by the unresolved border and property  issues, over 600 million dollars in unsettled claims of private  depositors with the Ljubljanska Banka and deterioration in  economic relations.</p>

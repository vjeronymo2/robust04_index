			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 27 Jun (INA)--Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Hashimi, head of the Foreign Relations Bureau at the Iraq  Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and chairman of the  Iraqi-French Friendship Society, met here today with Ahmad  Shakir, chairman of the Association for Developing Arab-French  Relations, and his delegation.    During the meeting, Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi reviewed  the impact of the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq, affirming that  there is no longer any justification for maintaining this  embargo, particularly since Iraq has fulfilled its commitments  per the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.    Al-Hashimi also underscored the importance of promoting and  normalizing trade and economic ties between Iraq and France in  the interest of the two countries' peoples.    For his part, the chairman of the Association for Developing  Arab-French Relations expressed his willingness to continue to  work for the lifting of the unfair sanctions imposed on the  people of Iraq.    A delegation from the association arrived in Baghdad earlier  today. The delegation comprises French Senate Member Jean  Jacques Robier and representatives of several French firms and  banks.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Settlement #2: In accordance with section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, notice is hereby given that the terms of an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) have been agreed to by the following 22 parties, for the following amounts: Clifford Motors (a/k/a Steve Clifford Motors) ($1,500.00); Interstate Transmission (a/k/a Bailey Financial Corp.) ($1,800.00); Barnes Amoco ($1,400.00); Rocky Mountain Lube ($2,000.00); Zippy Lube (n/k/a Estate of Virgil Ruhter, deceased) ($4,000.00); Bob's Oil Exchange &amp; Car Wash ($25,000.00); Frank Fiksdal ($2,000.00); Tri-State Oil ($30,000.00); Ray McKee (a/k/a Lonnie Ray McKee) ($1,000.00); Landers Salvage ($8,668.00); Al Moser Chevron ($2,200.00); Herzog Brothers ($1,500.00); Crestwood Texaco ($1,893.00); O.N.O., Inc. (d/b/a Brigham Street Service) $3,600.00); Desert Oil Company ($60,000.00); Horner's Chevron (Wayne Hormer) ($200.00); Refinoil Products (d/b/a gardner Refinoil) ($500.00); Mesa Oil Company ($193,000.00); Al's Conoco (a/k/a Al Cazier's Conoco) ($200.00); A&amp;W Diesel Sales &amp; Service, Inc. ($14,000.00); Kent's Amoco/Service ($1,500.00); and Bill &amp; Vern's Service ($1,150.00). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By the terms of the proposed AOC for this settlement, these 22 PRPs will together pay $357,111.00 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund). The $357,111.00 represents approximately 0.5% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement was based. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement #2, has been reduced in consideration of the ability of the settling party to pay. EPA has determined that the settling parties cannot afford EPA's least expensive  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  settlement option offered to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sde minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  parties at the Site; that is, the ``Option A'' settlement. The settlement amount for each settling party has been reduced to the maximum amount EPA has determined the party is able to pay. Each settling parties' settlement amount equals $2.97 (derived and described above) multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of 30% of the Base Amount, minus an adjustment reflecting EPA's determination that the party is unable to pay the full settlement amount, referred to in the AOC as the ``inability-to-pay factor.'' The proposed AOC for all settlors participating in Settlement #2 contains an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to U.S. EPA relating to the proposed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  settlements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the proposed AOCs may be obtained from Greg Phoebe (8HWM&hyph;SR), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 294&hyph;7036.

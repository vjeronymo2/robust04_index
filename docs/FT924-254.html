			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Most markets felt quiet due to coming holidays. Cassia/cinnamom: nearby positions tight, demand small. Nutmegs/mace spot unchanged, shipment weak. Ginger: New crop is declining. Although the harvest is widely expected to be considerably less than last year, local and export demand have been soft. This could turn around quickly. Spots are small and will not cushion the trade. Cloves: Brazilian crop is in full swing, however crop shall be below normal. Pimento: both Jamaican and Mexico spot europe very tight. Tendency firm.</p>

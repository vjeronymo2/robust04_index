			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Crime -- The Andean Center for Popular  Action, (CAAP), reported in the Quito daily HOY of 3 April that  from 1982 to the present the country's crime rate has increased  by 9.4 percent annually, exceeding the urban growth rate of 4.3  percent per year (since 1974). CAAP believes that one of the  main reasons for this spiraling crime rate is the increase in  poverty resulting from the economic crisis of the 1980's. Crimes  against property increased 20.8 percent and represented 51  percent of the total reported crimes in 1992-93, while crimes  against individuals increased 11.6 percent and represented 14  percent of total reported crimes. CAAP also reports that the  regional distribution of crime has changed "drastically." For  example, population groups most hit by the economic crisis, the  poor in large urban areas and in the most "neglected" provinces,  now register the highest crime rates. Crime increased at a  faster rate in the Amazon region (19 percent), followed by the  coast (17 percent), and the highlands (8 percent). The provinces  with the largest increases in the crime rate were Esmeraldas  (37.9 percent) and Loja (35.1 percent). In absolute terms,  however, CAAP reports that Pichincha Province registered the  highest crime rate with 12,900 cases per year, followed by  Guayas Province with 12,600 cases.    The National Rehabilitation Council reported in Guayaquil EL  UNIVERSO of 23 March that, of Ecuador's total prison population  of 8,856 distributed among 33 penal institutions, 4,878 are in  Guayaquil and Quito. Drug-related crimes constitute 39.3 percent  of all crimes for which people are jailed. Crimes against  property follow at 27.2 percent. H0Y 3 April also reported that  the number of people detained for drug-related crimes increased  8 percent in 1993. However, 70 percent of those arrrested were  only drug possessors or consumers; drug traffickers were a small  percentage of those arrested. Guayas, Pichincha, and El Oro  Provinces have the highest incidences of drug-related crimes.    Human Rights -- Citing the monthly journal PEOPLE'S RIGHTS,  4  April HOY reported that in 1993 human rights violations  increased 65 percent, from 641 reported or detected cases in  1992 to 1,055 in 1993. The same daily also quoted CAAP  statistics charging that the police are responsible for 43.9 of  all human rights abuses. According to CAAP "authorities,  individuals, the military, public functionaries, penal  authorities, private employees, and unknown persons" are  responsible for the rest of human rights abuses.    Unemployment Rate -- The 18 March issue of the Quito daily  EL  COMERCIO reports that Labor Minister Alfredo Corral said that  Ecuador now has one of the highest unemployment rates in Latin  America with 14 percent of its economically active population  without work and a 50 percent underemployment rate. This was  contrasted with 1992 when the unemployment rate was at 8.9  percent. The minister added that unemployment and  underemployment were the country's most "pressing" problems, and  that the Duran-Ballen administration is committed to carrying  out projects that will generate jobs mainly in the "education,  health, transportation, and housing sectors."    The same daily observes that the government's modernization  program, launched in 1993, has "substantially" reduced  employment in the public sector. In 1993, over 26,000 employees  "resigned or terminated their employment with the state." It is  estimated that a similar number will do the same in 1994.    Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers Front (FUT),  commented to EL COMERCIO that the current unemployment figures  put the country on "red alert": 57 percent of unemployed are  between the ages of 15 and 24;    47 percent of unemployed are women;    12 percent are heads of households;    Ponce pointed out that "unemployment is a direct route to  social upheaval," and it is therefore necessary for government  and business to come up with a "responsible, viable, and  humanitarian solution to the problem." He noted that past  government labor reforms have not brought results, stating that  "in 1993, 23,670 workers were dismissed and only 3 percent found  other jobs." He also charged that the Labor Ministry's  employment program is a "mockery of all workers," since in more  than two years it has managed to create only "500 temporary  positions."</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> MINORITIES HOPE TO MAKE GAINS ON SCHOOL BOARD  </P> <P> Tuesday's election for three seats on the Pasadena School Board may produce for  the first time in the city's history a board dominated by minorities.  </P> <P> Nearly 80% of the students in the district are Asian, Latino or black, but  currently, the only minority member of the board is Elbie Hickambottom, who is  black.  </P> <P> The two incumbents in the Pasadena Unified School District race, Anne W. Pursel  and James H. McBath, are both white, but all of the challengers are minorities.  Candidates Frank D. Rocha and George A. Padilla are Latinos, and Dennis D.  Scott, Alicia Woods, Wilbert Smith and Arlene Moncrief are black.  </P> <P> In the race for Seat 1, Padilla has the endorsement of the Unified Teachers of  Pasadena and beat Moncrief in a poll of members of ACT, a local nonpartisan  political action group.  </P> <P> Smith has won the endorsement of the teachers union for Seat 3 and had raised  $15,613 as of the last campaign reporting period -- more than any of his  competitors, McBath, Scott and Woods.  </P> <P> The campaign for Seat 5 has been a quiet race between Pursel and Rocha.  </P> <P> Voters can cast a ballot for each of the three open seats on the five-member  board.  </P> <P> None of the candidates have raised race as an issue and each has campaigned  solely on their experience in business or public life.  </P> <P> But most candidates say the prospect of greater minority representation on the  board is a welcome sign of change in the district.  </P> <P> "I think it would be fantastic if the board had more minority representation,"  Padilla said. "It's the way it ought to be."  </P> <P> "I think it's great," Moncrief said. "You want people who are most  representative of the entire community."  </P> <P> The campaign for Seat 1 brings together two old competitors. Padilla and  Moncrief faced each other in the 1987 election, although both lost to current  board member Roberta Moon.  </P> <P> Moncrief, an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, has called for a return  to basics, with more emphasis on math, language and science skills. She also is  a strong supporter of multicultural education, saying that students should know  more about other cultures, especially incidents such as the Holocaust, slavery  and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.  </P> <P> She also supports improving benefits for teachers to remedy low morale that she  said has become a districtwide epidemic.  </P> <P> Padilla is a civil engineer who runs his own consulting firm in Pasadena and is  vice chairman of the city's Human Relations Commission.  </P> <P> He said his top priority is increasing teacher and parent participation in  board decisions. "I call it shared decision-making," he said. "There is a  feeling that the administration has not been as open and approachable as it  should be."  </P> <P> In the race for Seat 3, McBath, a professor of communications at USC, is  running for his second four-year term against a field of three other  candidates.  </P> <P> He said he believes the board has done an admirable job in increasing  educational standards at all schools and increasing teacher salaries, which  were among the lowest in the county four years ago.  </P> <P> McBath said if elected to another term, he would like to see the creation of  special middle and high schools that would emphasize specific fields, such as  math, literature or the performing arts.  </P> <P> Scott, a personnel administrator for the Veterans Administration, said his main  concerns are improving vocational education and increasing school safety. He  has advocated placing security guards at every school, including elementary  schools, to stop gang and drug activity.  </P> <P> Smith, a director of national accounts for Bank of America, is a reserve deputy  sheriff in Altadena, has a master's degree in special education and was  chairman of the steering committee for the district's kindergarten program for  4 year olds.  </P> <P> Smith said he supports the creation of special schools within schools to  enhance the teaching of math, performing arts, science and vocational skills.  He also called for the creation of a full-time training facility to keep  teachers abreast of new teaching and counseling methods.  </P> <P> Woods is a self-described dark horse in the race and has raised no money for  her campaign. She is the credit manager for Broadcast Equipment Rental Co. in  Burbank and sees her run for the board as a way of spreading her message about  controlling violence in the schools and restoring vocational education.  </P> <P> Woods has proposed making parents responsible for the actions of their  children. If their children participate in vandalism or violence, parents would  be warned several times and then fined by the district.  </P> <P> In the race for Seat 5, Pursel, a longtime community volunteer, has won the  backing of the both the teachers' union and ACT.  </P> <P> Pursel said the board has done a good job of raising teacher salaries and  graduation requirements. She said she supports reducing class sizes, increasing  parent involvement and opening a new middle school during the next four years.  </P> <P> Her only competitor, Rocha, is making his first run for elected office and has  raised no money.  </P> <P> Rocha, a local real estate broker and frequent critic of city government, said  he supports reducing class sizes throughout the district. He said he believes  his experience as a local businessman would also help the district.  </P></p>

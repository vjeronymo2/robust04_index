			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a dramatic development late last night, with only  minutes to go before the deadline for election registration was  due to expire, Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader  Constand Viljoen made his appearance and signed up  provisionally. The development came only hours after the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] also announced its decision to  register.    Gen. Viljoen, a former South African Defense Force chief,  insisted, however, that his party's decision had still to be  confirmed by the front's controlling Volksraad [National  Assembly] today. A total of 29 parties have registered for the  election.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Caro Kriel] Gen. Constand  Viljoen made his surprise entrance at 15 minutes before  midnight. He said the registration was provisional, because the  Volksfront did not have enough time to discuss the IFP's  decision to contest the elections provisionally.    [Viljoen] No, I didn't come to register tonight, because the  decision from the IFP, a member of our alliance, came this  evening, and then our controlling bodies will only be meeting  tomorrow, and because of the deadline, and because of the fact  that the [Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, Chairman] Judge  [Kriegler] has said to us that this is the real deadline, we  decided to come and discuss with the officials here tonight  whether, if we hand in all our papers and refer the case to the  controlling body tomorrow, then we can by phone confirm that it  is OK, they can carry on.    [Kriel] But IEC officials confirmed the registration and  said  the party had paid the 70,000 rands deposit. The party,  registered under the name Freedom Front, has until 12 noon today  to change its name.    Earlier the IFP delegation, headed by the party's national  chairman, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, arrived to register. This was  provisional, pending negotiations on international mediation  concerning key constitutional issues. Dr. Mdlalose also denied  any split in the Freedom Alliance.    [Mdlalose] People have wanted to see a split ever so often.  There's no split. We are different parties, and we formed the  Freedom Alliance as a negotiating alliance.    [Kriel] As midnight drew closer, other parties also  registered, among them the African Moslem Party, the African  Moderates Congress, and the Federal Party.    [Federal Party spokesperson Frances Kendall] It's the poor  people, the ordinary people, that get sidelined all the time.  Nobody in the end ever reaches their needs.    [Kriel] And a maverick party, calling themselves the Soccer  Party.    [First unidentified Soccer Party member] We've only just  finished a game, and, you know, sport comes first. We were  playing with the other guys in our neighborhood.    [Second unidentified Soccer Party member] We believe we are  the only fit party, actually, to represent the voters. We're  the only guys fit to govern. Yes, the sporting party. [end  recording]</p>

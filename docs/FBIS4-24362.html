			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Woman ambassadors and  wives of diplomatic envoys of various countries gathered here  today to discuss such topics as family, women and children, as a  way to mark the "International Year of the Family".    Zhou Hanqiong, wife of Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen , said at the meeting that there are over  200 million families in China. The Chinese Government has  always attached great importance to the role of the family, as  it is the basic cell of society.    She said that a happy and harmonious family constitutes an  important part of Chinese culture. It has also many social  functions to perform.    If every family enjoys harmony and progress, Zhou said, it  will contribute significantly to social stability, cultural and  ethical advancement, reform and development and higher  population quality.    She said: "While enjoying the warmth, care and security of  the family, we cannot forget that there are still places in the  world where families are suffering from chaos of war, where  numerous mothers and children have lost homes, having neither  warmth nor security. We deeply sympathize with their plight.    "We hope to see an early end to these wars so that the  mothers and their children will regain their family warmth and  well-being in a peaceful environment," she said.    Farid Rahman, representative of the office of the United  Nations Children's Fund in China, spoke on children's education.    He said that on the occasion of the International Year of  the  Family, it is of great importance to stress again the role that  families play in children's subsistence and development.    Rahman noted the astonishing progress that China has made  over the past 44 years in this regard, adding that there was  still much to be done. The United Nations Children's Fund is  willing to help China solve these problems in cooperating with  it.    Prof Yan Renying, Chinese expert on women's health and  children, and Mrs. Lombo, wife of the ambassador of Zaire, Lombo  Lo Mangamanga, spoke respectively on "maternity and child care"  and "family and children's education".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 29 (XINHUA) --  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today expressed concern at  the "persistence of the deadlock in the efforts to restore  democracy in Haiti" as well as the human rights situation in the  country.    Having reviewed the situation with his special  representative  for Haiti, Dante Caputo, the U.N. chief reiterated that "it is  essential that the restoration of democracy be the result of an  agreement by the Haitian parties," a U.N. spokesman said today.    A draft Security Council resolution on Haiti, worked out by  the United States and being circulated among diplomats here,  gives Haitian military authorities 15 days to resign or leave  the country. Otherwise, they will face much tougher sanctions.    According to the Governor's Island treaty signed between  exile Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haitian Army  chief Raoul Cedras last July, the president should have returned  to his country by the end of the following October.    But Aristide cannot do so because the military authorities  failed to observe the accord they themselves signed.    The secretary-general has asked Caputo to "continue to  analyze the situation closely and to report back to him soon,"  and will report to the General Assembly this week, the spokesman  said.</p>

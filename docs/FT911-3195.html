			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Beer sales ride the recession ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest US brewer, has weathered both the recession and a rise in federal excise tax to post a 10.1 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 200.9m after tax. During the three months to the end of March, Anheuser's sales rose by 6.2 per cent to Dollars 2.92bn. Earnings per share were up to 70 cents from 64 cents. The St Louis-based group sold 20.4m barrels of beer to wholesalers, up by 1.4 per cent on the 20.1m sold in the same period a year earlier. However, it said sales from wholesalers to retailers were lower in the first quarter, because of the build-up in stocks which occurred at the end of 1990. From the start of 1991, the increase in federal excise tax took effect, causing the price of beer to increase by about 10 per cent, according to Anheuser. The beer giant said it reckoned that about 1.2m barrels of industry sales were switched from the first quarter of 1991 to the last quarter of 1990 as a result. 'Industry sales for the first quarter are expected to be down by approximately 5 per cent,' said Anheuser, although it claimed that its market share had improved by about 1 to 2 per cent. Elsewhere, the Campbell Taggart food subsidiary - whose products range from bread to frozen dinners - saw first-quarter profits increase, thanks to the contribution from international operations, higher volumes and improved margins. Results at the can manufacturing interests also improved, but Anheuser said theme parks nationwide had been affected by the decline in tourist travel and warned that the weak economy might continue to hit these interests in 1991.</p>

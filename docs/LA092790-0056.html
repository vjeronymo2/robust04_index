			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW OFFERS AID TO HOME BUYERS  </P> <P> First-time home buyers in Gardena who earn as much as $70,000 annually will be  eligible to receive loans from the city under a bill signed Tuesday by Gov.  George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The bill, introduced by state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), allows the city  to raise money by issuing revenue bonds that will be loaned to first-time home  buyers to assist them with down payments.  </P> <P> Gardena officials say the new program will permit them to help middle-class  residents who would otherwise have to hunt for houses in less-expensive  communities.  </P> <P> Details of the new program have not been worked out, Gardena City Manager Ken  Landau said Wednesday. But he said the city expects the loans to be available  immediately after the Dills legislation takes effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Those interested in receiving information on the program should call Landau's  office at 217-9503.  </P></p>

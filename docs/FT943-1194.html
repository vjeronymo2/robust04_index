			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / North Korea digs in heels over N-talks: Pyongyang raises new demands and protests at US military 'provocations' US negotiators admitted at the weekend that talks with North Korea on its nuclear facilities were making little headway, as Pyongyang repeated that it would not accept international inspection of two suspect nuclear sites and warned that US military exercises were 'provocations'. The atmosphere at the talks has been further clouded by remarks by the US Pacific Fleet Commander, Admiral Ronald Zlatoper, that US naval manoeuvres off the Korean coast sent 'a very strong message' to North Korea comparable with the pressure on Haiti's military leaders to step aside. In a predictably angry reaction, North Korea's foreign ministry said the US naval presence amounted to 'undisguised military provocations' that could wreck the Geneva negotiations and end the freeze of the country's nuclear power programme. Nevertheless, despite the bluster, the two sides met twice over the weekend at working level and were due to meet again last night or today. The current negotiating session, which began on Friday, is expected to last about a week. The US team had hoped this time to reach a final settlement of the dispute with North Korea, based on the preliminary accord reached on August 12. But Pyongyang has since raised new demands and seemingly gone back on aspects of the earlier agreement. The two sides agreed in August that, as part of a final settlement, Pyongyang would freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA). In return, it would be given two light-water atomic reactors, help with its interim energy needs and the coveted diplomatic links with Washington. However, Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's chief negotiator at the Geneva talks, reaffirmed that Pyongyang would not accept special inspections of two undeclared sites where the IAEA believes diverted plutonium may be stored. North Korea is also demanding 'several billion' dollars in compensation for giving up its graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme. This is in addition to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) estimated cost of providing the more 'proliferation-proof' light-water reactors, which produce less weapons-grade plutonium. In addition, Pyongyang is refusing to accept South Korean nuclear technology, saying it wants German or Russian reactors. The US, which is trying to put together a multinational consortium to meet North Korea's energy needs, including South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, says this demand is not practical. There is also the vexed question of the 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea says it is willing to encase them in concrete but the US wants the fuel rods shipped to a third country such as China.</p>

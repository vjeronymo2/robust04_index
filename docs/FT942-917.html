			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise's paper tiger Decision time is approaching for Lasmo shareholders. By Friday they must either back the oil explorer's continued independence or accept Enterprise's Pounds 1.6bn all-paper bid. Though the two-month battle has seen a welter of accusations, several issues stand out. Most important, Enterprise has failed to demonstrate any added value from putting the companies together. Comments by Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, that it was necessary to be one of the 'big boys' smack of empire building. And although it would have been easy to criticise Lasmo's management or financial strength last year, such arguments carry less weight following management changes and the recent rights issue. It might still be argued that Lasmo shareholders are being offered such a generous deal that they should accept Enterprise's paper regardless of any industrial logic. The snag is that the offer, which would give Lasmo shareholders 44.5 per cent of the combined entity, looks fair but not generous. As the bid has progressed, perceptions of the relative values of the two companies have shifted in Lasmo's favour. Investors have become aware of how Enterprise's reported profits have been inflated by writing down sharply the value of assets it acquired during the 1980s. A further problem is that, if the merger went ahead, the market could be flooded by reams of Enterprise paper that nobody particularly wants. So Lasmo shareholders who accept the bid with the aim of selling Enterprise shares in the aftermarket could receive a poor deal. Given the lack of industrial logic or sufficiently attractive terms, investors should reject the offer.</p>

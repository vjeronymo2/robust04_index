			<p>BFN     [Text] (Beira) We have received the following report and  opinion from a UN source in Sofala Province:    Every day here in Beira, we receive refugees or people  seeking refugee status. They come from countries such as Zaire,  Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia, and  Zimbabwe. No Malawians have been asking for refugee status.  Those people come from countries beset by internal conflicts  where per capita income is very low. Some of those conflicts  have been followed by the United Nations, which is supervising  the Mozambican peace process now.    Whoever is familiar with international politics will not  have  any illusions concerning the role of the United Nations. They  will know that, contrary to what many people think, it is not  the United Nations that rules the roost but, rather, the parties  that are behind those conflicts. Even now, they are the ones  that dictate to the international community the slow pace of  pacification.    The government stopped demobilizing its troops two weeks ago  and demobilization was postponed in all assembly areas. The  reason given was that the Mozambique National Resistance's  demobilization process was going very slowly.    Be that as it may, the Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM,  soldiers  in Nhangao assembly area did not like that and started  threatening the UN observers, even though the latter had nothing  to do with national decisions made by the Supervision and  Control Commission, CSC.    A solution to this problem was sought with Lieutenant  Colonel  Tembo, Cease-Fire Commission representative in the Central  Region. A total of 500 soldiers -- double the usual number of  soldiers to be demobilized at any given time -- started applying  pressure and received the promise that they would be demobilized  on 3 May.    Yesterday, 2 May, was a holiday. All officials involved in  the process, including the observers, financial personnel,  Technical Unit [not further identified] and International  Migration Organization, OIM, officials were preparing for today  but at midday were told that the demobilization had not been  authorized. As I write this, we are looking for Lt. Col. Tembi,  so he can inform his troops about that decision, which will  almost certainly be poorly received.    Whoever came from Chimoio on 1 May must have witnessed the  departure of trucks carrying UN Italian forces for the last time.    Many will blame the United Nations, if war resumes in  Mozambique.    However, peace cannot be imposed, neither by the United  Nations nor by other nations. It is necessary that those who  made war genuinely want peace.    Everyone should understand that.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / NZ inflation at 31-year low New Zealand's inflation rate tumbled to one per cent last year, its lowest level for 31 years, the Department of Statistics said yesterday, Reuter reports from Wellington. The department said the Consumer Price Index fell 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, the first quarterly fall since 1961. Prime minister Jim Bolger welcomed the fall in prices as 'tremendous news', but financial markets were doubtful, believing the inflation data showed the country was sinking deeper into recession.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / The Long View: Inflation puts up a fight WILL THE real inflation rate please stand up (or preferably, fall down)? Is it the government's headline figure of 4 per cent for March, or should we believe some other figure? The year-on-year factory gate inflation rate for manufactured goods was 4.5 per cent last month, for example. Excluding housing, inflation is still 7.3 per cent. Certainly the Germans tend to protest at British political claims that retail price inflation in the UK has now fallen below the German rate of 4.7 per cent. German calculations are distorted upwards by factors like tax increases, while British figures are being massaged downwards by cuts in mortgage rates and manipulation of poll taxes. The technicalities of this are tedious, but there are signs that British inflation is proving resistant to the recession. Annual rises in average earnings have never fallen below 7 per cent on an underlying basis for more than 20 years: the average British worker expects a decent pay increase every year, come hell or low inflation. On the February calculation released this week the 7 per cent barrier has still not been breached. Of course, the continuing gap between pay inflation and price inflation may help explain why the government was voted back into power. In the circumstances the British economy has become divided into two. That part exposed to external realities - especially the manufacturing sector - has had to bring down its inflation rate, although it has been helped by stable commodity price inputs. But the domestic economy has gone on its own sweet way. The past year's inflation in most household and personal services has been 7 or 8 per cent. Now, however, the government has a rare opportunity to address this problem head on. In the past I have expressed doubts about whether the British electorate would really vote for anti-inflationary policies, but after the re-election of John Major I have to eat my words. The gilt-edged market celebrated by pushing the yields on fixed income government securities sharply lower. Significantly, the index-linked issues noticeably missed out on the euphoria. So the buyers were not anticipating any fall in real interest rates, but were cutting expectations of inflation, now down to an implied 4.5 per cent. Can sterling now be turned into a hard currency? There are now no fears of hung parliaments, temporary governments or soft-hearted socialist regimes. Sterling has zoomed by about 8 pfennigs against the DM over the past week or so; pretty soon it could even be looking the DM straight between the eyes at 2.95 to the Pounds . Sentiment can alter in strange ways; chaos in Eastern Europe this summer could undermine the DM. International investors tend to place a premium on political stability, especially of the right of centre variety. Around the world just now there is not a great deal of this to be had. The Americans are taking significant financial risks in the interests of the re-election of George Bush. The Japanese one-party state has not turned out entirely to represent political stability, let alone financial equilibrium. France is still run by socialists, albeit of the market-friendly variety, and faces its own elections within a year or so. One snag is the British trade gap. Hard currencies do not usually rub shoulders easily with balance of payments deficits. But this need not be a great problem so long as foreigners are keen to buy British government bonds. Indeed, it follows that if the government is financing its swelling budget deficit in large part by selling bonds overseas then there must be a current account deficit to match the capital inflow across the exchanges. If at some stage in the future British financial institutions wake up to the appeal of sterling bonds and displace the foreigners from the gilts auctions, ironically sterling then could start to slide. But the devaluationists lurking in the wings will argue that the British economy needs a hard currency like a hole in the head, and they have a point. What it needs is sharply lower interest rates. The virtuous circle is that a strong economy leads to a firm currency and to lower interest rates. This is how it used to be in Germany. The UK is coming from the other direction: somebody else's high interest rates (Germany's) are generating firmness in the currency which is leading to a weak economy. The current economic strategy is pointing to an employment crisis, as the jobless total heads towards 3m, and to a financial crisis, as interest accrues at real rates of 7 per cent or more on vast corporate and personal debts. Chancellor Norman Lamont has been much abused for his suggestion last year that this economic distress is a price well worth paying to beat inflation. But 42 per cent of the electorate may have, in a manner of speaking, agreed within him. At any rate Major and Lamont now have the opportunity to seek a non-inflationary way out of Britain's economic mess without worrying too much about short-term unpopularity. How? Well, there has to be something close to a pay freeze over the next couple of years. In the public sector this might be arranged through deft handling of a public spending crisis with an appropriate package of cuts. In the private sector a high exchange rate will help maintain pressure, although the stock market should be aware that profits will be squeezed as well as wages. As for the debt overhang, the repayment priority is bound to keep the economy under restraint for several years. There is a big cash flow into the investment institutions of up to Pounds 50bn a year which could help in the refinancing, but government guarantees might be required. More about this anon. Meanwhile, I have no official figures for chocolate Easter egg inflation, but on the basis of limited private sampling it is a lot more than 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Investors move into Vietnam An enduring memory for many first-time visitors to Vietnam is the sight of apparently destitute street vendors and barrow boys squatting on the pavement, reading books, magazines and serious newspapers. Vietnam is poor, but nearly 90 per cent of its 70m inhabitants are literate. The economy, furthermore, has started to expand rapidly since the communist government embarked on a series of economic and financial reforms in the late 1980s. This combination of literacy and economic growth has encouraged a growing number of foreign companies to seek investments in the potentially lucrative Vietnamese print media. At the end of May, Australian Consolidated Press, in which businessman Kerry Packer and his family have a large holding, bought 46 per cent of the company that manages and edits the Vietnam Investment Review, a periodical published in English and Vietnamese editions; ACP did not disclose the price, but the stake is believed to have cost more than Dollars 2m. In June, Sondhi Limthongkul, the Thai publisher whose Manager group owns newspapers in Thailand and the Hong Kong-based magazine Asia Inc, signed an agreement to upgrade the state-owned English-language daily Vietnam News. But for the time being the biggest foreign player in the Vietnamese media is Ringier, the Swiss publishing group which was able to build on its experience of launching business publications in post-communist eastern Europe. Ringier runs four titles in Vietnam, including the weekly Vietnam Economic Times with a circulation of 37,000 and New Fashion, which sells 35,000; both are in Vietnamese. The company also launched a monthly English-language version of the Vietnam Economic Times earlier this year. 'The lesson we learned is that if you go very early into an emerging market and build up a position very rapidly, then you're well set for the future,' says Alain Jeannet, Ringier's project manager for Asia. The company has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Vietnam in the past 18 months, but expects its two main publications to pass break-even point later this year. The foreign partners in Vietnamese newspapers and magazines all speak of their plans to upgrade the publications they manage. They can certainly increase advertising revenue and improve production, distribution and presentation, but their influence over editorial content is severely restricted - especially when it comes to politically sensitive news. Only state-approved organisations can own press titles in Vietnam, and foreigners merely sign 'co-operation contracts' giving them a right to a share of the profits. The Vietnam Investment Review, for example, is managed by Australians but published by the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, while the Vietnam Economic Times titles run by Ringier come under the auspices of the Association of Vietnamese Economists. Control of news by the government is unlikely to be relaxed soon, and companies like Ringier are concentrating on areas such as business information and fashion where they believe they can make money without getting into trouble. New Fashion's circulation could be boosted to 100,000, says Jeannet.</p>

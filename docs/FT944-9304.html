			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Hogging it Douglas Hogg has at least two reasons to celebrate his wife Sarah's stepping down as head of prime minister John Major's policy unit. Douglas, a minister of state at the foreign office, will be delighted that Sarah will now occasionally come home; her Downing Street work frequently occupied as many as 16 hours a day. And maybe his own career will get a boost. Hogg never had a chance of a seat at the cabinet table while Sarah was in Number 10: too nepotistic. But if the attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, gets chopped as a result of the Scott report on the arms-to-Iraq affair, Douglas must be in with a chance. Along with Sarah goes Jonathan Hill, Major's political secretary. But the shadow of Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's image-maker and chairman of PR firm Lowe Bell, still looms. Hill was previously a Lowe Bell employee; he is returning there as a consultant. Hill's post is being taken by Howell James - one of Bell's closest friends. And when he was at Capital Radio, James employed Bell's wife, Virginia. Nice to see Major sticking by family values.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A senior official of  President Yeltsin's administration has stressed the important  role of ex-prime minister of Japan Morihiro Hokosawa in the  development of relations between the two countries. He  expressed hope that the new Japanese government, headed by  Tsutomu Hata who was elected prime minister today, would pursue  the same policy in this sphere.    "I think Hosokawa has done very much for the development of  Russian-Japanese relations," head of a department of the press  service of the Russian president and specialist in Japanese  studies Aleksandr Orfenov told ITAR-TASS today. In his opinion,  Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October is proof to it. Important  documents were signed during the visit.    "We hope Hata will continue the political course of the  previous cabinet, aimed at developing relations with the Russian  Federation," the spokesman for the president's press service  said. In his opinion, Hata's statements during his visit to  Moscow last March give grounds for such hope. Judging by those  statements, he is a sober-minded politician.    According to Orfenov, it is regrettable that during Tsutomu  Hata's recent visit to Moscow President Yeltsin was on leave in  Sochi and could not meet him. At that time Tsutomu Hata was  deputy prime minister and head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.  "I think it would be useful for them both to meet and establish  personal contacts," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Peace and the U.S. Role,"  TISHRIN writes: President Hafiz al-Asad has received a message  from U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the peace process  and means of promoting it. He also discussed recent  developments with U.S. envoys Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk and  the two officials reaffirmed the United States' commitment  toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace.    The paper adds: In fact, U.S.-Syrian contacts have continued  ceaselessly since the recent Geneva summit. Washington has  repeatedly voiced its appreciation for Syria's vital role in the  peace process and paid tribute to its sincere efforts.    The paper says: After the Hebron massacre, the world became  convinced that the only way to end tension in the region and  establish peace is to put an end to the Israeli occupation --  Army and settlements, to return the occupied territories to  their rightful owners, and to accept the objective and balanced  Syrian proposals.    The paper notes what President Hafiz al-Asad said -- that  partial solutions do not make peace and that the only possible  peace means the end of occupation and the return of rights.  This is the honorable peace and the peace of the brave.    The paper stresses that the events that have occurred since  the signing of the stumbling Oslo agreement have confirmed that  Syria was right and that the peace of the brave, which it  advocates, agrees entirely with the UN Security Council  resolutions and the substance of the U.S. initiative. They also  show that without this peace, the Middle East will have no  chance of escaping the cycle of violence and turmoil.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: Undoubtedly, the United States  has a principal role to play in bringing about the desired  change in the Israeli position, considering the huge aid it  gives to Tel Aviv and its patronage of the peace process and  commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace.</p>

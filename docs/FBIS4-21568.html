			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Syed Alamdar Raza: "Pakistan's External Security </F> Environment"]    [Text] The meeting of the Defence Coordination of the  Cabinet (DCC) was held on 10th March which, according to  newspaper reports, discussed the latest situation obtaining in  occupied Kashmir, attitude of different countries in respect of  the Kashmir issue, situation of Siachin and other border needs  of the Armed Forces specially the matter of the F-16, Pak  American relations and matters related to the purchase of the  Armed Forces equipment from different countries, The meeting was  held in the context of the reports that the Indian defence  budget had gone up by 20 percent i e from Rs [rupees] 191.8  billion to Rs 230 billion. The ground situation also has vastly  changed and India has now a clear 2 to 1 superiority over  Pakistan.    Their state of weaponry is vastly better than that of  Pakistan because of their huge indigenisation programme  resulting in ready and easy replacements of the old, used up and  outdated weaponry and spares, Pakistan's support even in respect  of the Kashmir issue is not what it should have been i e the two  resolutions presented before the UN General Assembly and the UN  Human Rights Commission on human rights violations, had to be  withdrawn and deferred. Even the purchased and paid for  military equipment in USA has not been made available with the  result that military initiatives has passed on to India. The  relaxation of Sino-Indian relationship has enabled India to  withdraw two more divisions and concentrate against Pakistan.  The security environment has, therefore greatly deteriorated.    Indian writers are now confident that Pakistan is no longer  a  military problem in terms of conventional warfare. Ravi Rikhy in  his book "The war that never was" has the following remark to  make, "Trident (name of a defence exercise) called for an attack  on 8th February 1987 at 0430 hours with Skardu as the first  objective and Gilgit as the second. The operation was expected  to last two weeks, within which time the Northern Areas under  Pakistani occupation since 1947-48 would be recovered. If  Pakistan chose to keep the conflict limited to Northern Areas,  this was fine with India.    But suppose pakistan wanted to retaliate and escalate say by  attacking Punjab, then "Brass Tacks" which was originally  planned as a gigantic strategic deception to focus Pakistan's  attention on Sindh while we went for Northern Areas, would have  been converted into an actual operation with the aim of reaching  Mixpur Khas within three days and Hyderabad City within seven".  India has been keeping such contingency plans ready ever since  and is in a position to launch them as and when it suited her.  Her superiority in numbers and equipment makes it clear that  she is quite capable of launching such operations. India may  have wrong notions about our defence capabilities and her claim  to run over may not be quite as easy as she imagines but what is  quite clear is that India is now clearly in a position to take  initiatives as and when she likes and we have only the option to  react effectively to what India does. This possibility makes us  highly vulnerable.    What has kept India away from launching such adventures is  the fact that according to her, Pakistan has developed the  nuclear capacity. Even here India claims 1 to 10 superiority  over Pakistan but Pakistan's ability to launch nuclear  retaliation according to India is such that she is capable of  destroying New Delhi and Tarapur causing immense destruction and  crippling India to such and extent that she would be effectively  neutralised for years to come. The fact that Pakistan will also  be extensively destroyed, is hardly a matter of any satisfaction  and will hardly provide India any edge over her. What is worse  from India's point of view is that in this respect Pakistan has  the initiatives and can launch a nuclear retaliation at her  will. In fact, it should be a normal expectation that if  operations like Trident or Brass Tacks were launched and  Pakistan was squeezed as Indians hoped she would be, she would  resort to nuclear warfare and being a weaker nation, may be the  first to use it out of insecurity.    This is a very real possibility of which the Indian Magazine  "India Today" dated 15th February 1994, has referred to. There  are three aspects of the nuclear problem which are causing great  worry to India. Firstly, that Pakistan has both, the nuclear  weapons and the delivery system. How many weapons they have is  not to important. They may have six or more but they are  capable of inflicting irreparable damage upon india. Secondly,  that Pakistan has effectively safeguarded her nuclear arsenal.  Kahuta which was vulnerable to Indian attack has been vacated.    The present nuclear storage facility is located at Chagai in  Balochistan and is in a ready state for the pilots to take off  before Indians could attempt to destroy them. Thirdly, Pakistan  is building another 70 megawatt reactor at a secret location  along the Indus.    According to Indians, by 1992 half of the construction and  assembly work had been completed. Indian military experts  believe that the programme when completed could yield bombs that  would counterbalance India's vastly superior conventional force.    The above facts indicate that even if the Indian claims to  their conventional military superiority are to be believed they  fear they have been effectively neutralised by the emergences of  Pakistan's nuclear capability, India has no effective answer to  this new phenomenon. The fact is that whatever Indians may  allege, the programme is peaceful but it poses a threat to India  because they visualise it the same way as their own nuclear  programme which they claim to be peaceful.    The only option open to India is roll back our entire  programme and they are working towards that end. USA is being  cultivated and Indians have apparently made some headway. There  are clear indications that the programme has been frozen and as  such a very effective weapon in the hands of Pakistan is being  blunted due to the intervention of our erstwhile friend USA.  This is being done in addition to a ban being put on the  release of military weapons even where we had paid for them.  This is a very unenviable position which makes us highly  vulnerable and places India in a position to take initiatives  which Pakistan may have no ability to effectively counter. As  far as our friend USA is concerned whose policies are now  weakening our defence capability, we cannot rely on them in  moments of crisis and war. Our own experience leads us to that.    Where do we go from here? This is what DCC is apparently  meeting to consider. How do we meet this challenge? Our  approach should be two fold. Firstly we should tell our friends  that our security has to be ensured. This would be in American  interest also as we have always been their most allied ally.  Verbal or even written undertakings as to our security will not  be enough because they have not helped us in the past. What we  need is that out defence capability be-built up to a point where  we are able to defend ourselves effectively against India.  Secondly, we have to realise that our real assets are those  people who have helped attain the present nuclear capability.  They have to be looked after and duly safeguarded. They  should not be allowed to be neutralised. Their abilities should  be utilised on research and on further development of nuclear  potential for peace, So long as these people are there we  cannot be betrayed even if our political leadership sucumbs to  pressures, our nuclear experts are quite capable of giving what  we need during the war and in moments of crisis. So let them  work on peaceful nuclear projects. There is no reason why we  should not follow Indian example in this respect who continue to  claim that their programme is strictly peaceful and as innocent  and non-violent as Buddha. Let us also continue with our  peaceful and non-violent nuclear programme.    Our electricity requirements alone justify such continuation  and in fact, further advancement of our nuclear programme. We  should, however, make one thing clear to the rest of the world i  e that our nuclear programme is far more peaceful and  non-violent than the Indian programme.</p>

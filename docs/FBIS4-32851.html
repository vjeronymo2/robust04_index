			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>   [Text] Panama's President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares  has told the media that Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Rosello  promised him that his government will install soon in Panama a  liaison office with the purpose to attract private investment to  the isthmus.    Perez reported this at Marco A. Gelabert Airport on his  return from the Antilliean island where he spent five days as  guest of Governor Rosello, who was a schoolmate of his at a U.S.  university.    During his stay in Puerto Rico, Perez also met with  commercial and industrial groups of the island and spoke with  them about the advantages Panama offers to foreign investors.    Perez said: "I hope we can dedicate that office soon and  that  it produces the effect we all expect."    The president elect also said that he spoke with Puerto  Rican  investors about the returned areas and the military  installations that the U.S. southern Command will deliver to  Panama in a few months.    In Perez Balladares' opinion, these installations can be  used  as complementary facilities and be turned into a door for the  entrance and establishment of South American commerce in Panama.    Perez noted: "I think that we must reproduce the effort we  are making in Puerto Rico in other countries of the world to  establish in Panama marketing, export, and reexport centers that  use the returned areas to create jobs we need, and at the same  time take advantage of our geographic position."    Consulted about the reforms proposed by President Bill  Clinton to restructure the Panama Canal Commission and about  reforming the bank secrecy statutes to strengthen the antidrug  struggle, Perez said he prefers to wait until his foreign  minister-to-be gives him a well-founded report.    Perez said: "I would welcome, from any country, any joint  effort initiative that, without hurting our interests, serves to  check drug-trafficking and money-laundering." He noted that this  is what his government will aim for and this is what President  Clinton has referred to.    Regarding the Canal reforms, he said that Law 96-70 (the  Murphy Law) requires modifications to permit the implementation  of the final phase of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, "and I  suppose that this is to what the reforms sent by President  Clinton to the Senate refer."    Finally, Perez Balladares rejected speculation about Panama  moving toward the category of a Free Associated State, like  Puerto Rico, noting that Panamanians have chosen to remain as a  free, independent, and sovereign republic, while Puerto Ricans  decided to maintain their status. In this regard he said that he  respects the idiosyncracy and autonomy of all nations.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Private companies show more confidence Business confidence among medium-sized private companies is rising steadily, according to a survey conducted by 3i, the venture capital group, Vanessa Houlder writes. The 3i Enterprise Barometer, which is based on 1,000 companies in the 3i portfolio, has risen over each of the past four quarters to stand at its highest level since the survey started in January 1988. The balance of respondents believing that the business and political climate is more favourable to starting a new business than it was a year ago has increased to 52 percentage points. This was a sharp rise on the 35 points recorded four months ago and is the highest balance since the survey started in 1988. The increased confidence is shared by companies operating throughout the country, although those in the south are more positive. The businesses are increasing their plans for investment, with 36 per cent expecting an increase and only 15 per cent planning a cut.</p>

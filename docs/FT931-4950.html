			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A clearer view of the EC  -Charles Batchelor begins a monthly series answering questions raised by the single market THE formal launch of the European single market on 1 January 1993 signalled the most ambitious step towards European integration since the drawing up of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. In many areas, however, the creation of the single market was more apparent than real, since legislation prompted by the Single European Act of 1987 has been coming on stream for some time. The most notable changeover on 1 January was the switch to a new system of accounting for VAT and for collecting trade statistics. In the run-up to the creation of the single market companies were deluged with advice from the government, consultants, accountants and advice agencies on what action to take. Since 1 January the clamour has been stilled but businesses are still coming to terms with the changes. There are many sources of information open to businesses on the single market both public and private but the FT believes that by highlighting some of the issues which arise it will be providing a service to readers. We may also be able to pinpoint areas where either the original EC directive or subsequent national legislation has led to difficulties. We therefore invite readers to write or fax any queries relating to doing business in Europe or resulting from the creation of the single market. The FT is happy to acknowledge the assistance of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry's European Information Centre in compiling this feature. Write to Charles Batchelor, Single Market Q&amp;A, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL or Fax 071 873 3933. Public contracts Q: How can I find out about public contracts open for tender in other members states? Can I bid for them? A: Yes, any company based in the Community may bid for contracts advertised in the Supplement to the Official Journal. EC legislation governing public procurement requires public purchasers in the member states to submit details of contracts for supplies, works, utilities and services to the Commission for inclusion in the supplement. This journal is known as the 'S series' and is published daily. It is available on subscription from Her Majesty's Stationery Office. You can consult all Official Journals at your local European Information Centre. In addition, Tenders Electronic Daily, the on-line version of the supplement, offers accurate and up-to-date information on contracts. A number of organisations, including the European Information Centres, operate a monitoring service whereby companies are notified of relevant contracts. Contracting authorities have a choice of three types of procedures. Open procedure - any interested contractor may submit a tender. This is the procedure which is most commonly followed. Restricted procedure - only those contractors who have been through a pre-qualification process are eligible and may be invited to tender. Negotiated procedure - allows contracting authorities to consult contractors of their choice and negotiate the terms of the contract with one or more of them. Public purchasers must advertise contracts above set minimum values. These are Ecu200,000 (Pounds 165,000) for supplies and services, Ecu5m for public works, Ecu600,000 for services in telecommunications and Ecu400,000 for services in the water, energy and transport sectors. What the rules mean Q: I am familiar with the term 'EC Directive' but recently came across an 'EC regulation'. Can you tell me what the difference is? A: There are five kinds of EC rule-making procedure. They are: Regulations. These are directly enforceable laws applicable and binding in the member states. In other words, no local laws need be passed for them to be effective. Directives. These are also legally binding but require further action by member states. They lay down the intended results of legislation leaving it to the individual member states as to how these aims are to be achieved and the target date for implementation. Decisions. These apply to member states but may apply to an individual or a company (or any legal entity) and are legally binding. They are primarily used to enforce competition policy decisions. Recommendations and opinions. These are not legally binding but they do have considerable political influence. Notices. These are not really legislation, nor are they legally binding but are generally intended to provide guidance. They are usually used to assist companies in the field of competition. Importing toys Q: We import toys and sell them in the Community. What are the standards that apply and are there any plans to tighten them further? In addition, how do we prove we have attained the standard and carried out the necessary testing? A: The EC has ruled all toys should bear the CE (Communite Europeenne) mark at the point of entry into the EC. It is recognised, however, that many importers apply the CE mark after importation and, as far as we are aware, this is accepted by many port authorities. There is no specific procedure for testing products nor does any authority formally award the CE mark. The mark is a declaration that the toy complies with the requirements of the EC legislation. It is the responsibility of the importer or manufacturer to ensure this declaration is accurate. In the UK the toys may be subject to checks by trading standards officers and, or customs. To ensure the toys comply with EC rules, the importer/manufacturer may decide to have the product independently tested in an accredited laboratory within the EC - a list of EC-approved bodies is contained in the Official Journal C264, 1992. Samples are submitted for testing to the harmonised standard and any other relevant standard. In the case of EC-type examinations, full manufacturing and design details should also be submitted. Toys which legitimately carry a CE mark may be circulated legally throughout the Community. All member states have implemented the Toy Safety directive. Selling by mail order Q: I understand there are new VAT requirements for small companies involved in distance selling. I sell by mail order and wonder how this will affect me? A: From the beginning of 1993 the rules changed. If you sell to customers in other EC countries who are not VAT registered, you are responsible for the payment of VAT in this country. This ruling applies until the value of distance sales (which includes mail order) to another EC country exceeds a specific threshold. Member states have stipulated the following thresholds will apply to each individual country and will be set in the currency of each country: Ecu35,000 Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Ecu100,000 France, Germany, Netherlands and the UK. When your sales surpass the threshold of any country, VAT becomes payable in that country on any further sales and you are required to register for VAT there. If you do not already have representation in the other member state, you must appoint a tax representative who will be responsible for accounting for VAT to the authorities on your behalf. This will usually be an accountant. Food packaging Q: We are a UK-based company selling Danish foodstuffs. Is there any European Community legislation governing the language employed on food packaging? Would it be enough, for example, to place a notice in English over the display cabinet describing the product and its contents? A: The EC rules require food retailers to display information about their products in a language which can be easily understood by customers. It is unlikely that a general notice in English above the display cabinet would be considered sufficient. Your have three options to meet the directive: you could repackage the goods using English-language packaging; you could apply English-language labels to the original packaging; or you could have folders or pamphlets printed and distributed with the foodstuffs in question. This subject is covered by EC directive 79/112/CEE relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer. The directive indicates the information which must be provided on labels. The language question is covered by article 14.</p>

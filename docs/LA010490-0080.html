			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WAVE OF WEALTH;  </P> <P> IRANIANS NO ORDINARY GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> Ten years ago, amid the chaos of the Iranian Revolution and the rise of  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalist regime, the migration of  upper-class Jews from Iran to the United States began in earnest.  </P> <P> These were no ordinary huddled masses yearning to breathe free. This was one of  the richest waves of immigrants ever to come to the United States.  </P> <P> Their first toehold in their new land was no squalid, crowded "Little Tehran"  but rather the gracious hillsides of Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills and  other nearby neighborhoods of the Westside and the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Khomeini's revolution drove about half of Iran's 80,000 Jews into exile. A few  headed for New York or Israel, but the vast majority of those emigrants,  probably at least 30,000, have settled in or near Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Not all are fabulously wealthy. While some families have bought or built  mansions north of Sunset Boulevard, at least as many are crowded into  rent-controlled apartments on the south side of town.  </P> <P> But whether rich or merely middle-class, they have, like most immigrants before  them, brought change to their adopted home and have themselves been changed by  life in America.  </P> <P> "Before the Iranians came, this city was a sleepy city," said Beverly Hills  real estate broker Stephan Saeed Nourmand, an Iranian who moved to the area in  the early '70s and has been on hand for the wave that followed. "Sure there  were celebrities, but it was still a small town. There was a gas station and a  hardware store on Rodeo Drive."  </P> <P> The Iranians, Nourmand said, brought more than money.  </P> <P> "They brought their talents too. There were doctors, lawyers, businessmen,  retailers, manufacturers -- a variety of people who came and immediately  contributed by boosting Beverly Hills' international image," he said  </P> <P> The stamp of Iranian success is seen in the glitzy Rodeo Collection, trendy  shops and eateries on Rodeo Drive built by Dar Mahboubi, who is also part-owner  of the fashionable Bijan boutiques of Beverly Hills and New York. Adrays, a  chain of discount department stores, is owned by Masud Hakim and two partners.  And Iranian-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building a 22-story Center West  tower in Westwood.  </P> <P> Nowhere is the immigrants' impact more evident than in the Beverly Hills  Unified School District, where nearly one out of every five students is  Iranian. Their language, Farsi, is incorporated in announcements sent home to  parents and taught in after-school classes to the children.  </P> <P> The district has hired a full-time counselor to ease the transition for  students and to sensitize administrators and teachers to Iranian culture. And  thousands of dollars have been contributed by parents to the Beverly Hills  schools through the Iranian Education Foundation.  </P> <P> Despite this, many Iranians still manage to live their lives nearly surrounded  in the culture of their homeland -- going to Iranian nightclubs, worshiping at  Iranian synagogues, shopping for clothing and jewelry at Iranian businesses.  </P> <P> The majority of the Beverly Hills-area Iranians are Jewish, and in many  respects, they form a community of their own. At times, however, they also  function as part of a larger Iranian community that is estimated to number  300,000 in Southern California. For Iranian Muslims, the largest concentrations  are in Palos Verdes and Irvine. Ethnic Armenians from Iran have migrated in  substantial numbers to Glendale, already home to a large Armenian community.  </P> <P> There is an 848-page Iranian Yellow Pages, listing 1,600 Iranian businesses and  professionals in Southern California. There are Iranian magazines and  television and radio shows. Concerts of Persian music, featuring such noted  Iranian singers as Moine, Darioush or Shahram, often perform at Hollywood's  Palace theater before audiences of 1,000 or more.  </P> <P> On most Sunday afternoons, Iranian families gather for picnics on the Palisades  in Santa Monica, where mothers parade their teen-age daughters in front of  prospective sons-in-law.  </P> <P> The influx has transformed a stretch of Westwood Boulevard south of Wilshire  into an Iranian Main Street, where the aromas of shish kebab and rice hang in  the air, where Iranian grocery stores stock hard-to-find Persian foods and  spices and where bookstores offer books and tapes in Farsi -- including some  that recall the "glorious days" under Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi.  </P> <P> Iranians have also contributed to the night life in Westwood and Beverly Hills.  Stores and restaurants stay open longer, catering to Iranian families who tend  to eat and shop later in the evening. And festive Iranian parties go on until  the early hours of the morning -- at times ending at the request of the Beverly  Hills police.  </P> <P> "At restaurants, the locals clear out by 9 p.m., and that's when the Iranians  are coming in," said Irwin Kaplan, the former director of city planning in  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Every Tuesday night, the Omarkhayam Restaurant on Westwood Boulevard becomes a  Who's Who of former celebrities, government officials and other notables from  the days of the Shah as they gather with families and friends for an evening of  dinner and poetry.  </P> <P> UCLA sociologist Ivan Light, who is studying the Iranian immigration under a  grant from the National Science Foundation, said the influx is extraordinary  for its number of "high-status immigrants."  </P> <P> Both the Jewish and Muslim immigrants, according to Light, are drawn largely  from the privileged classes in Iran, tend to be well-educated and include many  doctors, lawyers, bankers and other professionals. But there are also some  differences between the two groups.  </P> <P> Muslims, he said, are somewhat more likely than Jews to have advanced degrees.  Large numbers of Iranian Muslims have gone into real estate development and  construction. The Jews, meanwhile, are more likely to be self-employed with  backgrounds in trade and manufacturing of apparel and jewelry.  </P> <P> Light has also found that all of the Iranian subgroups are more dispersed  within their new communities than is typical with other immigrants.  </P> <P> "With the possible exception of Westwood Boulevard, there is no central  location for Iranians, like a Koreatown or Chinatown," he said. "We suspect  that wealthy immigrants don't need those kinds of support systems."  </P> <P> Jews have lived in what is now Iran for 2,500 years, ever since Cyrus the  Great, the founder of the Persian empire, conquered Babylonia and invited its  freed Jewish slaves to live in Persia.  </P> <P> Traditionally merchants and traders for generations, the Jews found great  prosperity during the regime of the Shah, not just as merchants and  manufacturers but also in government and the professions.  </P> <P> But in spite of a history in Iran that predated Islam by more than 1,000 years,  the Jews were never more than a tiny minority in a country that is about 98%  Muslim. Iranian Jews who have come to California say they always knew the day  might come when they would have to leave.  </P> <P> "Because they were a minority in Iran, they always felt insecure, and many made  sure they invested outside the country," said Baroukh Beroukhim, former  president of Ettefak school, a 2,000-student private Jewish academy in Tehran.  </P> <P> "They even sent their children abroad to go to school as a means of having a  little branch out there somewhere that would become the only hope if things got  bad,' he said.'  </P> <P> Beroukhim, who now lives in Westwood, is active in the Iranian Education  Foundation and the Iranian Jewish Federation Council.  </P> <P> Many Jews who left Iran in the days immediately before and after the Shah's  downfall in early 1979 say it was not overt religious persecution by Islamic  fundamentalists that forced them into exile. Far more threatening, they say,  was the general chaos and the enmity that Khomeini's followers seemed to feel  toward wealth in general.  </P> <P> The memory is still painful for Guity Nemani, who abandoned a successful family  rug business, her home and most of her belongings in the city of Abadan, and  fled the country with her husband and three children in 1978, shortly before  the Shah was overthrown.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["g-n."-attributed report: "Crisis Management Only With the </F> Alliance"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 1 March -- As the conference of NATO  heads of state and heads of governments agreed in January, apart  from performing its ongoing defense task, NATO should be turned  into an instrument for preventative diplomacy and the control of  international conflicts. The Bundeswehr general inspector,  General Naumann, insists that this should not occur at the  expense of the first task, the ability to defend, and in the  case of "conflict management," the alliance should also be able  to act alone, that is, independently of a UN mandate. He warns  against abandoning the usual NATO organizational framework, that  is cooperation under an integrated command structure, in the  event of crisis management, and forming ad hoc coalitions  between individual nations, which would encourage the  reintroduction of national elements into European policy and  reduce alliance cohesion. This would also apply to cooperation  with the Americans. The relationship should not be called into  question by the Europeans, nor should the Europeans do anything  that would encourage the Americans to give in to tendencies to  give up the idea of collective Western foreign and security  policy. "Crisis management" also requires collective action.    The general inspector recently set out his thoughts and  concerns to the German-British Officers Association in Bad  Neuenahar. He warned against pursuing collective crisis  management, which has moved to the forefront of alliance policy  since the Brussels NATO conference, at the expense of collective  security. Both elements must be maintained. His observations  not only clearly referred to tendencies toward an "ad hoc  approach" in France, but also among other allies. "We must  reorganize, but without splitting up the integrated command  structure." He expressly warned against performing assignments  under Article 4 of the NATO Treaty (crisis) using organizational  forms other than the customary and proven ones of the integrated  command structure for the event of Article 5 (the duty to  provide support in defense cases). The failure of Western  policy with regard to the war in the Balkans and in Somalia are  the concrete background for these thoughts. Naumann's  assessment has received the backing of the current NATO  commander of the Northern Group of Forces, Sir Charles Guthrie,  and of two of his predecessors, General Sir Peter Inge and Field  Marshal Sir Nigel Bagnall, as well as the former commander of  the NATO Central Europe Force, General von Sandrart.  <H5>  The Threat Axis Has Shifted South </H5>   The general inspector used the opportunity to discuss new  elements of German security policy. Following 1989, the NATO  "threat axis" has shifted from the east to the "south." This  has imposed considerably more work on the NATO Southern Europe  Command (Naples). However, as before, the European central  region, Germany, France, and the British and U.S. forces on the  continent, remains the region that would be most involved in  crisis management irrespective of where the crisis is. "The  focus of NATO military policy will remain the central region,  even if in future conflicts will tend to be in the south."    The German general inspector and General Guthrie, who are in  agreement on the matter, blamed the failure of the deployment of  Western forces in both the conflicts in the Balkans and Somalia  on ignoring Clausewitz's maxim that a political goal must be set  before forces are deployed. Both generals fear that, in future,  this will also be a problem for collective crisis management,  especially as in the case of crisis management, differences of  opinion stemming from national interests are more likely to come  to the fore than in the event of collective defense against a  direct attack.    Soldiers need clear political goals, said Guthrie,  sufficient  resources to be certain of accomplishing their task, and  instructions to make preparations as soon as possible, meaning  that time was required to improve soldiers' training for special  assignments in foreign environments. However, said Guthrie,  politicians generally find it difficult to set the military a  clear political assignment in good time, because politicians  seek to keep options open for as long as possible and when  action is finally taken, they then say that things can be done  very quickly and simply without much expenditure. "Politicians  seldom give us sufficient reserves for materiel, personnel, and  mobilization. They believe that the job can be done with less."    General Naumann pointed out that since the great changes  that  have occurred in the threat situation since 1989, it is true  that objectively, the "warning time" for performing a defense  role has risen to about a year, but militarily "effective  warning time" only amounted to between three and six months,  because political leaderships hesitate in identifying a  dangerous situation and issuing the appropriate instructions to  the military leadership. This particularly applies to  identifying a "crisis." Today, crises are no longer a short  transition period between peace and war, but a third state that  might last longer and is marked by ambiguous signals and  contradictory threats. That makes decisions on prevention and  action instead of reaction more difficult. The contradictory  nature of "signals" and the ups and downs in a crisis result in  "free reign" being given to the situation, as was the case with  former Yugoslavia.    Naumann showed that crisis management entailing  "peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" -- General Inge pointed out that  the two were very close, the one might apply to one village and  other to the next village, or they might rapidly alternate in  the same place -- cannot be pursued at the expense of defense by  citing a simple example. If the Bundeswehr must make 50,000 men  available for deployment in a crisis, then it could either only  send a small number of the men to another country, because  others would have to remain for training and replacement  purposes, or it would have to mobilize reservists, because  otherwise the Bundeswehr's main task, the ability to provide  collective defense, could not be fulfilled.  <H5>  Without a Mandate From the UN or the CSCE </H5>   A British general pointed out that until now NATO had  permitted individual nations to remove troops from NATO  obligations to special emergency situations temporarily (for  example, U.S. troops during the Vietnam War and British troops  during the Falklands War). That was possible because other  allies could fill the gaps. This is another reason why "crisis  management" cannot be divorced from defense and both have to be  pursued collectively as an alliance.    There is no way in which one could have two sets of troops,  one for defense and the other for "overseas crisis management."  It would also be impossible to form two leadership structures.  It is particularly important to strengthen those elements that  "multiply" the armed forces, for example, resources for  intelligence, leadership, and rapid (air and sea) transportation  of forces. Without the Americans, there would be insufficient  intelligence for the foreseeable future and without the  alliance, there would be no experienced leadership for the  command of the armed forces of several countries. He repeated  once again that ad hoc cooperation was not enough.    General Naumann said that if Germany wants to participate in  solving an international crisis, then essentially one must be  ready to deploy troops and one cannot hide behind supposed  prohibitions based on German history or behind the German  Constitution. It is also just as important that NATO should see  such action as its own affair and not allow itself to be turned  into the recipient of UN or CSCE mandates, because there will be  situations in which neither the UN or the CSCE will be able to  adopt decisions. The Federal Republic would never act alone,  without its allies, in defense or in crisis management.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As we have just learned, the Russian gas company  Gazprom has been forced to gradually reduce gas deliveries to  Belarus beginning 1 April. As a result of the  Belarusian-Russian talks held on 15 March, the volume of gas  deliveries to Belarus was restored to the level of 54 million  cubic meters per day. Since then, however, the Belarusian debt  to Gazprom has risen to 500 billion rubles, and it continues to  increase. The Belarusian Government's attempts to collect money  from Belarusian consumers and pay the debt have so far been  unsuccessful.</p>

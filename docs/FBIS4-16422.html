			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 14) TURAN: Religious Muslims in  Azerbaijan are demanding the resumption of television  broadcasting from Iran.    The broadcasting of the daily Iranian programme was  terminated in early March by Azerbaijan Television (AzTV) due to  "an electrical energy deficit".    The head of the Executive Committee of the Islamic Party of  Azerbaijan, Haji Vagif, condemned this act calling it "a  treachery against the people".    In today's news daily "ISLAM DUNYASI" (Islamic World), Haji  Vagif, accused national television of serving the interests of  Zionism.    The head of the Azeri Broadcasting Company Babek Guseynoglu  told Turan that for now AzTV does not intend to resume its  broadcasting from Tehran.    The last agreement on Iranian transmission broadcasting  programs to Azerbaijan was signed in autumn of last year and a  simultaneous agreement was signed concerning broadcasting from  Baku to Iran. However, this agreement has not been implemented.</p>

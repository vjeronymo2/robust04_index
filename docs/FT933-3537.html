			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Bank deposit plan angers Bonn: European Court may have to rule on 'unfair and unjust' directive GERMANY may appeal to the European Court of Justice after EC finance ministers yesterday voted 11-1 in favour of a new Community-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme. Bonn government officials made no effort to hide their disappointment over adoption of the new scheme, which falls short of Germany's unlimited protection for bank account holders. Mr Christoph Zeitler, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry, said the new bank deposit directive was 'unjust and unfair'. A German diplomat described the scheme as 'anti-competitive'. Under the new directive the EC would require banks to raise protection to 90 per cent on the first Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,320), starting January 1 1995. There is, however, a five-year transition period under which member states can limit the guarantee to Ecu15,000. Germany's objections centre on the difficulties of safeguarding its own generous privately managed compensation scheme if foreign bank subsidiaries which operate in the country elect to join. 'It is a matter of supervision,' said one official. Bonn also argues that its own banks should be able to use their superior investor protection as a competitive weapon when operating elsewhere in the EC. However, the directive expressly applies only to 'topping up' and not lowering protection. The new EC bank directive covers deposits in EC banks which are denominated in EC currencies and Ecus. Member states would be free to oblige third-country banks to join the scheme Agreement on the scheme paves the way for similar arrangements to increase cover for investors in stocks and shares. which would mark a further step towards completing the single European market. Separately, ministers agreed to release the second tranche of an Ecu8bn balance of payments loan to Italy. The budgetary goal set by the Rome government for 1993 was likely to be met, they said. Ministers welcomed Italy's emphasis on spending controls in the 1994 budget but warned that 'there is still a need for additional budgetary efforts to meet the 1994 targets'. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, has emerged as the consensus EC candidate for chairmanship of the IMF interim committee, vacated by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the former Spanish finance minister. But Mr John Dawkins, Australian finance minister, is also said to be in the running.</p>

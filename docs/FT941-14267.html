			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EdF in Slovak joint reactor venture Electricite de France (EdF) has signed a joint venture agreement with Slovensky Energeticky Podnik (SEP), the Slovak electricity company, to complete the construction of two nuclear reactors and manage SEP's unfinished nuclear plant at Mochovce, about 120km east of Bratislava. The total investment for completing the two Soviet-designed pressurised water reactors and bringing safety up to western standards is expected to be about DM1.3bn (Dollars 765m). The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is expected to provide financing for the project. This is EdF's first contract to upgrade a Soviet-designed nuclear reactor. Westinghouse Electric of the US won a contract last year to upgrade the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Under the agreement, EdF will hold 51 per cent and SEP 49 per cent in EMO, a joint venture company established for the project. Germany's Bayernwerk may also take a stake in EMO, an EdF official said. The Mochovce plant has been controversial and construction effectively stopped in late 1989 after the 'velvet revolution' that brought an end to the communist regime in what was then Czechoslovakia. Initially the plant was to have four Soviet-designed VVER 440213 reactors with 440MW capacity each. EDF says the reactors are the most recent Soviet design and 'relatively close' to western standards.</p>

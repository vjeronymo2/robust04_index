			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Architects attack cut-price bids MORE than 60 leading architects have signed a statement criticising public authorities for taking advantage of the recession and accepting cut-price bids from architects. The signatories, including professionals from Richard Rogers Partnership and Sir Norman Foster and Partners, are concerned that choosing architects on the basis of price alone will encourage poor designs and shoddy work. The move comes at a time when a third of Britain's 32,000 registered architects are estimated to be out of work as a result of the recession.</p>

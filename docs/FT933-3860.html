			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Market downturn hits meat exporter: Business reports sluggish Continental sales CONCERN ABOUT Mr David Maunder's meat business disturbs his sleep. After recently investing millions of pounds to bring his abattoir up to EC standards, he now faces over-capacity in the UK market for the lamb he sells and declining export sales as Europe pitches into recession. 'I am faced with it the whole of my waking life and it wakes me up in the night too,' said Mr Maunder, director of Lloyd Maunder, one of the UK's larger exporters of lamb carcasses. Mr Maunder said that after enjoying a boost from the devaluation of sterling last September his export business had seen a downturn since the start of the year. Last year Lloyd Maunder sold about 630,000 tonnes of lamb, with about 60 per cent of that going for export, but export sales are expected to be lower this year. He added: 'Margins have been eroded because of competition in France and Germany, and the Spanish market is not looking as good as last year  - all of these markets are being squeezed by recessionary pressures.' Spain's market for UK lamb represents a niche that some companies such as Mr Maunder's have established over the past eight years. Spanish buyers want lighter lamb carcasses than are sold in the UK from August to January, when domestic supplies are low. But sales to Spain over the past month have been running a third lower than last year as the recession bites. The company is also facing increased competition from newcomers to the export market which are turning to Spain and undercutting prices as competition in the UK intensifies. Competition in the French market, particularly from Irish producers, has cut margins to a level that is making it harder to cover overheads. Mr Maunder said: 'If margins continue to be eroded like this, it will be extremely hard for us to make a profit this year.'</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: HBO and studios in Asian pay-TV venture HBO, the pay-TV subsidiary of Time Warner, has signed a deal with two Japanese-owned Hollywood studios, Sony Pictures and MCA/Universal, for the exclusive pay-TV showing of their films in Asia. The deal sharpens competition between HBO and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, a recent entrant to pay-TV in the region. HBO said it had brought in Sony and MCA (owned by Matsushita) as equity partners in HBO Asia, a joint venture originally formed between Time Warner and Paramount. Financial details were not disclosed, but all four partners will have an equal stake. The deal brings together four studios - Columbia, Warner Bros, Paramount and Universal - which HBO said had between them produced 19 of the 25 top-selling pictures in 1993 and 1994, and accounted for almost 70 per cent of US box office returns, excluding animated features. The deal gives HBO Asia exclusive pay-TV rights to current and future titles, as well as to the partners' film libraries. HBO Asia is available in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Brunei and Papua New Guinea, and will shortly be in Bangladesh. Talks are going on with the Chinese authorities over access to Chinese hotels. Subscribers at the start of this year totalled 300,000, and the figure is claimed to be higher. The films will all be shown in English, with subtitles in Chinese, Thai and Indonesian. This contrasts with Star TV, which shows Chinese-language films as well as Hollywood productions.</p>

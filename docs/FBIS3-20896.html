Research Minister Paul Krueger said before today's  Bundestag research debate that the Federal Government would  therefore "not relax its considerable commitment to R&amp;D  funding  in industry in the new laender."    Krueger nevertheless rejected the claim by the Halle  Economic  Research Institute (IWH) that the R&amp;D work force had been cut  from 86,000 to 10,000 between 1989 and the end of 1993 and that  another 3,000 jobs were expected to be lost: His ministry could  not agree with these figures. The terms of the comparison with  an estimated 86,000 employees in the former GDR were not proper,  as the figure of 10,000 referred solely to industry in the  strict sense, whereas that of 86,000 took in the whole of the  economy.    Krueger did not expect further heavy cuts in R&amp;D jobs:  "On  the contrary, the funding programs are showing results, and the  R&amp;D work force in industry in the new laender is receiving  increasing support -- over 50 percent -- from state funding  measures. The Federal Government realized early on that  maintaining and expanding a productive industrial research  capability would require an exceptional commitment on the part  of the state." The range of funding measures had thus been  extended back at the beginning of 1992 and considerably more  funds provided for industrial R&amp;D in the new laender.    Krueger considered even greater efforts on the part of  government and industry necessary to make up lost ground.  Companies from the original laender were setting up research  stations in the new ones, and this, together with the funding  measures sponsored by his own ministry, the Industry Ministry,  and the governments of the new laender, should have a  stabilizing effect on staffing levels there. The two ministries  had set aside 740 million German marks for 1994, and additional  funds would be forthcoming from the new laender themselves.    Krueger saw a strong export trade aspect in this funding, as  "R&amp;D-intensive goods are a strong feature of German exports."  These are goods in which R&amp;D expenditure represents over 3.5  percent of the sale price. They gave Germany a considerable  trade surplus each year, 48 percent of German industrial exports  being R&amp;D intensive (1992).    Numerous east German firms were still not internationally  competitive with their products, so a greater orientation toward  product innovation was required. Industry in the new laender  would need support in developing products based on selected key  technologies. "This will also contribute to stabilizing the  R&amp;D  work force."</p>

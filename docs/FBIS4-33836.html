			<p>BFN     [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A preliminary toll  of five dead, six injured, and extensive property damage is the  result of an explosion outside the Camino Real Hotel in this  capital city of the Mexican Jalisco State, police authorities  have reported.    The police confirmed that the incident occurred at 0230 in  the morning (0830 GMT) when a 1993 Ford Grand Marquis car that  had been loaded with explosives blew up. The vehicle was parked  in front of the "Camichine" room of the aforementioned hotel.    Relief and security offices have reported that the explosion  destroyed 10 vehicles, including the bus of the "Los Huracanes"  musical group, and broke the windows of the room where a  birthday ball was being held to celebrate the 15th birthday of  Karine Ramirez.    Judicial Police Director Roberto Machuca Aguilar commented  that the party started last night and that the room for the ball  had been rented by a lady whose last name is Fernandez Castro,  apparently from Sinaloa State.    Of the six people injured, who were sent to different health  centers, five were identified as Jorge Castro Angulo, Alberto  Menchado Montes, Arturo Rangel Martinez, Ramon Perez Velarde,  and Jose Andres Gonzalez Padilla, 38, 30, 46, 34, and 20 years  of age, respectively.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1450 GMT on 11 Jun 94 reports from  Mexico City that "according to local reporters, the car bomb  could have been placed as an act of vengeance between drug  trafficking bands that operate in Guadalajara or as retaliation  for the arrest of Manuel Quintero Payan, related to a powerful  drug trafficking band." The AFP report adds that reporters have  linked the arrest of Quintero Payan to the car bomb "because the  people who attended the girl's birthday party talked like  `northeners' and thus are associated to the drug trafficking  bands."]</p>

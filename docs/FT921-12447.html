			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: All not lost in family planning Sir, How difficult it is to deal sensibly with family planning. The FT survey on Egypt (January 21) has a story headlined 'Lost: 20m condoms'; but it fails to mention the progress made in family planning. Few things are more important for the future of Egypt than slowing the growth of human numbers; there are 1m more births than deaths every nine months and the population is likely to double by the year 2020. Fortunately, Egyptians want smaller families. Fertility is declining and a recent survey found about half of all couples are now using modern contraceptives. This is the result of a successful partnership between the government of Egypt, non-governmental bodies, the private sector and international donors. Indeed, the demand for contraception in the developing world is so strong that the lost condoms given such prominence in the FT may have been illicitly sold to neighbouring countries. This is embarrassing for the monitors of US Agency for International Development, but the contraceptives almost certainly continued to save lives and plan families; it is neither statistically plausible nor culturally likely that every other Egyptian is playing with an odd-shaped, lubricated balloon.

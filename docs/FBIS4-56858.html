			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Federation and Paraguayan governments  are taking steps to sign a bilateral or multilateral agreement  on deep-sea fishing within the framework of an agreement on  commercial and economic cooperation. It has yet to be decided  which neighboring country, either Argentina or Brazil, may be  selected, although the balance is tipped in favor of Argentina.  Uruguay may also be included.    Reliable sources have said the preliminary negotiations  initiated some months ago have been translated into a rough  draft of an international agreement based on the UN Convention  on Maritime Law.    It should be recalled that, pursuant to the agreement  between  Russia and Paraguay -- the first of its kind -- the parties have  granted each other the status of most-favored nation while  promoting economic bilateral cooperation in building,  streamlining, and reconstructing mixed enterprises between both  nations or within the Treaty of Asuncion or Mercosur [Common  Market of the South]. The agreement also provides for the  facilitation of the supply of equipment, technology transfer,  and industrial cooperation.    All this was confirmed with the visit of Sergey Glazyev  [name  as published], Russian minister of foreign economic relations,  to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay more than a year  ago. His proposals have been enhanced by Yan Anastasyevich  Burlyay, Russian ambassador to Argentina and concurrent  ambassador to Paraguay.    His ideas produced a favorable response among Paraguayan  ship  owners, so much so that after discussions with the government at  technical level, steps were taken to adopt the necessary  international instruments to begin deep-sea fishing in the  territorial waters of neighboring countries like Argentina and  Brazil, and possibly Uruguay.    Official negotiations will be pursued within the framework  of  Articles 69 and 70 of the UN Convention on Maritime Law, which  establishes landlocked countries' rights to deep-water fishing.  Legislation and other background information have been collected  in the aforementioned neighboring countries to assess whether  this could be a cost-effective activity for Paraguayan ship  owners or for joint ventures between Paraguay and other  countries like Russia. This move also seeks to define the  species of fish to be captured, and the marketing in Paraguay or  other countries.</p>

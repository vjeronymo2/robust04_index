			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (2): Priority is jobs, jobs, jobs - Wim Kok has inherited an economy that seems poised for growth Bill Clinton's celebrated reminder that 'It's the economy, stupid' has little relevance to the Netherlands's new prime minister Wim Kok, who has inherited an economy that seems poised for a return to healthy economic growth. But if he had to choose a slogan to capture his priorities, Mr Kok might well have selected 'It's jobs, jobs, jobs'. The latest Dutch coalition government, inaugurated on August 29, has started its four-year term with good prospects of economic buoyancy but also with continuing signs that the country's long-standing unemployment problem is not going to go away easily. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in a report on the Dutch economy in June, argued that the Netherlands's unemployment problem is a structural one that cannot be overcome by economic growth alone. Its recipe for success is reducing rigidities in the labour market, decentralising wage-setting and, crucially, making the dole less attractive by widening the present narrow gap between welfare benefits and low-level wages. 'In a nutshell, the goal should be to reduce labour costs, redress the incentive balance between working and not working, and improve labour force skills and competencies, in all cases especially at the lower end of the market,' it wrote. Mr Kok's government has clearly targeted job creation as its main task, and it is planning to pursue this goal through a mixture of fiscal measures and specific programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mr Kok will really manage to address what the OECD describes as the Achilles heel of the Dutch economy. 'The biggest worry confronting the Netherlands is the shortage of jobs,' Mr Kok wrote in his government programme, which has received the backing of his own Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 party. 'Too many people remain, counted or uncounted, in the waiting room of the labour market; are unfit for work; or find themselves outside the labour process in middle age.' On its own, the quicker pace of economic growth is expected to help create 230,000 jobs during the cabinet's lifetime. But this will not be enough to deal with the 300,000 people projected to enter the job market in this period. For this reason, the new three-party coalition government will be actively pursuing programmes to stimulate jobs, particularly at the very lower end of the labour market. This will be done, in part, by reducing taxes and social premiums, thereby making employees less expensive for employers. 'Gross labour costs must come down, especially for lower-paid labour,' Mr Kok said. At the same time, some business sectors may be exempted from the minimum wage laws to help generate more entry-level jobs for job seekers. In another move, some 40,000 jobs for people on the dole will be created by the state in public duties such as home-help for the elderly, child care, and public safety and security. What Mr Kok will emphatically not do is lower unemployment benefits to encourage the unemployed to seek or accept work. This option - frequently proposed by those like the OECD who argue that the country's generous welfare provisions make it unattractive for dole recipients to take low-paid jobs - would be unacceptable to the rank and file of the Labour party. It is in this area of labour policy that the biggest doubts arise about the new government's ability to stimulate people to forego the security of state benefits and seek work. According to the Netherlands's own narrow definition of unemployment, only about 7 per cent of the potential labour force is out of work. But the OECD's broader definition - which takes in all people of working age receiving disability and other types of social security benefits, as well as people enrolled in special job creation programmes - puts unemployment at just above 25 per cent. The unemployment problem notwithstanding, the Netherlands is estimated to be on track for economic growth of 2.0 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 1995, up from a projected 1.5 per cent this year and just 0.3 per cent in 1993. The buoyant growth predicted for next year confirms that the Dutch economy is out of danger of slipping into the same recession that plagued its big European trading partners, especially Germany, in the early 1990s. Thanks to the Dutch guilder's close links to the German mark, inflation is expected to be relatively under control at 2.5 per cent this year, falling to 2.25 per cent next year. 'The economic prospects facing the new cabinet are good,' MeesPierson, the Dutch investment bank said in a report. 'The economy is just beginning to revive, inflation is on the way down, and employers' organisations and the trade unions have signed a national deal paving the way for wage restraint." Though the economy may look rosy, the new government, and especially the new finance minister, Gerrit Zalm, a member of the pro-market Liberals, face serious difficulties in the area of public finances. After several years of steady, albeit small, declines, in the financing deficit, the shortfall in 1995 and 1996 is expected to be static at 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product, before falling to 3.1 per cent in 1997 and 2.9 per cent in 1998. At this 1998 level, the Dutch financing deficit will fall just within the 3 per cent norm established for European monetary union at the end of the 1990s. But the absolute level of public debt will remain high, causing long-term worries for the government. Given the still precarious nature of the national debt, the new government will obviously be hoping that the predicted acceleration of economic growth will not only materialise, but that it will be even higher than projected. If so, tax revenues will also come in above budget, creating room for a renewed assault on public debt.</p>

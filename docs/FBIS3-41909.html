Voronin, chief nuclear and </F> thermonuclear weapons designer, under the ``Interlocutor of the  Day'' rubric by Mikhail Rebrov; date, place not given: ``Atomic  Bombs Are Not for Use in Political Games'' -- first four  paragraphs are introduction]    [Text]  <H5>  Calling Card </H5>   Stanislav Nikolayevich Voronin was born into a working-class  family in 1930 in the city of Yaroslavl. After graduating from  school he went to the Leningrad Ship-Building Institute. He  began working at the All-Union Experimental Physics Scientific  Research Institute (Arzamas-16) in 1954 as an engineer-designer  and was involved in developing and testing nuclear munitions for  several generations of land-, sea-, and air-launched missiles.  He has won Lenin and State Prizes. In 1969 he became a deputy  chief designer.    Since 1991 he has been a chief nuclear and thermonuclear  weapons designer.    He is married with two children.    Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, everyone is  hearing about the future of Ukraine's nuclear weapons today.  There are very different opinions on this. INTERFAX reports  that [Ukrainian] President Kravchuk recently said that ``given  the complex economic situation Ukraine regards nuclear weapons  not as weapons but as a material asset.'' What comment can you  make on this statement?    Voronin: Some of the chief designers of nuclear  weapons and munitions -- prominent scientists Yu.B. Khariton,  Ye.N. Avrorin, Yu.A. Trutnev, and R.I. Ilkayev; directors of  Russia's Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 federal nuclear centers  V.A. Belugin and V.Z. Nechay; and Ministry of Atomic Energy  specialists have sent a letter to the citizens and governments  of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries exposing all the  trickery over the nuclear weapons and over the question of  whether they are weapons or commodities....    Rebrov: You recently visited Ukraine, Pervomaysk  among other places. What is going on there?    Voronin: An inspection of the state of the nuclear  weapons in this and other areas revealed a number of major  irregularities in the handling of the nuclear munitions. Not  only as far as their storage is concerned, but also in terms of  maintenance. What is being done there constitutes a flagrant  breach of the most basic regulations and norms for handling  nuclear weapons. You want me to be more specific? OK. Some of  the warheads have been taken off alert status and cannot be put  back. That's impossible. Warranty periods [garantiynyye sroki]  have expired, there are no spare parts, and the servicing  procedures envisaged by operating instructions are not being  carried out. This work must be carried out without fail at  least once every three years. The munitions have been stored in  a temporary storage facility, that is in places where they  should only be kept during the servicing procedures. This  storage facility is jam-packed at the moment. There is no  proper access to the weapons, nor are there places for technical  servicing, and consequently there is none of the proper  supervision. This is all very serious.    Rebrov: It has been reported that a rise in  temperature has been recorded at these storage facilities....    Voronin: Yes, of 1.5-2 degrees. That is  understandable. Every munition emits heat; plutonium is, after  all, always hot -- this is not critical. It is something else  that is frightening: There are lots of weapons in the store, the  radiation background is rising, and the time that technical  personnel spend there has to be restricted....    It is always dangerous to stockpile nuclear munitions. And  if there are flagrant breaches of technical maintenance  requirements to boot, it is doubly dangerous. Fire,  explosion.... This is plutonium, after all. A highly dangerous  material. I won't tell you what could happen if it touches the  ground. It has a half-life of 24,000 years....    Rebrov: And how long have these munitions been  there without technical servicing?    Voronin: Five years.... The articles contain  moisture absorbers and bulk fillers [poglotiteli vlagi i  obyema]. They also require periodic checks. A change in the  oxygen content of the environment can cause the important  uranium components to oxidize. These processes occur tens of  times more intensively than in air.... And there is also the  formation of fine dust. It can spontaneously ignite. What is  more, the hydrogen content is rising in the hermetic container.  It may approach critical level. And an explosive mixture  spells the danger of detonation. The increased concentration of  hydrogen also has an adverse effect on electronic instruments.    Rebrov: It is not only at Pervomaysk that this  alarming, if not dangerous, situation has arisen....    Voronin: Regrettably, no. A similar feckless  attitude is being manifested toward cruise missiles and other  munitions. The recurrent irregularities are becoming  frightening. Just think: Missile complexes fitted with nuclear  munitions are not carrying out the repair and inspection work  for which documentation makes provision.    And what about failure to comply with transportation  regulations! We asked for two weapons to be sent to us for  control disassembly [kontrolnaya razborka]. The talks were  difficult, but it did nonetheless prove possible to persuade  them of the -- let me stress -- urgent advisability of doing  this. We are still waiting. The weapons have still not turned  up. It now turns out that they are held up at customs and have  spent two weeks in a siding somewhere without any supervision  and guard.    In a word, these violations -- and the list goes on and on  --  are causing slipups, increasing the danger in handling nuclear  munitions, and may cause accidents whose consequences and scale  will be comparable to or even exceed the disaster at Chernobyl.    And this is a disaster not only for Ukraine and Russia. All  neighboring states and those states in Europe and the Near East  which, owing to various meteorological phenomena, may find  themselves in the zone of radioactive contamination need to  ponder this.    Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, is Ukraine able in  your opinion to cope autonomously with such an alarming  situation and such a complex problem?    Voronin: What do you mean by ``cope with?'' The  rigorous system for maintaining and ensuring the security of  nuclear weapons that operated for many years in the former USSR  and is still functioning in Russia has been destroyed in Ukraine  and is not operational. I say this in all responsibility as a  chief designer.    I do not want to go into the reasons, I do not want to  conduct a political debate; I am only talking facts. And the  facts are that the prevailing situation is being aggravated by  the fact that the nuclear munitions on Ukraine's territory lack  physical protection and guard in keeping with present-day  requirements.    Rebrov: What about disassembly? The Ukrainian  leadership is relying on Western aid....    Voronin: Let me tell you this: Atomic bombs are  not for use in political games! Some politicians are indeed  saying that nuclear munitions can be dismantled in Ukraine.  This is an ill-intentioned attempt to mislead the public.  Ukraine has neither the specialists with the requisite  qualifications nor the production units nor the experience of  disassembling weapons. Incidentally, handling munitions whose  warranty periods have expired and which have been kept in  extremely dubious conditions is a highly dangerous job.    I would like to believe that we will reach a sensible  solution once we have cast aside all political ambition and  speculation. In exchange for the warheads Ukraine will receive  fuel elements for its nuclear electric power stations. But who  will pay the ``Russian workers'' for their hypercomplex and  dangerous work? Have you asked yourself that?    It is thoughtless to count on foreign specialists. No  sensible professional, if he is a responsible inhabitant of the  planet, would undertake to dismantle a nuclear munition  developed in another country, using unknown technology.    Rebrov: What is the situation today? Has there at  least been some progress -- the problem has, as you said, gone  beyond Ukraine and Russia?    Voronin: There is no particular optimism.  However, nor is there particular reason not to be optimistic.  The warheads must be removed immediately. We have proposed a  schedule. And that is not so easy either. The transport and  the plants where the disassembly will be carried out must not be  overloaded. Time is moving on. Haggling is inappropriate in  such a dangerous situation. There has so far been no reaction  from Ukraine.    Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, there have been  various adjustments and amendments to the agreements that have  been reached.... What is behind them?    Voronin: All that is irresponsible bluff. That is  why scientists and designers from two Russian nuclear centers  have provided the peoples and governments of all the world's  countries with an analysis of the situation and urged them to do  everything they can to avert a potential catastrophe.    Rebrov: When we met with you in Arzamas-16 in  October you spoke about the problem of the safety of the nuclear  weapons, and now we have this situation....    Voronin: I said and I can repeat that we have not  been marking time while working on developing nuclear munitions.  Year in, year out the level of security has risen. We have  succeeded in developing new detonators that do not explode in  the event of fire or when struck and do not operate even if you  crush them. In other words, we have succeeded in making  detonators less sensitive to heat and mechanical factors than  the explosives used in the weapons.    The configuration and design of these munitions are devised  in such a way as to ensure that no nuclear explosion occurs in  the event of any catastrophe or accident. But what I am saying  does not apply to the munitions now in Ukraine.    Rebrov: You said that ``you have not been marking  time.'' What about now?    Voronin: Do you mean: What are we doing now?  Have we come to a standstill? Have I gotten your drift? Allow  me to ask you this: Has the world already become nuclear-free,  and have all states with nuclear weapons stopped producing and  improving them? No! Then why should Russia act differently?  Isn't our security guaranteed by the might of the country's  defense potential? I think that I have answered your question.    Rebrov: In that case are tests necessary?    Voronin: They are. Can you develop new weapons  and not test them? I would like to talk about guarantees of the  safety of such tests. We have developed a technology for  underground explosions whereby no emissions occur. This is a  tricky problem, but it has been resolved. And I think that  information about it should not be kept secret but brought to  the notice of the public, to everyone who talks about tests  without knowing or understanding the crux of the matter.  Regrettably, the inspections that have been carried out at test  facilities -- not long ago but recently -- have not acted as an  argument; nobody reads these reports. Hence the tendency to  blame atomic specialists for everything.    Moreover, if we are talking about tests, you have to take a  far broader view and not just confine yourself to weapons. Talk  to our scientists and, in particular, to Academicians Khariton  and Trutnev. Both Yuliy Borisovich and Yuriy Alekseyevich will  give you a detailed insight into the problems of physical  science. It is not ``marking time'' either; today physics is  tackling the kind of processes that cannot be reproduced under  laboratory conditions. Imagine, pressure of billions of  atmospheres, temperatures of tens and even hundreds of millions  of degrees, velocity measured in 100-millionths of a second....  Not to mention fantastic densities, the purity of the  substances obtained, etc. No science can develop without  experiment....    Rebrov: Blowing up munitions that have been  uncontrolled in terms of technical servicing, observance of  storage norms, etc is probably of interest to nuclear designers?    Voronin: Indisputably. That is why I would like  to stress that we should not tilt at windmills but confront the  real danger. It does exist, and its source is well-known.    Rebrov: One last thing, Stanislav Nikolayevich,  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has frequently written about the social tension  at Arzamas-16. Has there been any change?    Voronin: We are grateful for the support, the  newspaper's article played a positive role, and there has been  kind of progress, but.... Regrettably everything has been held  up. And I do not rule out the possibility of another social  explosion.</p>

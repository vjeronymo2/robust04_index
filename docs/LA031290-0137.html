			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CANSECO HALTS ATTEMPTED STEAL  </P> <P> Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco picked off someone trying to steal -- his  boat.  </P> <P> A hapless thief tried to roar off with Canseco's 42-foot boat as the slugger  played volleyball Sunday on South Beach, a popular Art Deco district of Miami  Beach.  </P> <P> The boat's engine wouldn't cooperate, and police arrested 27-year-old Gregory  Dudley adrift as he tried in vain to start it, Miami Beach police spokesman Jim  Hyde said.  </P> <P> Canseco had anchored near Penrod's Beach Club. "He swam in to play volleyball,"  Hyde said.  </P> <P> About 6 p.m., Canseco quit. He spotted someone hiding behind the boat console.  </P> <P> Canseco called police, who responded quickly -- Metro Dade police with a  helicopter, Miami Beach police with a boat. The Florida Marine Patrol responded  too.  </P> <P> Police corraled Dudley and the drifting boat. Dudley was charged with attempted  grand theft.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Sound Diffusion The accountancy debates of the 1980s are obviously going to rumble on into the 1990s. The issues behind accounting for leasing profits are so complicated that one could write a book on them; indeed at 255 pages, the DTI inspectors of Sound Diffusion have. But shareholders must feel that if there can be such wide disagreement between inspectors and two leading firms of auditors, they have little hope of keeping track. Given the 1980s' problems in the computer leasing sector, leasing companies are not likely to be too welcome on the stock market for a while. It is perhaps unsurprising that GPA is private. In the circumstances, one can feel more than a twinge of sympathy for the two non-executive directors, Mr Macdonald and Mr Howard, brought in to sort out the complicated mess and ending up only with brickbats from the inspectors for their pains. The criticisms may well re-open the issue of whether inspectors should be allowed to be so trenchant. And given that the report took two years to complete, only to conclude that no single factor was responsible for the group's failure, the taxpayer might wonder whether the expense of these investigations is justified.</p>

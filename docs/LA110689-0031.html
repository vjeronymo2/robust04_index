			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> SAILORS FROM 2 ERAS HONOR CARRIER DEAD  </P> <P> There was an air of irony as former sailors who served aboard the Lexington in  World War II joined with the aircraft carrier's crew over the weekend in  Pensacola, Fla., to remember shipmates who died 45 years ago. An association of  former crew members had originally planned its reunion to coincide with the  45th anniversary of the day a Japanese suicide plane hit the carrier and killed  47 shipmates. But, last week, a T-2 Buckeye training jet crashed into the  Lexington, killing the Navy pilot and four people on the flight deck. The  accident bore an eerie similarity to the remembered wartime attack. As a crowd  of 1,500 watched, sailors from two eras dropped wreaths during a weekend cruise  in the Gulf of Mexico about 10 miles from where the trainer crash occurred.  </P></p>

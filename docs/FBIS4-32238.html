			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Democratic Community of Hungarians  in Vojvodina [VMDK], the Hungarian political leadership can also  be blamed for the VMDK's crisis. The VMDK Presidium's  communique says that following the financial scandal that broke  out some months ago, the Hungarians in Vojvodina have got into  an unprecedented political crisis. There are also external  reasons, namely leading Hungarian politicians, in the background  of the crisis, the document reads. According to the VMDK  leaders, some powerful people of the Hungarian Government made  the financial support aimed for the Vojvodina Hungarians subject  to a demonstration of party loyalty. The aim of the Hungarian  Government politicians was to line up the VMDK, too, among the  supporters of the Budapest coalition.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Overnight at 100% THE LIQUIDITY shortage in the sterling money market took a turn for the worse yesterday as the overnight rate in the interbank market rose to 100 per cent in afternoon trading, writes James Blitz. Commercial banks were bidding painfully high levels for sterling against base rates of 8 per cent because of the shortage of cash in the system. There was general dismay at the situation, and some discount house dealers were concerned that the Bank of England has proved unable to rectify the problem by adding liquidity. Yesterday's shortage of Pounds 1.8bn forecast by the Bank of England was the latest in a string of liquidity problems that have dogged the sterling market all week. They are partly the result of the tax collection season which the UK is now in. This forces the banks to deliver more funds to the Bank of England than they are receiving. But the difficulties fundamentally reflect the systemic shortages which followed the Bank of England's massive intervention on the foreign exchanges in the wake of Black Wednesday. Compounding the problem is the widespread feeling that another base rate cut is imminent. Dealers do not want to offer bills to the Bank of England at the current structure of 8 per cent base rate, because they fear that the assets will lose value if base rates are cut. Last Friday's base rate cut in the wake of a 26-day 'repo' reflecting the former structure of rates has probably undermined any interest in offering bills. Discount house dealers said that the Bank of England did not dare to offer liquidity through a short-dated 'repo' because this would be interpreted as signalling another base rate cut. One dealer wondered whether there might be policy differences between the Treasury and the Bank of England. He could not understand why the Bank did not offer a short-dated repo accompanied by an announcement that it signalled no policy change. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 400m yesterday, although this still left the system short of Pounds 350m of cash. One month money closed 1 1/2 percentage points above base rate, while 3 month money firmed up to 8 per cent.</p>

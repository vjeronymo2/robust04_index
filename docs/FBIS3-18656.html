			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>   [Excerpts] The UN envoys gave indications to President  Glavkos Kliridhis that views may be converging on at least two  of the serious issues on the agenda of the proximity talks: safe  access to Famagusta's fenced-off area and Turkish Cypriot access  to Nicosia Airport.    Relevant O FILELEVTHEROS information is that at their latest  meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative in Cyprus, and UN Political Adviser John Paul  Kavanagh got the impression that there will be progress on some  issues. The UN envoys conveyed their beliefs to the Cypriot  president. The Greek Cypriot side hopes that Feissel's "ideas,"  which will be submitted next Monday [7 March], will raise the  prospects for progress toward implementing the measures without  deviating from the UN secretary general's principles. According  to the Greek Cypriot side, the most important principle is to  open the way for a swift settlement of the Cyprus problem.    O FILELEVTHEROS' information mentions that the United  Nations  shares the Greek Cypriot view that Varosha should not be  enclaved by the Turkish troops and that there should be free  access by land and sea. The United Nations will control  Varosha's offshore waters up to the buffer zone.    With the help of three of the four UN advisers that are  already in Nicosia, Feissel and Kavanagh are feverishly  preparing their proposals. They are also negotiating with the  diplomatic representatives of the UN Security Council permanent  members. [passage omitted]    The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent at the  United Nations reports that Britain is moving to get the  Security Council to approve a resolution, while the United  States prefers for the Security Council president to make a  statement.

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES ITSELF A HEFTY PAY RAISE  </P> <P> I think I understand why the man in the street is upset over the pay raises for  congressmen and senators. The average workingman in this country obviously  thinks that a salary of more than $80,000 is already more than enough for the  rank-and-file leaders of our country. It's the Ralph Naders and other respected  architects of popular opinion who confuse me.  </P> <P> A workingman may not readily realize that a lawmaker who is already making four  times as much as he does could easily go into the private sector and earn well  over $200,000 per year. But I would expect Nader and his associates to grasp  that apparently elusive point.  </P> <P> The reality of the situation is really quite simple:  </P> <P> * If our government is going to work effectively, we must have capable leaders.  </P> <P> * Capable leaders are now, as always, at a premium in our country as they are  in all other countries.  </P> <P> * If we don't pay our leaders enough money to live at a level that bears some  semblance to the station that their education and accomplishments entitle them,  we subject them to the harshest of temptations. If we don't pay them enough to  live well by the standards of their peers, there are plenty of very wealthy and  unprincipled people who will see to it that our leaders do have access to those  levels -- for a price.  </P> <P> * Senators and congressmen make speeches. If they make those speeches to the  right groups of people, they are well paid for their time and elocution. These  payments are called "honorariums." It requires no great imagination to see that  a company that, for several years, has paid a congressman $5,000 plus expenses  for a 40-minute speech, might expect a more sympathetic attitude from that  congressman regarding any legislation that may benefit said company.  </P> <P> * If we keep paying our House and Senate leaders at twice the going rate for a  competent machinist and one-quarter or less of the going rate for leaders in  private industry, we will ultimately be left with but three categories of  leaders. Those who are already wealthy, those who are poor but honest and those  who are, to some degree or another, beholden to the private interests that pay  a large part of their real salary.  </P> <P> PHILIP W.

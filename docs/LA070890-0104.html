			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KRIEGER AVOIDS 5-CAR CRASH TO WIN MAIN EVENT AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> A five-car accident on the second lap of the Sportsman Division main event at  Saugus Speedway delayed the 40-lap race for nearly an hour Saturday night  before a crowd of 3,553.  </P> <P> But after the race restarted, Larry Krieger of Reseda won for the second  consecutive week. Krieger passed Tom Eurton of Valencia on Lap 30 and held on  for the victory in a 14-car field. Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley finished  second, followed by Pat Mintey of Quartz Hill and Dave Phipps of Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Even with the win, Krieger, who entered the night third in the points  standings, will remain behind points leader Will Harper.  </P> <P> Tim Staubs of Littlerock won the 15-lap figure-eight main event. Steve Nickolai  of Simi Valley finished second, followed by Russ Beckers of Sepulveda.  </P> <P> A videotape of the Sportsman Division accident showed that a car driven by Gary  Sigman of Carson got turned around on the backstretch. Keith Spangler's car  collided head-on with Sigman and then John Cran of Reseda rear-ended Spangler,  became airborne and went over the top of Spangler's car.  </P> <P> Spangler, of Northridge, was taken to the hospital for X-rays after leaving his  car under his own power. The race was delayed until another ambulance could  arrive at the track.  </P> <P> Cran entered the night second in the Sportsman points standings. Spangler was  fourth and Sigman seventh.  </P> <P> Also involved in the accident was Mintey, who entered the night eighth in the  points standings. Mintey, who had the night's fastest qualifying time, was able  to re-enter the race, however, because his car did not sustain major damage.  </P> <P> Earlier, Nickolai took advantage of a few breaks -- and a lot of skill -- to  win the 25-lap Street Stock main event and take over the points lead.  </P> <P> Nickolai started sixth but moved up to second, behind Chris Doyle of Canyon  Country, by passing Larry Durm of Northridge on Lap 18.  </P> <P> Nickolai then passed Doyle, who had led the whole race, during a yellow flag on  Lap 23. Nickolai had to pass on the inside to avoid a stalled car.  </P> <P> The win was the first main-event victory of the season for Nickolai, who  started the night tied for third in the points standings.  </P> <P> Nickolai also got some help when Russ Beckers of Sepulveda, who was running in  second place, was involved in an accident and went to the back of the pack.  Also sent to the back was Staubs, who was running third.  </P> <P> Moreover, points leader Dave Blankenship was unable to compete because of an  illegally wide wheelbase and Thad Friday of Reseda, who was second in  standings, was unable to finish the race when his motor failed.  </P> <P> Doyle finished second, followed by Ed Horst of Reseda, Doug Renno of Canoga  Park and Rayburn.  </P> <P> Dale Petty of Palmdale led from the beginning to win the Street Stock semi-main  event and advance to the main event. The race was called after nine laps  because of an accident involving Sean Hadley of Reseda and Dave Osborne.  </P> <P> Durm won two Street Stock heat races. Other heat-race winners included Larry  Woodside of Saugus and Rayburn (Sportsman); Mike Johannes of Van Nuys and Jim  Marlewski of Simi Valley (Street Stock); and Petty and Staubs (figure eight).  </P> <P> Trophy-dash winners included Krieger in the Sportsman, Ken Maler of Castaic  (Street Stock) and Rayburn (figure eight).  </P></p>

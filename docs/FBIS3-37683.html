The meeting participants praised the message of Boris  Yeltsin  to the Serbs on the need for joint actions of the United States,  the European Union and other partners in order to boost the  Bosnian settlement. A meeting of senior officials from the  Russian Federation, the United States, Germany, France and Great  Britain, as well as the European Council's "three" will be held  next week to discuss a dialogue with the Security Council, the  United Nations and the co-chairmen of the London conference on  former Yugoslavia.    According to diplomatic circles, the meeting will be held in  Bonn. There may also be a meeting of foreign ministers on the  same issue.    The process was initiated by German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev, said Sidorova. After meetings with  U.S. state secretary and foreign ministers of France and Great  Britain, everyone supported the need for joint initiatives.    The Athens consultations also discussed the soonest signing  of a treaty on cooperation and partnership by the European Union  and Russia. The political declaration was signed by Boris  Yeltsin in 1993, and the treaty will outline specific areas of  cooperation and interaction.    There are some disputable questions, including exports of  nuclear cycle materials and banking. Some voice the need for  quotas on these goods, and the Russian side is against this.  Russia is against any quotas on these goods. Sidorova said  Greece is ready to help the soonest conclusion of the treaty.    The consultations analyzed European security, the situation  in conflict zones on territory of the former Soviet Union,  including Transcaucasia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and relations with  Ukraine.    They noted general understanding on sanctions against former  Yugoslavia. The question of sanctions will be raised as soon as  settlement progresses, and this coincides with the Russian stand  on the issue.    Describing the situation in Transcaucasia, Kozyrev stressed  the interest in the involvement of CSCE and U.N. peace-makers,  said Sidorova.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]  investigation into allegations of mass fraud in some districts  of KwaZulu-Natal has held up the tallying process. With no  substantial results available from this region it's not yet  clear whether Saturday's inauguration ceremony for the region's  premier can go ahead. Ida Jooste has the story.    [Begin recording] [Jooste] Speculation is mounting over  whether the ANC or IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] will take control  of KwaZulu-Natal. An urgent meeting was held behind closed  doors at a counting station in Durban today to address  allegations of fraud. Hours later and IEC commissioner and party  officials emerged to announce that there had been some  agreement. However, the issue of about 80 disputed boxes from  the Mahlabatini area remains unresolved.    [IFP spokesman Ziba Jiyane] More than a hundred boxes have  been held up here because somebody from the ANC identified their  origin as the IFP stronghold, and we brought Mr. Nupin to come  here. I took my time out here with Mr. Miller and now when we  make a case to Mr. Nupin the ANC decides to call us aside and  say they are withdrawing all that -- because they knew they were  frivolous claims.    [ANC spokesman Beki Cele] One serious thing that happened is  to give the officials of KwaZulu to run some stations. The  officials of KwaZulu would be the IFP people or would have some  kind of (?allegiance). I think that was a serious shortcoming  from the very word go, and it has...[pauses] it was bound to  snowball.    [IEC Commissioner Charles Nupin] The second category were  boxes that on the face of it could not be reconciled to  particular voting stations. Now, my information is that an  investigation was conducted and in the large majority of cases  those boxes were reconciled to particular voting stations. [end  recording]</p>

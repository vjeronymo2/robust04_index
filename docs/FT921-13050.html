			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / 3,000 Lloyd's Names face Pounds 100m cash call MORE THAN 3,000 Lloyd's Names are to be asked this week to meet a cash call for over Pounds 100m as a result of losses incurred in 1989 and 1990 by insurance syndicates formerly run by Gooda Walker, the managing agency that went into liquidation last September. Four Gooda Walker syndicates, numbers 164, 290, 298 and 299, which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance, are affected. The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting on the Lloyd's market - were asked to pay Pounds 137m in a cash call last June but did not expect that further money would be needed until their syndicates announced final results for 1989 this June. The losses are among the worst faced by any of the 400 Lloyd's syndicates trading in 1989, during which the market's overall losses will be at least Pounds 1bn. According to Mr Ralph Sharp of GW Run-Off, a privately owned company managing the syndicates' affairs on behalf of affected Names, the cash call arose out of the decision by two UK banks that had supported the syndicates to call in outstanding loans. Mr Sharp said last year's estimates of losses by Gooda Walker understated the syndicates' difficulties. The Names were told last year that losses might total Pounds 238m for 1989 and Pounds 58m for 1990. 'We know that having looked at the cash flow it is going to get worse,' Mr Sharp said. Claims from disasters such as hurricane Hugo in September 1989, the European storms of January 1990 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989 had been arriving faster than expected, he said. 'The losses especially for syndicate 290 are unacceptable and well beyond bad luck.' The cash call will exacerbate the difficulties of the Gooda Walker Names, many of whom have been unable to pay last year's cash call. Mr Sharp said Pounds 21m of last year's Pounds 137m call had still not been collected. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, of the Gooda Walker Names Association, said many of his association's members 'cannot afford to pay' and will need to appeal for help from the Lloyd's hardship committee. He added that other Names 'don't want to pay on principle. We are not sure that these calls are kosher and the result of properly conducted insurance business.'</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> METS' CONE TRIPLES HIS SALARY TO $1.3 MILLION BY ARBITRATION  </P> <P> Pitcher David Cone tripled his salary to $1.3 million today when arbitrator  Raymond Goetz picked his figure rather than the New York Mets' offer of  $815,000.  </P> <P> Cone's salary is a 291% increase from the $332,500 he made last season, when he  was 14-8 with a 3.52 earned-run average.  </P> <P> "The major factor I think is the fact that he has had an outstanding two  seasons with only a minor blemish during a four-start period in 1989," said  Steven Fehr, Cone's agent. "I thought our number was very reasonable."  </P> <P> "We gave it our best shot," Mets Senior Vice President Al Harazin said. "We  presented our cases as best we could and we abide by the arbiter's decisions."  </P> <P> Fehr said the Mets' "argument was geared principally to looking at other  three-plus and four-plus pitchers and saying that on a one-year basis, he was  not better or as good."  </P></p>

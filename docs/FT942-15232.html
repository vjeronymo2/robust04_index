			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Credit Lyonnais stoppages Workers at Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank recently baled out by the government in a controversial FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.2bn) rescue, yesterday rejected proposals to shed up to 3,800 jobs in France over the next three years. Credit Lyonnais's branches throughout the day were disrupted by strikes and stoppages by staff protesting against the cuts. Several hundred employees staged a demonstration outside the group's grandiose headquarters on Boulevard des Italiens in Paris before a morning meeting between Credit Lyonnais's unions and management. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who in November was appointed by the government to chair the bank, last month called on its 38,000 French employees to accept a radical rationalisation plan as part of his efforts to bring Credit Lyonnais back into the black after a FFr6.9bn net loss last year. The proposals include the loss of 1,000 jobs in France this year followed by the loss of 2,100 to 2,800 posts over the next two years. The Peyrelevade plan is by far the most dramatic cost cutting initiative in the French banking industry. Mr Peyrelevade has claimed that a large proportion of the proposed cuts could come from natural wastage such as early retirement and transfers to part-time working. However the banking unions, which earlier this year staged an industry-wide strike against less radical cuts, are concerned that, if Credit Lyonnais accelerated its rationalisation, other banks might follow suit.</p>

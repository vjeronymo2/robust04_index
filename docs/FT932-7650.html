			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Hopes rise for launch of investment watchdog PROSPECTS for the creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for financial services, have been boosted by a compromise proposal on membership rules intended to encourage banks, building societies and independent sales agents to join. The proposal from Sir Brian Jenkins, a senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, and a former Lord Mayor of London, involves moderating the controversial proposal by the Securities and Investments Board that independent financial advisers be required to have minimum capital of Pounds 10,000. Sir Brian has proposed that only those who, after submitting a three-year business plan, cannot demonstrate solvency will have to present an enforceable guarantee that up to Pounds 10,000 could be put into the business. The solvency test will also have to be met if their gross revenues fall by 25 per cent, or if a single source providing more than 10 per cent of their business is lost. Bankers, who had been particularly keen to see minimum capital rules, privately said they did not believe the compromise would weaken regulatory standards. One bank official said: 'If this report is adopted in its present form it will go a long way towards encouraging at least some of the big banks to join the PIA.' Both Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank have said they would join the PIA provided it raised regulatory standards along the lines suggested last year by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large. The PIA had asked Sir Brian to review the SIB proposals, intended to make the PIA a tougher regulator than the existing self-regulatory bodies. The PIA is intended to replace Lautro, the self-regulatory body for life insurers, and Fimbra, the body for independent financial advisers. Life insurers have said they will not join unless the banks and building societies which sell financial services join as well. Most of those are regulated directly by SIB. Sir Brian endorsed SIB's proposal that all those joining the PIA be vetted before admission, even if they had previously been members in good standing of a similar body. He urged, however, that as far as possible, those vetting new members should rely on information already on file at other self-regulatory bodies. The proposals are also expected to be largely welcomed by large independent financial adviser firms which already exceed the minimum requirements spelled out in the paper. Mr John Bridle, chief executive at Towry Law, a large chain of independent financial advisers, said: 'One needs to do something so the industry as a whole can demonstrate it is committed to raising standards.'</p>

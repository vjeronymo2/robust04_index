			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Fridrik Sophusson: "Iceland on </F> a Cautious Course Toward Europe"]    [Text] On 17 June it is 50 years since the Republic of  Iceland was founded. To mark the occasion the Icelandic finance  minister assesses the country's economic development and its  relationship to economic and political cooperation in Europe.  Even though Iceland is involved in the economic cooperation  between the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EU  [European Union] countries -- so-called EEA [European Economic  Area] cooperation -- Iceland is the only Nordic country not to  have sought EU membership.    If one were to describe Iceland's economy from World War II  up to only a few years ago, the key word is instability. This  is due first and foremost to the uniformity of industrial and  commercial life where fishing has been the decisive factor for  the population. This has often led to violent turbulence and  the situation in times of recession has often been aggravated  further by the intervention of the authorities in dubious rescue  attempts.    This instability led among other things to massive inflation  and major economic swings generally. It almost became a reflex  action to blame the authorities every time problems reared their  heads in which people were expecting the politicians to  intervene. As a result as time passed the authorities'  involvement in the economy grew steadily.    However, the situation has not been as gloomy as this the  whole time. In the 1960's, for example, major economic reforms  aiming at greater liberalization were implemented. But it was  not long before people resorted to the old solutions again.  People moved away from the path of liberalization, and the  authorities' intervention in the economy increased again. There  was hardly an area in which the authorities did not have their  fingers in the pie.    In the wake of growing inflation, which reached its peak in  the mid-1980's when it topped the 100-percent barrier, saving  was abandoned completely. People preferred instead to take  loans on a similar scale.    Society's system of values became totally distorted. It was  a case of spending money as soon as it appeared on the horizon  -- and ideally a little more money than you actually had. The  best thing was to borrow money at the negative interest rates  that burned up on the bonfire of inflation in the course of only  a few years. These were good times for those who owed money,  while those people who had saved money were badly hit and some  of them lost everything they had. It goes without saying that  those who controlled large amounts of capital had great power in  Icelandic society. In a society where the majority of the  financial institutions were state owned these had of necessity  to lead to a situation in which the politicians felt tempted by  this power. This was what Iceland was like.    In the past few years Iceland's economic policy has been  revolutionized. The Icelandic coalition government consisting  of the Independence Party and the Social Democrats that came to  power in 1991 has made it a point of honor to combat the  problems of the past. We have endeavored to decrease state  intervention. The public sector has been rationalized and been  the target of spending cuts. At the same time the government  has begun to sell off state-owned companies. The taxation  system has been completely reorganized with lower levels of tax  relief and fewer deductions. Domestic and foreign trade, the  service sector, and the activities of the stock exchange have  been liberalized to an appreciable extent. The door has been  opened up to foreign investments. In particular the present  government has made every effort to bring inflation down to the  level of our neighbors. This has naturally required close  consultation between the government and the two sides of  industry.    And now we are beginning to see the light. The economy has  largely been stabilized. Inflation is down to below the OECD  average, which at present is around 2 percent. Interest rate  levels have fallen dramatically, and we are now in line with the  majority of our trading partners, particularly the Nordic  countries. From a large deficit in foreign trade in 1991 we  achieved a surplus in 1993. As a result we have been able to  deal with an accelerating foreign debt. The shortfall in the  state's coffers and public debt are also smaller in Iceland than  in many other places. Finally, there is the prospect that  economic growth will get under way next year.    These have to be described as impressive results, especially  when we remember that since 1987 the Icelandic economy has  experienced seven lean years. GNP has remained static -- this  means that economic growth has been nil. This stagnation has  been first and foremost due to the cuts in the fishing quotas  that it was necessary to adopt to protect fish stocks in the  ocean. In addition fish prices have fallen by 25 percent as a  result of the wave of recession that has swept through the  foreign countries closest to us.    This stagnation brings with it growing unemployment, for  example, and for the first time in more than 25 years we are  able to record an appreciable level of unemployment in Iceland.  The government has moved to tackle this unemployment through  the construction of new roads, for example, and lower taxes for  companies. Unemployment is now at 5.5 percent -- a figure that  is somewhat lower than unemployment in the rest of Europe.    Its historical legacy and its newly won independence have of  course set their stamp on the young Icelandic Republic's links  with international cooperation. Geographically Iceland finds  itself on the boundary between the America and Europe. Like  Denmark and Norway, Iceland was swift to choose to ally itself  with the Western Hemisphere in security policy cooperation. Our  country has no army, but because of our island's strategic  location we were able to contribute by making available land for  U.S.-manned NATO bases.    A few years later -- in the mid-1950's -- Iceland became an  active partner in Nordic cooperation that came into being in the  context of the founding of the Nordic Council in 1952. Nordic  cooperation has always been of great importance to Iceland. The  advantages to be gained from Nordic cooperation are obvious,  especially when there are things that can better be done  together than by each small country individually. This  importance will not decrease now that Iceland is facing the  prospect of -- perhaps -- being the only Nordic country outside  the EU.    Attitudes to international cooperation have gradually  changed  over the years. We have increasingly made efforts to promote  trading cooperation, at the same time as foreign trade has been  liberalized. We have done this through the GATT agreement, for  example, EFTA cooperation, free trade agreements with the EU,  and now most recently the EEA agreement. European cooperation  is particularly important in that the largest part of Iceland's  foreign trade is with Europe, but there is also a cultural and  political belonging. We have, however, chosen to take cautious  steps. There are various explanations for this decision.  Iceland is a relatively young Republic; the principle of  independence is therefore high on the agenda. Another reason is  the country's dependence on fish. We want to control our fish  stocks ourselves. This was a realistic view to take at the time  when the Icelandic Government decided that the time was not ripe  to seek EU membership alongside the other Nordic countries. The  colossal changes which the Icelandic economy has experienced  have brought Iceland closer to the rest of Europe. In the years  to come Iceland will attach importance to opening up even more  to the rest of the world and to improving conditions for foreign  investors. The cautious, but above all viable fisheries policy  where cuts have been made in fish quotas will show itself to be  a profitable investment which will bring increased fish catches  in years to come which will help to put the Icelandic economy  back on its feet. In addition we have at our disposal huge  amounts of energy in our waterfalls which make it easier for us  to offer foreign investors favorable terms for investment in  Icelandic industry and commerce. This is why we are taking a  rosy view of the future.    We note that the world scene is changing rapidly, even  viewed  through Icelandic eyes. I am thinking here first and foremost  of the other Nordic countries' possible future membership of the  EU. This will naturally have an effect on Nordic cooperation,  particularly as far as Iceland is concerned. The Icelanders are  a Nordic people in Europe, and we wish to continue to be so.  That is why we are attaching great importance to continued  close cooperation with the other Nordic countries -- either in  the framework of the EEA or in the EU context.    This fact requires a reassessment of the situation. We will  look these changes in the face and make our arrangements  accordingly. The capacity for adjustment of Icelandic society  knows no bounds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Gao Luchin, director of the PRC's </F> State Patent Office, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given -- first two paragraphs  are introduction]    [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  reporter, Gao Luchin, director of the PRC's State Patent Office,  said China is in support of moves by Japan and Europe to  coordinate the world patent system and to adopt a unified global  principle of first patent application. In the interview, the  Chinese official in charge of patent affairs said Beijing  intends to attract more foreign businesses by revamping its  current patent system to further develop China's economy.    Following is a summary of the interview.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does China view moves to  coordinate the world patent system?    [GAO] In order for the world economy to develop, it is  necessary to make technology invented by certain nations freely  transferable across borders. If terms for the acquisition of  patents and the method of their protection differ from country  to country, this situation would cause international disputes  such as patent infringement. It is indispensable to create a  world patent system to avert such international disputes. The  United States is the only nation which maintains the principle  of first invention, but China intends to ask that country for an  early shift to the principle of first patent application in the  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other  international organizations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The world sees China as a highly  potential market. How does China plan to attract foreign  capital and technology?    [GAO] Japanese and other foreign enterprises see China as a  market that will grow in the future. China is willing to  introduce technologies held by foreign firms which can serve to  develop China's economy. In order for the enterprises of many  nations to easily make business inroads into China with their  own technologies and gain access to the Chinese market, China  needs to protect their intellectual property rights effectively  and correctly.    To that end, China intends to simplify the current  procedural  process in a bid to shorten the period of patent examination for  the acquisition of patent rights and work to strengthen the  examination system to protect property rights correctly.  Specifically, in order for technologies of foreign firms and  inventors to be properly protected, China intends to work  towards improving the management of the patent system by  promoting both an exchange of experts with foreign nations and  an exchange of views with officials in charge of patent affairs  in the firms of industrialized nations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Would you explain how China is  working to revamp its patent system and how it will work to do  in the future?    [GAO] China first introduced the patent system in 1985, nine  years ago. The history of China's patent system is short  compared with that of Japan, Europe, and the United States. It  can be said China was able to introduce a modern patent system  on the model of patent systems in industrialized nations. China  sweepingly amended the Patent Law in March 1993, and now the law  gives the same protection to patent rights as those of  industrialized nations.    China aims to join GATT as a member nation. China has taken  steps to protect its manufacturing technology and to adopt a  patent system on materials in line with the contents of the  Intellectual Property Right Accord hammered out last December at  the Uruguay Round. In the future, China seeks to join the  Budapest Convention on the international consignment of  microorganisms.</p>

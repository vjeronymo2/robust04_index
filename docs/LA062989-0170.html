			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGHES PAYS $1.29 MILLION TO SETTLE DEFENSE CONTRACT SUIT  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft Co. has paid $1.29 million to settle claims that it mischarged  costs for developing the M-1 tank's infrared target simulator, the Justice  Department said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The settlement includes $732,900 that Hughes had previously paid the Defense  Department under the Pentagon's voluntary disclosure program that encourages  defense contractors to report possible civil or criminal fraud, the department  said in a statement.  </P> <P> Hughes, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of General Motors, made the payments to  settle government claims that it had mischarged development and marketing  expenses of the target simulator to Army contracts that did not provide  reimbursement for such costs.  </P> <P> The agreement signed Monday also settles government claims that Hughes  mischarged some labor costs, the department said.  </P> <P> In return, the Justice Department agreed not to file suit under the False  Claims Act, which could have subjected Hughes to triple damages if the  government had prevailed in court.  </P></p>

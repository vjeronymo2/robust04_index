			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Tory rebels warn on rail privatisation CONSERVATIVE rebels against rail privatisation yesterday warned the government not to try to reverse a Lords amendment giving British Rail more power to bid for new franchises. Ministers are considering how to respond to the threat of a backbench rebellion when the bill returns to the Commons by early November. They fear that up to 15 backbenchers may vote against an attempt to overrule the upper chamber's amendment allowing BR to bid for rail franchises after privatisation. Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said: 'Many people up and down the country do not believe that a change to the franchises would result in a better rail service.' He is hoping ministers will accept the Lord's amendment. Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said: 'My advice to the government is that they should accept the Lords' amendment.' Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said there was an easy solution to the problem: 'If the government does not want BR to bid for the franchises it should widen that out and prevent any national rail corporation from bidding.' However, since such a blanket ban on foreign railways could be in breach of a European Commission directive, the government is unlikely to agree to such a proposal. Pressure from backbenchers has taken on a greater significance since the Ulster Unionists signalled that the government would have to work hard to secure their help in steering its rail privatisation proposals through the Commons. A number of Tory MPs said they had asked ministers to find a compromise. 'I am hopeful that the government will not try to reverse the Lords amendment,' said one senior backbencher. Another said: 'I don't think you should assume the government will automatically try to push through its original rail privatisation proposals.' Ms Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West, said that while she would not vote against the government, she hoped ministers would come up with 'better proposals' on privatisation. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, are holding meetings with many of the Tory MPs concerned that BR should be able to bid against the private sector for franchises. Some backbenchers are concerned about what they believe to be inadequate government funding for BR. Mr Peter Bottomley, a former transport minister, said the lack of capital investment was more important than BR's future ownership.</p>

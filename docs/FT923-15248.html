			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / NZ deficit at twice forecast MS Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, unveiled a deficit of NZDollars 3.2bn (Pounds 916m) for 1991-92 in her annual budget speech yesterday, nearly twice the amount forecast last year. She predicted that the deficit would rise to NZDollars 3.3bn this year, fall to NZDollars 2.8bn in 1994 and to NZDollars 2.3bn by 1995. Ms Richardson said she was far from comfortable with these forecasts, but would not increase taxes. Instead she would control the deficits by checking government spending and countering tax avoidance. The budget contained no new initiatives, in contrast to the sweeping changes to the welfare state that Ms Richardson announced last year in what she then called the 'mother of all budgets'. Many of these were amended or withdrawn because of public protest or because they were considered unworkable. Among the few changes yesterday, the government is to boost education spending by NZDollars 100m and put an extra NZDollars 90m into employment and training schemes. The budget announced a number of new tax measures including taxing business entertainment expenditure, and taxing New Zealand residents on their worldwide income. A plan to develop the biggest exotic forest in New Zealand, in erosion-prone land on the North Island's East Cape, an area of high Maori unemployment, was also disclosed. Much of Ms Richardson's financial statement dwelt on what she termed the successes of the past year. These included cutting government spending, to a forecast 39.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 39.6 per cent, and lowering inflation to 0.8 per cent.</p>

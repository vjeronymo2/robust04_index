			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 18 Apr--On 18 April, the prime minister  announced that the elections to parish councils would be held on  19 June. The elections are to be held according to the old  electoral law passed in 1990, Ewa Wachowicz, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak's press secretary, told PAP.    The prime minister has ordered that the elections be held  without waiting for the president to make his decision--a few  days ago the president announced that he would veto the new  electoral law (passed by the Sejm on 18 March)--and without  waiting for the Sejm, which can reject the president's veto by a  majority of two-thirds of the votes. The president has until 21  April to make his decision.    The most important difference between the two laws is the  threshold where proportional representation applies. According  to the old law, the threshold is 40,000 citizens, and, according  to the new one, the threshold stands at 15,000 citizens.</p>

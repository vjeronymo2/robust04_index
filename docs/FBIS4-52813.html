			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- As part of its efforts to  cope with diplomatic and trade challenges in the post-Uruguay  Round era, the government will recruit more negotiating experts  -- perhaps as many as 15 percent of the successful examinees  taking the yearly state diplomatic service test.    Reporting to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)  Thursday, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said the Ministry  will expand its special recruitment program to strengthen its  language ability and international economic and trade expertise.    Revising the current inefficient qualification procedures of  the supernumerary appointment system, Hong said the written test  for English and law will be replaced by curriculum vitae  screening and interviews.    The Ministry may also introduce thesis testing in English  and  economics for the exam's second round, requiring that the  economics questions be answered in English as well.    In order to make the most of Korea's overseas missions, the  Ministry is to set up computer linkages with the Korea Trade  Promotion Corp. (KOTRA), the Korea Foreign Trade Association  (KFTA), the Bank of Korea and other organizations with offices  abroad.    Noting the government's trade channels are scattered among  60  divisions in 20 agencies, the Ministry will seek to absorb all  trade negotiating power to provide for consistent and effective  decision- making and implementation.    To raise the diplomatic force's efficiency, the government  will reduce overseas missions to 130 or 135 from the current  141. It will also refrain from posting grade-three or higher  officials from other government agencies than the Foreign  Ministry in overseas missions to prevent abuse of manpower and  budget.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: PUNCHING HOLES IN NO-ZONE  </P> <P> Open letter to NFL coaches:  </P> <P> Dear Sirs,  </P> <P> Stop me if you've heard this. Don't say, "Uh-oh, here he comes again with his  dumb recommendations." But will you do me a favor? Will you take that nickel or  dime defense you put so much faith in, bag it, and drop it in the Los Angeles  River? And hold it under till it's gone?  </P> <P> Oh, I know. I can hear you sighing right now and see you looking at me  pityingly. I've seen that look, the one that says, "Look, creep, why don't you  stick to adverbs and adjectives? You just don't understand football."  </P> <P> What's to understand? You don't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to add up  touchdowns. That "soft zone" is going to put Joe Montana in the Hall of Fame.  Also, probably, John Elway and Phil Simms. Oh, I know. Coaches from George  Allen to John Robinson have been enamored of that five-and-10-cent store  defense. You know, the one where you peel back as many as seven or nine  defenders on pass plays, the theory being that no one can complete a pass  through that forest of defenders. The Maginot Line theory.  </P> <P> I know you say the public doesn't get the whole picture.  </P> <P> But I see, game after game, where your method doesn't work. It kind of reminds  me of some years ago when a colleague of mine was covering the missile beat for  a national magazine. It was before Star Wars but it was when the government was  trying to perfect an antiballistic-missile system.  </P> <P> "What are its chances?" I asked my co-worker.  </P> <P> He sighed. "Well," he said, "think of it as you in a pitch-dark hallway and  someone is throwing needles at you and you have to throw needles back at them  that will meet those needles head-on in midair and knock them down."  </P> <P> Forgive me, but I have to think that's what you guys are trying to do.  </P> <P> Take the Ram game Sunday. Before the game, the coach said he was going to try  to neutralize the Philadelphia quarterback, Randall Cunningham, with a soft  zone. English translation: no rush.  </P> <P> Well, personally, I couldn't look. I happen to think the soft zone should be  called the twilight zone. You remember what happened. With 1:50 to play in the  first half, the Philadelphia quarterback got the ball on his own 32 and went  through the Ram soft zone like a knife through hot butter. In fact, there were  still 34 seconds to play after the Eagles had scored.  </P> <P> It happens all the time. It happens too often to be coincidence. It is an  absolute indictment of the "prevent" or "nickel" defense. The so-called  "two-minute offense" is really the two-minute defense. It requires the absolute  cooperation of the defense.  </P> <P> Recall with me the night the New Orleans Saints had rushed the pants off the  49ers' Joe Montana for 58 minutes 10 seconds. Suddenly, with 1:50 to go and  Montana with the ball in his own territory, they changed strategy. I remember  thinking at the time, "Oh, my God, they've peeled back! Montana will kill  them!"  </P> <P> He did. All Montana needed was a field goal. Duck soup for him. He just stood  there, licking his lips. In about three plays he was in field goal range, and  the 49ers won.  </P> <P> I get cynical watching two teams struggle manfully all night to put nine points  or so on the board and then, all of a sudden, scores are flying around like  popcorn in the final two minutes. There has to be a reason. The quarterback  didn't suddenly get better with two minutes to go. The defense just got worse.  </P> <P> In addition to everything else, the nickel-dime defense makes it easier to run  on. Recall Cunningham in that drive before the half Sunday, looking over the  line of scrimmage, seeing no one open but nobody but the pathetic pass rush in  front of him. And he took off and ran 27 yards before backpedaling defenders  could put on the brakes and come up and get him.  </P> <P> Murray's Law is, a quarterback without a limp can help himself to 10 or 15  yards in an obvious passing situation any time he wants.  </P> <P> I can recall the late Red Sanders, as good a coach as I have ever known, on the  subject of pass defense. "No quarterback can throw the ball successfully flat  on his back," he said.  </P> <P> Sanders' tactic was no soft zone but rather a hard rush he used to call Omaha  -- a whole line coming in like cops raiding a crap game. It worked. Ask John  Brodie, who was with Stanford at the time. John still has grass stains on his  backside from that one.  </P> <P> I remember John Unitas once telling me he figured he had 3.5 seconds to get rid  of the ball on a pass play. That was in those days. They had a pass rush in  those days. I recall Dutch Van Brocklin when he was coach of the Vikings, after  a trying afternoon trying to cope with the Rams' front four. Dutch came into  the locker room, muttering darkly, "They better never lose that pass rush."  </P> <P> They don't have pass rushes today. They just kind of send a token force. No  more Fearsome Foursomes. They're Tentative Threesomes today. Quarterbacks get  five, 10, 15 seconds to throw today. You give John Elway or Joe Montana -- or  even Randall Cunningham -- 10 seconds and he'll throw it through a keyhole for  you.  </P> <P> As I say, I don't know whether I should bother to wise you guys up. Football  games are a lot more fun and excitement this way. A touchdown lead with a  minute to play doesn't mean a thing.  </P> <P> I realize I have a lot of chutzpah trying to tell professionals how to run  their business. I just feel it's my civic duty. You're right, I don't know how  a zone defense works. All I know is, it doesn't.  </P></p>

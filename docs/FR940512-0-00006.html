This rule also increases the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. Authorization of this budget enables the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur operating expenses, collect funds to pay those expenses, and settle indemnification claims during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. Authorization of the increase in the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year enables the Committee to collect sufficient funds to pay expenses projected for the remainder of that year. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers who have signed the agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 998.407 is effective July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995.

This agreement is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12887, Civil Justice Reform. Under the agreement now in effect, peanut handlers signatory to the agreement are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the peanut agreement program are derived from such assessments, and deductible type insurance for 1994&hyph;95 indemnification expenses. This rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Committee for the crop year beginning July 1, 1994, and increases the administrative assessment rate for the crop year which began July 1, 1993. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 47,000 producers of peanuts in the 16 States covered under the agreement, and approximately 76 handlers regulated under the agreement. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of the producers may be classified as small entities, and some of the handlers covered under the agreement are small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the agreement, the assessment rate for a particular crop year applies to all assessable tonnage handled from the beginning of such year (i.e., July 1). An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of peanuts. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel for program operations and, thus, are in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed at industry-wide meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to provide input in recommending the budget, assessment rate, and indemnification reserve. The handlers of peanuts who are directly affected have signed the marketing agreement authorizing the expenses that may be incurred and the imposition of assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected receipts and acquisitions of farmers' stock peanuts. It applies to all assessable peanuts received or acquired by handlers from July 1, 1994. Because that rate is applied to actual receipts and acquisitions, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

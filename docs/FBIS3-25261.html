			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   ANC Relationship With Irish Newspaper Group -- Johannesburg  THE CITIZEN in English on 11 February in its page-6 editorial  finds it "deplorable" that the Argus company decided to sell its  major newspaper interests to Mr. Tony O'Reilly's Independent  Newspapers Plc of Ireland. The paper notes that O'Reilly  "hosted ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela  at his home in the Bahamas at Christmas and New Year," and it  would be "stretching credulity to the limit if we were asked to  believe that they did not discuss the possibility of a bid by Mr  O'Reilly for Argus. Or that Mr O'Reilly did not establish ahead  of time that the takeover would not be blocked by the ANC when  it became the government." THE CITIZEN believes O'Reilly's  relationship with the ANC has "raised fears that he will  influence the future policy of the group, making these  newspapers even more willing to promote the ANC than they are  now."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   FA Must Not Deny Others Right To Vote -- By embarking on an  election boycott strategy, the Freedom Alliance (FA) members  "risk being marginalised," warns a page-12 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 14 February. "Whether they  like it or not, the new government will be regarded by the vast  majority of South Africa and the outside world as legitimate and  representative." Although the FA is entitled to pursue the  boycott option, "the reverse applies equally." "People have the  right to vote and provide South Africa with its first  democratically elected government."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Election Nonparticipation FA Bargaining Chip -- Referring to  a confidential Freedom Alliance document on strategic options  "`leaked'" to the press, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on  14 February in a page-4 editorial remarks that the alliance  tactics "are absolutely dependent on using threatened  nonparticipation as the main bargaining chip to obtain the best  deal possible." However, the document shows that the alliance's  members are "too divided on policy to contest the election as a  united front," and that "secession is not an option." This  leaves the alliance only the choice between "a passive boycott  of the election and the `new South Africa', or an active  campaign against them, with the latter more likely. It may be  disruptive, but it offers little long-term security for alliance  supporters."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Negotiations With Freedom Alliance `Exercise in Futility' --  "It is apparent from documentation recently made public that the  sometimes desperate negotiations held with the Freedom Alliance  have been an exercise in futility," begins a page-8 editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 February. "The trilateral  talks between the FA, the ANC and the Government could not be  allowed to succeed because it meant submission to the one thing  the alliance's members feared most -- the April elections."  "While it is owed to the people of this country to use all  possible means to achieve a settlement, there comes a time when  certain hard realities and challenges must be faced squarely."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Detention-Without-Trial Remains--"The delay by the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC) in implementing the repeal  of the obnoxious section 29 of the Internal Security Act -- the  detention-without- trial clause -- is profoundly disturbing,"  says a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 10  February. The TEC's law and order subcouncil "has not yet even  considered the issue and Section 29, inexplicably, remains in  force, in spite of Parliament's repeal of the measure. The lame  excuses offered raise serious questions about the commitment of  the major TEC parties, the NP [National Party] and the ANC  alliance, in upholding civil liberties."</p>

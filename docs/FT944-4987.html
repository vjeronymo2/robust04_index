			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Leading Article: The danger of a cold peace If any such warning was still needed, President Boris Yeltsin's blunt words at the CSCE summit in Budapest yesterday gave notice that the post-cold war honeymoon is over. He angrily rejected the plans of the Nato alliance to expand to the east, without including Russia itself, and warned that Europe was in danger of sliding from the cold war into a 'cold peace'. President Bill Clinton's rejoinder, that no country would be allowed a veto on Nato enlargement, sounds all very well. But it is his administration's determination to accelerate that process which has infuriated Moscow. It suggests that the Nato allies in general, and the US in particular, have greatly underestimated Russian sensitivity to being left out in the cold once again. Of course the western allies should not indefinitely appease the Russian government which, in spite of its unpredictable vacillations in matters of economic reform, has proved that it remains a tough and sophisticated player of international diplomacy. Its tactic has been to remain persistently ambiguous, extract concessions, and then still fail to deliver its part of the bargain. That is what Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, did yet again in Brussels last week, when he refused to finalise plans for a military co-operation programme with Nato. Yet the west must at the same time understand and respond to the extraordinary sensitivity of a humbled superpower, whose economy is in tatters and whose proud military establishment is grumbling and potentially mutinous. It was precisely to reconcile the conflicting demands of the central and east Europeans for full Nato membership, while keeping the Russians slightly more at arm's length, that the Partnership for Peace programme was devised: a half-way house to enlargement, and a deliberate fudge. It remains valid today, and full Nato membership for the central and east Europeans should not be over-hasty. Indeed, the US urge to accelerate the process seems counter-productive. Is it really sensible to extend a security guarantee up to the former Soviet borders - indeed up to the Russian frontier, if the Baltic states are included - which Washington itself is unlikely to implement? What the central and east Europeans really need today is economic security, not military defence. Access to western markets, followed by full membership of the European Union, is therefore a far more urgent priority than full Nato membership. It is also a process which is much easier for the Russians to accept. Indeed, Moscow has been positively enthusiastic about Finland's prospective EU membership, precisely because it will bring the Union to its very borders. It means that western Europe will become more aware of the economic development needs of Russia itself, and more willing to contribute, the Russians believe. If the EU continues along its path of strengthening the European defence pillar of Nato through the Western European Union, future east European members of the EU will be getting enhanced military security through the back door. It will lack the US security guarantee, but that seems unrealistic anyway. There is no doubt that the EU enlargement process to the east will itself prove extremely difficult, not just for the east Europeans, but for the current members too, who will have to pay for it. They have barely started to calculate the cost, nor to define what reforms will be needed. But it is the right road forward, and one which will not cause Europe simply to slide into a 'cold peace'.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Turbulent activists worry Tories Senior Tories are becoming increasingly worried about the display of 'people power' which forced Mr Tim Yeo to resign as environment minister after an extra-marital affair which produced a child. The fear is that the campaign by Suffolk party members to force Mr Yeo to quit will lead to pressure for a bigger role for constituency activists. This has long been resisted by the party leadership, which has sought to maintain tight central control. Close associates of Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, believe that the Suffolk outburst was prompted by personal animosity between Mr Yeo and local party officials. But influential backbenchers say the affair has set an important precedent because no other Tory minister has been forced to resign by constituency pressure. 'This raises all kinds of complex questions about who is responsible for what in the party,' said one senior MP. There was also concern that more powerful constituency associations could be targets for extremist groups. These have occasionally infiltrated local party organisations in the past. A backbencher said: 'If we are going to be dependent on individuals, then who knows what groups will try to take control of constituency associations to influence ministers?' The activists' success was applauded by Mr Eric Chalker, a member of the Charter Movement, which campaigns for greater democracy in the Tory party. He said: 'The desire of party members to assert themselves is steadily growing.' But the South Suffolk association appears to have achieved its place in Tory history almost by accident. The campaign leader, Mrs Aldine Horrigan, Tory mayor of Haverhill, was not available for comment yesterday. But locals say she had no intention of mounting a grassroots rebellion. Meanwhile, the possibility that Mr Yeo might be forced to resign as an MP appeared to be receding after several branches in his constituency gave him their support. Mr John Major, prime minister, is to visit President Bill Clinton in Washington in February or early March, Downing Street said yesterday.</p>

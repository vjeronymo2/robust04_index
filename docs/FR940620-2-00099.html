			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The U.S. Departments of Labor and Education are conducting separate competitions for grants to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that are prepared to implement statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems, to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> local partnerships <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that are prepared to implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, and to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> local partnerships that serve high poverty areas  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and that are also prepared to develop and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This notice announces the competition for Urban/Rural opportunities Grants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grants under this competition will be financed under title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act to enable local partnerships to begin implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in high poverty areas of urban and rural communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partnerships in high poverty areas face particular challenges in implementing School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There are few large private or public employers in high poverty areas, making it more difficult to secure employer participation, work-based learning opportunities, and career-track jobs for youth who complete a School-to-Work Opportunities program. Therefore, creative strategies must be developed to fully utilize the capacity of local institutions to include a variety of alternative work-based learning environments and to support intensive efforts to enhance diverse employer involvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Dropout rates of schools in high poverty areas in many cases are over 50 percent, and interventions to improve schools may need to begin in the elementary or middle school years. School-to-Work Opportunities programs can provide more relevant and engaging school-based and work-based activities which can encourage youth to remain in school until completion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Students at schools in high poverty areas will be poorer and may be much less aware of college opportunities than students in other areas. This, coupled with financial constraints, may make them more likely to seek immediate job placement prior to or immediately upon high school graduation, regardless of whether those jobs have potential for long-term career opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In most high poverty area neighborhoods, peer pressure is a strong force which does not necessarily promote achievement. School-to-Work Opportunities programs that offer alternative learning environments and creative approaches to academic and technical subjects can make success in school more attractive to these youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Youth in high poverty areas are likely to experience pressure from situations outside of school which may affect their performance in school. To turn around the prevailing negative forces operating on youth, School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these neighborhoods will need to be complemented by various community-wide interventions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Schools in high poverty areas are more likely to have students of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds than schools in other areas. In addition, high poverty area schools often serve a higher percentage of students with distinctive learning needs; therefore, School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these areas should be designed to meet the needs of these youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Because of the high dropout rates in many high poverty areas, there will be proportionately many more out-of-school youth in these areas than in other communities. School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives should include linkages with institutions that meet the special needs of such youth by improving their ability to make a transition into education and/or employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

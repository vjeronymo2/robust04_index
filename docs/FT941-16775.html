			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Sanctions put shoppers in front line: Yugoslavs are hunting for food and petrol across the border 'You went shopping in Hungary,' commented Mrs Mila Novakovic, peering from her Belgrade flat at the dozen plastic bags piled on the staircase. 'How much did that yellow cheese cost?' she demanded of her upstairs neighbour. Mrs Novakovic, like most Serbs, currently is weighing up whether a day of grocery shopping in the Hungarian frontier town of Szeged, about three hours away from the Serbian capital, is worth paying the new DM10 (Dollars 5.75)tax to cross the Yugoslav frontier. Strapped for cash, the Yugoslav federal government last week imposed the exit tax for each Yugoslav citizen and DM30 per vehicle. Government officials claimed the tax would help cover the costs of 'growing humanitarian needs' in the face of the 'unjust economic sanctions' imposed by the United Nations. But critics called the tariff yet another government ploy to skim some of the profits off the many black marketeers. They make daily runs across the border, returning to Yugoslavia with a wide range of wares, from jerrycans of petrol to cartons of cigarettes and medicines. Since the UN imposed sanctions on Belgrade 19 months ago for its role in the partition of Bosnia, smuggling has become one of the most profitable pastimes in Serbia. Inhabitants of Yugoslav border towns have turned to the sale of petrol. But on a more mundane level, many Yugoslavs last year did their shopping abroad. According to government estimates, some 2m people crossed the frontier in November alone. Hyperinflation, chronic shortages and unemployment left them little choice. Hard-pressed to afford black market prices for milk, cheese, and staples unavailable in Serbian stores, armed with long grocery lists and precious hard currency, people wait in queues for up to 20 hours to enter Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania or Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic. In Szeged, just 20km from the frontier, local shopkeepers grumble that Serbs are buying up everything, in particular, coffee, milk and detergent. Until the new tax, Szeged appeared a boom town. Shops were packed with Serbs and ethnic Hungarians from the Vojvodina province of Serbia. The Serbian economy has been devastated by financing nearly three years of war and by the effects of sanctions. Inflation in December ran at one million per cent. The average monthly wage has dropped to the equivalent of DM4. Most shops, except for a handful of state stores, accept only D-Marks, spurning the decimated dinar, the Yugoslav national currency. The National Bank last week chopped nine zeroes off the dinar, just two months after the last six. Five hundred billion dinars became 500, which yesterday was worth four pfennigs. In spite of the national mint working overtime, dinars were all but impossible to find in the run-up to the Orthodox Christmas celebration. Back from shopping in Hungary, Yugoslav clerks at the exchange bank kindly advised travellers to drive to the nearest town to convert their hard currency into dinars at a local cafe at the unofficial rate. 'If we had dinars, you would lose a lot of money - the rate here would be 50 per cent below the street rate,' they said. This week, after the exit tax was introduced, the motorway from the Hungarian border to Belgrade was nearly deserted, except for the occasional police checkpoints. Traffic has dwindled since the sanctions, which includes an oil embargo. Black marketeers were positioned along the road hawking cannisters of petrol and diesel stacked on car roof racks in the shadows of the long January night. Their earnings increased this week as petrol soared to DM4 per litre in the New Year. On the return trip, toll booth operators waved drivers through if they said they had no dinars. The paltry toll of 500 dinars was evidently not worth the bother. The few cars driving down the misty road were laden with bulky packages of toilet paper, bottles of coca-cola, and sugar which, in many cases, hid cannisters of petrol. Looking over the rims of spectacles, Mrs Novakovic sighed about the high price of salami in Belgrade. 'I never would have considered waiting for a day to buy milk, but what else can I do?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social </F> Democracy Party of Romania, by Mihai Fabian; place and date not  given: "We Envisaged a Long-Term Government Formula"]    [Text] [Fabian] Mr. President, will we or will we not  have a new government by 1 March? If yes, what will be its  "color"?    [Gherman] Prime Minister Vacaroiu is the most authorized  person to answer this question. We voted confidence in Prime  Minister Vacaroiu and suggested that he should make certain  changes to the current government formula. Therefore, we will  not have a new government, but it is very likely that we will  have a government reshuffle by 1 March 1994.    [Fabian] It is said that this government will be a coalition  between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and PUNR  [Romanian National Unity Party].    [Gherman] We would be slightly anticipating things if we  were to make such an affirmation. Even from the protocol  concluded with PUNR, it has resulted that it is not strictly  necessary to have a government that includes members of  political formations but members recommended by certain  political formations. Nevertheless, we agreed that among the  recommended persons, there should be a competition of  professionalism. Therefore, if PUNR recommends a person who  exceptionally fulfills all the conditions in those areas that we  believe the government's activity was less than efficient, then  we will accept that person. If you carefully read the protocol  with PUNR, you will see that the fundamental criteria is  professionalism. Therefore, it is not excluded that  modifications might be made to the current structure of the  government and it is not excluded that people recommended by  PUNR might be included in the government. Regarding the  respective person's affiliation to a party, the problem is a  little more complex because this issue is not a clause  specifically stipulated neither in the protocol nor in our  understandings.    [Fabian] Thus, people recommended by PUNR might become  government members. Could it happen that none of the new  members would belong to PUNR?    [Gherman] This has not been requested in the protocol.    [Fabian] Has PUNR not insisted on this issue?    [Gherman] I cannot disclose any more information in this  discussion. Certainly, we thought about the variation that the  recommended people should be PUNR members, but, precisely in  order to give a broader scope to proposals, we agreed that the  respective people should be recommended by PUNR.    [Fabian] Were there ministries about which more heated  discussions were held, in the sense that the PDSR would have  liked to maintain control over those sectors that are believed  to be key sectors? Does PUNR in turn wish to obtain certain  ministries?    [Gherman] The biggest mistake that a politician could make  would be to publicly reveal intentions referring to certain  proposed moves. Everyone is curious. Everyone would like to  know whether the changes we are going to make will affect  education, culture, or finance. However, such a thing is  announced the moment the change has been carried out. There is  no country in the world where various aspects of a business,  banking operations, or issues connected with the government are  announced to the public before the changes have been made.  Thus, no matter how much sympathy I would feel toward your  newspaper and you personally, and even if I knew exactly what  changes are going to be made, it would be a real mistake to  disclose them before the change itself has been carried out.    [Fabian] A new formula for a government reshuffle has been  negotiated. Has the durability of the new government formula  been discussed, or has it been viewed as a team that should  ensure the process of transition until appropriate conditions  are created for more fundamental, ample, and even more open  discussions with the opposition?    [Gherman] We have not negotiated a stage, while keeping the  next one in mind. We discussed these aspects with the parties  that are included in the government in order to resolve the  problem of governing. If the respective solutions prove to be  very efficient, it means that we have no reason to think about  them as short-term solutions. Thus, we have not established a  certain trial period or a limited period of time for this  solution. On the contrary, we wanted it to be a long-term  solution. Thus, this is not a transition government, a  government that should ensure that we cross the bridge. It is a  government that we envisaged as a long-term one.    [Fabian] When the new government is established, it has to  do its job. It needs parliamentary support. In the light of  the latest stand taken by the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and  the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], it is difficult to believe  that the PDSR will continue to enjoy the necessary parliamentary  support. Some percents are missing. Have you thought about  getting them from somewhere else?    [Gherman] Your hypothesis is erroneous. Namely, I do not  believe in nor do I foresee any modifications in the option of  the PRM and the PSM. I do not believe they will join the  opposition to form a parliamentary opposition -- at least that  is how I see things, even if in both cases negotiations on a new  government formula have been suspended.    [Fabian] The conditions under which the government continues  its activity are unusual. There is talk about accepting an  austerity program. What are the measures that the PDSR is  proposing to take in order to attenuate as much as possible the  deterioration of its prestige?    [Gherman] In our government program, we propose to reduce  the effects of this austerity program to a minimum. We are  certain that by the end of 1994, the country's economic  situation will have improved considerably, which will implicitly  lead to an improvement of people's living standard.    [Fabian] During your discussions, have you thought of the  possibility that the new government team might be able to settle  the conflict with the trade unions and ensure credibility abroad?    [Gherman] We have constantly maintained cooperative  relations with all the trade union confederations. First of  all, we have taken note of all viewpoints regarding the  credibility of a government reshuffled in accordance with the  views expressed by those trade union confederations. There has  been a constant, substantial exchange of information, opinions,  suggestions, and even certain variations that were presented by  both partners.    As far as credibility abroad is concerned, I have learned a  very tough lesson -- namely that credibility abroad can only be  achieved through credibility at home. If we work better and  more efficiently, we will achieve better economic results and,  thus, eliminate embarrassing elements from our relations with  other countries. Our credibility will be ensured. Here is an  example: If we eliminate all acts of chauvinism and  anti-Semitism, and condemn such attitudes, if we try to maintain  a temperate and democratic atmosphere in our country, and, at  the same time, prove the efficiency of our government, then our  credibility is ensured. We will have to overcome a superficial  aspect of identifying certain parties with certain people. If  you study the documents that have been signed by us, including  the protocol with PUNR, you will realize that these are in  complete and total agreement with the requirements of the  Council of Europe, as well as the European Community.  Therefore, one can take substantial steps forward and they will  certainly be noticed by our foreign partners.</p>

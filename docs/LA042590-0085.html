			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENT SEIZED BY FBI AS ALLEGED SITE OF RAMPANT DRUG SALES;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE ACTION REPORTEDLY IS THE FIRST SUCH CONFISCATION IN THE  CITY. OFFICIALS SAY THE BUILDING OWNER TOOK PART IN NARCOTICS DEALS.  </P> <P> FBI agents Tuesday seized ownership of a nine-unit apartment complex in  Westchester that authorities said had been the site of rampant drug sales.  </P> <P> The move marked the first time that federal drug laws had been used to  confiscate an apartment building in Los Angeles, according to City Atty. James  K. Hahn.  </P> <P> Hahn said authorities believe that the owner, John Eckert, 32, "knew about,  condoned and participated in" the sale of cocaine by some tenants in the  run-down apartment building at 5400 W. 99th Place.  </P> <P> Since last July, Hahn said, Los Angeles police have made 19 arrests at the site  on a variety of drug-related charges. "There is evidence that the owner was  accepting cocaine as payment for the rent," Hahn said.  </P> <P> The apartment building was seized under a federal law that allows the  confiscation of property belonging to those who encourage or facilitate the  sale of drugs. The FBI and Los Angeles police cooperated in the investigation.  </P> <P> Eckert was arrested March 27 on charges of being under the influence of cocaine  -- a misdemeanor -- after police raided his apartment and another unit and  confiscated 8.1 grams of rock cocaine. Two other tenants were later arrested  for buying cocaine at the site.  </P> <P> When Eckert failed to appear for his arraignment on the charges last week in  Los Angeles Municipal Court, a warrant was issued for his arrest, Hahn said. On  Tuesday, Eckert was arrested on the warrant and was being held in jail in lieu  of $8,000 bail.  </P> <P> Neighbors on the residential street just a mile northeast of Los Angeles  International Airport expressed relief that the government had seized the  property. They said car thefts and shootings had become routine as drug dealers  and users descended on the apartment complex.  </P> <P> "Just like the planes go by every day, you could count on hearing the gunshots  once or twice a week," said Diane Gayles, who lives across the street from the  building. "If (the landlords) don't want their property in trouble, they  shouldn't do these things."  </P> <P> One 22-year-old tenant of the building said a man had assaulted her and stolen  her purse last week as she entered her first-floor apartment. The woman, who  asked that her name not be published, said she hoped calm would return to the  street. "I'm glad," she said. "It's a relief."  </P> <P> After police raided the apartment building and seized the cocaine, the city  went to federal court, where a magistrate authorized the seizure of the  building on April 17.  </P> <P> With the seizure, the building becomes the property of the U.S. government.  Hahn said Eckert may choose to contest the seizure in court. In the meantime,  federal marshals will operate the building and collect rent until a property  manager is found to run the building, Hahn explained.  </P> <P> For now, tenants will be allowed to remain in the building but should they  engage in the use or sale of drugs, they can be prosecuted and evicted.  </P> <P> Acting Assistant U.S. Atty. William Cullen, who filed the action to seize the  building, said some of the residents were confused by the change in ownership.  </P> <P> "Basically, we told them, 'The building has just been taken over by the federal  government. Please don't make your rent payment to Mr. Eckert. Make your checks  payable to the U.S. marshals,' " Cullen said.  </P> <P> The two-story building eventually will be sold, Hahn said, with the proceeds  divided among Los Angeles police and the FBI, with the LAPD getting about 90%  of the money. In the last year, $7 million has been channeled to the LAPD from  similar property seizures.  </P> <P> Federal forfeiture laws have been used to confiscate automobiles, boats and  airplanes belonging to those arrested on drug-related charges since 1984. The  laws have also been used to confiscate apartment buildings in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Hahn said authorities in Los Angeles had not seized apartment buildings before  Tuesday's action because of the difficulty in proving the landlords' link to  drug-related criminal activity.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- U.S. citizen  Ramon Rissin, the Summer Linguistic Institute's security chief,  has been kidnapped by guerrillas in Meta Department in southern  Colombia, military sources confirmed today. The Army's 7th  Brigade reported that Rissin was relaxing at a resort hacienda  in Puerto Lleras, some 300 km from Santa Fe de Bogota, when he  was abducted by six men who identified themselves as  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, members.    With Rissin's abduction, the number of U.S. citizens  kidnapped by FARC in Meta increases to three. In January,  guerrillas took missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck  hostage while at a camp near Villavicencio.    The Army report says that FARC political propaganda was  found  at the site where Rissin was taken captive. The FARC is  Colombia's largest and oldest rebel organization. "We can  confirm Rissin's kidnapping, but we do not know the reasons for  it," a 7th Brigade source said. He added that a special  operation was mounted in the area to try to find Rissin.    On 3 March, National Liberation Army, ELN, guerrillas  released, safe and sound, U.S. citizen Manning Lowis, who had  been taken captive in the jungle of Choco Department, on the  border with Panama, one year earlier. The FARC and ELN are part  of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Guerrilla Board, CGSB, which  two years ago abandoned the peace negotiations with the  Colombian Government in Tlaxcala, Mexico.</p>

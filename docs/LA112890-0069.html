Lifland followed testimony by Martin R. Shugrue  Jr., the airline's bankruptcy trustee, that requiring Eastern to come to court  every time it needed money dramatically hurt business and the carrier's chances  for survival.  </P> <P> "This is a major victory for Eastern Airlines and a major victory for its  18,000 employees and a major victory for the American traveling public,"  Shugrue said after an hourlong hearing. "Passengers can book with confidence."  </P> <P> In his testimony, Shugrue had complained that when hearings were held earlier  this month on the airline's request to draw $30 million from an escrow account,  the adverse publicity nearly killed advanced bookings, costing Eastern $36  million.  </P> <P> At that time and again on Tuesday, Eastern's unsecured creditors argued that  the airline should be liquidated.  </P> <P> "Eastern is not reorganizable," said the attorney for the creditors committee,  Joel B. Zweibel. "It is not a viable, stand-alone airline." Zweibel said the  carrier was still losing $2 million daily.  </P> <P> Judge Lifland said "tension exists" between the two parties and agreed that the  airline's chances to remain viable were better served if it did not have to  come back to court every time it needed money.  </P> <P> He also criticized the creditors for contributing to the bad publicity by  seeking liquidation and by leaking information to the media.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Lifland ordered that $15 million of the released funds be set  aside for Eastern to make deposits with credit card companies that are  breathing down its neck. Shugrue said American Express had already required  Eastern to make a $10-million deposit as "cash-up-front money" to cover  customer ticket purchases. Other credit card companies are about to do the  same, Shugrue said.  </P> <P> The $135 million for day-to-day operating expenses includes $15 million which  the judge previously had said would be paid out to the airline on Dec. 3. Two  weeks ago, Lifland allowed Eastern to take $30 million from its escrow account,  which holds funds it has realized from the sale of assets since declaring  Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, 1989.  </P> <P> Even with the judge's vote of confidence in Shugrue's management, observers'  assessments of Eastern's chances for survival were mixed.  </P> <P> "Instead of going back and asking the judge for money all the time, they have  to generate cash from their business," said Edmund Greenslet, a Florida-based  analyst. "I think Eastern can reach the point where it can generate cash in a  reasonable period of time."  </P> <P> But Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., an  investment house, said efforts to rescue the Miami-based carrier were wasted.  </P> <P> "Put Eastern to rest," he said. "Competition should not be held back. There is  too much capacity," he said, and Eastern's competitors could readily absorb its  passengers if the carrier is allowed to fold.  </P></p>

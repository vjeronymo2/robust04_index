			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Bush team urged to halt talks on trade SENATOR Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, called on the Bush administration yesterday to halt the Uruguay Round of trade talks 'until the Clinton team is fully consulted and has input on the negotiations'. The senator, who has advised President-elect Bill Clinton on other trade matters, said that, because the recently concluded US-EC oilseeds agreement was 'almost meaningless', he had 'no faith in the ability and willingness' of the Bush administration to conclude agreements in other areas. Mr Clinton has indicated his support for continued negotiations by the Bush administration. But his supporters are divided on the issue of trade, between those who want to see the Uruguay Round finished swiftly and those who want Mr Clinton to take office and make significant changes in a compromise text introduced by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, which is now the basis for negotiation. Senator Baucus said the text was not acceptable to Congress as it endangered domestic trade laws, 'does little' on intellectual property rights, and 'potentially exposes US environmental laws to unwarranted challenge'.</p>

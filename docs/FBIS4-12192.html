			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Hammud Munsir in Aden and Lutfi Shatarah in </F> London: "Yemeni Diplomat Obstructs Arms Deal Between Sanaa and  Warsaw"]    [Excerpt] Muhammad Sharaf, the Yemeni charge d'affaires in  the Polish capital Warsaw, has obstructed an arms deal worth  hundreds of millions of dollars which the northern leadership in  Sanaa was arranging through a contract between the Economic and  Military Foundation, whose name has recently been changed to the  Yemeni Economic Foundation, and the Polish Arms and Foreign  Trade Company.    The deal included what has been described as  "internationally  banned fragmentation bombs," aircraft, spare parts, and various  types of other weapons including light ammunition.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the charge d'affaires  refused to grant visas to five of the Polish company's senior  sales officials. He also informed the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] leadership in Aden of the situation on the grounds that  the deal was part of the military repercussions of the Yemeni  political crisis and that it would undermine Yemen's national  Army.    Colonel 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director of the Yemeni  Economic  and Military Foundation, had sent a letter to Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah in Sanaa asking him to grant the  delegation a visa to enable it to complete the agreement on the  deal, but Sharaf refused to carry out the foreign minister's  instructions and the visit was suspended. The delegation was  supposed to arrive in the Yemeni capital on 6 April.    YSP officials in Aden have raised questions about the source  of funds for such a deal and also about the attitude of the  Foreign Ministry or rather about the way the Yemeni leadership  used that ministry, bearing in mind that Basindwah had issued a  circular to all Yemeni diplomatic missions instructing them to  refrain from any actions that would reflect partisan views and  urged foreign states to deal directly with the Foreign Ministry.    Yemeni sources have confirmed that Sanaa has recently opened  two offices for the purchase of arms in the Russian capital  Moscow and the Ukrainian capital Kiev. In a telephone statement  to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in London, they said that a well-known  Yemeni businessman was supervising the Moscow office and  negotiating contracts on behalf of the north Yemeni leadership  with the Russian authorities, some covering 60 fragmentation  bombs, each worth $350,000, as well as missiles which have been  shipped to al-Hudaydah port through Bulgaria.    The sources said that Muhammad Sharaf, the Yemeni charge  d'affaires in Warsaw, contacted the home of Yemeni Mrime  Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attass in the evening of the day  before yesterday while the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue  Committee was in session, and informed him of the matter.  Al-'Attas then reported what he heard directly to the Dialogue  Committee. [passage omitted]</p>

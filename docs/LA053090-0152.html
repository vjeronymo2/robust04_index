			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITON ASSAILS JEWISH SETTLERS  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today it is wrong for Soviet Jews  to settle on Israeli-occupied Arab land.  </P> <P> Speaking shortly before leaving London on an official visit to Jordan and Saudi  Arabia, Hurd said: "We have worked for a long time to help the Jews leave the  Soviet Union. They've been suffering a great injustice.  </P> <P> "But what we say to them and to the Israelis is, 'Don't correct one injustice  by creating another.' It isn't right. It's not just, that Jews should go from  the Soviet Union and settle in the occupied territories."  </P> <P> Israeli Immigration Minister Yitzhak Peretz was quoted Tuesday as saying the  migration would reach 250,000 this year.  </P></p>

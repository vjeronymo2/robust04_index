			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The newly-launched cabinet  of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has a 47 percent public approval  rating, a sharp decrease of 24 percentage points from a poll  taken just after last August's inauguration of the cabinet of  his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, an ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper  poll showed Wednesday [11 May]. The ASAHI said the public  disapproval rate for the Hata cabinet was 32 percent.    The national daily added that the initial support rate for  the Hata cabinet is 10 percentage points lower than the approval  rate for the Hosokawa cabinet's last stage as scored by the  ASAHI survey in February. The ASAHI said a new cabinet usually  holds a higher approval rating than that for the last stage of  the previous cabinet.    The newspaper conducted its nationwide survey of 3,000  eligible voters on Sunday and Monday. The response rate was 80  percent.    Only 19 percent of the respondents expected brighter  political prospects with the establishment of a minority  government, down 24 percentage points from the September survey  last year, it said.    Regarding the next general election, 11 percent of those  polled supported an immediate general election even before the  Diet's passage of the government-proposed fiscal 1994 draft  budget.    Twenty-three percent called for a general election under the  current electoral system as soon as the Diet approves the draft  budget, the ASAHI reported, while 26 percent said the general  election should be conducted after the new electoral system  takes effect. Some 31 percent said an early general election is  not necessary, according to the survey.    The public support rate for the Japan New Party led by  former  Prime Minister Hosokawa plummeted to 5 percent, a decrease of 7  percentage points from February.    The Shinseito of Prime Minister Hata gained a 14 percent of  approval rating, an increase of 3 percentage points from  February. [sentence as received]    The Social Democratic Party, which pulled out of the  coalition, scored a 15 percent support rate, an increase of 2  percentage points from February.    The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party got a 34  percent  approval rating, a slight increase of 1 percentage point from  February, the ASAHI added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" on interview with Chen Jiyuan, director of </F> the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Rural  Development, by staff reporter Sun Hanting (1327 3352 0080):  "Chen Jiyuan Discusses Current Deep-Seated Problems Facing  China's Agriculture"]    [Text] What are the deep-seated problems facing China's  agriculture? How can we solve these problems? In an interview  with this magazine, Chen Jiyuan, expressed the following  viewpoints. 1. We should thoroughly change our basic attitude  toward agriculture and the peasants. For a long time, the  peasants have been required to contribute grain and various  kinds of farm produce. All the more, the agricultural  accumulation fund has been turned into an industrial  accumulation fund and rural accumulation fund has been turned  into an industrial development fund by means of scissors  differences. Now that we have put forward the "grain sack  project" and the "vegetable basket project," our starting point  is to take them as key moves to ensure supply and curb  inflation. Our starting point is still on how to stabilize the  cities and solve the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket"  problems of urban residents. It is of course necessary to raise  this issue. However, if we only think of solving the problems  of the urban residents without taking into consideration the  peasants' benefits and their "money bag" problem, i.e. their  income problem, then the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket"  problems will not be solved once and for all. For a long time,  there has actually been a sharp contradiction in rural work,  that is, the state needs grain while the peasants need income.  The peasants are required to fulfill the task of supplying  grain but the problem of their income is often neglected. We  can say that this is the most deep-seated problem facing China's  agriculture. If we only think of urban needs, urban stability,  and the interests of urban residents; keep asking the peasants  for supplies without thinking of giving them anything; and if we  do not set to work to solve this problem but let things continue  like this, it will be difficult for agriculture to continue to  grow steadily. Although we can practice the responsibility  system for leaders at all levels and make it the obligation and  duty of the peasants to grow grain, it can only help solve the  problem for the time being and cannot solve the fundamental  problems facing China's agriculture.    2. We should raise our understanding of the strategical  position of agriculture in the national economy. We should say  our leaders at all levels have talked enough about the  importance of agriculture. They have talked about it for  decades from the 1950's till now. However, the guiding  principle and policies of the central authorities have not been  implemented. So, there is a deep-seated problem here, i.e. for  a long time we have overlooked the strategy for agricultural  development.    The practice of using the goal of quadrupling the GNP by the  end of this century as a principal index for assessing the  achievements made by local governments and cadres is worth  discussing. It is a main factor in causing the tendency to  neglect agriculture because agriculture has the lowest  comparative advantage and its total output value is also the  lowest as compared with other industries. To achieve a lot and  to be successful, localities and cadres, of course, will take  firm hold of the industry having high output value. Agriculture  is undoubtedly put in a negligible position because of its low  output value. In the past, we always published the growth rate  of the total output value of all provinces and cities in  newspapers at the end of each year. Those cadres whose province  or city fell behind would feel the pressure. When this pressure  changed into action, these cadres would neglect agriculture.  So, we must change the practice of assessing the achievements  of localities and cadres by means of quotas and break away from  the assessment method of using growth rate of total output value  as a key indicator and an important basis. If we do not proceed  from this, it will not be possible to solve the problem of  neglecting agriculture.    Besides the abovementioned reason, there is also a  structural  aspect. For a long time past we practiced the policy that  localities were responsible for their finances. As a result,  the localities paid attention to whichever industry yielded high  profits. However, agriculture was not on their list for  consideration. That is why we should gradually solve the  structural aspect by deepening the reform.    3. It is necessary to consider whether we should change from  the practice of nurturing industry with agriculture into the  practice of supporting agriculture with industry. We should  consider whether China's economy has reached such a stage,  namely, the stage of changing from the practice of nurturing  industry with agriculture into one of supporting agriculture  with industry. In other words, we should consider whether the  time for such a change has come. It is a problem worthy of our  consideration. In the course of its development, a developing  country usually will have to go through the stage in which  agriculture nurtures industry. As industry develops and grows,  in due course it will become strong enough to support  agriculture. Then it will change into another stage. As for  the development of China, it is very clear that industrial  development has depended on and been nurtured by agricultural  accumulation for a long time. At the beginning of our  industrialization it was necessary and a way that we had to  take. Now it is time for us to take into consideration the  question whether China's economy should change into the stage of  industry supporting agriculture as our industry has grown  through decades of development. Viewed from the following three  points, the condition for such a change has initially matured.    First, fundamental changes have taken place in the  structure of industrial and agricultural output value. At the  beginning of socialist construction, industrial output value  accounted for 30 percent while agricultural output value  accounted for 70 percent. Having gone through several decades  of construction and development, industrial output value now  accounts for over 70 percent while agricultural output value  accounts for only 20-plus percent.    Second, the income disparity between urban and rural  residents has grown bigger. During the more than 10 years of  reform, the disparity was once reduced; now, however, not only  has it returned to the previous situation but it is bigger than  the disparity at the beginning of the reform, growing from over  two times to over three times. Generally, in the course of  modernization of developing countries, the disparity between  cities and countryside is around 40 percent. In the ROK, where  the disparity is the biggest, it is only around 60 percent. If  we allow the situation of undermining agriculture to go on and  fail to support agriculture with industry, it will lead to the  intensification of social contradictions.    Third, we are now in a stage of comprehensive restructuring,  changing from the system of planned economy into one of market  economy. As agriculture is an industry with a weak  constitution, its contradictions are becoming more prominent.  Under the condition of market economy, agriculture needs  support and aid from the state. Covered up by the planned  economy, the contradictions of agriculture as an industry with a  weak constitution did not manifest themselves sharply. Since  the practice of market economy, the low comparative advantage of  agriculture has been sharply reflected through the peasants  themselves. It does not mean that there were no contradictions  in the past. At that time, under the system of everybody eating  from the same big pot, this contradiction did not manifest  itself. Now, under such a new situation, if we do not shift the  economy to the stage of industry supporting agriculture in a  timely fashion, we shall not be able to meet the requirement of  making a switch-over.    In terms of the abovementioned three points, the conditions  for making a switch-over have matured. However, this is a very  big issue and, therefore, we should study and explore it well at  theoretical level in conjunction with China's reality.  Naturally, this change will be a gradual process and cannot be  completed overnight. It is now time to raise this problem as  our economy cannot always stay at the stage of agriculture  supporting industry but should move forward. I think our  understanding of this stage should be the basic starting point  for us to formulate a series of rural polices. If we still  think that we are still at the stage of agriculture supporting  industry, then we will go on developing industry at the expense  of agriculture. On the other hand, we are required to adopt a  series of measures to support agriculture if we think that the  stage of industry supporting agriculture has come.    Fourth, given the market economy, we should practice a  protective policy on agriculture and particularly on grain  production. The reason why agriculture needs protection is that  it is an industry with a weak constitution. There are two  reasons for this: 1. Agriculture mainly uses biological type  technology and, to a large extent, is subject to natural  elements. So it is difficult for it to compete with mechanical  industries which are less subject to natural elements. 2.  Agriculture is run on a small scale with a low level of  socialization. Usually, its operational units are based on  households. It is difficult for it to compete with industries  which have a high level of socialization and are managed in an  enterprise style. Therefore, under the condition of market  economy, those countries practicing market economy adopt, with  exceptions, a protective policy toward agriculture. China  should not be an exception either.    There now exists a different viewpoint which holds that  agriculture, including grain production, should be arranged in  accordance with the principle of comparative advantage. That  is, China will grow whichever crop has a high comparative  advantage and will abandon growing those crops with a low  comparative advantage. Instead, it will depend on imports. This  is not realistic. In China, grain is not an ordinary farm  product but a product of strategical significance. Therefore,  our basic standpoint is to be basically self-sufficient. Of  course, we can import for the sake of variety. There are two  reasons for us to say it is not realistic: 1. It is not  realistic from the economical point of view. The annual world  trade of grain amounts to 100 million tonnes. If China imports  a large amount of grain, it will make grain prices rocket on the  world market. 2. As a strategic product, grain has its  political significance. It is dangerous to depend on others to  feed our nation. So it is highly necessary to adopt a  protective policy toward agriculture and especially grain.    Currently, the biggest problem is that the prices of grain  and other farm produce cannot catch up with the prices of  agricultural factors of production. The peasants do not  increase their income while increasing agricultural production.  Under such circumstances, if we do not take protective  measures, it is certain that the peasants will not use, or use  less, agricultural factors of production. Enterprises producing  agricultural factors will also vent their grievances endlessly.  Chemical fertilizer plants complain about their losses and so  do agricultural machinery plants. Even though they lose money,  the peasants still cannot afford to buy them. How can they buy  if the prices of the agricultural factors of production are  raised again? A dilemma then presents itself: Who to protect?  To protect both the peasants and enterprises or just one of  them is a serious policy choice. It is difficult to protect  both. If we set limits on the prices of the agricultural  factors of production, the maximum price limit actually turns  out to be the minimum limit. All the more, the peasants should  be subsidized. The correct choice is to liberalize one, that  is, to liberalize the prices of agricultural factors of  production. Let them follow market development and enter the  market economy. Those good enterprises will survive while the  poor ones will be eliminated through competition in the market  economy. The peasants should be subsidized for the use of  machines and diesel. Moreover, we can adopt the method of  raising prices and bring into play the price leverage. In  recent years, the prices of farm produce have increased quite a  bit but, despite the present price level, they cannot offset the  cost of production. The current price of rice has risen to 0.8  to 1 yuan, which is equal to O.5 yuan in 1989 when inflation is  taken into consideration. However, it rose to 1.5 yuan in  Guangdong in 1989. It seems necessary to raise the prices of  farm produce to protect agriculture but the effects are limited  because prices cannot be raised endlessly. The prices of our  farm produce are already near the prices in international  markets. It is very difficult to raise them higher than the  prices in international markets so more consideration should be  given to the subsidy method. Another way is to offer loans. The  loans provided for the peasants should be preferential ones. We  cannot offer them loans with ordinary interest rates.  Industries can accept loans with ordinary interest rates but  not the peasants.    Fifth, we should enlarge the operational scale of  agriculture. The operational scale of our agriculture is too  small. When compared with Japan and Taiwan, let alone with  those countries with a vast territory and a sparse population,  it still has a long way to go. In Japan, it is 1.5 hectare  while in China, with households as a basic unit, it is 0.43  hectare. It is not possible to increase agricultural labor  productivity with such an operational scale. To enlarge the  operational scale of agriculture, we need to solve the problem  of transferring the surplus labor in agriculture. If we fail to  do so, it will be impossible to enlarge the scale. Without  developed nonagricultural industries and without developed  township and town enterprises, it will be difficult to enlarge  the scale. To develop township and town enterprises, we should  support labor-intensive industries and strengthen their  competitive strength.    In short, we will never solve the problems facing China's  agriculture only through emphasizing the leader responsibility  system and defining grain production as the peasants' obligation  and duty. Instead, we should give the abovementioned problems  comprehensive consideration and make a great change in our  general way of thinking and the whole policy decision. This is  an urgent demand of agriculture under the condition of market  economy. It is also a new way of thinking for tackling the  deep-seated problems facing our agriculture.</p>

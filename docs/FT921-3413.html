			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: AEG cancels agreement on Olympia AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, has cancelled its agreement to sell the German distribution and customer service operations of Olympia, the office equipment and typewriter company. Last week AEG announced a preliminary agreement to sell the business - which employs 525 people - to Mr Jurgen Sievers, a management consultant who had been advising on the restructuring at Olympia since August last year. Yesterday AEG said that, after publishing details of the disposal last week, it had discovered details about Mr Sievers' past business activities which made it unwilling to complete the sale. The Frankfurt-based company did not disclose what it had discovered about Mr Sievers. It said that it was ending his consultancy contract with the company immediately. AEG is now in talks with other parties about a possible sale of the business.</p>

The U.S. economy "remains in a steady growth trend" since it  posted a six-year high growth of 5.9 percent in its real gross  domestic product (GDP) in the final quarter of 1993, the  Japanese central bank said in its monthly overseas economic  report.    But with the strong growth increasing inflationary pressure,  the Federal Reserve Board recently announced a "preemptive"  monetary policy change, sending short- and long-term market  rates higher, the report said.    The best scenario the U.S. appears confident to attain is to  slow down real GDP growth to the 3 percent level in 1994 with  stable prices, a BOJ economist said.    But that "scenario could fail if long-term rates continue to  rise firmly," he said.    Turning to European nations, the central bank said in the  report that the British economy is maintaining a "moderate  recovery led by personal consumption."    Germany and France "have yet to grasp clear clues for an  economic recovery with domestic demand again turning stagnant  since early autumn amid continued tough labor adjustments," the  report said.    The BOJ official said both nations could see some bright  signs again in summer, particularly in Germany, where the  Bundesbank is expected to maintain its "cautious" credit easing  to support the economy while preventing inflation, he said.    Asian nations are continuing to grow strongly led by China,  the report said.    China is maintaining "high growth driven by capital  investment," posting a hectic 13 percent expansion in 1993. But  inflation also remains over 20 percent.    This was despite Beijing's efforts to stem overheating to  stop inflation.    South Korea is posting a "clearer recovery, bolstered by  increased exports and construction spending," the report said.    Other newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and countries  of  the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are  maintaining "relatively high growth on the whole, supported by  expansion of intra-regional trading and of  infrastructure-related investment."</p>

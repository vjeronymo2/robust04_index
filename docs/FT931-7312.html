			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Doubts over Art Deco icon: Campaigners concerned over the future of the listed power station will have to wait a while longer to be sure it is safe BATTERSEA Power Station, for the past four years an embarrassing symbol of the conflict between the desire to preserve the past and the commercial realities of the London property market, is going to a new owner. Campaigners concerned for its preservation will have to wait a bit longer, however, before they can be sure that its future is safe in Hong Kong hands. The property-owning Hwang family which is acquiring the site is giving no guarantees and has made it clear it will be considering all options. This could include seeking listed building consent to demolish or alter the now-derelict building. They might also decide to go ahead with a mixed-usage development. The Hwangs are consummate businessmen with an eye - like every other property developer - on the inherent value of one of the biggest development sites in inner London. For those who prefer a chunk of flat land, this site is spoiled slightly by Gilbert Scott's huge Art Deco power station which, with its four chimneys, looks like an upturned table and dominates the Battersea skyline. Mr George Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang, the brothers negotiating the deal on behalf of their family, are known in Hong Kong for their interests in the prestigious Parkview complex in the colony's Tai Tam country park. The complex is partly owned by Chyau Fwu, their private company, but it recently sold part of the development to their listed vehicle, which changed its name from Ming Ren Holdings to the Hong Kong Parkview Group in January. The family, headed by their Taiwanese-born father Mr Hwang Chou-shiuan, bought a controlling stake in Parkview in 1990. Later the same year the company made its first foray into the UK by acquiring a majority stake in FBM Marine, formerly Fairey Marine, the Isle of Wight boatbuilder which has a number of military and domestic contracts, including a project to develop a high-speed catamaran for the Ministry of Defence. It also supplied the catamarans which are used by the London riverbus service. Other Parkview interests in Hong Kong include a 20-year exclusive franchise from the Chinese government to run a ferry service between Hong Kong and Shenzhen airport. In the year to March 1992 the company made a profit of HKDollars 6.3m (Pounds 560,000). In the six months to September 1992, however, it recorded a HKDollars 590,000 loss. The Chyau Fwu company emerged from Taiwan where it carried out extensive infrastructure projects such as the construction of airports, dams, railways and schools. Among the biggest Taiwan development projects were the construction of World Wide House and Bank Tower Taipei. Mr Hwang senior left Taiwan after four officials from Chyau Fwu were charged with bribery offences in March 1989, but the family's supporters in Hong Kong have pointed out that such cases are not uncommon in Taiwan. Three years ago the Hwangs surprised the Hong Kong stock market when they launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Evergo International and Chinese Estates. Recently the family has been injecting more of its assets into Parkview. The company's current ventures include a 20 per cent stake in a USDollars 500m (Pounds 342m) Japanese theme park. It has also been studying the possibility of relocating an oil refinery from the United States to China. The oil venture is part of a complex scheme, under review by the Hwangs, that they believe would give the company a big stake in Chinese oil production. The family members are keeping their thoughts to themselves as to the future of the power station. Financial details of their move to buy the power station site have not been revealed but it is thought that the syndicate of banks that backed Mr John Broome's leisure development will have had to sell their debt, signing away their right to the site at the same time, at a considerable discount.</p>

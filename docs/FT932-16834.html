			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat bosses suspended - Hotel group takes swift action over its financial crisis THE FINANCIAL crisis at Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, claimed its first senior management victims yesterday when Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, and Mr David Hersey, finance director, were suspended from their duties with immediate effect. It also emerged that Barclays, Queen Moat's joint lead bank, had sent a letter to the group's 44 other banks asking them not to call in loans, pending the results of an investigation of the company's affairs by investigators from Grant Thornton, the accountants. Grant Thornton is probing why the group ran into financial difficulties, when only a week ago it gave no inkling to bankers of its problems. Bankers said yesterday that part of the reason for the apparent collapse in Queens Moat's profits may have been that in past years the company booked profits on the expectation of future cash flows, which in the event have not materialised. The company said yesterday that the announcement of the group's full-year results, scheduled for next Wednesday, had been postponed. The suspension of Mr Marcus and Mr Hersey was the result of bank pressure. One banker said last night: 'It's very important that responsibility is clearly seen to be taken. We're talking about a financial problem and the people responsible for that have to take responsibility.' The sudden and unexpected crisis at Queens Moat was the result of Mr John Bairstow, the chairman, taking more direct control of the company. Mr Bairstow, who is 62, had decided to reduce his role when he turned 60. He increasingly felt, however, that the group did not have a suitable successor in place and that he should play a more active part. Mr Marcus sold Pounds 629,500 of Queens Moat shares, about half his holding, in February, on the last working day before the start of the group's close season. He said he had sold the shares to fulfil personal commitments. Queens Moat said yesterday that cheques had been posted in respect of interest payable on April 1 on the 10 1/4 per cent First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2020. Hotel industry rivals said yesterday that while Queens Moat was highly regarded for its hotel operating skills, it had been clear for some time that its financial expertise had not kept pace with its growth. 'They over-stretched themselves and grew too quickly. They were running all over the continent and the UK like blue-arsed flies,' a senior hotel executive said. Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr Maurice Hart became non-executive chairman of the audit committee of Queens Moat within 14 months of resigning as senior partner of Bird Luckin, the firm which audits the consolidated accounts. This rapid change of jobs does not appear to breach any current professional ethical rules, although draft rules being considered by the chartered accountancy profession might introduce an intervening 'quarantine' period.

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey strong Abbey National saw its share price move higher in the face of disappointing results as the market focused on a possible cut in UK interest rates following the changes to the European exchange rate mechanism. The argument is that if ERM members cut rates the UK will have to follow suit to remain competitive. Building societies will be able to lower their rates to savers but leave their mortgage rates steady, thus improving profit margins. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst with UBS, said base rates could fall by one percentage point but Abbey will only cut its lending rate by a quarter of a point. However, he argues that this would only give a short-term boost to a group with long-term problems and he recommends selling into strength. Abbey came in with profits of Pounds 301m against a market consensus of Pounds 310 after heavy provisions. The share price was 14 ahead at the day's best and closed 9 up at 392p after very high turnover of some 12m shares.</p>

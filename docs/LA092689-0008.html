Atty. Edward Jagels said.  </P> <P> At a presentation at the Los Angeles County registrar of voters' office, about  50 boxes filled with petitions containing about 292,000 signatures were turned  over as several members of victims' families cheered.  </P> <P> The initiative, sponsored by state Sen. Ed Royce (R-Orange County), includes a  provision allowing victims to demand a speedy trial for defendants, increases  penalties for murderers and makes jury selection a duty of the judge rather  than attorneys.  </P></p>

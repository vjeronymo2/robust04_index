"I believe it  is essential that the decisionmaking process at the United  Nations is such that the effectiveness of responses can be  assured under good conditions whenever a response is required.  Too frequently this is not the case." In the case of the Serbian  tank aggression, "once again, it took more than one hour for the  administrative procedures to run their course," affirmed the  prime minister.    According to the military personnel on the ground, the  request to respond has been made at 2217 local time by the  commander of the French battalion, and the green light was only  given by the UN special representative, Mr. Yashusi Akashi, (the  sole individual there empowered to order an air strike) at 2315  [local time]. This version of events was implicitly confirmed by  a NATO spokesman in Rome. He indicated that the two aircraft  which arrived over Bihac received shortly afterwards the order  not to intervene because "the shooting had ceased."    Edouard Balladur had come out with his reproaches Sunday  morning, during a talk with Yasushi Akashi in Zagreb. He  announced that, together with [Defense Minister] Francois  Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, he would "study the  proposals that might be made with a view to accelerating the  process so that decisions to respond be made in time and not  when the moment had passed. It is essential that our troops  benefit here from optimal conditions of safety and protection,  because they are not indulging in warring activities, but  participating in humanitarian operations."    The criticisms made by Edouard Balladur echo those made by  General Cot, the UNPROFOR commander, who -- back in January --  had already taken issue over the ponderousness of the  decisionmaking process leading up to an air strike in response  [to hostilities in violation of the cease-fire]. At the time he  suggested that the UNPROFOR commander be empowered to make the  decision. The French Government has also called into question  the behavior of the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, the British  General Michael Rose, who is second-in-command to General Cot.  Last Thursday, according to Francois Leotard, the UN troops in  Bihac had called for air support "but General Rose had rejected  their call." According to French military sources, relations  between the French leaders and the British general, who the  former reproach for having adopted "too personal" an approach in  managing the situation in Bosnia, are not looking rosy.    Paris also fears that Bihac could become a major center of  confrontation. Since the beginning of February the latter [not  further specified] have in fact reinforced their presence by  several thousand men. Within the context of an agreement  between the Croats and the Muslims, the railway (along the river  Una, in the south of the pocket), which constitutes the  boundary, is of great strategic importance, for it represents  the sole link between Knin in Serbian Krajina and Belgrade,  thereby ensuring the continuity of Serbian territory.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salihovic] </F>   [Excerpt] The tragic outcome of the terrorist attack by  the chetnik artillery on the free Brcko territory last night is  three dead and a dozen or so wounded civilians. After  provocative attacks on the positions of the Brcko defense  yesterday, last night, at 1945, the enemy launched a fierce  artillery attack. Using mortars of all caliber, recoilless  guns, howitzers, and the T-12 gun, the aggressor shelled our  positions between Ljukici and Kladije [words indistinct]  Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca with destructive projectiles.    Unable to change anything at the impenetrable defense lines,  at 2015, the chetniks turned their artillery in a criminal  fashion toward civilian targets deep toward the free Brcko  territory. The aggressor mercilessly attacked unarmed civilians  and houses on free Brcko territory with 122-mm and 155-mm  howitzers, 122-mm mortars, and hill guns for a whole hour.  [passage omitted]</p>

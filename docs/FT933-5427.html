			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: Tracking down wayward pets - Worth Watching Pet dogs wander off, thoroughbred horses are stolen and expensive falcons fly away. To combat the problem Fecava - the Federation of European Companion Animal Veterinary Associations - has decided to standardise on chip technology which gives each animal a unique identification code. The device, developed by the US company Destron, and marketed in the UK by Animalcare, of York, is a transponder the size of a grain of rice which is injected into the animal's neck or paw. When the device is installed the unique number and details of the owner are logged on a national database. The animal can be reunited with its owner by reading the transponder with a hand-held reader. Animalcare: 0904 488661.</p>

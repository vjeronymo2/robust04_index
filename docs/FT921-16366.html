			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Pension funds cut rate of investment TOTAL NET investments by insurance and pension funds during the third quarter of 1991 fell by 2 per cent to nearly Pounds 9.4bn compared with the same period last year, according to Central Statistical Office research released yesterday. There was a substantial shift away from short-term investments, and particularly UK ordinary shares. The CSO's analysis of a sample of pension funds and companies showed investments by public and private pension funds were Pounds 3.9bn, while holdings in long and short-term funds by insurance companies were Pounds 5.4bn. There were substantial declines in holdings of short-term assets, with a net fall of Pounds 185m in short-term investments by insurance companies in the three-month period. Net investment in UK shares by pensions funds fell 53 per cent to Pounds 1.8bn and that by insurance companies fell 57 per cent to Pounds 1bn. Investment in overseas ordinary shares increased correspondingly during the period to Pounds 5.2bn for insurance and pension funds. Total long-term insurance funds were Pounds 5.6bn, Pounds 600m above the previous quarter and Pounds 800m above the third quarter of 1990. Net investments by pension funds in UK property rose to Pounds 300m, however. This is the highest level since the last quarter of 1987. Net investment in property by long-term insurance company funds was Pounds 400m, slightly more than in the previous five quarters.</p>

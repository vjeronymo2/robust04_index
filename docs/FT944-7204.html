			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rooney takes the helm at Atreus - Former Spring Ram chief makes City comeback in Pounds 6.6m deal Mr Bill Rooney, former chief executive of Spring Ram, yesterday returned to the City to announce a Pounds 6.6m deal to take control of Atreus, the bathroom goods supplier. Mr Rooney, who will become chairman of the recently floated company, heads a consortium which is investing Pounds 4.8m in Atreus shares and convertible loan notes. His family trusts are also underwriting an open offer of 18m new shares to shareholders at 10p, on a one-for-two basis. Atreus shares closed up 4p at 13p yesterday. The investment comes 14 months after institutional investors forced Mr Rooney off the Spring Ram board. His departure followed revelations of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary and three profit warnings in eight months. Before this, the group had enjoyed 13 years of spectacular growth. Mr Rooney is joined at Atreus by Mr Alan Bell, former chief executive of Spring Ram's kitchen division, and Mr Ron Farr, former chief executive of Spring Ram's special products business. Mr Rooney said: 'We saw ourselves coming back to the City in three or four years' time, after the dust had settled, but Atreus approached us. With our expertise and cash, they felt we had a nice partnership.' The subscription and open offer is expected to raise about Pounds 6.4m net of expenses to fund new products and acquisitions in related sectors of the home improvement market. Alongside the takeover deal, Atreus announced the acquisition of Samson Stairs, which manufactures wooden balustrade systems, in return for 2m ordinary shares. Mr Bell, the new chief executive of Atreus, said: 'If we cannot treble what we have in two or three years, we might as well go home. 'It is very exciting to go into the 1990s with a clean sheet, but it is unlikely we will be building too many large factories in the next few years.' Atreus gained an official listing in March 1993 by a reverse takeover of the shell company URS International. The group had a market value of Pounds 7.76m after a placing and public offer of 27.5m shares at 20p each. At the time the board said it wanted to grow by expanding its product range. However, the company issued a profit warning last January, saying that the company had suffered pressure on margins. Atreus yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 551,000 profit) on turnover of Pounds 2.94m (Pounds 3.78m) in the six months to September 30. Mr Charles Gillams, chairman, said the losses reflected the cost of an overhead reduction programme and weak consumer spending. The board did not declare an interim dividend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report By Rosie Watson Vasquez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met today for  30 minutes with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos  official residence. Peres came with some proposals that are  already being studied so they can be implemented without delay.  Those proposals include seeking a commercial agreement -- and  this is perhaps the most important proposal -- similar to the  one that has been in effect for some years between Israel and  the United States.    Israel is setting its sights on Mexico because, Peres said,  it is a nation that seeks markets and opportunities. During  this private meeting, President Salinas de Gortari and Foreign  Minister Peres also discussed ways to prevent double taxation  which is hurting commercial exchange, to seek (?joint  investments) for development and research in the field of  science and technology, and to promote cultural exchange. On  this latter point, it has been suggested that each country  should select 10 works of literature, translate them into the  other country's language, and publish them.    They also talked about the new structure that must govern  the  United Nations now that the division between communism and  democracy, north and south, no longer exists, so the Third World  countries can join the First World, Peres said. Following his  private meeting with the Mexican president, the Israeli foreign  minister hosted a news conference where he said the 21st century  is full of perils and nations have to block the path of  dictators, new wars, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons  because we do not have much time left. This is the time,  according to Peres, to buy a ticket for revolution and to  understand revolution means change. He added, it is a time to be  either spectators or actors. He felt Mexico had already  purchased its front row ticket.    The Israeli official admitted that change has made the world  more democratic and that the topic of protecting the ecology and  living a free life go hand in hand. One advantage to all this  is the movement of information, which travels in the sky as if  it were air. Television, for example, is much stronger than the  iron curtain of the communist system.    [Begin Peres recording; superimposed translation into  Spanish  in progress] ...this revolution. In all nations, Mexico is  obviously one of those cases; this is a question of deciding  whether to purchase a ticket, whether one is going to enter the  next century in sitting a theater seat or as a participant or an  actor. Changes in the world are as follows: first, the sources  of wealth and power are now of an intellectual and not material  nature. Everything depends on education, science, technology and  no longer on the wealth of oil or gold mines. Before, oil  constituted 80 percent of Mexican exports and industrial  products were 20 percent. That relation has been reversed. [end  recording]    Shim'on Peres arrived at Los Pinos and his movements around  the city are conducted under tight security measures. A black  Lincoln with him aboard leads five other cars with his personal  bodyguards who issue orders in Hebrew, the official language of  Israel. He has a stern and dry expression, but when he talks he  becomes another person. He speaks in poetry. He said, for  instance, that the task of our generation is to eliminate the  desert from the earth, salt from the water, and violence from  the people. That is how we will have a happy world.    He feels that despite the dangers looming over us there  never  can be another Hitler. To conclude, upon leaving Los Pinos,  Salinas de Gortari informed Peres he would be traveling to  Jerusalem next year. If the visit materializes, Salinas de  Gortari would be going as a tourist since he would no longer be  president, according to the electoral timetable.    [Station anchorwoman] Peres will conduct private activities  in our country, right?    [Watson] That is right. He will remain here a few hours and  then leave. He is on a tour of different Latin American  countries.</p>

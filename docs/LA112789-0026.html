			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CARBON MONOXIDE DANGERS STUDIED  </P> <P> Very low levels of carbon monoxide, such as those found in a roomful of  cigarette smokers, can trigger potentially hazardous oxygen shortages in people  with heart disease, according to Dr. Thomas E. Dahms of the St. Louis  University School of Medicine. The problems were seen at levels of carbon  monoxide that are considered safe by federal air quality standards, Dahms  reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> In studies with 63 men with coronary artery disease, Dahms found that they  could perform 5% less work on a treadmill when their carboxyhemoglobin levels  -- the combination of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin -- reached 2% and 12% less  when the level reached 4%. Hemoglobin ordinarily combines with oxygen and  carries it throughout the body. Carbon monoxide, however, binds with hemoglobin  even more tightly than oxygen does. When people breathe carbon monoxide, it  cuts down the amount of oxygen in their blood, and high doses are fatal.  </P> <P> Standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allow enough carbon  monoxide in the air to take up 2% of the blood's hemoglobin. Dahms said a  nonsmoker in a closed room with 20 smokers would breathe enough carbon monoxide  to have about a 2% carboxyhemoglobin level. Someone who smokes a pack of  cigarettes a day has levels between 4% and 8%.  </P></p>

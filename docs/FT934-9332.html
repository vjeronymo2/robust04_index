			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Former Daf workers win Pounds 10m award: Tribunal condemns receivers for ignoring legal obligations WORKERS made redundant after the financial collapse of Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of the failed Dutch truck maker, won compensation technically worth about Pounds 10m yesterday. Unions claimed a 'famous victory' after an industrial tribunal censured receivers of the former truck company for ignoring employment laws. The tribunal ruled that 2,400 workers in Leyland in Lancashire, Birmingham and Glasgow were made redundant unlawfully because neither their employers nor the receivers who took over last February gave them the statutory 90 days' notice. The tribunal strongly criticised the receivers Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen. It said: 'It is very surprising that the administrative receivers of eminence involved in this case should fail to meet their statutory obligations so repeatedly and so lamentably as they have done here.' The receivers argued yesterday that when they moved in they were fighting to keep the business alive, and there had been no alternative but to issue redundancy notices. Mr McKillop said: 'As receivers we had to use what limited funds that were available to save what was left of the company. The alternative was complete closure.' The Leyland Daf case mirrors a successful claim by 700 former workers of the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside who were awarded Pounds 1.5m compensation in September. Although yesterday's award was worth Pounds 10m, the unions will have to seek payment from the Department of Employment redundancy scheme, as they are unable to lodge a claim with the company. The government scheme would give them a potential maximum award of nearly Pounds 4m and, because compensation is likely to be offset by pay in lieu of notice, the final payment could be even lower. Mr John Allen, AEEU engineering union chief negotiator at Leyland Daf, said: 'While no amount of money can compensate those who were unceremoniously sacked, the union has established an important principle. Companies and receivers will in future have to obey the law or face the consequences. Just because a company is facing financial difficulty they clearly have no right to behave in an arbitrary and cavalier manner and expect to get away with it.' Mr Michael Short, the union lawyer, said the tribunal made it clear there was no excuse for the 'brutal and unfair' manner in which the receivers dismissed workers. He added: 'Unfortunately it seems the company has no money to pay the awards. We are now looking to recover the money from the government.'</p>

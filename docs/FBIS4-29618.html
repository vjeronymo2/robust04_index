			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 June, Japanese and U.S. negotiators concluded  two days of talks in Tokyo regarding government procurement of  telecommunications equipment in the Japan-U.S. framework trade  talks. The negotiators held discussions on improvements in  bidding procedures, which the Japanese Government compiled last  spring, and on benchmarks (objective criteria) to gauge the  openness of Japanese markets to foreign access. Apparently,  "progress was made" (as stated by a Japanese negotiating  official) in the talks. However, U.S. negotiators reiterated  that they wanted to hold discussions regarding the procurement  of telecommunications equipment by the Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation (NTT), something which Japan has rejected.  As a result, the negotiators were unable to narrow the gap  between their opposing views.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Vance rules out UN troops for Bosnia MR CYRUS VANCE said yesterday that the UN would not extend its peacekeeping operations to Bosnia-Hercegovina, where fresh clashes were reported despite a ceasefire. The United Nations special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade for another round of peace talks, appealed to Bosnian leaders to respect the ceasefire. 'The situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is very, very serious and is causing us great concern. It is therefore essential that all the parties live up to the ceasefire agreement. War is not the answer. It will be ruinous to all sides and nobody should think that he or she can gain a one-sided advantage.' Mr Vance said the UN did not have enough troops to undertake peace-keeping operations in Bosnia as well as Croatia. Nor is there any UN mandate to operate in Bosnia. Despite the ceasefire agreed on Sunday by leaders of Bosnia's nearly 4.4m Moslems, Serbs and Croats, clashes yesterday were reported in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, in Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia, and in Mostar, in the south. The federal army said it had secured Visegrad, a predominantly Moslem town in south-east Bosnia. The fighting has left dozens dead and forced 100,000 to flee. David White, Defence Correspondent, adds: Britain's contribution to the peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia will be a field ambulance unit and support troops, 260 personnel in all, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday. The role of the lightly-armed troops will be to evacuate any wounded UN personnel to hospitals. The force is smaller than the 1,000-1,200 UK troops expected to be required. Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, UK chief of defence staff, firmly rejected any suggestion that Britain was 'dragging its feet' on UN peacekeeping tasks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad  al-Sabah, Kuwaiti deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati met this  evening on the sideline of the ministerial Non-Aligned  Conference in Cairo.    Shaykh al-Sabah said they exchanged views on a number of  issues, including Iraq-Kuwait relations and the ties between  Kuwait and Iran, which he described as good.    He noted that the Iranian president invited Shaykh Jabir  al-Ahmad, amir of Kuwait, to visit Tehran. He said the visit  will take place very soon.    When asked about the altercation between the Kuwaiti and  Iraqi delegations today, Shaykh al-Sabah said the Kuwaiti  delegation was replying to the remarks of the Iraqi delegation  concerning the Security Council resolutions that Kuwait, along  with the entire world, demands be implemented. Regrettably, he  said, Iraq always says that it closed the file the Kuwait issue.    If Iraq really means that, the Kuwaiti minister said, then  the Iraqi Government and National Assembly should send an  official document to the Security Council telling it that they  accept all its resolutions.    He denied any Egyptian mediation to improve relations  between  Iraq and Kuwait.    The Iranian foreign minister was asked about Iran's future  relations with the PLO in light of Iran's opposition to the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He replied that the PLO still  operates its embassy in Tehran, and that the Iranian Government  has good ties with the various Palestinian factions. He said  his country is sympathetic toward the Palestinian cause, and it  closed the Israeli embassy and replaced it with an embassy for  Palestine.    Velayati said there are plans for the presidents of Iran and  Syria to meet in Damascus in July to discuss regional and  international issues of mutual concern. The presidents will  also discuss the situation in northern Iraq, which is called the  Kurdish region, he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ FINDS THE TIME TO UPEND LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> It was the wildest 3 minutes and 59 seconds of James Jackson's life.  </P> <P> Jackson, a sophomore tailback at Dominguez High School, scored two touchdowns  and recovered a fumble in the final 3:59 Friday night to help the Dons upset  Los Alamitos, 18-15, in the first round of the Division III football playoffs  at Hanford Rants Stadium.  </P> <P> Dominguez (8-3) advances to the second round against Mission Viejo. Los  Alamitos (9-2) failed to reach the Division III final for the first time in  three seasons.  </P> <P> And it's all because of Jackson's fourth-quarter flurry.  </P> <P> Jackson, who finished with 104 yards in 10 carries, scored on a 25-yard run  with 3:59 left, recovered a fumble by Bob Simpson on the ensuing kickoff and  scored from 31 yards out two plays later.  </P> <P> And before he had a chance to catch his breath, Dominguez had turned a 7-6  deficit into an 18-7 lead.  </P> <P> "This was a big surprise to me because I haven't had much success lately," said  Jackson, 5-feet-11 and 160 pounds. "I had a sore ankle and hadn't been running  well. It's only about 97%."  </P> <P> Jackson's touchdown runs, both down the left sideline, were set up by fakes to  fullback Bruce Walker.  </P> <P> Walker, a 6-4, 245-pound senior, finished with 103 yards in 23 carries.  </P> <P> "They were keying on Bruce and that opened things up for me on the outside,"  Jackson said. "I just kept thinking 'Get in, that's all you need to do.' "  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said injuries to quarterback Todd Gragnano  (ribs) and running back Erik Mitchell (ankle) hurt the Griffins' chances. Both  returned, but Mitchell finished with only 26 yards in seven carries and  Gragnano completed only three of 12 passes for 125 yards.  </P> <P> "Our effort was super," Barnes said. "I have no complaints about that. But Todd  had hurt his ribs three weeks ago and then again (on a running play in the  second quarter). He really gutted it out. I didn't know if he could come back  in the second half."  </P> <P> Gragnano did most of the damage for the Griffins early.  </P> <P> On the Griffins' first play from scrimmage Gragnano threw to wide receiver  Tyler Cashman for a 63-yard gain to the Dominguez six-yard line. LaQuan  Beckton, Mitchell's replacement, scored on the next play and Los Alamitos led,  7-0.  </P> <P> But Gragnano's 63-yard completion was his only one of the half as Dominguez's  defense shut down the Griffins, who were averaging more than 34 points a game.  Los Alamitos had only two first downs and 26 yards rushing in the first half.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PASSING LEADERS  </P> <P> Orange County career passing yardage leaders:  </P> <P> 1. Todd Marinovich '84-87 (Mater Dei, Capo Valley): 9,182  </P> <P> 2. Bret Johnson '85-87 (El Toro): 6,627  </P> <P> 3. Todd Gragnano '87-89 (Los Alamitos): 6,160  </P> <P> 4.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Goodyear ahead of forecast with Dollars 87m GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last US-owned tyre group, posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings of Dollars 87.1m, or 60 cents a share, against a forecast Dollars 83m to Dollars 86m. A year earlier, underlying income was Dollars 66.1m, or 47 cents, excluding the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Including the changes, it had a net loss of Dollars 944.5m, or Dollars 6.67. Earnings per share have been restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective May 4. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said the company achieved higher operating earnings despite 'economic confusion in the US with a new administration, a lingering recession in Europe, and what is normally the tyre industry's slowest sales period.' He attributed the improvement to production efficiencies and lower selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of sales. The company also cut interest costs. In the 1993 quarter, worldwide tyre unit sales rose 9 per cent and revenues advanced 4.6 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn. In the general products segment, operating income fell 18 per cent to Dollars 43.4m on sales 15.2 lower at Dollars 411.4m,reflecting the sale of polyester resin and industrial and commercial films operations.</p>

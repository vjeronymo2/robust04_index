			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOCKEY CLUB GOLD CUP AT BELMONT;  </P> <P> RACE WAS EASY GOING FOR EASY GOER  </P> <P> Shug McGaughey, the trainer of Easy Goer, wanted more than just a victory in  Saturday's Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park. He wanted an easy victory --  and that's what he got.  </P> <P> "I told Pat this morning, if we can, I want it to be one of those typical Pat  Day rides," McGaughey said.  </P> <P> Day is noted for not using a horse more than he has to.  </P> <P> "I told him, I don't want you to get to the bottom of him,"' McGaughey said.  "We have one more stop."  </P> <P> That stop will be a showdown with Triple Crown rival Sunday Silence in the  Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park.  </P> <P> Easy Goer will go into that race with a five-race winning streak, including  Saturday's four-length triumph over Cryptoclearance in the $1,099,000 Gold Cup.  </P> <P> "I thought he ran fantastic," McGaughey said.  </P> <P> He certainly ran easily, third at the half mile in a leisurely 48 3/5 and in  front after a mile in 1:39 2/5. He reached the 1 1/4-mile mark in 2:05 and, at  the time, was being seriously challenged by Cryptoclearance.  </P> <P> About a sixteenth of a mile later, that challenge faded, and Easy Goer romped  home in 2:29 1/5 for the 1 1/2 miles without ever feeling Day's whip.  </P> <P> The $659,400 first-place money boosted Easy Goer's career earnings to  $3,859,650.  </P> <P> Cryptoclearance finished 19 1/2 lengths in front of third-place Forever Silver,  who was three-quarters of a length in front of Prized, who upset Sunday Silence  in the Swaps at Hollywood Park in July. That came one race after Easy Goer  began his winning streak by beating Sunday Silence in the Belmont Stakes.  </P> <P> Day had Easy Goer fourth entering the backstretch with a mile to go. At that  point, Impersonator, ridden by Richard Migliore, had a daylight lead, and he  led until almost the half-mile pole when Day moved Easy Goer past him.  </P> <P> As the horses entered the turn, Jose Santos made his move with Cryptoclearance.  The 5-year-old moved into second behind Easy Goer with about a quarter-mile  left.  </P> <P> Momentarily, it looked like Easy Goer might have all he could handle, but he  quickly dispelled that notion.  </P> <P> Easy Goer, owned by Ogden Phipps, paid $2.20, $2.20 and $2.10. Cryptoclearance  paid $3.40 and $2.10, and Forever Silver paid $2.10 to show.  </P> <P> Easy Goer and Prized, the only 3-year-olds in the field, carried 121 pounds,  while the other five each toted 126 under the weight-for-age format.  </P> <P> Completing the order of finish were Its Acedemic, Jack of Clubs and  Impersonator, who was eased through the stretch.  </P> <P> Easy Goer's record now is eight wins and two seconds in 10 starts this year,  and 12 wins and four seconds in 16 lifetime starts as he points toward the $3  million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park, where he can clinch or lose  both the 3-year-old and Horse of the Year titles.  </P></p>

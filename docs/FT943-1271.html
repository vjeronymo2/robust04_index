			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - Avril Groom condsiders the vexed question of choosing the right shirt Shirts are subject to the subtle whims and codes which groups of men devise to make themselves distinctive. According to Sir Hardy Amies, writing in his book The Englishman's Suit, the shirt is now 'the fashionable, status-enhancing garment' for men. Yet a surprisingly large number of British men apparently let their wives buy their shirts for them. Research by Van Heusen, which aims to overturn its staid image this autumn, with a new range including both traditionally-made City-style shirts and modern, more relaxed designs, divides shirt-buying neatly into thirds. Some 34 per cent of all men's shirts, it found, are bought by women. Another 34 per cent are bought with a woman present, or at least with her approval. The rest are bought by men alone, for reasons of speed, getting a better fit or, most tellingly, not wanting to be pushed into something unsuitably trendy. Men who shop alone are particular about detail and more likely to buy the 3 per cent of shirts which cost more than Pounds 45. More than half of the shirts purchased in the UK cost between Pounds 15 and Pounds 30 with Marks and Spencer alone accounting for one-fifth of the market. Chain and department stores are more likely to be the haunt of the shirt-buying woman, probably while she also shops for herself. A man is more likely to go to a specialist or designer shop. A straw poll of professional men with a sharp eye for a good shirt, showed only a minority who sought their partner's advice, let alone expected her to buy their shirts. But the men come in two very distinct categories: the traditionalist and the trend follower. The traditionalist shops when his old shirts wear out. He goes for good two-fold cotton and quality details. Once he finds a suitable source he sticks with it. This includes mail order sources, as upmarket brochures from companies such as James Meade or Boden testify. In this case, wives often make the final choice and order. James Meade (tel: 0264-333222 for brochures) estimates that 20 per cent of its sales are by this method and Johnnie Boden reckons 'togetherness' is a plus for mail order, less stressful than shopping a deux. The trend-follower, on the other hand, is aware of labels and fashion conscious. He is likely to spend time window- shopping and retires his working shirts as painting smocks, not because they are worn out but because he has gone off them. He is likely to work in a less conservative profession and is adept at bringing individuality to the suit-shirt-tie uniform. Both groups demand style and lasting value, and their main gripe about cheaper shirts is their limpness after a number of washes. The debate about easy-care cotton and fused collars (where the interfacing is ironed on to the collar fabric which makes ironing easier but may eventually distort the smooth line - Van Heusen fuse, Thomas Pink and Boden do not) is a sideline as few shirt enthusiasts launder at home. Small changes do not go unnoticed - traditionalists admit that the appearance of an unusual collar shape or shirt colour in the office still causes comment. Even the trends followed by the fashion-conscious point to classic looks - subtle checks, textured self-coloured weaves, button-down collars. In the world of the working shirt, tiny changes can be talking points. Because men now work jacketless, Van Heusen puts a pocket for pens even on its most traditional, double-cuffed shirt. Some men love it, others feel a plain front looks more professional. But there is, as Daniel White, the company's marketing executive, says, 'a loosening up, a move towards individuality. 'The 1970s were the great shirt years with a huge variety of shapes and patterns. The 1980s boom brought a uniform - power stripes and double cuffs. Now people want a more personal touch but it should be subtly done.' To test the thesis, we record the views of four keen shirt buyers, none of whom owns fewer than 30. Each clearly belongs to his own, mutually-recognisable club.</p>

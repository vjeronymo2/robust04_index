			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 19 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic on Thursday rejected a statement by  British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg that the  Moslems in the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should  admit a military defeat. Speaking to BBC's reporter in  Sarajevo, Silajdzic firmly rejected claims that the Moslems had  lost the war in Bosnia and said that the main reason for their  losses so far is the international embargo on arms deliveries.  The United Nations banned the delivery of weapons to the  territory of the former Yugoslavia in September 1991.    Addressing the Royal Institute in London on Wednesday Hogg  said that the peace process in Bosnia would begin only if the  Serbs give up a part of the territories and the Moslems admit  military defeat. The Moslems must be reconcilled with this and  realize that a foreign military intervention in Bosnia is out of  the question, he said. Hogg warned the warring sides in Bosnia  that in the next eight weeks a peace agreement should be reached  because the alternative is the withdrawal of the U.N.  peacekeepers and the halting of international humanitarian aid.  The pullout of the international troops from Bosnia could  seriously be considered if the Moslems continue nurturing hopes  that the embargo on arms deliveries could be lifted, as the  United States promised in the face of British and French  opposition, Hogg said.    The Moslem government in Sarajevo rejects a four-month  ceasefire called for by the meeting of foreign minsiters of  Russia, the United States, European Union and the United Nations  held in Geneva last Friday. Hogg recalled that early this year  Great Britain and France announced they would not forever keep  their troops in Bosnia and had started looking for ways to  withdraw them. According to Hogg, this was cut short by NATO's  military scenario and the U.S. diplomatic initative for  supporting the Sarajevo Moslem authorities.    British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Wednesday  that so far there does not exist a plan for the withdrawal of  the British U.N. contingent from Bosnia.</p>

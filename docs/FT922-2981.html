			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Up the polls IF I AM known in the office for anything, it is for my sang-froid. At times, my imperturbability is mistaken for casualness, but it is a mistake that detractors make only once. It is because of my coolness and composure that editorial personages of a surprising seniority frequently make the trek from the first floor to the third to consult me in my bower, which is curtained off from the press of humanity by a screen of exotic potted palms. Safe behind this screen, senior editorial personages can pick my brains or seek my support in shadowy enterprises. But I boil over sometimes. Even my renowned calm can give way to dreadful agitation if I am seriously provoked, and I have been provoked recently - not by something in the office but by the UK government's wilful refusal to countenance a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the move to closer European unity. As I explained quite recently, I am a Euro-federalist. I want Europe to be enlarged and homogenised: one queen, one president, one parliament, one language, one rail system, and so on. Then I want us to move to world government and integration, so as to help us counteract the unmitigated vices, including genocide and environmental destructiveness, that help distinguish us from the other two species of chimpanzee, and may prove our downfall. An ardent Euro-federalist I may be. But I am not a cheat or a hoodwinker. I want us to integrate our affairs, in Europe and the world, not by subterfuge but on the basis of intelligent majority approval as measured by referenda. I want the politicians to lift their game mightily. To claim that the Maastricht treaty or European unity were adequately discussed during the UK election campaign two months ago is a lie. (This was the media's fault, as much as the politicians'). To imagine that John Major, backed by a fragile parliamentary majority, has the right to negotiate weighty constitutional matters on our behalf is absurd. First, I want a mass of information. I do not want to rely on Douglas Hurd's tortured explanations of Maastricht, any more than I want to hear the incoherent howls of the Euro-sceptics. I want facts, millions of them. I want intelligent and unambiguous discussion, a genuine debate. Then I want a referendum. In fact, I want us to move towards electronic polling as swiftly as possible. I want snap referenda on almost everything, for I see them as the only way forward - the only way to smash the gridlock and end the bungling that politicians almost everywhere have fallen into. Next week I am launching the BBR, the British Board of Referenda. There is much ground to cover. We will have referenda twice a week to start with; eventually, daily. Here are some of the questions that we might have asked this week, had we been in business. To illuminate my purpose and demonstrate the sort of answers my referenda will generate, I am taking the liberty of giving you the forecast result of each referendum question, as best as I can calculate it: 1) Euro-federalism will mean one language, one parliament, one queen, one anthem, one railway timetable, much cheaper cars and shorter working hours. Are we in favour? (Result. For: 96.7 per cent. Against: 3.3 per cent). 2) The Brussels bureaucrats, led by Jacques Delors, are calling for an outrageous increase in the EC budget, mainly so that they can donate great sacks of cash to indolent smaller members like Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. Should we tell the bureaucrats to stop annoying us with such proposals? (For: 97.8 per cent. Against: 2.2 per cent). 3) Do we all agree that the Prince and Princess of Wales have had a wretched time at the hands of the media lately, and that about a dozen editors need locking-up? (For: 99.1 per cent. Against: 0.9 per cent). 4) On the other hand, there is a widespread belief that Charles and Diana would not be in this pickle if Charles wasn't such a cold fish. Should he be told to lighten up? (For: 97.3 per cent. Against: 2.7 per cent). 5) Everyone hates the water companies. Shall we all hurl a saucepan of water out of our windows at 8pm tonight? (For: 99.9 per cent. Against: 0.1 per cent). 6) The England team at the European soccer finals in Sweden is arguing about whether to play five men forward or five men back. Should we fax the manager and tell him to play 10 men in the middle? (For: 94.9 per cent. Against: 5.1 per cent).</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Clash of big battalions will decide the line to take BEHIND the slightly shabby facade of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo's civil service area and the government heart, a fight is under way to reshape the most sensitive aspect of Japan's most important international relationship - its trade policy towards the US. Japan's approach to the Clinton administration when Premier Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington in mid-April will be determined by the outcome of the struggle between Japan's bureaucratic big battalions. The fight to refashion policy towards the US has pitted the Ministry of International Trade and Industry against the Foreign Ministry, and, equally significantly, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan. They all agree on many issues, and welcome Mr Clinton's plan to cut the budget deficit. But they are at odds over some vital aspects of trade policy. Miti wants policy towards the US to be guided by a new overall approach to trade issues, a shift from a trade policy based on special considerations for foreign demands to a rule-oriented approach. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Miti vice-minister for international affairs, believes the US administration could improve trade relations in the long run. An attack on the US federal budget deficit should help cut the US trade deficit, while the administration's industrial policy should help raise US industry's competitiveness. He stresses it is too early to judge the new administration's trade policy, which so far seems cautious. The anti-dumping decision against steel imports was inherited from the Bush administration and the new administration has refrained from raising import tariffs on mini-vans. But Tokyo is still braced for US demands for Japan to open its market. Miti favours stimulating the Japanese economy to cut the surplus by creating more demand for imports. It says it will resist moves to open up sectors of Japanese industry such as cars or computers, to a specified level of imports. But this approach is running into opposition from two different quarters. First, the Foreign Ministry argues that a 'rule-governed' policy which attempts to settle trade disputes through formal procedures will sound evasive in Washington. A ministry official said: 'You have to address some issues directly. Everyone is fed up with the Structural Impediments Initiative talks. We have to look for a new mechanism. We have not yet reached consensus on what that should be.' One option considered by the Foreign Ministry are two parallel sets of bilateral talks, one for macroeconomic issues, the other for micro-issues such as measures to open Japanese markets to imports. Trade friction with the US has a strategic significance for the Foreign Ministry. The end of the cold war has removed the main rationale for the US-Japan security alliance. As a result, the alliance is more vulnerable to being disrupted by trade frictions. Mr Katsunari Suzuki, in charge of policy planning at the Foreign Ministry, said: 'If the imbalance continues, then US public support for the defence of Japan will erode. It is most important we work with the Clinton administration to strengthen the US economy because then US public opinion will be more magnanimous about supporting Japan in times of need.' Second, Miti faces equally powerful opposition from the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan. Their worry is economic. They fear an attempt to reduce the trade surplus by stimulating the domestic economy's demand for imports will provoke a renewed bout of inflation in two or three years. Financial authorities believe the bubble economy of the end of 1980s was set off by economic policy in 1987, when the government introduced a Y6,000bn emergency spending package, partly in response to foreign pressure, when the economy was already out of recession. Mr Kosuke Yamamoto, who was in charge of industrial policy at Miti at that time, explains that Miti's ability to mobilise business and political pressure forced the Finance Ministry to double the size of the package from the initial Y3,000bn. The financial authorities are determined not to make the same mistake again. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, commented: 'An imminent need exists to put the economy on a sustainable growth path to get rid of the cyclical component of the surplus. Higher growth will to some extent reduce the surplus, but a significant amount will remain. If that is dealt with by macroeconomic policy, that could be very inflationary.' The implication is that the structural component of the surplus needs to be dealt with by microeconomic measures targeted at specific industries. Mr Mieno says: 'Market opening can be very useful'. When Mr Miyazawa lands in Washington, he should be singing a tune his officials have agreed. But that will be the outcome of a painful battle yet to peak in Tokyo.</p>

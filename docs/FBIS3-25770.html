Police  spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo was not immediately available to  comment, but police had cordoned off the area around the IFP  office in Albany Grove and were apparently attending to another  "bomb" in a nearby parking lot, said Mr Tillet.    "The first bomb was in the building," said Mr Tillet."The  other was outside in the garage where transport for our national  headquarters is kept."</p>

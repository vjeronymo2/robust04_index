			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / T&amp;N seeks Pounds 119m to reduce debt and modernise plant T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and general engineering group, is raising Pounds 119m (Dollars 204m) to reduce debt and fund its modernisation programme, as well as cutting a further 2,500 jobs. The money will be raised in a one-for-four rights issue at 140p a share. This comes little more than a year after a Pounds 127m, one-for-three cash call at 150p, which was related to the Dollars 190m acquisition of JP Industries, the US automotive parts maker. JPI brought in Dollars 176m debt, which drove up T&amp;N's borrowings to Pounds 248m by last December, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said one reason for the issue announced yesterday was to reduce that ratio to less than 30 per cent. Some market disappointment at the move was reflected in an 11p fall in the share price to 163p. The job losses follow cuts of 1,800 last year and will bring T&amp;N's total workforce down from 42,000 in December to fewer than 40,000. When the group announced its 1990 results in March, it provided for another 600 redundancies this year, but warned that the cuts were an ongoing process. Mr Hope said the brunt of the cuts would again be in the UK, where T&amp;N has 16,000 workers, and on the automotive side. Over two years, redundancies would cost the group about Pounds 21m. As UK component suppliers have had their margins squeezed by sharp falls in sales volumes, the 'big six' (Lucas Industries, GKN, Pilkington, BBA, T&amp;N and BTR) have shaken out about 5,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Warnings had already been issued that 1991 would see several thousand more disappear. Mr Hope said the labour cuts, spread over 150 factories in several countries, were also the consequence of investment in more efficient plant. Capital spending would be kept at more than Pounds 80m this year, compared with Pounds 89m in 1990. 'We want to maintain our investment programme and keep a sound balance sheet,' he said. He warned that the first-half results would be well below the Pounds 46.1m pre-tax recorded in last year's interims. They would be more like the second half of last year, when the taxable amount fell to Pounds 24.4m and earnings per share were little more than 4p. With interest costs rising to Pounds 15.6m in that half and an interim dividend of 3.6p to try to match, Mr Hope agreed there had been some concern about ratios other than the gearing. The board did, however, declare its intention to maintain the total dividend for 1991 at 10.85p. Mr Hope expected a second-half improvement as the benefit of lower costs came through and demand began to pick up. Last year, when T&amp;N's pre-tax profit fell 16 per cent to Pounds 70.5m on sales of Pounds 1.25bn, sharp declines were registered in continental Europe as well as in the UK. T&amp;N is more exposed to Fiat, Renault and Peugeot in Italy and France than to the busier German makers. Mr Hope said while the UK deteriorated further, France and Italy had improved a little.

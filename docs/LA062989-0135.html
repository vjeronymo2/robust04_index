			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASSENGERS STALLED AS AIRLINE HITS ROUGH TIMES  </P> <P> Air America, a small vacation airline that has experienced problems with its  aircraft, has caused hundreds of passengers to begin their holidays hanging  around Los Angeles International Airport for as long as two days.  </P> <P> A flight bound for Hawaii, scheduled to take off at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday with 350  passengers, finally left at 5 a.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> A flight to Nassau, the Bahamas, scheduled to leave at 11:30 p.m. last Friday  with more than 300 passengers, finally got off the ground on Sunday.  </P> <P> Travel agents said such delays on small airlines that have no backup equipment  are always a possibility. Arrangements for such charter or special vacation  package flights, they said, are usually made by passengers directly with the  airline in response to advertisements offering bargain fares.  </P> <P> "I don't want to say it is a common occurrence, but it is easy to see why a  small airline would incur problems like that because they are not always going  to have the resources to fall back on," said David Jeffrey, spokesman for  Airline Passengers of America, a nonprofit consumer lobbying group.  </P> <P> "When you pick between flying one of the biggest airlines in the world or a  little obscure one," Jeffrey said, "common sense is going to dictate that, on  the small one, there is a greater possibility of inconvenience."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Size Cited  </P> <P> Air America claims its problems stem from its size -- only five airplanes, all  wide-body L-1011s -- and the popularity of its destinations during this peak  summer vacation and holiday period.  </P> <P> Fred Davis, vice president of marketing for Air America, said the Nassau flight  was postponed last weekend because Lockheed had delayed delivery of a plane  that it was refurbishing for the airline. Davis said the airline expected to  get the plane by Friday but that it was actually delivered on Sunday.  </P> <P> He said the Hawaii flight was delayed several times Tuesday while mechanics  located the trouble indicated by an electrical component warning light. By 4  p.m., he said, they had found the problem, but it took all night to replace a  faulty throttle cable that runs from the cockpit to the tail of the aircraft.  </P> <P> "It is tough to be delayed that long. I feel sorry for the customers," Davis  said Wednesday after the plane left for Hawaii. "We tried to rent another  airplane from another airline, but every airline had all its equipment booked.  It is the start of summer vacations."  </P> <P> Davis said passengers were given meals and rooms overnight at the Airport  Hyatt.  </P> <P> He said passengers on the long-delayed Nassau flight were offered full refunds  if they chose to cancel their trips; or, if they chose to go, were housed in  the Hyatt and Quality Inn hotels at the airport until the plane took off, and  were given a $200 rebate when they landed in Nassau.  </P> <P> "Since some of the travel packages cost only $399," he said, "we thought that  was fair."  </P> <P> The little airline delayed a flight for 340 Hawaii vacationers 26 hours on July  6, 1988, when one of its planes needed a new fuel valve. When the part could  not be flown in from Chicago as arranged, Air America finally borrowed one from  another airline.  </P> <P> Even major airlines can have long flight delays, some travel agents said, if a  plane has a mechanical problem and all of the airline's other planes are in  use. But major carriers usually are better able to substitute equipment or find  spare parts.  </P> <P> Travel agents Mary Castiglione and Lydia Plona of Associated Travel Inc. in  downtown Los Angeles said they try to prepare passengers by giving them the  percentage of an airline's flights that are on time according to the Department  of Transportation.  </P> <P> Air America, said Plona, who had booked one passenger on a delayed Air America  flight to Hawaii, does not participate in that rating system.  </P></p>

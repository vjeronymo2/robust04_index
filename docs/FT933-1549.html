			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Recovery at Next continues with Pounds 23m NEXT, the fashion retailer that was an icon of the 1980s but came close to collapse at the end of the decade, continued its strong recovery yesterday, almost tripling interim profits from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 23m. The pre-tax figures for the six months to July 31 outstripped analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 18m, and the shares increased 4 1/2 p to 208 1/2 p. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said the improvement stemmed from better product quality and customer service as well as greater efficiency and lower mark-downs. Next has also broadened its customer appeal, retreating from the high fashion territory it strayed into during the 1980s. It now aims to provide 'good-taste, good-quality' products that are fashionable but durable. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said Next was no longer targeted at '25-year-old Porsche-driving yuppies', but at 'people who want a wardrobe which will last and not go out of fashion within months'. It has unified products across the high street and mail order divisions, leading to cost savings through bulk buying. Total turnover rose 9.6 per cent to Pounds 233.2m, while the high street stores increased sales 16.2 per cent to Pounds 160.9m, from 1.8 per cent less selling space. Next Directory, the catalogue division, lifted sales 8.8 per cent to Pounds 46.5m. Next said current trading at both divisions was up 10 per cent. The credit operation Club 24 increased the contribution from its ongoing business from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.6m, with a further Pounds 3.3m profit (from a Pounds 2.2m loss) arising from debt collection by its third-party debt funding business, which is being wound down. Next shrunk from 305 to 298 stores, but has now finished its rationalisation programme. Selling space may increase marginally, but the company believes it is close to the natural limit for profitable stores in the UK. Lord Wolfson said there was still considerable scope to improve the trading performance and it did not intend to rush into expansion or diversification. The company has opened one experimental store in the US: start-up costs of Pounds 1.1m were charged to the interim accounts. The dividend was tripled to 1.5p. Earnings per share increased to 5.5p from 2p.</p>

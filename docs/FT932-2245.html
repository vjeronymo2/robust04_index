			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Toyota unveils cost-cutting plan TOYOTA, Japan's largest car group, will reduce the number of styles on individual models and standardise some components to curb costs. The group might also review investment plans and seek cuts in administrative expenses, but did not plan any job reductions, said Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president. This is the latest example of the Japanese car industry's attempts to slim costs in line with depressed demand, down 10 per cent there last month. It indicates that European and US carmakers will be hard put to close the cost gap between themselves and their Japanese competitors as they take an axe to their own workforces. However, Mr Toyoda believed 'the gap between relative costs won't be so wide,' on export markets because of the impact of the yen's strength. 'Over the past five years, we might have set too high a sales target and increased variations of sales perhaps too drastically,' said Mr Toyoda. Yet he saw no need to reduce the 74,000 workforce since Toyota had a labour shortage only three years ago and could well have one again in the future. Instead, Mr Toyoda was seeking to reduce average annual working time from 2,300 hours to 1,900 hours 'more in line with international norms,' he said. Mr Toyoda expected the group's overseas production to grow from 800,000 units to 1.5m units over the next few years, some of which would replace exports from Japan, rather than being additional output. The group's world output was 3.9m units last year, of which 1.7m were exported. Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese carmaker, will use engines and transmissions manufactured by Chrysler in its US-made cars for the first time and plans to export cars made in the US to Europe from next spring. The move comes as Japanese carmakers have been hit hard by the rapid appreciation of the yen, which has reduced their competitiveness by forcing many to raise prices overseas. The Japanese carmakers are also restricted by an agreement between Japan and the EC to restrict Japanese car exports to the Community to a mutually agreed level until 1999. Mitsubishi hopes to sell 10,000 annually of its cars which will use Chrysler engines and transmissions.</p>

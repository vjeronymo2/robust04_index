			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Yuriy Kozlov, </F> Valeriy Sevryukov]    [Text] Moscow, 1 Jun -- The church may play a significant  positive role in the Balkans in settling the Bosnian crisis.  This was stated here today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Besides talks with  Russian diplomatic head Andrey Kozyrev the program for the Greek  minister's visit has also included a meeting with Aleksiy II,  the patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.    Touching on the importance of the efforts of the Russian  Orthodox Church in the Balkans, Papoulias said: "We support  such initiatives because they are aimed at defending peace.  These are humane initiatives helping to settle many issues with  due consideration for the historic role the Orthodox Church  plays in the south of Europe."    One should not forget the common Orthodox roots existing  between our peoples, the Greek minister continued. He noted  that during their talks Kozyrev expressed anxiety over "the  unpleasant incidents and provocations against the Universal  Istanbul Patriarchic," which there had been in Istanbul.    The Russian foreign political department and the Russian  Orthodox Church are in constant contact, Kozyrev told an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. We highly appreciate the peace-making  efforts of Patriarch Aleksiy II. One should note that in our  relationship with Greece and a number of other countries  religion serves as "a firm spiritual foundation that imbues it  with a cordial character".    The Russian minister cited specific examples related to  Murmansk oblast from which he was elected a State Duma deputy.  An Orthodox church is now being restored in Murmansk.  Unfortunately, Kozyrev said, after 70 years of militant atheism  it is being done practically from scratch and mainly through the  efforts of parishioners and the public. At present at our  request and with the most active participation of the Russian  Orthodox Church our Greek co-religionists render help in  creating an iconoclastic for this church.    Besides making use of the hospitality of Orthodox  co-religionists, we send children from Russia's northern areas  for rest and treatment in Greece which is famous for its  heavenly climate. In the near future a trip to Greece by a group  from Archangel is being prepared. To tell the truth, Irina  Kozyreva, the minister's wife, could obviously tell about this  in more detail as she heads the Russia's Care charitable  foundation to help children on a voluntary basis.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Allied troops sent to aid Kurds: US, British, French forces to set up safe zones in northern Iraq TROOPS FROM Britain, the US and France are to set up protective zones in northern Iraq as part of a greatly expanded aid effort for Kurdish refugees announced last night by President George Bush. Warning that he expected Iraq not to interfere, Mr Bush said the presence of the troops - who would be given air cover - would allow easier distribution of food, medicine and clothing. Mr Bush's announcement, sharply reversing previously stated policy, came after a day of intense diplomatic activity involving Mr John Major, United Nations officials and representatives of other allies in the war against Iraq. His decision was taken after consultation with Britain, France, Germany and Turkey. The president said the refugee sites would be turned over as soon as possible to the United Nations. Stressing that the US had no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or becoming involved in its domestic turmoil, he vowed that the US would not get sucked into 'another Vietnam-style quagmire'. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the teams would move 'in and out for short periods of time - I mean hours' to help build camps, transport refugees or distribute food and water. They would not be involved in any military action. The UK government said last night that British troops would be helping to meet 'the urgent humanitarian needs' of the refugees fleeing the troops of President Saddam Hussein. In London, the US decision was hailed as a vindication of Mr Major's initiative at last week's European Community summit in Luxembourg to create 'safe havens' in Iraq for the Kurds. The move was endorsed by other EC leaders. Details on the number of troops to be deployed, not immediately available last night, seemed likely to emerge today. British officials stressed that the deployment did not represent a direct military intervention in Iraq's civil war. The expectation was that the British forces would be relatively few, but one senior official said there might have to be a significant commitment of 'air cover' to guarantee the safety of troops on the ground. Mr Major said: 'We expect the Iraqi government to co-operate with this further measure to ensure the effective implementation of resolution 688 and with the (UN) secretary general's efforts for the refugees.' There are an estimated 600,000 Iraqi refugees on the Turkish border. About 400,000 are inside Turkey, and 1m on Iraq's border with Iran. Mr Bush said that in spite of a massive relief campaign by western and other humanitarian groups, the efforts had so far failed. The objective was to bring the Kurds down from the mountainous regions where they had congregated along Iraq's northern border with Turkey and Iran. 'If we cannot get adequate food, clothing and shelter to the Kurds living in the mountains, then we must encourage the Kurds to move to an area in northern Iraq where the geography facilitates . . . such a large scale relief effort,' the president said. President Bush has repeatedly said his first objective, now that Kuwait's sovereignty has been restored, is to 'bring the kids home.' However, an outcry over the refugee problem has caused him to mount a massive relief operation. About 8,300 Americans - mostly military personnel - are already deployed in Turkey in support of a relief effort which the White House says is perhaps the largest in history. The troops are providing air and land transportation, medical, engineering assistance and water purification. At a news conference after his announcement, Mr Bush raised the possibility of exile for the Iraqi leader in a third country where he would not be hunted down for war crimes. It was 'important to the tranquility of Iraq' to remove him. Kuwait bombs Page 16 Turkey rejects criticism of relief effort Page 4</p>

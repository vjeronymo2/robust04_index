			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlad Ignatov: ``Workers of Intellectual Labor Go </F> on Permanent Strike, but Would Prefer to Talk'']  txt}[Text]  <H5>  Discontent </H5>   Scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS),  inspired  by their trade union, have gathered to picket the building of  the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. The demands  of participants in the strike are not very different from the  ultimatums to the government stated by miners, oil field workers  or communications workers. ``We want payment of what is owing to  the RAS for 1993, payment of the shortfall for January and  February of 1994, compensation for inflation due to late  allocation of funds for the pay raise in 1993, and also  reimbursement for incomplete compensation of increased cost of  communal payments for the period from 1 April 1993 through 1  February 1994.'' So goes the printed statement of the Trade  Union of Workers of the RAS addressed to Sergey Dubinin, acting  ministry of finances of Russia. According to calculations of  union bosses of the RAS, the total indebtedness of the  government to the Academy of Sciences is more than 108 billion  rubles per year.    But this time, they did not strike, preferring talks with  the  government. However, unfortunately extreme forms of protest  (strikes and the like) have become a very popular ploy among  Russian scientists. More precisely, among their trade unions.  There might be more of them on strike than miners. And so what?  A whole series of demonstrations put on by scientists, draping  the statue of General Lomonosov in rags and symbolically burying  science, have not wrested a single copeck from the budget. As  the noted economist Nikolay Shmelev recently remarked, the  government has no money to be found, even on the night-table of  the minister of finances.    In return, the very theoretical and research activity for  which the RAS is fighting has suffered considerable losses  because of these actions. In the words of Professor Granit  Fedorov, one of the organizers of picketing of the Ministry of  Finance and of a proposed subsequent nationwide protest, member  of the Russian council of the trade union of the RAS, for the  last two decades the rate of doubling of human knowledge has  grown by a factor of more than 50, and the loss of each day of  creative activity is in proportion.    In answer to the question of SEGODNYA's correspondent  whether  trade unions of scientists are capable of any forms of  protecting the interests of their members that are more  constructive than pickets and strikes, Vladimir Khlebodarov,  director of trade unions of the RAS, stated that the trade union  is ``ready to talk about the substance of the demands.'' But it  would seem that in this country at this time, the outcome of  such talks is foreordained.</p>

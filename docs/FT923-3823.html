			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Dedicated provider of a public service - Andrew Clark talks to Hugues Gall, director of Geneva's opera house ASK Hugues Gall, director of Geneva's Grand Theatre, why there are no star singers in his opera programme, and the answer is unequivocal. 'We're handling public money. We're providing a cultural service, so the aim is to satisfy our public with a balanced policy, not to make big splashes. 'We're not interested in singers flying in for three or four performances, for which we have to charge gala prices. We want consistency throughout the run. We want a repertory balanced between the 17th century and the present, and a policy which makes each season a link in the chain between past and future. This is our mission culturelle.' As Europe's opera managers prepare for the onslaught of a new season, many wish they could follow Gall's approach. After 12 years in Geneva, Gall, 52, commands international respect for the quality of his programme. His cast-lists are full of young, talented singers, but he still attracts top-rank artists for lower fees than they receive elsewhere. His widely-spaced stagione programme means that each production is properly rehearsed. With no resident music director or ensemble, he has complete personal control over choice of repertoire, cast and production team. He has a 98 per cent attendance record, with more than 50 per cent of seats sold in subscriptions before the season begins - reducing his dependence on safe repertoire. The top seat price is less than Pounds 50. Gall, a self-effacing Frenchman who served his apprenticeship under Rolf Liebermann at the Paris Opera in the 1970s, is the first to admit that Geneva conditions cannot and should not be reproduced elsewhere. He points to the different artistic traditions and political circumstances of leading companies. His prescription for success is simple: 'First, you need complete political support from the government which subsidises you. Then you need a strong management team with a clear vision of how they want the institution to develop.' With 75 per cent of his own budget coming from the Geneva taxpayer, Gall is a firm believer in culture as a public service. Like most of his continental colleagues, he was appalled by the erosion of government support for the arts in Britain during the 1980s, and says the international reputation of the Royal Opera has suffered as a result. 'British companies deserve less criticism for the struggles they have, because their ratio between quality and public subsidy is better than in any other country. 'What British companies have achieved with limited resources is incredible. You can make up for money to some extent with imagination, talent and management skills, but that limit has long been passed at Covent Garden. National institutions should never be obliged to find so much private money.' Gall is no disinterested observer: an unashamed Anglophile, he was the only foreigner invited to contribute to the Priestley report on Covent Garden, commissioned by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s. Nor does he reject sponsorship - 'as long as it is only icing on the cake. As soon as you increase your dependence on private funding, by raising seat prices or giving blocks of tickets to sponsors, you change your public. It becomes less democratic and often less discerning.' 'We don't despise sponsors, but they're not a 'spontaneous' public - if it was free, you wouldn't see 1 per cent of these people. That's what I mean by mission culturelle: in Europe we've achieved a lot of things better than other parts of the world, and that includes the way we pay for the arts. The state provides not just for our physical health but our cultural well-being.' But in these recessionary times, can any opera company escape the financial squeeze? Gall acknowledges that when governments cut spending, culture budgets are often the first to suffer. The best defence for opera companies, he says, is to show the breadth of their appeal - one reason why Geneva has reluctantly embraced surtitles. 'If I was running a major festival like Glyndebourne or Salzburg, I would stick to my convictions and resist surtitles: people who can afford that sort of time and money should also have time and money to do their homework. But I accept surtitles in my own theatre because we want to make it easy for people to join the club, to open our doors to a wider public. 'Two or three generations ago, people were born into the club, it was in the family, you didn't need to tell the story of Manon because the opera public learned it at home. Today, opera companies have to provide political justification for the money they receive.' As far as singers are concerned, Gall bemoans the fact that most national operatic schools - France and Italy included - can no longer adequately cast their native repertory with native talent. That is one reason why he admires Britain. He speaks of British singers' professionalism and artistry, of their ability to adapt to other traditions and styles; the list of British singers regularly invited to Geneva is proof of his faith. He welcomes the increased mobility of singers in the jet age, but has no sympathy for the minority who abuse it. He has successfully sued artists who broke their Geneva contracts to pick up better-paid work elsewhere. Not that he begrudges the stars their astronomic fees. 'Gold is gold, and the pleasure of hearing a unique voice like Pavarotti's can never be measured in terms of money. Today's stars are no more nor less concerned about money than Caruso, Melba or Tamagno were. Fortunately, such artists are not crucial for an opera season. In Geneva, we hire singers not because they sell well, but because we think they'll be good. 'When everything works - when sound, singing and staging are in harmony. . . people forget how much they've paid for their ticket.' Gustave Charpentier's Louise, conducted by Armin Jordan and staged by Christian Aeby, opens the 1992-3 season in Geneva tomorrow. The production runs till September 27</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: A good wine and a bush - At a glance Witan, an international general investment trust managed by Henderson, has launched a campaign to attract investors. The trust is waiving the 3 per cent initial charge on its personal equity plan and has cut the annual management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent. Dealing charges are 1.25 per cent. Those who invest Pounds 6,000 in a Witan Pep before April 30 can receive either a year's free membership of the Royal Horticultural Society plus a rose bush; half a case of wines; or a 1993 Royal Mint UK proof coin set.</p>

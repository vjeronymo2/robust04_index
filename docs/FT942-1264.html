			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Private king - Profile / Mohamad Hasan In the tight-knit Indonesian business community, the same names keep cropping up - such as Mr Mohamad Hasan. Universally known as Bob, Mr Hasan heads one of the small number of enormous personal business empires which control much of the country's economic activity. By his own count, Mr Hasan owns more than 100 companies with interests ranging from forestry and construction to insurance and banking. But although his wiry figure and impish looks are a familiar public sight, his personal affairs have remained very private - often wrapped up in the yayasans, or quasi-charitable foundations which conceal much of Indonesia's wealth. Mr Hasan has never floated shares on the public exchanges. In a recent interview he said his group made no use of debt either. But the influence of the Hasan empire extends well beyond mere business. Mr Hasan is close to President Suharto, whom he got to know in the 1950s when he was a regional military commander. Today the two meet regularly to play golf. The mere association of Mr Hasan with some initiative is enough to get it off the ground. Like most of Indonesia's business tycoons, Mr Hasan is of Chinese ethnic origin - a somewhat touchy matter in a country which resents Chinese commercial domination. But if this has been a disadvantage, it is greatly outweighed by his links with Suharto, which are closer than any cabinet member's. To reinforce these ties, Mr Hasan changed his name (it was originally The Kian Sang), and converted to Islam, joining Suharto on the haj to Mecca. He is also said to make a point of not employing Chinese staff. The heart of the Hasan empire lies in forestry and wood products. His personal power base is reinforced by his chairmanship of Apkindo, the Indonesian plywood trade association whose members account for over three quarters of the plywood supplied to the world market. This forestry connection has made him a controversial figure, not merely because of Apkindo's powerful grip on the wood products business, but also because of international concern about the destruction of the rain forests. Mr Hasan denies that Apkindo sets prices: 'That would get us in a lot of trouble.' He has also gone on the offensive to defend Indonesia's forestry practices, visiting Strasbourg earlier this year to put his case to Euro-MPs. 'We want the world to know that we care about our forests,' he says, adding that Indonesia has a detailed plan for its forest management, and has embarked on initiatives to enforce the law on concession holders, such as aerial surveillance and an eco-labelling scheme. Asked about the extent of illegal logging, he says; 'There's a small quantity.' Mr Hasan believes that natural resources must underpin Indonesia's economic growth. 'Everyone is going into electronics, cars and steel. But you need a table to put your computer on, a case for the diskette. We can make those things. They're complementary.' Now in his 60s, Mr Hasan has begun to pull back from direct day to day involvement with his businesses. His real interests, he says, are the string of sporting and community causes with which he is involved. He heads Indonesia's athletics, gymnastics, golf and chess associations. He is also a member of the Business Council for Sustainable Development  - the Swiss-based group of environmentally concerned businessmen - and is in the process of setting up an Indonesian branch of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. 'These are my businesses. My industries are my hobbies,' he says.</p>

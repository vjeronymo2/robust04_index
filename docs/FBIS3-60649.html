In an interview with CTK, the diplomat did not rule out the  possibility that Israel's concerns could become one of the  topics of Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's upcoming  visit to Israel, scheduled for December 12-14.    The diplomat also based his suspicion on an October 28  report  in the French daily LE POINT, according to which the Czech firm  Skoda Plzen allegedly signed an agreement with Iran to supply  technology for nuclear reactors in exchange for deliveries of  oil products.    Referring to Skoda's cooperation with Iran in nuclear  engineering, the manager for technical service of nuclear power  plants of the Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi Plzen company,  Frantisek Svitak, said today that Iran was interested in  constructing a nuclear power plant and that Skoda could supply  it with reactor equipment through the mediation of a Russian  general supplier.    In the interview with CTK, the Israeli diplomat pointed to  similar deliveries to Iraq before the Persian Gulf War and  stressed that Iran currently represented the biggest threat to  Israel.    Skoda General Director Lubomir Soudek visited Iran at the  end  of November and the beginning of December where he negotiated  the possibility of cooperation in energy, transport engineering  and the sugar industry.    During his recent visit to Prague, Israeli Acting Defence  Minister Mordechai Gur told CTK that supplies of armaments and  military systems to the Teheran government by unnamed European  countries have turned Iran into a threat to world peace. He  said then that Israel would welcome the Czech Republic's  participation in the Middle East peace process by exerting  pressure on countries such as Iran and by controlling its  exports to prevent these countries from pursuing aggressive and  militant policies.    According to Israeli Analyst Dani Kesem, who was quoted by  the Czech press this week, Skoda is becoming for the American  company Westinghouse and for the German concern Siemens the gate  to the Iranian nuclear market. This statement was immediately  denied by Skoda Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec who said he considered  it misleading.    Skoda effectively cooperates with Westinghouse in developing  nuclear fuel for the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power  reactor) 1000 reactor destined for the Temelin nuclear power  plant in Southern Bohemia, Svitak told CTK today.    He said that non-active model tests are currently being  conducted at Skoda's testing facilities for Westinghouse which  is supplying models of nuclear fuel, to check the suitability of  its nuclear fuels for the VVER 1000 reactor.    Svitak said that Skoda had been promised it could provide  similar tests at its testing facilities to check nuclear fuel  for the VVER 440 reactors. With these reactors are equipped,  for example, the nuclear power plants in Dukovany, Southern  Moravia, and in Jaslovske Bohunice, Western Slovakia. It has  not yet been decided which firm will supply this fuel.  Westinghouse, Siemens, the French Framatome, and Swedish-Swiss  ABB are participating in the selection process.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Mercury helps C&amp;W rise STRONG growth at Mercury, the UK telecommunications company, helped its parent Cable and Wireless to increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 824m in the year to March. C&amp;W also made an exceptional profit of Pounds 118m on the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Mercury to Bell Canada Enterprises. Mercury's turnover rose by a third to exceed Pounds 1bn for the first time. It claims to have secured 10.5 per cent of the UK telecoms market from BT, against 8.5 per cent a year ago. At Pounds 3.83bn, group turnover was 22 per cent up on last year's Pounds 3.12bn. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 918m (from Pounds 644m) after exceptional items, which also included a Pounds 60m gain on the conversion of warrants acquired in the creation of Hongkong Telecom in 1988, and an Pounds 83m charge for the write-down of undersea cables. Lord Young, C&amp;W's chairman, said group strategy was based on expanding from its three 'hubs' of western Europe, Asia/Pacific (where it has a majority stake in Hongkong Telecom), and the Caribbean (where operations include a 79 per cent stake in Telecoms of Jamaica). 'Strategic partnerships will come to shape our industry. We intend to develop clusters around our three hubs, building on the critical mass we already have in the three regions,' he said. Asia-Pacific remains easily the largest of C&amp;W's three regions. Turnover there was Pounds 1.7bn, up 20 per cent, with operating profits 16 per cent higher at Pounds 563m. Hongkong Telecom benefited from a 26.5 per cent increase in international call volume. In the UK, Mercury's assault on the small business and domestic markets, previously virtual BT monopolies, mostly accounted for the 50 per cent increase in ordered lines over the year. At the end of March Mercury had 474,000 lines for residential customers and 535,000 for small businesses, compared with 67,000 for the two sectors combined four years ago. Before exceptional items, operating profit in the Caribbean region increased by 11 per cent. C&amp;W blamed slower growth on continuing US recession. At March 31 C&amp;W's gearing stood at 13.2 per cent, down from 25.9 per cent last year. A final dividend of 10.1p per share was declared, making a total of 14.85p, against 13.25p. Earnings per share rose from 30.1p to 47.5p. Excluding exceptionals, earnings were 38.8p per share, up 6 per cent. C&amp;W's shares closed 13p up at 777p. The company plans a one-for-one share split, to improve the shares' marketability. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 24 London SE, Page 42</p>

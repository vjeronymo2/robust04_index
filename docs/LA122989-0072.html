			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART SOCCER TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CAMARILLO TO STAY FOR FINAL AFTER JOINING AS LATE ENTRY  </P> <P> The Camarillo High boys' soccer team would have been home for the holidays had  it not been for St. Bonaventure's inability to field a team.  </P> <P> Camarillo Coach John Alfino received a phone call from Hart tournament  officials Dec. 21 asking the Scorpions to fill the vacancy left after the  Seraphs withdrew from the tournament.  </P> <P> After a 1-0 victory over Newbury Park in a semifinal match Thursday, Camarillo  will play for the tournament championship against San Fernando today at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> "It's kind of ironic," Alfino said. "We weren't in this thing a week ago and  now we're in the final.  </P> <P> "If we wind up winning this thing they might be sorry they let us in."  </P> <P> Newbury Park, a Marmonte League rival of Camarillo, was not at full strength.  The Panthers (8-3) had only nine of their 18 players, forcing Coach Ben Buttner  to bring up six players from the junior varsity.  </P> <P> "Our whole defense has gone skiing," Buttner said. 'I think we can take  Camarillo when we have the rest of our team."  </P> <P> Camarillo (7-0) broke a scoreless tie with four minutes to play when left wing  Chris Sampson took a head shot from six yards off Marcus Hanson's crossing  pass.  </P> <P> Sampson's shot, just out of the reach of Newbury Park goalkeeper John  Casarietti, found the upper-right corner of the net.  </P> <P> Newbury Park took just six shots on goal, and Buttner said in order for his  team to score one or two goals in a match, it has to take about 20 shots.  </P> <P> In other matches:  </P> <P> San Fernando 2, Hart 1 -- Midfielder Marco Zanbrano scored with 10 minutes left  to snap a 1-1 deadlock and lift the Tigers (7-0-2) into the tournament final.  </P> <P> Trailing, 1-0, at halftime, San Fernando tied the score, 1-1, in the second  half on forward Fabian Galvan's goal at the 15-minute mark. Striker David  Rosales had scored with five minutes to play in the half to give Hart (4-1-1) a  1-0 lead.  </P> <P> San Fernando played a man short for most of the second half. Tereso Delgado  received consecutive yellow cards -- which constitutes a red card -- and was  ejected at the five-minute mark.  </P> <P> Harvard 2, Palmdale 1 -- The Falcons led, 1-0, at halftime but Harvard scored  two goals in the first nine minutes of the second half in the fifth-place game.  </P> <P> Midfielder Scott Malin scored from 20 yards on a rebound shot to tie the score,  1-1, at the seven-minute mark. Two minutes later, midfielder Aristides Alberto,  on an assist from Jerome Schwartz, put the Saracens (8-2-2) ahead to stay.  </P> <P> Canyon 3, Victor Valley 0 -- Forward Jeff Ferguson scored goals at the two- and  28-minute marks in the first half to pace the Cowboys (3-3) in a fifth-place  semifinal.  </P> <P> Canyon goalkeeper Chris Littleford made 10 saves.  </P> <P> Alemany 1, Granada Hills 0 -- After playing to a 0-0 tie in regulation,  fullback Marcus Bradley scored the winning goal in a shoot-out to lift the  Indians (6-1-1) into the consolation championship against Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill 1, Hollywood 0 -- Forward Bryon Richards scored in a shoot-out.  </P></p>

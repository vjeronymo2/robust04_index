			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Farmers fear being forced to leave the land European farmers' organisations warned yesterday that, unless important changes were made to the proposed Uruguay Round farm deal, a third of Europe's 10m-11m farmers would be forced to leave the land. The Committee of Agricultural Organisations (Copa) and the General Committee for Agricultural Co-operation (Cogeca), grouping farmers' organisations in all 12 EU member states, said in Geneva that the current draft agreement on farm trade reform would more than double the amount of productive land left fallow, halve farm incomes and cripple the rural economy. Their complaints were echoed in more strident form by French farmers' groups and the European Farmers Co-ordination, representing small farmers across Europe, who plan a big demonstration in Geneva on Saturday against the proposed reforms. However, Mr Hans Kjeldsen, president of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers which brings together farming organisations from over 50 countries, said yesterday that a failure of the Uruguay Round this time would be 'a disaster for farming worldwide' because of the risk of increased protectionism and trade war. At the same time, farmers needed reassurance that a Gatt accord would sustain 'a more dynamic and sustainable role' for agriculture. 'If we want to maintain rural life, we need viable farmers,' he added. Both Mr Kjeldsen and the representatives of Copa and Cogeca were in Geneva to see Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, amid speculation that the meeting in Brussels yesterday and today between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, could produce a revised farm accord. Mr Augusto Bocchini, Copa president, said yesterday that the present draft Uruguay Round farm deal would go well beyond reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and unilaterally penalise European agriculture. It would cut European exports of farm products by about a third, on average, and lead to a considerable increase in imports, while excluding the EU from participating in any expansion of world farm trade. Total compensation payments now envisaged under CAP reform would have to double to maintain present income levels for those farmers still managing to survive, he said. Echoing demands made by France for changes in last year's US-EU Blair House accord on farm subsidies, Copa and Cogeca are urging a reordering of the timetable for cuts in the volume of subsidised exports, so that the impact is felt more evenly over the six-year transition period. The two organisations also want an indefinite 'peace clause' that would prevent the US and others from challenging EU farm policies during the reform process, effective safeguards against price and currency fluctuations and restraints on imports of cereal substitutes.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Regulating taxis LONDON'S DISTINCTIVE black cabs are like old-style red telephone boxes or the King James Bible. They have become part of the fabric of national life. News that the government is considering deregulating taxis and minicabs throughout the UK will, therefore, in some quarters, be taken as a sign that ministers are pushing free-market economics well beyond its sane limit. Does not the gruelling 'knowledge' test that London's cabbies have to pass ensure that they take the shortest route and rarely get lost? Are not the cabs themselves well suited to performing tight turns in narrow streets and catering for the needs of those in wheelchairs? Does not regulation give security to women travelling at night and protect passengers from being ripped off? There is some truth in these points. Certainly a free-for-all would not be desirable. In one respect, current regulations are even too lax. Minicab drivers in London (but not other parts of the UK) are not licensed at all. At a minimum, there should be a check on drivers to see whether they have criminal records. There is also a need for fares to be regulated. Passengers hailing taxis on the street are not in a good bargaining position and so need to be protected from exploitation. Similarly, there is a case for ensuring that some taxis can cope with wheelchairs. But regulations need not be so onerous. In particular, the various barriers to entering the trade should be eased. Provided they meet basic regulatory requirements, minicabs should be allowed greater freedom to ply for hire, rather than being exclusively restricted to telephone bookings. While there is a case for regulating the number of taxis in an area, in order to prevent competition getting out of hand in the way that it has in some cities following bus deregulation, there should be a bias towards easier entry into the market. There is also a case for relaxing fare controls. The snag with the current system is that all taxis in a particular area charge the same fare while minicabs cannot compete freely. The simplest option would be to make clear that regulated fares are maximum prices not uniform rates. Competing taxis would then be allowed to advertise their fares as such-and-such a percentage discount from the maximum. Ministers should also explore ways of meeting the needs of disabled people without requiring all London taxis to use costly black cabs. One option would be to require a certain portion of the taxi fleet to be adapted for wheelchair use and compensate their owners. Other cabbies would then be free to choose other vehicles if they wished. The government's challenge is to find a way of regulating taxis with a light touch while maintaining good standards of safety and customer protection. If it can achieve this, fares will fall and the availability of taxis increase.</p>

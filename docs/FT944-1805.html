			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Hedge funds settle claims Two US hedge funds agreed to pay Dollars 76m to settle charges that they manipulated the US Treasury bond market in April 1991. Steinhardt Management and Caxton had been accused by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission of a market 'squeeze', in which they conspired to corner the market in two-year Treasury notes to drive up prices. According to the authorities, they took positions worth Dollars 20bn in a Dollars 12bn issue of notes, enabling them to make illegal profits of Dollars 35m. The settlement, in which neither fund admitted or denied the allegations, is unrelated to the bigger Treasury market 'squeeze' for which Salomon Brothers admitted responsibility two years ago.</p>

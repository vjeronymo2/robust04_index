			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Profits of Pounds 62m for MoD agency The Defence Research Agency, the science arm of the Ministry of Defence, yesterday reported an operating profit of Pounds 62m for the year to March 31, up from Pounds 39m last year. This was in spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 796m to Pounds 771m. Redundancy costs of Pounds 40m and other restructuring charges meant that overall profits were only Pounds 2.6m, however. The workforce fell to 10,004 from 11,094 in the year with the bulk of redundancies in the engineering services and quality assurance departments. These lost business because the MoD stopped buying some services from the DRA. Up to 1,000 further redundancies are likely this year. The agency was converted into a quasi-autonomous trading fund in April last year as part of the government's market reforms of the civil service. As a result it now produces annual audited accounts as though it were a private-sector company. More than 90 per cent of its work comes from the MoD, although the agency is trying to increase the proportion of commercial work and to develop 'dual use' technologies which have both civil and military applications. Work from the MoD will decline further as a result of the 'front-line first' defence review, with Pounds 50m being cut from the agency's long-term research effort. The MoD will no longer fund work which is unlikely to lead to practical weapons in the next 20 years. Mr John Chisholm, the agency's chief executive, said that the first year's operations as a trading fund had been a success. Productivity had improved and the agency had cut its fixed costs to combat the decline in research income. Mr Chisholm said that the agency was meeting 85 per cent of its deadlines compared with 50 per cent three years ago.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ERROR;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: CHIP BANKS IS PLAYING WELL FOR THE COLTS, BUT THE FORMER CHARGER  ALSO IS JUST ONE FAILED DRUG TEST AWAY FROM BANISHMENT BY THE NFL.  </P> <P> The docudrama that Chip Banks' life has become gets played out every day at a  barnlike training complex located on the drab flatlands that make up the  outskirts of downtown Indianapolis.  </P> <P> This is where the Colts practice. And this is where they watch and wait to see  or hear what will become of the troubled 30-year-old left outside linebacker  they took in trade from the Chargers Oct. 17.  </P> <P> "I can't say that I don't think about it," says Duane Bickett, the Colts' Pro  Bowl right outside linebacker who was a teammate of Banks at USC. "Every  morning, when I walk into the locker room, and I don't see Chip, I say, 'Shoot,  I hope nothing's happened.'  </P> <P> "You know what I mean? It might be that he just hasn't come in yet or whatever.  But it's always there."  </P> <P> Banks, you see, is one random urinalysis away from being the next Dexter  Manley. One more positive drug test, and Banks, like the Redskins' Manley, will  be banned for life by the NFL from doing what he does best.  </P> <P> And the odds are stacked, like a short-yardage defense, against him. Statistics  show that more than 50% of cocaine abusers who have undergone rehabilitative  therapy end up backsliding into the dark world of drugs.  </P> <P> "You can't revert," Banks tells himself every day.  </P> <P> "It's possible to stay clean," he tells himself. "It's not impossible."  </P> <P> But, he adds in the next measured breath, "it's also possible for me to mess up  next week. You flip a coin every day."  </P> <P> The drug experts emphasize that addiction is a disease. Curing the disease is  more than just a matter of willpower. "Just Say No" is fine if you haven't made  cocaine a habit. "Just Pray No" is more realistic once the demon has gotten  inside you.  </P> <P> "People have come back from lower ditches and gutters than me to lead clean and  sober lives," Banks says. "All things can be accomplished with the grace of  God."  </P> <P> Only God knows why he blessed Banks with the size, strength and speed that made  Banks graceful enough on the field to become an All-American, the third player  selected in the 1982 draft, a four-time Pro Bowl participant and a man who has  started all 90 of the NFL games in which he has played.  </P> <P> "This guy is sculptured," says Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer of Banks, who is  6-feet-4, 245 pounds.  </P> <P> It is one day after the Colts have beaten the Jets and six days before they  will face the Chargers, Banks' former teammates. Meyer -- wearing a pressed  blazer, and a wide-striped, button-down shirt, with matching tie -- sits behind  a huge desk, shuffles a stack of papers, leans forward and makes a confession.  </P> <P> "Maybe I'm too soft," he says. "I'm prejudiced. I like football players."  </P> <P> So much so that between the time the Patriots fired him as their coach in 1984  and the Colts hired him in 1986, Meyer served as a player agent.  </P> <P> In 1988, Meyer took a similar chance with former Patriot running back Tony  Collins. Collins subsequently failed an NFL drug test and wound up in a  hospital.  </P> <P> Meyer knows the same thing could happen to Banks, which is part of the reason  he chats privately in his office with Banks at least once a week.  </P> <P> Banks lives in a hotel room near the Colts complex. And he continues to receive  ongoing outpatient drug therapy in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Banks also talks on the phone regularly with David Katz, the San Diego-based  therapist who guided Banks through the rigorous 90-day rehabilitation program  at the Rancho L'Abri institute in Dulzura, Calif.  </P> <P> Banks says Katz, 39, has been free of drugs and alcohol for several years and  calls him "a living miracle."  </P> <P> Banks left San Diego against Katz's wishes. "Chip knows how I feel about it,"  he says. "But his dedication to recovery was on line, or else I wouldn't have  let him go."  </P> <P> Katz was an ironworker in San Diego until he became "extremely addicted" to  drugs and alcohol 10 years ago.  </P> <P> "How low did it get for me?" he asks, repeating the question. "It got to a  point where I was having seizures on a daily basis, neurological deterioration,  and my liver was giving out."  </P> <P> Katz says his wife took their three children and "went east." He hasn't seen  them since and doesn't know where they are. Before he sought professional help,  he was sleeping in the homes of various people at night and collecting money  for drug peddlers by day.  </P> <P> "I'm a former football player," he says. "So I was kind of big. I was like a  henchman."  </P> <P> When Katz finally tried to get into a downtown San Diego detoxification center,  it was full. So he waited three days and slept in the garbage dumpster outside  the building. "That's pretty low," he says matter-of-factly.  </P> <P> From detox, Katz moved onto a seven-day program and then into a long-term rehab  that took seven months. For the next 18 months after that, he lived next door  to the rehab center.  </P> <P> He says he has been drug and alcohol free for six years and working as a  therapist for the past four.  </P> <P> It was Katz who helped convince the NFL to reinstate Banks before the trade  deadline. It was not an easy sell.  </P> <P> Between February 1988 and last June, Banks, who grew up in Augusta, Ga., was  arrested four times in Atlanta on cocaine and marijuana possession charges. On  Oct. 11, an Atlanta judge sentenced him to five years probation for a cocaine  possession conviction. The sentence is running concurrently with a five-year  probation for a March marijuana conviction.  </P> <P> "He has a storied past," Meyer says. Hence, the private chats.  </P> <P> "I'm not naive enough to think we have all the answers," Meyer says "We just  take it day to day. Hour to hour."  </P> <P> In their meetings, Meyer asks questions. "Painful questions," he says. And  Banks weighs his responses. The subjects they discuss have very little to do  with football.  </P> <P> "Chip knows the tremendous ramifications if he falls out of line," Meyer says.  "All you have to do is look at Dexter Manley."  </P> <P> Manley's banishment over the weekend hit Banks' teammates hard. "We thought  Tony Collins was going to make the team," Bickett says. "It's not like we  haven't seen this before."  </P> <P> Manley's banishment hit Banks harder. "It was like it was almost me who did  it," he says. "It really upset me that a guy with his talent would jeopardize  his whole career."  </P> <P> But talking about recovery, he says, "is easier said than done."  </P> <P> "And every time something like that (Manley) happens again, it will hit Chip  the same way," Katz says.  </P> <P> Meyer and Steve Ortmayer, the director of football operations who effected the  trade from the Chargers' end, have been friends since Ortmayer's days as an  assistant coach at Colorado in the late '60s and early '70s.  </P> <P> Saint Coach Jim Mora was Meyer's defensive coordinator at New England. Mora's  son is the Chargers' secondary coach.  </P> <P> Because of connections like these, certain NFL teams talk to certain other NFL  teams on a regular basis. Dallas is another team the Chargers communicate with  more than others. In fact, the Cowboys originally wanted Banks more than the  Colts did.  </P> <P> But a deal fell through when Katz convinced Banks he shouldn't leave San Diego  and the outpatient treatment he could receive there.  </P> <P> Then Charger owner Alex Spanos offered to re-sign Banks if Banks would be  willing to sit out the 1989 season. Banks accused Spanos of "stringing him  along."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ortmayer had continued talking to Meyer about Banks. The Colts  needed a linebacker because of the knee injury suffered by starter O'Brien  Alston.  </P> <P> "Our first reaction when Steve brought up Chip Banks' name was like everyone  else's: 'Hell no,' " Meyer says. "You keep your hands off guys like that. And I  conveyed that feeling to Jim Irsay (Colts' general manager)."  </P> <P> Time passed, and the Colts' need at linebacker became more glaring. As the  trade deadline neared, the Chargers' asking price for Banks came down.  </P> <P> Meyer went to tackle Chris Hinton and running back Eric Dickerson, both of whom  had played in Pro Bowls with Banks, and made inquiries. And he double-checked  with Bickett, who told him: "If you can, get him over here."  </P> <P> Following marathon negotiations between Irsay and Ortmayer, the Colts agreed to  take Banks in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 1990 draft. That  selection could become a third or second-rounder depending upon how well Banks  does the rest of the year.  </P> <P> If he backslides, the Chargers still get the fourth-rounder. The Colts are  paying Banks $250,000 this year and will pay him $275,000 if he plays for them  in 1990.  </P> <P> The Chargers announced the trade on Tuesday, Oct. 17. Banks, who hadn't played  a down since December of 1987, was practicing with the Colts the next day.  </P> <P> He started in Indianapolis' 23-12 upset of the Bengals in Cincinnati that  Sunday. On the Bengals' second play from scrimmage, he hurried Boomer Esiason  into an incompletion. He was on the field for 49 snaps and finished with three  solo tackles, three assists and four quarterback pressures. Meyer awarded him a  game ball.  </P> <P> "Physically, the guy has not lost anything," says Rick Venturi, who coaches the  Colts' linebackers. "He can still burst and accelerate." And he has benefitted  from a defensive scheme similar to the one he played in Cleveland.  </P> <P> In five games, Banks has totaled 23 tackles, one sack, five quarterback  pressures and one interception. He has played through a wrenched back and a  pinched nerve.  </P> <P> Facing the Chargers Sunday, he says, will be "fun."  </P> <P> Charger tackle James FitzPatrick, who also played at USC, says playing against  Banks will be "bizarre."  </P> <P> The temptation is to say that Indianapolis is a good place for Banks because  there are fewer distractions here than in California or Atlanta. And, Venturi  says, "nobody lives in this league other than in seven-day cycles."  </P> <P> But while the coaches work their way through 18-hour days, players are free  after practice. Indianapolis has alcohol. Indianapolis has parties.  Indianapolis has drugs just like every other city.  </P> <P> Bickett walked into a nightclub not long ago, and the first person he noticed  was Banks. "He was drinking soda water," Bickett says. "He wasn't raising hell,  and he left early. It wasn't like I was checking up on him."  </P> <P> But it wasn't like Bickett was unhappy to see Banks in control of himself  either.  </P> <P> Katz says he wants Banks back in San Diego after the season to continue  treatment. Banks, who has never tested positive for drugs in season, has  already gone through more than one therapist in Indianapolis. "Chip had a  problem with trusting," Katz says.  </P> <P> Meyer says he hopes Banks finds a permanent place to live in Indianapolis. But,  he says, "I don't know if I know Chip Banks."  </P> <P> Banks says he might go back to Atlanta,  </P> <P> "I don't think too many people are inside Chip Banks," Meyer adds. "And that's  fine. There's nothing wrong with that."  </P> <P> Unless the demons are still in there plotting a way to transform Banks back  into the babbling addict who walked away from a $4.7 million, five-year  contract offer from the Chargers in 1988.  </P> <P> Banks says that years ago an uncle told him: " 'As long as you are still  breathing, you can be knocked down but not knocked out.' "  </P> <P> That same uncle told Banks: "Don't ever count your opponent out."  </P> <P> The day Chip Banks does will be the day he begins to die. His opponent is not  the Chargers or any other NFL team. His opponent is an insidious disease for  which there is no known cure.  </P></p>

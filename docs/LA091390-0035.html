			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No  rating. A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies.  </P> <P> The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the  grills over the hatches. And this time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be  gallant as hell.  </P> <P> "The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An  American comes to postwar Vienna to discover a friend has been murdered, and he  winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to help  himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that is a  marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music. MIKE FLAGG  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Press Review JAPAN The Japanese press pinned the blame on the Social Democratic party for last Friday's unexpected defeat of the political reform bill in the upper house. Many papers carried front-page pictures of SDP defectors brandishing green opposition ballots, while the Asahi Shimbun, the left-leaning daily, ran a picture of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, party leader, bowing deeply in apology to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who masterminded the political reform offensive. The Asahi, however, also pointed a finger at the Liberal Democratic party, the leading opposition group, claiming in its editorial that the scandal-ridden LDP rule created the need for political reform, and it was the LDP which failed to implement reform while in power. The leading national dailies also managed a jibe at Mr Ozawa, for whom they have had little love ever since he lashed out at two leading national papers for unfavourable reports. The Mainichi Shimbun called the bill's defeat a rejection by the upper house of 'Ozawa GHQ's steamroller tactics'. With only a week to work out a compromise reform bill, pessimism prevailed in the papers' predictions on the fate of reform. The Yomiuri Shimbun, the conservative daily, urged against an agreement where an anti-corruption bill is separated from electoral reform - a plan suggested by LDP elders and some SDP members - calling it a 'deception' by politicians trying to save their own necks. Fears were also raised over the economy. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, warned against 'anarchy on the economic front', also predicting a delay in tax reform and confusion among economic planners and the financial markets. Most of the press were vague on the fate of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, who pledged to resign if political reform failed to pass through parliament. The dailies carried comments by the LDP's Mr Michio Watanabe, former foreign minister, that he would not pursue Mr Hosokawa's resignation. Even the sports tabloids provided some political analysis. Tokyo Sports, known for its lurid headlines, explained that the turmoil over political reform was just another version of the popular sports games between rivals Keio and Waseda (Japan's version of Oxford and Cambridge), dubbing it a match between Mr Ozawa, a Keio graduate, and LDP leader Mr Yohei Kono, a Waseda man. UNITED STATES Great disasters are a regular occurrence in southern California and the region's main newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, is equipped to deal with them. After winning a Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, the LA Times produced the same sort of blanket reporting after last week's earthquake. Even the paper's slimline east coast edition - a model of compactness and clarity which some Californian readers beg the company to send them in place of the advertisement-laden local edition - offered seven complete pages on the 'Disaster before Dawn' and its aftermath. Besides one editorial and opinions from outside contributors, the LA Times contained articles by 18 bylined reporters, and gave credit for their contributions to another 132 people on the editorial staff and 24 special correspondents. In its editorial, the LA Times remained strictly practical, concentrating on the implications of the quake for the region's freeway and rail networks. From the other side of the country, the New York Times editorialists were unable to get so close to the ground; instead, they mused weightily on 'the precariousness of human life on the edge of nature's immense, imponderable forces'. But for most people, the earthquake was a television event, with the first reports coming on the Monday morning news shows. Even the venerable Mr Walter Cronkite, fortuitously in Los Angeles on personal business, made a brief report. His successor as CBS's anchor, Mr Dan Rather, is usually so obsessed with natural disasters - especially hurricanes - that he can be counted on to turn up. This time, however, he did not broadcast from Los Angeles until Tuesday, beaten to the draw by Mr Peter Jennings of ABC and Mr Tom Brokaw of CBS. BURMA There is something quaint about The New Light of Myanmar, the official newspaper of the Burmese military junta. The absence of real domestic news or debate, the plethora of irrelevant foreign stories taken from news agencies ('With 80 foreign news reports' the paper boasted on Friday), and the bizarre, empty formulas used to describe the activities of government ministers have the flavour of the press in a Soviet satellite state during the 1970s. Previously called The Working People's Daily, the NLM is required reading for students of Burma, just as Pravda was scrutinised by Kremlin-watchers in the heyday of Soviet communism. Rangoon diplomats are always alert for clues to the thinking of Burma's secretive rulers: Why was such and such a general not shown in the photograph on page four? Why was this speech given more prominence than that speech? One big news item last week was the latest session of a national convention, whose members are being coerced by the junta into drafting a new, pro-military constitution. But more prominence - the diplomats noted - was given to daily mass rallies by the Union Solidarity and Development Association (Usda), a group founded four months ago to support the junta and probably to become its future political wing. Reports of these rallies are reassuringly predictable. Columns of people march to a sports ground; a leader addresses the rally and condemns the 'wily tricks of neo-colonialists'; the people unanimously approve six motions (including one in support of the forthcoming constitution); the 'mammoth gathering' then closes with either 'thunderous applause', or, more usually, 'tumultuous chanting of slogans'; people then depart in an orderly manner. The NLM blithely ignores the reluctance with which people attend these rallies (most are civil servants and schoolchildren bussed to the site) and the guerrilla methods used by Burmese citizens to express displeasure with Usda functions (by cheering in the wrong places, and crowding at the exits to get out before the end). With Orwellian audacity, the NLM last week published an editorial in praise of truth. 'As always,' it said, 'truth shall prevail, and when more of our brethren realise who it is that drives a wedge between us (the editorial does not say who is driving wedges) and how much we must together resist such dastardly acts, we will come out the victor. In truth we trust.' Up to a point, Lord Copper. Contributions from Emiko Terazono in Tokyo, George Graham in Washington and Victor Mallet in Rangoon.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOLAN TO SEEK 7TH ASSEMBLY TERM  </P> <P> Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R -- Glendale) announced Monday that he will run for a  seventh term.  </P> <P> Nolan has served as representative from the 41st Assembly District since 1978.  </P> <P> He lives in Glendale with his wife, Gail, and two children.  </P> <P> Nolan's political future has been uncertain since he and other state  legislators were targets of an FBI sting operation in August, 1988, that was  based on allegations of corruption in the Legislature. Nolan has not been  charged with any crime, but he later resigned his post as Assembly minority  leader.  </P> <P> In announcing his candidacy, Nolan said he will continue his efforts to hold  down taxes and spending, to improve public education and to enact tougher crime  laws. He said he has worked closely with Gov. George Deukmejian to re-implement  the death penalty in the state.  </P></p>

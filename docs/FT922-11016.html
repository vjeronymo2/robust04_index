			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Moscow looks at strings attached 'THE Big Seven demand that Russia legislates for private property,' declared the splash headline in the evening paper Izvestia last night. The headline ran above an account of the Group of Seven decision to follow through on its offer of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.5bn) aid to Russia. Interest in Moscow is focused more on the strings attached to the money and the difficulties of implementing reform than the sum itself. Izvestia noted: 'Since, at the past Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the question of private ownership of land again fell without any decision being made, this hardly makes the work of the Russian government with the IMF any easier.' Even those who welcomed the decisions in Washington stressed that the money came at a heavy price. Mr Feodor Prokopov, first deputy minister of labour, said: 'It is very welcome: it is a huge support for the government. But what we must now do will be very hard.' On the other side of the political fence, leaders of nationalist parties - who met yesterday to assess results of the Congress and to promise more active opposition to the government - accused Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, and his colleagues of crawling to the IMF and the G7 and of being unable to guarantee the money will be forthcoming. Mr Ilya Konstantinov, a leader of the Christian Democratic Movement and chief economist for the grouping of nationalist parties, said the Dollars 24bn was merely a 'mythical injection': Dollars 6bn was earmarked for rouble stabilisation at a time when the rouble could not be stabilised: Dollars 7bn was to cover interest payments on foreign debt (which are not at present being paid); and the remainder was not really committed. World Bank governors have approved the membership of 13 of the 15 former Soviet republics, adds Peter Norman. They will vote on membership of Azerbaijan on May 4 and Turkmenistan on May 15.</p>

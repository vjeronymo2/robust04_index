			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Ex-chief of Eagle Trust convicted MR JOHN FERRIDAY, the former chief executive of Eagle Trust, the Midlands mini-conglomerate, was yesterday convicted of stealing more than Pounds 12m in cash and shares from the company after the failure of its 1987 rights issue. After a 10-month trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Mr Ferriday was found guilty of five counts of theft. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on April 19. Mr Ferriday stole the money and 1.7m shares in the Howden engineering group belonging to Eagle Trust to make good personal commitments he had made to support the issue, the jury was told. Eagle Trust made a takeover bid for Samuelson, a film and lighting equipment company, in autumn 1987. The bid involved a cash or shares offer for the company, backed by a rights issue. The stock market crash of October 1987, however, led to the Eagle Trust share price falling from 30p to 20p. Samuelson shareholders chose the cash option, leaving Mr Ferriday - who had underwritten the issue personally - with a substantial sub-underwriting commitment. The prosecution alleged that Mr Ferriday, to meet his debts, committed the thefts from Eagle Trust in December 1987 and January 1988, routeing the money through Connect Parcels, the delivery company, and two off-shore companies before bringing it back into the UK. Fraud was suspected when, in May 1989, Eagle Trust became insolvent and trading in its shares was suspended. The West Midlands fraud squad instigated inquiries before passing the case to the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Ferriday did not give evidence at his trial. The SFO is now considering its position regarding three other men who originally stood trial alongside Mr Ferriday charged with similar offences, but who were all removed from the trial - without being acquitted - on the direction of the judge. They are Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director, Mr Martin Baker, a former finance director with the company, and Mr Leslie Goodwin, a former chairman of Connect Parcels. The SFO is expected to announce its decision on their cases on April 19.</p>

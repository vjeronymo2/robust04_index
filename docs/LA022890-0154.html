Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PASSENGER SPOTS SMOKE -- 30 FOLLOW HER DOWN JET'S CHUTE  </P> <P> A woman passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 123 spotted smoke in the cabin  today, panicked, pulled open an emergency exit and began an evacuation down a  chute while the plane was still at the terminal, the airline reported.  </P> <P> About 30 of the 167 passengers aboard the DC-8 slid down the chute onto the  Tarmac at Orlando International Airport, said Sara Dornacker, a United  spokesman in Chicago.  </P> <P> The rest walked off the plane through the jet way in an evacuation by flight  attendants, Dornacker said.  </P> <P> There were no injuries and there was no fire, she said.  </P> <P> Dornacker said what the passenger saw was smoke from an overheating  air-conditioning unit, something she described as "not that uncommon."  </P> <P> The flight to Chicago and San Francisco was canceled so the chute could be  replaced.  </P></p>

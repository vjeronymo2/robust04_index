			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest banking group, said yesterday that had raised FM759m (Dollars 130.8m) through its latest share issue, AP-DJ reports from Helsinki. Subscriptions were entered by more than 150 international institutional investors, resulting in the increase of the number of shares offered to 63.25m from the original 50m, KOP said. The issue brought the proportion of foreign owners in the bank's shareholder base to 24 per cent from 13 per cent, the group added. The most recent KOP share offering is one of several steps in a capitalisation program unveiled in March. Since then, KOP has raised about FM2.85bn in new equity capital, bringing the bank's total share capital to FM4.42bn and its capital adequacy ratio to 10 per cent.</p>

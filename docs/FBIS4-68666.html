			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Summary of report by F.G. Khamidullin, deputy prime </F> minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, at the 19th Session of  the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet: "Results of the  Republic of Tatarstan's Socioeconomic Development in 1993 and  the Forecast for 1994"]    [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies!    A most important event in the life of the republic was the  conclusion of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, which  affords new opportunities for the socioeconomic development of  the republic. The government has drawn up and adopted an action  program for realization of the treaty, which will largely  determine the directions of our activity in the current year.    Permit me to dwell briefly on the progress of the economic  reforms. Mention should be made briefly of being among the most  important measures in this sphere in 1993 for the further  development of the processes of privatization and  denationalization in accordance with the republic program  approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan.  More than 300 enterprises with summary statutory capital of more  than R427 billion have been privatized in the course of its  realization. They include the Tatneft, Nizhnekamskneftekhim, and  Orgsintez associations, the Kazan Engine-Building, Kazan  Helicopter, and Tatmyasoprom plants and the Chistopol Watch  Works, the Tatnefteprovodstroy Trust, and others. The privatized  industrial enterprises manufactured more than 40 percent of the  total commodity product. The privatization of housing has begun.    Work on the issue of registered privatization deposits got  under way. Fifteen specialized check investment funds, which  have altogether accumulated privatization checks totaling more  than R10 billion, were functioning in the republic by the end of  the year.    F.G. Khamidullin went on to say that as a result of the many  months of work of a large group of specialists, scientists, and  employees of economic departments a program of the targeted  social protection of the populace, the first in the CIS in  practice, had been prepared. Its realization will make it  possible to protect more efficiently the needy strata of the  population of the republic under the conditions of the  development of market relations.    An important instrument of government regulation of the  economy in 1993 was the use of the system of the preferential  allocation of credit. A special commission of experts under the  auspices of the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting  made an expert appraisal of almost 400 specific plans presented  by the enterprises, took the most efficient of them, and  recommended them to the government for the preferential  allocation of credit under the strict supervision of the banks  and the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting.    Realization of the agrarian reform continues. Of the 884  kolkhozes and sovkhozes which underwent reregistration, 702  retained their status, and 182 farms were reorganized. More than  4,000 persons are employed at the 725 peasant (private) farms  that are operating at this time. They have been allocated 24,300  hectares of land, 642 tractors, 340 motor vehicles, 78  grain-harvesting combines, and the requisite set of agricultural  equipment. Some R589 million of credit resources and R170  million from the republic budget were allocated last year for  the development and formation of these farms.    The speaker then called the deputies' attention to certain  negative trends causing the government particular concern. It is  a question primarily of the decline in industrial production.  The main reason is the nonpayments problem. The sum total of  receivables from customers, the majority of whom are outside of  the Republic of Tatarstan, amounted as of 1 March to  approximately R2.3 trillion, of which more than one-third is  past due. The economic development of our republic also will  depend to a considerable extent on the measures that are adopted  to resolve the problem of arrears on the scale of Russia. After  all, a large part of the biggest enterprises works for the  Russian market. Another problem is the enterprises' lack of  preparedness for operating under the conditions of the  competition that has arisen and their inadequate knowledge of  market conditions.    The year of 1994 must be one of the real stimulation of the  structural reorganization of the entire economy. What are the  specific directions of the structural transformations? One of  the main ones is a fundamental restructuring of the  military-industrial complex. The transformations have begun by  way of the state's selective support on the basis of a  competitive seeding of the most rapidly recoupable business  projects in areas of significance for the republic. Conversion  problems came to be tackled more actively in 1994 with the  Russian Federation Government. Specifically, measures to reduce  the debt to enterprises of the republic's military-industrial  complex for special products manufactured in 1993 were adopted.  The enterprises have begun to obtain funds for advance payments  for the defense order for 1994. This is a direct result of the  treaty that has been concluded between the Russian Federation  and the Republic of Tatarstan. A special commission has been  formed under the auspices of the State Committee for Economics  and Forecasting of the Republic of Tatarstan for a fuller  analysis of fulfillment of the mutual commitments in respect to  the defense block.    Serious structural changes are needed in the republic's oil  and petrochemical complexes. An oil-producing republic lacking  extended petroleum refining for fuel and oil remains dependent  on monopoly refiners. In addition, the reserves of high-grade  oil are being depleted, and the wear and tear and depreciation  of the petrochemical works continue. This is why a number of  alternatives involving the attraction of foreign capital is  being worked up and the Neftekhiminvestk holding industrial and  financial group has been created in the republic.    The areas for a number of new crops--corn for grain, rape,  and sunflower for oil seeds--are being increased in sectors of  the agro-industrial complex. The breed is being improved in  animal husbandry. Thus we have smaller numbers of cows than in  neighboring Bashkortostan, but the dairy product output is  greater here. The facilities for the processing of the  agricultural product are being reinforced at the same time--the  sugar refineries, meat-packing plants, and milk-conversion  enterprises are being modernized. The purpose of all these  transformations is to improve the republic's food balance to  achieve self-sufficiency in the basic food types with the  simultaneous creation of a competitive market environment.    The structural transformations should also encompass other  sectors, the nonproduction sphere included. Thus the market is  already signaling a shortage of skilled managers, accountants,  and other people capable of working under market conditions.    The entire ideology of government support for structural  transformations of the economy is essentially changing. Support  must be targeted exclusively at a specifically computed project.  The times of support for everyone in succession have passed.    The structural transformations will produce results with  simultaneous institutional changes. The development of  alternative forms of property and competition and the formation  of a secondary securities market will create a fundamentally new  environment for all subjects of the market.    Support for enterprise should be among the priority areas in  1994. A draft of the corresponding program has with the active  participation of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the Republic  of Tatarstan been prepared in execution of the edict of the  president of the Republic of Tatarstan. It provides for measures  of support for small business and the priority areas of the  economy, the granting of tax privileges and preferential credit  included. The realization of this program will contribute to the  further development of the infrastructure of the market and the  formation of a competitive environment.    An acceleration of the pace of denationalization and  privatization will contribute to a considerable extent to the  development of market relations in the republic. A further 450  enterprises will be privatized in 1994. They include the  Tatenergo and Zavod imeni Sergo associations, computer systems,  Elekon, and others. The privatized industrial enterprises will  manufacture more than three-fourths of the total commodity  product in the republic as a whole.    The set task for the creation of a competitive environment  in  1994 is an acceleration of the rate of privatization of trade,  public catering, and consumer service facilities.    A most important task of 1994 is the privatization of  housing. Only 5 percent of the apartments out of the total  amount of housing subject to privatization has been privatized  in the republic at the present time. It is contemplated having  raised this indicator to 30 percent by the year's end.    Proceeding from the current situation, the speaker  emphasized, the forecast of the economic and social development  of the republic for 1994 is oriented toward support for the  life-sustaining sectors of production and also selective support  for the enterprises that are prepared to secure the rapid  recovery of the resources invested in the interests of the  republic's economy. Industrial production is to constitute  R12.365 trillion, and output in comparable prices will decline  17 percent here.    The overall decline in the level of production in the  republic as a whole will be influenced appreciably by fuel  industry. The reason for this is the reduction in the production  of oil and gas, the continued deterioration in the structure of  the reserves, and the fraught environmental situation.  Accordingly, a decline in production in petrochemical industry  and power engineering is anticipated; a decline of 15 percent is  forecast at enterprises of the defense sectors.    A number of enterprises, including the Kama Truck Plant, is  forecasting an increase in the manufacture of its product in the  mechanical engineering and metal-working sectors. A certain  increase in production is expected in the food sectors of  industry. Despite the crisis situation, a number of associations  and enterprises is operating in stable fashion. They include  computer system associations, the Chistopol Watchworks, and the  Tochmash Plant. The Terminal Association and the Plant imeni  Gorkiy, which have pretty good prospects, have begun to increase  the pace of production.    The process of the conclusion of trade and economic  agreements with countries of the near abroad for the supply of  material and technical resources is becoming more purposeful and  efficient. Agreements have been concluded at the present time  with Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, and the Republic of  Lithuania, and agreements with 37 regions of the Russian  Federation have been extended.    In 1994, according to forecast estimates, the production of  consumer goods will constitute 100.2 percent, including 103.4  percent for foodstuffs and 96.7 percent for nonfood commodities.  An increase in the manufacture of basic consumer commodities  like refrigerators, synthetic detergents, toilet soap, footwear,  and knitwear is expected in the current year.    It is planned to maintain the trend of a stabilization of  the  production of agricultural products in 1994. Purchases of  agricultural products for republic food stocks will remain  practically unchanged.    It is contemplated continuing the government support for the  agro-industrial complex in the current year. Budget resources  will be channeled, in the main, into an increase in the  fertility of the land--the compensation of expenditure on the  purchase of mineral fertilizers and chemical plant-protection  agents, a fundamental improvement in the land, support for  pedigree breeding and elite seed growing, and  scientific-personnel support. The funding of the construction  and modernization of the most important enterprises of the food  and processing industry, the supply of gas and electricity to  the countryside, and social and cultural amenities is planned  also. It is planned allocating from the republic budget R310  billion for these areas.    It is contemplated preserving for the purpose of the social  protection of the population of the republic the subsidies on  animal husbandry products purchased for republic needs.  Approximately 27 percent of the expenditure side of the republic  budget is earmarked for the funding of the agro-industrial  complex altogether, subsidies included.    Land reform will continue. The reform of the kolkhozes and  sovkhozes, which will to a considerable extent interest the  workers of the countryside in the end results of production,  will be completed. An increase in the number of peasant  (private) farms is forecast. It is planned to render them  government support from budget appropriations and make soft  loans available in the current year.    According to the forecast estimates of enterprises of food  and processing industry, an increase in the production of  foodstuffs of 3.4 percent (in comparable prices, counting  alcoholic beverages) is envisaged for 1994. An increase in the  production of wholemilk products (in milk equivalent), macaroni  products, flour, and canned fruit and vegetables is scheduled.    The forecast for 1994 as a whole in terms of all sources of  funding envisages the assimilation of R2.5 trillion of capital  investments with a decline compared to the 1993 level in  comparable prices of 28.6 percent.    The allocation of capital investments for the construction  of  housing for persons demobilized from the armed forces and  certain other facilities totaling R56.5 billion from the budget  of the Russian Federation is contemplated.    Aside from this, a whole number of other federal targeted  programs, in which enterprises and organizations of the republic  may participate thanks to the treaty that has been concluded  with Russia, is being drawn up. The leaders of enterprises,  ministries, and departments should step up their efforts for the  specific development of projects with Russian departments. The  Government of the Republic of Tatarstan has performed the  corresponding preparatory work.    It will be hard in the coming years to expect under the  conditions of a reduction in production, the arrears crisis, and  the high rate of inflation a significant increase in investments  from the resources of enterprises of all forms of ownership and  the republic budget. The funds of commercial banks and foreign  investments could be realistic sources of an increase in  investments.    In 1994 the proportion of funds channeled into construction  for nonproduction purposes is forecast at the level of 37.7  percent against the actual 1993 level of 35.2 percent; this  ratio will be maintained thanks to the republic budget, in the  main.    The introduction of housing with a total area of 980,000  square meters, 91,400 square meters of which will be for the  movement of residents out of dilapidated and dangerous housing,  is contemplated from all sources of financing in the present  year. The government has adopted a decision on the supplementary  allocation of funds for the construction of housing for the  handicapped and participants in the Great Patriotic War. It is  contemplated through the efforts of individual developers  building 320,000 square meters of housing, which is 25 percent  more than was introduced in 1993.    The forecast envisages the introduction of general schools  for 9,900 students (101 percent of the 1993 level), preschools  for 3,110 children (103.8 percent), hospitals with 749 beds (179  percent), general clinics catering for 1,720 visits per shift  (116.2 percent), and clubhouses with 4,000 seats (87.7 percent).    The adoption of the laws of the Republic of Tatarstan "The  Subsistence Minimum" and "The Minimum Wage" created the  legislative basis for the stabilization and prevention of a  decline in personal living standards. A legislative provision  specifying that the minimum wage may not be lower than the  subsistence minimum has for the first time been made the basis  of the calculation of wage-increase indicators for 1994.    It is forecast that, despite the considerable decline in  production, the average wage in 1994 will increase by a factor  of 4.1 compared with 1993 and will in December 1994 be in excess  of R400,000 per worker. An increase in the remuneration of the  employees of publicly funded organizations also is specified in  the draft budget with regard to this rate of increase in the  average wage.    With a growth of consumer prices by a factor of 4.3  approximately compared with the 1993 level the increase in the  price of goods and services constituting the subsistence minimum  will be regulated and should not exceed the 3.8-fold level. That  is, the forecast provides for a preferential growth of wages (by  a factor of 4.1) compared with the value of the subsistence  minimum (a factor of 3.8).    Realization of the program of targeted social protection of  the population will continue. The amount of the sums of  compensation to the needy strata of the populace in the form of  food checks (more than 140,000 inhabitants of the republic are  currently being paid a sum total of more than R5 billion a  month) will increase proportionate to the increase in the value  of the subsistence minimum.    It is contemplated making the subsidies for transport  services, for provision of the public with fuel, and for  medication specifically targeted in 1994.    A 50 percent reduction in fares on suburban motor transport  will be introduced in the period from 1 May through 1 October.    A whole set of measures pertaining to the social protection  of the population is envisaged by an agreement among the Cabinet  of Ministers, the republic Council of Trade Unions, and the  Association of State-Owned Enterprises of Tatarstan for 1994.  Realization of the comprehensive "Care" program for an  improvement in services for war and labor veterans, elderly  single citizens, and the handicapped will continue. Funds for  the organization of the summer recreation and health and fitness  of children and funds for the support of the children of  employees of publicly funded organizations in preschools will be  allocated from the republic budget.    The forecast of the labor market for the republic for 1994  contemplates a level of unemployment that is no higher than 1.5  percent of the workforce. Financial assistance to enterprises  and organizations for the creation of approximately 12,000 jobs  is envisaged simultaneously within the framework of the  Employment Program (2,453 jobs were created thanks to resources  of the Employment Fund in 1993).    Switching to the concluding part of the report, F.G.  Khamidullin emphasized that work had been under way for more  than a year in the republic on a draft concept of socioeconomic  development incorporating a reform of the organs of  administration. The provisions of the concept are currently  being specified in the light of the treaty and the agreements  concluded with Russia. It will upon completion be presented to  the people of the republic.    The independence and rights of Tatarstan accorded by the  treaty demand increased responsibility for all business in the  republic. Questions of the strictest austerity in all types of  material, labor, and financial resources are particularly  pertinent. The government is contemplating a number of  organizational and economic measures in this direction.    On the whole, the year promises to be difficult, and the  crisis has not yet been overcome, but there will in the present  year be appreciable qualitative changes in the economy laying  the foundations of prospects of an improvement in the general  economic situation.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CUOMO WANTS STATE TO BUY THE YANKEES  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that if George Steinbrenner has to sell the New  York Yankees, he wants New York to be first in line to buy the team.  </P> <P> "I suspect that it is eminently financeable -- for the state and the city,"  Cuomo said.  </P> <P> "You could even sell bonds."  </P> <P> "He does not want to sell," Cuomo said of Steinbrenner. "He'll do anything to  avoid that and I hope he can. . . . But if he decided to sell, I wish he would  come to us."  </P> <P> Cuomo said to "forget the details," such as who would run the team or whether  voter approval would be needed to sign free agents.  </P> <P> The governor said a major league team would be a great investment.  </P> <P> "They make an average of what, a 35% profit?" Cuomo said. "The best investment  you could make is a franchise."  </P> <P> The Yankees owner is being investigated by Commissioner Fay Vincent for his  involvement with gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner said on Thursday that he  would not sell the team, even if Vincent suspends him from baseball.  </P></p>

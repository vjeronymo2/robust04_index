			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Explaining the mixed record of global penetration SOMETIMES the simplest calculations can provide the most revealing results. Among 300 dense pages of statistics and graphics in a new compendium of accountancy data*, one table sticks out from the rest, showing the relative grip of accountants on national economies. As the table shows, dividing accountancy fee income by gross domestic product (1990 figures) throws up tremendous variations. If the US economy is  -as sometimes claimed - being drained by lawyers, then accountants cannot be far behind. Elsewhere, the patterns are equally revealing, ranging from a low of 0.01 per cent of GDP in Japan to a peak of 0.63 per cent in Ireland. Lafferty's 'International Accounting Databook' puts a brave face on the proportions at the lower end of the spectrum. 'On the assumption that the accounting firms in other countries will be able to develop in the same way as British, Irish, Dutch and Swiss firms, it would appear that the potential world market for accountants' services is enormous,' it says. 'For example, the Italian market could increase 20-fold.' The Sony chairman, Mr Akio Morito, who has recently been outspoken in his criticism of the role of accountants in senior positions in business, might put a rather different perspective on the figures, and be gratified at his country's lowly position. At the other extreme, explanations for the position of Ireland and the Netherlands are hard to come by. Switzerland is also very high, at 0.5 per cent of GDP. This, the report suggests, may reflect the wide range of services offered by Swiss firms, as well as relatively easy access to outside capital. On home ground, theories are rather easier to develop. The UK comes in third highest, at 0.54 per cent. The survey suggests that the power of the profession reflects the UK's history as the birthplace of accountancy. It argues that the large number of companies subject to statutory audits and their control of the 'insolvency franchise' leads to the substantial fees generated. The firms have also been free to develop roles as tax advisers and general business consultants. 'Accountants are moving away from being a profession,' says Michael Lafferty, editor in chief of Lafferty Publications, 'they are becoming a business.' It no doubt also reflects the important role in the UK played by capital markets and the industries they sustain - corporate finance, financial reporting, due diligence work and so on - which are in their infancy across continental Europe. By comparison, tax and insolvency work in other countries including the US and Scandinavia is controlled by the legal profession and produces far less income for accountants. In some countries there are restrictions on accountants' business which may restrict the volume and value of work they conduct, such as compulsory rotation of auditors, or bars to prevent auditors conducting non-audit work. Overall, there is obviously a clear relationship between fee income generated and the number of qualified accountants. This raises the question of which came first: the accountants or the work to satisfy them? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has about 97,720 members and this is rising by 2.9 per cent per year - considerably faster than GDP. In addition, the four other professional accountancy bodies have more than 70,000 members. Only Ireland can compete with that figure in Europe. There, 0.597 per cent of the population were certified or chartered accountants in 1990, against 0.572 per cent in the UK. (Third, at just 0.275 per cent, was Gibraltar.) Mr Andrew Colquhoun, chief executive of the English Institute, says: 'I see accountants as part of the invisible infrastructure essential to making a market economy work. They have a real economic role for invisible earnings - although it is difficult to quantify.' Analysts could nevertheless have a field day scrutinising the over-staffing of accountancy firms across borders, by examining countries in which professional fees as a proportion of GDP exceeded the number of practising accountants per capita. They might also do more to assess the contribution the firms truly make to national product - since there seems to be little clear correlation between the proportion of GDP consumed, and economic growth rates in the countries shown. Other figures in the Lafferty compendium bear witness to the remarkable growth and change taking place in accountancy firms around the world. Fee income from the main accounting networks in 1991 grew by 13.4 per cent worldwide. Fee income shot up by more than 17 per cent in Europe, compared with just 2.6 per cent growth in the US, making the markets now almost identical in size: the US and Canada together contributed Dollars 14,096m last year, against Dollars 13,833m in Europe. Gross fees per partner from the firms in the top networks averaged just over Dollars 1m, and ranged from Dollars 1.45m in Germany to a low of Dollars 750,000 in Japan. There are plenty of other statistical manipulations that could be done on the figures - enough, in fact, to keep an army of unemployed accountants busy for months. No doubt Mr Morito would be among those recommending that they might more usefully spend their time retraining in different, more useful, skills. *International Accounting Databook. Pounds 545.

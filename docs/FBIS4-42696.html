			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Black article: "Britain To Lift Arms Embargo on </F> Israel"]    [Text] Britain is lifting the arms embargo it imposed on  Israel after its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and promises to  review a similar ban applied to Syria in the light of progress  in the Middle East peace process, it was announced yesterday.    Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, said in answer to a  parliamentary question that the embargo -- the last maintained  against the Jewish state by any European Union member -- should  be lifted now that Israel has handed over Gaza and Jericho to  the Palestine Liberation Organisation.    In a statement that will please Israel as much as it will  anger Arab governments, he said: "The Israeli Government has  made it clear that it has no territorial claim on Lebanon."    Israel withdrew most of its combat forces in 1985 but still  occupies a strip of south Lebanon which it calls the "security  zone" and uses as a trip-wire against guerrilla attacks. It has  refused to comply with United Nations resolutions calling for  withdrawal, citing the inability of the Lebanese government to  keep peace on the border.    Mr Hurd said that all future applications for the sale of  arms to Israel would be considered on a case by case basis.    "These include whether a proposed transfer would be likely  to  increase tension in the region or contribute to regional  instability," he said.    Sources in the Foreign Office -- long considered by  supporters of Israel to have a distinct pro-Arab bias -- made it  clear that the timing of the move should be seen in the context  of domestic politics and the forthcoming European elections.    For Israel the British arms ban has long been of symbolic  rather than practical importance since most of its weapons are  supplied by the United States. But the end of the embargo could  clear the way for Britain to buy Israel's Popeye missile.    This was indirectly confirmed in Jerusalem by Israel's  deputy  foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, who met Mr Hurd in London two  weeks ago.    "The significance of the cancellation of the embargo is that  it had been very difficult for us to sell Israeli weapons in  Britain because in many cases there was a formal or informal  condition that some of the components be British," he told  Israel Radio. "It will now be that much easier."    Mr Hurd balanced his announcement with a clear hint that the  wider European Union arms embargo against Syria could also be  lifted.    "We hope to see progress on the Syrian track in line with  that seen on the Palestinian track" he said. "In that context  we will be ready to raise with our European partners the lifling  of the European Union arms embargo against Syria."    That embargo was imposed in 1986 after a Syrian intelligence  agent, Nezar Hindawi, was convicted of trying to plant a bomb on  an Israeli airliner at Heathrow airport. Britain severed  relations with Syria but the links were restored later.    Syria and Lebanon last week condemned Israel after its  forces  kidnapped a Shiite Muslim guerilla leader from his home in south  Lebanon to hold as hostage in exchange for an Israeli airman  believed held by militant Lebanese.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR COMES OUT ON TOP AFTER TRAILING, 9-0  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School rallied from a 9-0 deficit to defeat Trabuco Hills,  10-9, at Mission Viejo High Friday night.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (2-2) relied on a stubborn defense that, despite giving up 301  total yards, kept the Sea Kings in the game until the offense, which gained  only 67 yards in the first half, woke up.  </P> <P> In fact, it was a 31-yard interception return by Corona del Mar's Scott Pannier  that set up the Sea Kings' first score. After an incomplete pass, Todd Kehrli  threw 39 yards to a wide open Jeff Wegener for the touchdown. After an  unsportsmanlike penalty was called on Wegener for spiking the ball, Tom Hess  kicked a 35-yard extra point to make the score 9-7.  </P> <P> The Sea King defense then forced Trabuco Hills (1-2-1) to punt and Corona del  Mar took over at its own 40. After a 16-yard gain by Hess on a reverse, the Sea  King offense appeared to be in trouble again when it faced a third-and-17  situation from the Mustang 41. But Kehrli threw 33 yards to Jason Clark to put  the ball at the eight. Three running plays resulted in three yards lost, so  Hess kicked a 24-yard field goal with 6:16 left to give Corona del Mar a 10-9  lead.  </P></p>

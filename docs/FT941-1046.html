			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Sleight-of-hand show - New York is entranced by Ricky Jay Those who place magic shows in the category of cheap and tawdry diversions are likely to have their minds changed by Ricky Jay. An astonishingly gifted sleight-of-hand artist and a raconteur supreme, Jay is currently providing a sophisticated evening's entertainment at New York's Second Stage Theatre, for those crafty enough to locate a ticket. Called Ricky Jay and his 52 Assistants, the sold-out show is directed by playwright David Mamet and is the toast of the city; Madonna, Lauren Bacall, Barbara Hershey, and Jerome Robbins were all in attendance at one recent performance. Producers have tried to lure Jay to a larger theatre than the tiny Second Stage, but he has wisely refused. The key to the show is its intimacy. Jay gives the impression that he has invited friends into his living room (actually, Kevin Rigdon's woodpanelled set) to show them his best tricks, and even those in the back row are close enough to be truly flummoxed by his skills. A bearded bear of a man, Jay performs alone: the assistants, if you have not worked it out yet, are his deck of cards, with which he does the most amazing things. As he shuffles and deals, cards appear where they certainly could not be and disappear as quickly. Dupes from the audience get trounced at poker, '21', and that favourite of New York hucksters, three card monte. Jay constantly plays with the audiences' minds, pretending to bobble the gags, and then revealing he was in control all along (whoops] dealt someone three aces? Good thing he saved himself a royal flush]) This is mindboggling, to be sure, but what takes the show a level higher is Jay's urbane, self-effacing manner and his witty patter. He talks a blue streak throughout, which not only provides the necessary distraction from his hands, forever fidgeting with the deck, but gives us a fascinating history of deception and magic. Jay is the author of several books on the subject, editor of a quarterly Journal of Anomalies, and is the darling of magic enthusiasts like Mamet, who has cast Jay in several of his films. In the second act, the show gets proppier, and to my mind weaker; his deceptions are at their least convincing during the cups-and-balls tricks and the prank with an old-fashioned automaton. Jay is at his best with a deck of cards in his hand, even when he is just tossing the cards around, as he does at the show's end. But what tossing] He makes cards spin back to him like boomerangs; he flings them across the room, decapitating a toy duck, setting a menagerie of stuffed toys to clanging their cymbals, and penetrating the 'outer pachydermal layer' (the green bit) of a watermelon after nearly a dozen attempts ('the ricochet,' he warns, 'once killed a man in Tierra del Fuego'). Jay's show is a playground for adults, sending even the most jaded audience members into a state of childlike wonder. He does not so much require that we suspend our disbelief as make it disappear - yes, like magic.</p>

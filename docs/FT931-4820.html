			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Feast of new issues digested on prospect of rate cuts CONTINUED optimism among investors that interest rates are set to fall further across Europe enabled the international bond market to digest yesterday's large supply of new issues. The Kingdom of Sweden returned to the market for the first time since its Dollars 2bn global offering in February with a zero-coupon Eurobond issue denominated in French francs. Good demand enabled the borrower to increase the amount to FFr4bn from an original FFr3bn, and fanned hopes that some more zero-coupon bonds would be issued this week. Sweden's 10-year bonds were priced at 48.65 to yield 24 basis points over the French government's 8 1/2 per cent OATs due 2003. When the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread tightened to 22 basis points, but later widened back to 24 basis points when the additional FFr1bn was launched. An official at the lead manager, Paribas, said retail demand for the bonds was strong, especially in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries. UK institutions were also interested. The official said that, by contrast, French investors did not show much interest, mainly because they did not accord to sovereign borrowers the reception they gave to domestic issuers of zero-coupon bonds. Rarity value added to the attraction of the Dollars 300m, seven-year Eurobond issue with equity warrants launched by Veba, the large German utility. Syndicate managers said that Veba was one of the few remaining German companies which still had authorisation from its shareholders to raise equity-linked financing without offering shareholders pre-emptive rights. In recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further authorisations at annual meetings due to growing shareholder opposition. Demand for Veba's issue was such that the price of the bonds rose as high as 119 1/2 from an issue price of 116 1/2 , but were later bid at 117 1/2 . The ex-warrant bonds closed at 99.55 bid, while the warrants traded around DM55. The Eurosterling sector was tapped again in the morning by Carlsberg Finance AS, a subsidiary of the Danish brewing group, which raised Pounds 100m worth of five-year Eurobonds. Later, Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 150m partly-paid seven-year Eurobond issue. The syndicate on the Halifax issue had not broken by the close of business. Carlsberg's bonds, which carry a 7 1/4 per cent coupon, were priced to yield 7.31 per cent, or 68 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent UK government bond due 1998. When the bonds were freed to trade by late morning, the spread narrowed to 63 basis points, reflecting continued demand from UK and continental institutions for sterling-denominated corporate paper. The Czech National Bank's Dollars 300m three-year Eurobond issue, launched last week, was priced to yield 272 basis points over US Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 272-278 basis points. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday affirmed the long-term rating of British Airways at A2. It had earlier put the rating under review for a possible downgrade.</p>

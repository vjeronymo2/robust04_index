			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BES The abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme is one of the Budget's more welcome features, and should help stimulate the debate over how small companies are best financed. BES investors have enjoyed an excessive tax break long after the scheme was largely diverted from its original purpose of raising venture capital for small businesses. Intermediaries will doubtless make full use of their two opportunities to stampede investors into new schemes before the system's demise at the end of next year, although it is hard to see that adding much economic stimulus. There must also be doubts over how far the housing market will be helped by the easing of rules on assured tenancy schemes for owner-occupiers in danger of repossession. As for the government's position that the UK venture capital industry is now sufficiently mature to fill the gap left by BES, that looks a little complacent. While BES has passed its sell-by date, there might still be a need for incentives in future. Unless, that is, the City plans to become much more friendly to such high-risk investments.</p>

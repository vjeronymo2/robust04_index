			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Efficiency in the trade associations Sir, You report the Department of Trade and Industry's interest in bringing greater efficiency into trade associations ('Ministers query cost of trade groups', October 5). We in the coatings industry (Pounds 2bn annual turnover) are streamlining our services to provide better value to our member companies. My association is following the federation route by incorporating the Printing Ink Manufacturers from January 1 while enabling existing paint, powder coatings and wall-covering activities to flourish within a single organisation. There is also regular co-operation with kindred associations on individual matters of mutual interest where collaborative effort is economical and provides comprehensive industry input to government. Individual companies will continue to support and belong to such clearly defined and appropriate trade groupings, in which their detailed technical and trade interests can be identified and serviced by experts. There is a sense of deja-vu in your report as the business of trade representation has been examined on several occasions in the past. The logical conclusion of the 'bigger is better' argument is that companies become direct members of the Confederation of British Industry and that the specialist sector associations close down. This might suit Mr Heseltine's mandarins but nobody else] Moira T McMillan, director, Paintmakers' Association, 93 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TY</p>

Sometimes a single courtroom requires 250  potential jurors a day. . . . Still, efficiency continues to rise (above).  </P> <P> One key, says jury services manager Evelyn Valle, is the county's telephone  alert system, which allows people to check in each morning to see whether they  will be needed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JURY DUTY  </P> <P> Number of people summoned for jury duty at Superior and Municipal courts in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Percentage assigned to court or jury  </P> <P> 1987: 39,560: 79%  </P> <P> 1988: 38,033: 80%  </P> <P> 1989: 35,336: 83%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fees and expenses  </P> <P> 1987: $1,039,140  </P> <P> 1988: 679,910  </P> <P> 1989: 661,200  </P> <P> Source: Jury Services -- Santa Ana Superior Court.

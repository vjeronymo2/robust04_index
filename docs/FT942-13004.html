			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Dutch triumph with Mahler In the Barbican's ongoing series 'Great Orchestras of the World', some orchestras have sounded distinctly less great than others. On Sunday afternoon, however, Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra displayed the very standard we have been trying to remember. Fearlessly secure and superlatively musical, Mahler's 7th Symphony, the sole work in its programme, was marvellous to hear, and the standing ovation was fully earned. It would be hard to pretend that any London orchestra these days could guarantee such a performance. If the trumpets do not crack somewhere the horns probably will, and anyhow the violins will rarely have enough thrust at climaxes to cut through Mahler's teeming orchestra and make themselves felt. By contrast, the absolute security and freedom of the Amsterdam players was awe-inspiring. No doubt their enviable working conditions are conducive to those virtues. The conductor was the Italian Riccardo Chailly, who inherited his distinguished post in 1988 from the long line of Bruckner-and-Mahler devotees who established the Concertgebouw Orchestra's reputation. Already noted as a fine Stravinskian and a specialist in extrovert Russian and French music, Chailly has had to win his spurs in that special Viennese repertoire. Mahler's Seventh was a bold choice for a London showcase, for it is notoriously 'problematic'. Full of bold ideas, as experimental and perversely chromatic as Mahler ever got (his choral 'Symphony of a Thousand', would be broader-brushed and operatic, his Ninth grandly and serenely backward-looking); but weirdly rounded off with a cheerful, racketty C major finale in shameless Meistersinger-mode. Chailly spelled everything out in richly idiomatic detail, very forward: if the Scherzo was too muscular and up-front to count as schattenhaft ('shadowy'), like everything else it sounded brilliant. The trees stood out so vividly that the woods rather receded; there was less sense of symphonic arguments and inexorable conclusions than of unstoppable, overflowing fantasy. In this exhilarating performance, that was more than enough to be going on with.

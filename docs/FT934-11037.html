			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Major issues clear warning of tax rises and spending cuts MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday gave the clearest signal yet that his government is planning further tax increases in the November 30 Budget, writes Philip Stephens. In spite of agreement to freeze public spending in real terms for the next three years, Mr Major indicated that tough controls on spending and resumed economic growth would not do enough to curb government borrowing. His comments coincided with signs of an upsurge of concern on the Conservative back benches about the impact of the tax increases already impending after the March budget. Under plans announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, the tax burden is set to rise by more than Pounds 6bn next year and by more than Pounds 10bn in 1995-96. But Mr Major told the Commons that the government needed to make a 'steady and sustained' move to reduce borrowing. That could be done in several ways. Controlling public expenditure was one, and economic growth would also help. But in a clear reference to tax increases, the prime minister added that 'other matters' would also contribute. Downing Street conceded that he was referring to tax increases but officials argued that the reference was to the plans announced by Mr Lamont. That explanation failed to convince ministers and Conservative MPs who had been listening to Mr Major.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: A superior record on economic forecasting Sir, In his story, 'Treasury 'wise man' calls for skills cash' (June 28), about the London Business School's latest Economic Outlook, Peter Marsh makes some quotes from the publication. Broad money is said not to have been 'a reliable indicator', while 'advocacy of this indicator' has been 'accompanied by exaggerated claims for Tim Congdon's forecasting prowess that does not bear close examination'. I first began to provide detailed macroeconomic forecasts in 1986 when I worked at Shearson Lehman. The subsequent record of quarterly forecasts has been continuous, apart from a period in late 1988 and early 1989, just before I founded Lombard Street Research. Over this seven-year period I do not believe that the London Business School (or, indeed, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) has once produced an end-year forecast for the subsequent year that has been as accurate as mine. (Of course, I did not have an end-year forecast in late 1988 for 1989, but I believe that my mid-year forecast was in this case better than the LBS's end-year forecast.) I may be incorrect in making these claims, but I find it interesting that - since making them - no LBS or National Institute economist has taken up the challenge of comparing my forecasts with theirs. Happily, all the forecasts are matters of public record. There is no doubt that, on average, my forecasting record has over the last seven years been superior to the LBS's and the National Institute's. I have tried to explain - to economists at both institutions and anyone else who may be interested - why I think they have been better. It has nothing to do with 'forecasting prowess', whatever that is or may be, but with the application of certain basic ideas in economic theory. In particular, every forecast that I have prepared has paid careful attention to various economic agents' demands to hold money balances, and the relationship between these demands and the actual quantity of money balances in existence. The need to equilibrate the demand for money with the money supply is an essential aspect of any meaningful attempt to understand the forces determining national income.

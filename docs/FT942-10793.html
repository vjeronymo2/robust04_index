			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Erroneous 'folklore' on consultants' value Sir, There are some erroneous assumptions being peddled as part of an emerging folklore about the UK government's use of external consultants. I would like to put some more balanced points down for the record. Over the past 10 years there has been a significant increase in the use of external consultants by the public sector. But 'consultancy' is a very difficult activity to define and many of the blurred boundaries have found their way into the assumptions which have been incorrectly matched up in recent articles in the press. The government is a significant purchaser of external advice and does spend a considerable amount in this area, as it does on research and on purchasing contracted services. It is, therefore, important and timely to be looking at the use of external consultants so that the government can be sure the best value for money is being obtained. In some cases, the money is well spent; in others we are not so sure. The Efficiency Unit scrutiny team is examining whether the purchasing of external advice can be improved. Are there best practices developed in some areas of government which might be shared more widely? Are there management systems which might be put in place to assess benefits and value for money in a more quantifiable way? These and other questions are part of the team's brief. Different sources of advice should not be seen as being mutually exclusive. They can be complementary, with the government purchasing expertise which does not reside within the public sector. At other times drawing on a different range of experience would be prudent and desirable. Many consultancies are, of course, not aimed at producing savings, though in the long run savings may be achieved. One could cite here improving customer services, developing training systems and designing strategic management systems. These lead to benefits but they are not always quantifiable under a direct bookkeeping type 'savings' heading. It would be foolish indeed to expect government to put a rigid straitjacket over the decision-making process, and insist that only one source of advice should be considered valid expenditure of the taxpayer's pound. This is a good time to take stock and to look at the value for money obtained from using external consultants. But it is much more helpful if this debate takes place on the basis of a final report, with the supporting data assembled and displayed, rather than at an intermediate stage when not all of the evidence has been assembled and when the report is still some way from reaching final conclusions.

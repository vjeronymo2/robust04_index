			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria states the following in  connection with the signing of the agreement on limited  Palestinian self-rule:    The agreement signed on May 4, 1994 by Israeli Prime  Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is an important step  towards achieving just, all-embracing and lasting peace in the  Middle East. In a relatively brief period of time after the  Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid in late 1991,  two of the most important participants in the negotiations have  shown that political will, mutual compromises and concessions  can result in considerable progress in the further solution of  the complicated problems which have accumulated in the region  over the past decades.    Hailing the signing of this important document, the Republic  of Bulgaria expresses its belief that it reveals real  possibilities for continuing peace negotiations after the Madrid  formula and creates the necessary preconditions for the signing  of agreements between Israel and the other Arab countries taking  part in the peace process, preserving and guaranteeing the  balance of interests of all Middle East states, the declaration  of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry reads.</p>

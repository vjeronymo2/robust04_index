			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Chilean airline falls to Dollars 1.17m LAN CHILE, the Chilean airline in which Scandinavian Airlines System has a 35 per cent stake, said it had net profit of Dollars 1.17m in 1992, Reuter reports from Santiago. Profits were lower than the Dollars 3.5m posted for 1991, but Lan said they were made 'in the context of a deep crisis in the world aviation industry'.</p>

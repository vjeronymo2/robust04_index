			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market passes Pounds 154m rights issue test EQUITIES survived another severe test of nerve, closing in reasonably good shape, after the recent post-election trickle of small-sized rights issues began to flow stronger yesterday. BICC, the international cables and heavy electrical group, emerged to ask the market for Pounds 154m via a straight rights offer. However, the rights issue's effect was cushioned somewhat by a handsome set of preliminary figures from J. Sainsbury, which inherited from Marks and Spencer the mantle of the UK's most profitable retailing organisation. There was also another rock solid performance by sterling against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound's strength led more market participants to expect a further reduction in UK interest rates. There was further good news from an encouraging survey of UK business confidence, carried out by the Confederation of British Industry. Adding to an overall cheerful mood in London was renewed overseas buying of UK stocks. The FT-SE 100-share Index, after one of its most subdued sessions since the general election, closed 1.9 off at 2,720.5. Brokers remained more than happy, however, with the level of business moving through the market. Yesterday saw turnover in equities top the 600m-share mark to reach 604.6m, compared with Tuesday's 592.1m shares. Although Tuesday's turnover was below recent levels, the value of customer business remained well ahead of the Pounds 1bn daily level regarded as the minimum requirement to provide a profitable market-place for broking firms. More good news regarding the strength and flexibility of London securities houses came with news that Kleinwort Benson Securities had carried out a Pounds 40m-plus deal, placing with its institutional clients a 3.26m block of shares in Securitas, the Swedish company, on behalf of Group 4 Securitas. The BICC rights issue, plus another, albeit much smaller, fund-raising exercise by Transfer Technology, which asked shareholders for Pounds 24m, coming so soon after the bout of profit-taking and indigestion caused by recent placings and bought deals, resulted in only momentary problems for the market. The Footsie began the session almost five points lower at 2,717.5, but was quickly on the recovery trail after J. Sainsbury delighted its investors in reporting a 21 per cent leap in preliminary profits to Pounds 628m, leapfrogging Marks and Spencer's Pounds 623.5m, reported on Tuesday, and increasing its market share. Sainsbury shares surged higher on exceptionally heavy turnover, taking those of fellow food retailers Tesco and Argyll with them. Insurers were also very much in demand, with Royal sought ahead of today's first-quarter numbers, which are expected to show a slight improvement against the corresponding quarter. Guardian Royal Exchange initially responded to whispers that one of the big European insurers may be casting a predatory eye over the UK composite. Ratners shares are expected to come under pressure this morning, after the group said it would need to make an exceptional charge of Pounds 98m in its 1991/2 accounts to accommodate rationalisation costs.</p>

The issue of creating a federal tax system that is  differentiated by the country's regions is being raised with  increasing urgency. Our correspondent met with Candidate of  Economic Sciences Boris Viktorovich Melentyev, a specialist on  regional and interregional problems and a research associate at  the Institute of Economics and Organization of Industrial  Production of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of  Sciences. The topic of their conversation is taxes.    [Voronchikhin] Boris Viktorovich, literally everyone today  is  moaning about chaos in taxation. It is complicated, confusing,  too much, unfair, and so on. In the past we only knew about  income tax, plus childless people had to pay a certain  percentage of their wages. Now there are all sorts of  deductions. I bet that soon there will a tax on beards. Do we  really need such a multitude of taxes, and can we not do without  them altogether?    [Melentyev] By tax we usually understand mandatory payments  appropriated by the state. We usually part with this money with  regret, especially if taxes are high. Nevertheless, a certain  part of taxes, especially at the all-Russia (federal) level, are  a necessary attribute of financial regulation of economic  activities. They are needed because the state, through tax  revenue, finances directly out of the budget, among other  things, defense, the pension and other social funds, targeted  development of new production, etc.    [Voronchikhin] Since it is a "production necessity,"  dictated  by "harsh reality," then should there not be, instead of the  chaos that reigns today in state tax policy, a flexible system  of duties that is agreeable for everyone?    [Melentyev] Creating a logical system of taxes is to a  certain extent an art: They must be simple; the principles for  calculating them, understandable for everyone; there should not  be many of them; and they should not be too high and should not  suppress the initiative of economic growth. In order for taxes  to serve as active means of state policy, it is desirable that  they fulfill several functions--for instance, not only ensure  the flow of revenue, but also stimulate achievement of certain  policy goals. In particular, high excise tax on tobacco and  alcohol products constrains consumption of these products by  young people; increasing tax on profit if it is used for wages  provides an incentive to direct it into production development.    Unfortunately, most existing taxes do not meet these  requirements. I will point out one peculiarity that is not  typical of the tax systems of other countries, but for us it is  simply mandatory. It is appropriation of an enterprise's extra  income for its placement in favorable climatic conditions (one  of the kinds of differential rents). In the world practice a  differential rent is not calculated separately and is included  in enterprise's income, therefore is appropriated only partially  within the limits of tax on profit. But the world does not have  other countries comparable to Russia in terms of territorial  size. Differential rents manifest themselves in the income from  foreign trade of southern countries with those in the north  because of lower costs of agricultural products.    A transition from the prevailing old system of financial  regulation of economic activities by planned targets to  management where economic (market) principles become  increasingly predominant constitutes the main contents of the  reforms began in 1985. Their goal is to shift to profit as the  criterion of activities, and by providing a combination of  centralized administration and market regulation to expand the  principles of self-financing not only for territorial entities  (oblasts, republics).    [Voronchikhin] This means that today a lot depends on the  competent actions of bodies of state administration?    [Melentyev] Modern practice demands a transition from a  rigid  planning, lessening, and reduction of this function of central  bodies, to strict measures of financial regulation. The old  system of economic management could not make serious demands on  the financial sphere. For instance, the prices enterprises  charged for their products did not necessarily cover the costs,  since what was demanded of enterprises was first and foremost to  fulfill the plan. The all-national economic  balance--distribution of the output produced--was carried out  only at the top level; at the bottom, the disbalance was covered  by subsidies. In the new environment, state administration  bodies have to create for all economic entities an adequate  economic and legal environment. It is characterized by a fair  tax system, setting up a mechanism of mutual responsibility  between enterprises and financial bodies, maintaining equivalent  circulation, and timely banking and credit clearing.    [Voronchikhin] You were talking about climatic conditions; I  assume you had in mind northern allowances and the Siberian  coefficient?..    [Melentyev] The process of expanding the regulating role of  the state with the help of economic elements of administration  (prices for the output of monopolist enterprises, taxes,  credits, etc.) have their special peculiarities in our country  because of its great territory and sharp differences in natural  and climatic conditions. This peculiarity requires equalizing  the operating environment across the regions. People living in  the regions with harsher climate spend more on warm clothing and  food. Also of considerable importance is that consumer goods are  more expensive here as well. This means that wages in these  regions must be higher than in the south. A man, no matter in  what region he lives, should get for the same labor the wages  that would provide him with the same standard of living.    Until now the state regulated the factor of such  differentials in the form of centrally set territorial  coefficients to base wages. In addition, prices for enterprises'  output also were centrally differentiated by region: in the  south they were lower, and in the north, higher. This way  differential rent was appropriated and production environment  was equalized across the regions. In modern market relations  most prices are set either by the market or by regional rather  than central bodies. As is known, prices in any market have a  tendency to equalize. For instance, during V. Chernomyrdin's  visit to the Far East in August of last year, a demand was made  to set electric power rates there at the same level as in the  rest of Russia. But with prices the same on average across the  regions, the differential rent ends up in the southerners'  income. This is not fair since this income is not associated  directly with the labor expenditures of those who have  appropriated this income in a disguised form.    Now the state function of factoring territorial differences  is narrowed down and includes only entities financed out of the  federal budget. For economically independent enterprises the  principle of factoring regional costs and deduction of  differential rent must be determined differently.    [Voronchikhin] How?    [Melentyev] Wages are an element of enterprises' costs.  Therefore, those located in harsher climatic conditions  objectively will have higher costs at least because of higher  wages. In addition, harsh climate requires greater use of  electric power, fuels, additional costs... This means that  enterprises in the north will produce more expensive products  that are not competitive with those produced by enterprises in  the south. I do not have to explain the consequences.    You cannot place the entire population in the square  adjacent  to the White House. It is in the interest of the state to  distribute the population across the entire territory of the  country. Therefore, wages must be differentiated, while  enterprises' income must be equalized in accordance with the  principle of social justice. The proposal is very simple: to  introduce a federal tax on land; [column line missing] in the  north it will be lower. The difference between the level of  taxes must cover the additional expenses incurred in the north  because of the harsh climatic conditions and the distance from  industrially developed centers.    [Voronchikhin] As many centuries of Russian history show us,  the issue of land is one of the most difficult to resolve.  Perhaps taxes would provide that very tool with the help of  which this delicate problem at least may be regulated less  painfully?    [Melentyev] The impact of this tax is multifaceted. First,  it  provides an incentive for enterprises not to halt production,  because this tax always has to be paid, even when the enterprise  has no output. Second, it provides an incentive for prudent land  use, because this use is not free. The aforementioned principle  of equalizing production conditions sharply diminishes the need  to develop a system of prices for transportable products  produced by monopolist enterprises that are differentiated by  zones, because a regional differential from the average national  price will be determined by the difference in selling and  transportation costs in deliveries between regions. Besides,  land tax is more stable than prices. After all, its level does  not depend on the changing state of the market and other  operational environment.    Establishing such a tax is not a goal in itself--it is an  element of improving the system of financial regulation of  economic activities. The main principle of the tax policy should  be as follows: Only after fulfilling the equalizing function  with the help of regionally differentiated land-use rent can a  unified principle of taxation by other factors be ensured.    [Voronchikhin] A regional tax differential probably should  be  scientifically substantiated, pass the expert evaluation of the  Federal Assembly, and be codified in law, should it not?    [Melentyev] Unfortunately, the idea of a regional tax  differential makes headway with great difficulty and sometimes  degenerates into foreign forms. Instead of differentiating taxes  as such, the share of contribution into local and federal  budgets is differentiated. This situation creates a basis for  bureaucratic arbitrariness with very familiar rules: to give or  not to give; how much to give and how much to take? [Word  missing] for instance, the republics of Chechnya, Yakutia,  Bashkortostan, and Tatarstan transfer the entire revenue from  the value-added tax into local budgets; some oblasts transfer 20  percent, and some, 50 percent. Apparently, what is behind it is  not economic calculation but rather the level of noise produced  by statements of their sovereignty.    [Voronchikhin] Is this not why other federation components  before the adoption of the new constitution so actively demanded  republic status?    [Melentyev] Most likely. Keeping in mind the caution of  federal authorities in this delicate business--what share of  taxes to give up to the federal budget--it becomes necessary to  set custom duties for one or another republic or oblast with  respect to the import and export of products. The level of  "import" duties should exactly correspond to the value of  differential rents charged.    For instance, Russia does not produce citrus fruit or  grapes;  this means that import of these products should be duty-free.  But when we import what we make ourselves, we should apply the  tax--in order to equalize the economic conditions of production,  to protect domestic producers. Hence, the slogan of a single  economic space that is currently being touted by the presidents  of the CIS southern republics is unsuitable for Russia. Just as  Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova have the right to purchase our gas  or other goods in their own way, on different terms.    Implementing the principles described above to construct a  regional differential federal tax system finally will allow  liquidation of the statute on unsubsidized development of the  northern territories, or at least reduce the subsidies to  one-time events, that is, temporary state subventions  (development-aimed incentive subsidies). We have to hurry,  because economic contradictions between regions and injustice  usually result in social tension...</p>

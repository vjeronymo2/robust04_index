			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Airbus foresees big demand Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft-making consortium, yesterday forecast that demand from airlines would exceed 13,000 aircraft by the year 2011 and that it would win about 40 per cent of the orders. The forecast, in the company's monthly newsletter, said demand would be strongest from North American and Asian airlines and just over half of the orders would come from the renewal of existing fleets. 'Of the 8,500 airliners in service at the end of 1991, 83 per cent should be replaced by the year 2011,' the company said. Combined with traffic growth, it airlines would need 13,400 new aircraft in the 20-year period from 1992. The assumptions are based on average annual airline traffic growth of 5.4 per cent, with the strongest annual increase, of about 7.4 per cent, coming in the Asia-Pacific region. The consortium, which groups Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain, said an increasing proportion of orders would be for large wide-bodied aircraft. 'Airlines will want aircraft which can handle more than 500 passengers, to cut costs and boost efficiency,' said the company.</p>

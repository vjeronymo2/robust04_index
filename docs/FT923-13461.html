			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / 'Millions of green jobs to be created' DEMOCRATIC vice-presidential candidate Senator Al Gore said yesterday there were millions of jobs to be created - and stolen from Japan and Germany - if the US led the way on the environment, Reuter reports from New York. 'This supposed choice between jobs and the environment is a bogus issue,' Mr Gore, a leading environmental activist, said on television on the first day of his party's election-year convention. However, critics fear that his policies would put nature above people and cost workers their jobs, at a time when US unemployment is already hovering at an eight-year high. President George Bush, the Republican incumbent, has been attacked as a laggard on the environment who has failed to provide world leadership or even keep up with the rest of the pack. Mr Gore said Washington's main economic rivals realised there were big profits to be made in exporting environmentally-sound products to the developing world. 'Japan and Germany and others are gearing up to sell those products. Millions of jobs can be created here in America if we are able to lead that environmental revolution,' he said.</p>

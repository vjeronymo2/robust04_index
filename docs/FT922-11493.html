			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Iraq acts to curb price rises Iraq removed import duties on meat and potatoes yesterday to check a sharp rise in prices since its Gulf war defeat, Reuter reports from Baghdad. The most essential foods such as rice, flour and cooking oil were already exempt but pre-war duties had remained in force on items for which the government had wanted to encourage local production. Luxury foods, including tinned goods, will still have high tariffs.</p>

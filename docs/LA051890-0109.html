			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MODESTO;  </P> <P> S.F. PLANS SUIT OVER TREATMENT PLANT  </P> <P> The city of San Francisco has notified the Modesto Irrigation District that it  intends to file suit challenging a proposed water treatment plant. "It is truly  with a heavy heart that the city has determined that it must proceed with  litigation regarding your environmental impact report for the domestic water  treatment plant," Mayor Art Agnos wrote the district.  </P> <P> The lawsuit would challenge an environmental impact report on the $200-million  plant that would deliver Tuolumne River water to 160,000 customers in Modesto  and outlying areas. San Francisco officials charge that the report did not  adequately analyze the underground water supply or detail the effects on San  Francisco's water supply and does not explore conservation options. MID  President Bill Lyons called the pending litigation an attempt by San Francisco  to control more than its share of river water. "We will not sit down and talk  with a gun to our heads. It's blackmail," he said.  </P></p>

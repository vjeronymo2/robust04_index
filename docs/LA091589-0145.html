			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MILLIKAN SEIZES MOMENT TO DEFEAT WESTMINSTER  </P> <P> After watching their team lose to Long Beach Millikan, 13-7, on Thursday night,  Westminster High School fans may want to console themselves with a few good  memories.  </P> <P>  -- Westminster had its spurts . . . just not in the right spots.  </P> <P>  -- Westminster had a few great plays . . . but also a few too many lousy ones.  </P> <P>  -- Westminster had Vance Senteno, who not only provided the Lions' touchdown  but the most exhilarating moments of the game when he returned kickoffs 73 and  70 yards.  </P> <P> The problem? In the game's final moments, Senteno was in severe pain. Team  physicians and trainers examined his left shoulder for a possible injury.  </P> <P> Although the game got off to a rousing start on Senteno's 73-yard opening  kickoff return and his seven-yard touchdown run three plays later, neither team  managed much of a drive for the rest of the first quarter.  </P> <P> The second quarter was much the same, until Millikan capitalized on a  Westminster mistake midway through the period. In what Westminster Coach Stan  Clark called a severe breakdown in communications, the Lions opted to pass on a  fourth-and-eight situation at their 10.  </P> <P> When Westminster quarterback John Shipp's pass fell incomplete, Millikan only  needed three running plays before Andre Borden scored easily on a one-yard run.  But Millikan's extra-point attempt fell short, leaving Westminster with a 7-6  lead. Although Senteno returned the ensuing kickoff 70 yards to the Millikan  20, Westminster failed to score.  </P> <P> In the second half, both teams were sluggish at the start. But with four  minutes remaining in the third quarter, Millikan's Keith Baker caught a punt,  outwitted several tackles in running 65 yards along the sideline for a  touchdown. The ensuing extra-point kick gave Millikan its final lead, 13-7.  </P> <P> Although Shipp -- who in the first half did not complete a pass in four  attempts -- finally found his groove in the fourth quarter, Westminster  couldn't capitalize. He threw five consecutive completions, bringing the Lions  to the Millikan 13. Four plays -- and no gain of yards -- later, Westminster  turned over the ball on downs.  </P> <P> It wouldn't have been so bad had Westminster not repeated the process on its  next possession. With less than three minutes to play, Shipp connected with  Dave Spence on a 20-yard pass that put Westminster at the 11. But after an  incomplete pass and two sacks for losses by Millikan tackle Lincoln Starks,  Westminster turned over the ball on downs again.  </P></p>

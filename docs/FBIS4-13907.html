			<p>BFN     [Text] The PLO-Israel economic talks have seen some delay.  They realized progress in tourism but have hit snags on the  customs and labor force issues. The heads of the two  delegations left for Tunis and Israel to consult with 'Arafat  and Rabin respectively and will be back in Paris on 25 April.  We have asked Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head of the  Palestinian delegation to the Paris talks and who is also the  head of the PLO Economic Department, about the achievements of  the talks this week. He said:    [Begin recording] [Quray'] In this round we realized  progress  in tourism. A paper has been agreed on. We have no big  problems in this matter. The difficult problem which is still  unsolved concerns imports and related policies, trade and its  effect on the overall economic policy. We have agreed on a  principle which I consider to be important and a gain, namely,  that there must be an imports policy, a Palestinian customs  policy regarding a number of commodities that are basic and  important for development and for the living conditions of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territory, in terms of  pricing, customs tariff, permitting imports, and other things,  with the Arab countries and the world. However, we have hit a  snag on defining these commodities with Israel. This has been  and still is a problem. We hope they will reconsider their  position on it next week.    The other topic is the currency and banknotes. Here also the  talks stopped at a previous problem, namely, the Palestinian  currency and the Shekel, will it be a legal tender [previous two  words in English] or a usable currency ['umlat tadawul]. We  insist on the term usable currency. I can say that these are  the difficult basic points in these negotiations. When we come  back we will talk about the other issues.    [Correspondent] During this round, you also discussed the  issue of the Palestinian labor force. What have you achieved in  this regard?    [Quray'] Concerning this point, we raised the issue of the  suffering and pain of our workers because of the closure of the  territories and the Palestinian worker's inability to go to  work, whether in the occupied territory or in Israel, and the  serious reflections of this situation on the overall peace  process. We presented this in the previous round and we have  repeated this in this round and they showed some flexibility in  this regard. They allowed 5,000 workers to return to work. A  budget for employment has been allocated for Gaza and the West  Bank, about $10 million.    The fact is that this is just some sort of a sedative, it  does not solve the problem. Either the employment process is  organized or new job opportunities for the Palestinian worker  are created within the national economy. Such a creation is our  ambition, but it is a very difficult process and will not be  realized by mere wishful thinking. It needs construction,  projects, infrastructure, and other things. I am not going to  discuss economic science here. The feasible issue is for this  process to be organized with Israel. This is what we are  considering in the negotiations. It has not been decided yet.  [end recording]</p>

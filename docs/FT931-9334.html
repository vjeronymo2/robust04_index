			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Warning on pit workers' pensions BRITISH Coal has told trustees of its two pension schemes that the government is likely to offer coal workers the same deal on pensions as that offered to British Rail. The government has said that after the rail privatisation it will stop its Pounds 70m annual contribution to the rail pension scheme, and contributions on behalf of current workers will be paid by their new private-sector employers. BR's pension trustees have been offered two options for current and deferred pensioners. The first would require BR to turn over a significant portion of its scheme assets to the Treasury in exchange for a promise by the government to increase pensions in line with inflation, but there would be no further improvements in benefits. The other option would allow BR to keep all the assets but, if these proved inadequate to meet pension obligations, benefits would be cut. BR's scheme has total assets of Pounds 7.22bn, with more than 130,000 contributors and about 176,000 current and deferred pensioners. British Coal has two schemes, one for white-collar staff and the other for mineworkers. Between them they have about Pounds 13bn in assets, with only 72,000 contributing members but 345,000 pensioners and 277,000 deferred pensioners. Miss Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme, said yesterday on BBC Television's Money Programme that she did not view government regulations as a sufficient safeguard for the pensioners in her scheme. She said: 'I think that the trustees of the staff scheme would certainly want primary legislation to guarantee the security of pensions for the future, if such a a proposal were to be adopted.' Trustees have discussed in private meetings earlier this year whether they could rely on funding promises made by one government being honoured by successive governments without legislation. Moreover, trustees are concerned that their present trust deed requires them to ensure that any change leaves pensioners no worse than they had been previously. Both BR and British Coal pensions have been raised in line with inflation annually, and in addition large surpluses have been used in recent years to improve pensions -  particularly for the elderly and least-well-off. The government's insistence that no further improvements may be made therefore effectively worsens conditions for the pensioners. Coal fund trustees, after a series of meetings, are said to agree that it may be worthwhile to give up scheme assets to the Treasury if sufficient safeguards can be offered to protect current and future benefits. However, the trustees feel the plans so far offered to British Rail fall short of the safeguards needed. Trustees of BR's pension scheme, including those appointed by BR management, are preparing a paper for government ministers outlining their concerns about the proposals. A BR trustee said: 'We want to talk quietly to the government about the options. But at the end of the day, if we have Hobson's choice, then we must take the best option.' Among other things, the trustees will point out to the government that all the current actuarial surplus has already been allocated to contribution holidays and benefit enhancements.</p>

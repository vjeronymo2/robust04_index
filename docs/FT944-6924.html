			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Nato jets in action as Serbs give Bihac ultimatum Bosnian Serb forces closing in on the town of Bihac last night gave its defenders a 24-hour-ultimatum to surrender as Nato aircraft were ordered into action but apparently failed to make any strikes. Within hours of the Nato action, it was disclosed in Washington that 2,000 US marines had been ordered to the Adriatic as a possible support for United Nations forces. The ultimatum to the mainly Moslem government forces holed up in Bihac came from General Manojlo Milovanovic, the Bosnian Serbs' chief of staff, who said the defenders must put down their arms by this evening. 'If they do no not surrender, I cannot guarantee that their lives will be spared, because they have committed crimes against the Serbs,' he said in a grim-voiced message. The United Nations said it called on Nato aircraft to over-fly the area because of a danger to civilians and UN personnel. But the bombers, which were fired on by SAM-6 missiles, did not make any strikes because they failed to locate any targets, a UN official said. The Bosnian Serbs claimed two Nato bombs had landed and said Bosnian government positions would suffer 'the least peaceful of nights' as a result. Serb-controlled media said the Serb forces and their allies in a renegade Moslem force led by Mr Fikret Abdic were advancing on the town centre. A radio station controlled by Mr Abdic said 400 of his men had entered the town. UN officials said the Serbs were about a mile from Bosnian army headquarters but could not confirm that there had been any change of position yesterday. In Washington, Pentagon officials described the despatch of the marines as 'strictly precautionary', adding that the amphibious group would be available if needed to support UN forces in Bosnia. The marines, on an amphibious flotilla headed by the USS Nassau, were ordered to cut short their visit to the French port of Toulon and sail to the Adriatic. Although the Nato allies have begun discussions of a possible US role in providing cover if Unprofor should have to withdraw from Bosnia, officials in Washington said no detailed contingency plan for withdrawal had been agreed. President Bill Clinton has insisted that there would be no question of sending US ground troops to Bosnia except within the framework of a peace deal agreed by all sides. The Serb threats followed the announcement by the UN of a ceasefire in the Bihac area, and a day of arguments between the UN and the Bosnian government as to how badly it was being violated and by whom.

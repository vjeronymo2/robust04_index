			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Senior staff at Matav agree Dollars 15m pay-off Senior managers at Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms group, have taken a leaf out of the western corporate practices book by awarding themselves capacious golden parachutes. Western telecoms consortia, which are bidding for 30 per cent of Matav, said yesterday that 127 executives at the Hungarian group had teed-up severance packages worth around Ft1.5bn (Dollars 15m). The disclosure comes embarrassingly close to the announcement expected tomorrow that a consortium of Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US has won the stake in Matav on sale in what is eastern Europe's largest privatisation. The Hungarian state holding company AV RT informed the competing consortia about the liability on Monday, the day before final offers were due. Officials told bidders they had only recently discovered the severance arrangements themselves and it is believed that Matav management instituted the generous terms in the last few weeks. AV RT promised to indemnify the successful consortium against the liability and discussed possible legal action against Matav executives. The western group which wins Matav takes the right to nominate half of the company's operating committee. Matav's current executives have been nervous about personnel changes. Under the terms of the contract, the western investor would not, however, have the power to remove Mr Pal Horvath, managing director of Matav. The Dollars 15m contingent liability is a relatively moderate sum by western standards and in comparison with the value of the 30 per cent stake in Matav which bids put at about Dollars 900m. But in Hungary a year's basic state pension is a hundredth of the redundancy payment now due to an average Matav executive.</p>

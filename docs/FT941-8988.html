			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Electricity shows highest return of sold-off utilities The electricity industry earned the highest return on capital of the privatised utilities in 1992-93, a comparison of regulated industries shows. The Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries reports today that the average return on historical capital employed in the non-nuclear electricity industry was 23.4 per cent over the period. This compared with 15.2 per cent in telecommunications, 13.6 per cent in gas, 10.9 per cent for airports and 10.6 per cent for water. The report follows last week's agreement by the electricity generators to cap wholesale electricity prices after complaints about rising electricity charges. Since then electricity distributors have started to cut prices in their long-term contracts with industrial users. The report shows that Scottish Power earned the highest return on capital of the privatised utilities with 33.6 per cent, followed by the National Grid Company, which is jointly owned by the electricity distributors, with 28.9 per cent. The report also showed that the state-owned nuclear generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, have a long way to go before earning private-sector returns. Nuclear Electric's return on capital was 7.4 per cent, and Scottish Nuclear's was 4.7 per cent. A public inquiry has been ordered by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, into the application by Scottish Power to build a 40-mile line of pylons across Ayrshire as part of the planned interconnector to supply power to Northern Ireland, James Buxton writes. The application is opposed in Ayrshire. It would involve building more than 200 pylons from near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire, which protestors say is one of the county's most beautiful areas. The interconnector, which is expected to cost Pounds 175m, also involves a cable across the Irish Sea. It will permit the transmission of 250MW of power to Northern Ireland Electricity, which is paying all but Pounds 20m of the scheme's cost. National Power, the electricity generator, was fined Pounds 7,500 and ordered to pay Pounds 13,250 costs for causing an oil spill in the river Thames. The spill, which happened last summer, was from the company's Littlebrook 'D' power station. The UK Regulated Industries: Financial Facts 1992-93. CRI, 3 Robert Street, London WC2N 6BH.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Several accords were signed at the end of  Uzbek-South Korean talks in Tashkent on Monday [6 June] -- a  cultural cooperation agreement, a bilateral free travel  memorandum, an air service agreement, and a protocol on  consultations and other contacts at foreign ministerial level.    Commenting on the outcome of the talks, South Korea's  President Kim Yong-sam told journalists that the accords  provided for "frontal cooperation between the two countries in  all fields of science, culture, and technology." "We regard  Uzbekistan as an important potential partner," he stressed. In  his opinion the most prospective cooperation fields are  electronics, communication, telecommunication, and gas  extraction and refinement.    "The two countries could prosper more by combining  Uzbekistan's natural wealth with South Korea's technologies and  finances," Kim Yong-sam said.    Noting the proximity of views with Seoul on a number of  international and regional problems, Uzbekistan's President  Islam Karimov spoke in favour of applying South Korea's  experience in consolidating Uzbekistan as a state politically  and otherwise. He described the Korean form of government as  democracy rather than arbitrary rule and said that a factor such  as strong executive power used by South Korea during its reform  suited Uzbekistan as well.    Asked by INTERFAX about Tashkent's attitude toward NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, Karimov said: "Uzbekistan has  nothing against the idea of Partnership for Peace. Uzbekistan  will sign this document. But we want to do so above all for  national interests rather than reasons of fashion. Haste in  this matter would be dangerous and improper," he said.    From Tashkent, Kim Yong-sam is going to Vladivostok tonight.</p>

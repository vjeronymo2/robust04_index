			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BID talk in Asda, in the traded options market, created substantial interest in an otherwise dull day for derivative markets, writes Joel Kibazo. Turnover in the London Traded Options Market reached 29,821 contracts, a big improvement on Monday's 19,926, with the bulk of the day's business carried out in stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was negligible at 4,922 lots. Asda was the top traded stock option as takeover talk returned. There was a total of 7,051 contracts traded, with the July 35 calls - in which 3,670 lots were dealt - the busiest series. This was followed by British Airways, which reported good profits that led to a clutch of profit upgrades. It traded 2,961 lots. Hanson, BT and Lasmo, in which dividend cuts are forecast, were also busy. In stock index futures, dealers talked of a dull session with June trading in a narrow range for a large part of the day. June opened at 2,727, which proved to be the high point of the day. Buying interest at the lower levels was modest, with economic statistics and Wall Street having no effect on the day's trading. June finished at 2,717, down 12 from the previous session and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover was a poor 4,649.</p>

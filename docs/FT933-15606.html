			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: ITV burdened with public service anachronism Sir, The National Heritage Committee's ill-informed knee-jerking over the News at Ten issue and the unnecessarily strong language in which the committee's report was couched only serve to underline the fundamental contradictions at the heart of the Broadcasting Act 1990 ('MPs condemn ITV over News At Ten proposals', July 3). What the committee failed to recognise is that ITV is going through an inevitable but painful transition - from a system with a considerable public service element to one of more or less unfettered commercialism (which are not, by the way, dirty words). The pain of this transition has been foisted on ITV by the Act, which cobbled together a system of competitive tendering which was supposed to value bids by the mechanism of the free market. In stark contrast, however, it burdened the ITV companies with very un-marketlike public service obligations in programming and scheduling. Forcing ITV to set its schedules in stone forever in the name of 'public service' will weigh ITV down with obligations which can only hinder it in competing in the domestic and international broadcasting market. In 20 years' time this will be seen as an anachronism in a world that has changed faster than the legislators realise. The true home of public service is the BBC. The legislators should not forget that, by no coincidence, the country with the world-beating media industry has the First Amendment. Daniel Sandelson, 16 Elgin Mews, South London W9 1JZ</p>

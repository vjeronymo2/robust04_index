			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Germany cuts key lending rate: Surprise move raises hopes for wider easing of monetary policy in Europe The Bundesbank unexpectedly cut its key discount lending rate yesterday by half a percentage point to 5.25 per cent, raising hopes of more speedy reductions in future. Resuming its cautious monetary relaxation programme after a pause of almost four months, the German central bank said it had taken into account the continuing fall in inflation which had further strengthened trust in the stability of the D-Mark. The decision was greeted with initial enthusiasm by European currency markets but the euphoria cooled. The D-Mark weakened across the board, but regained much of its losses in New York. Sterling rose nearly a pfennig to close at DM2.5559 in London, but lost most of its gains in US trade. The D-Mark was at FFr3.399 in late New York trade from FFr3.407 in London on Wednesday. It fell marginally against the dollar. Money market analysts said the move had improved the prospects for an easing of monetary policy elsewhere in Europe, but the rate of change would initially be slow. The German cuts were quickly followed by rate cuts in Belgium, Austria and Italy. The Netherlands also altered two rates and Spain may follow suit. In a brief statement, the Bundesbank shrugged off recent explosive growth in money supply, saying its monetary policy was based on annual targets and that 'temporary disturbances had to be accepted'. Its decision also appeared to discount any danger of employers offering inflationary pay awards as a way of avoiding or ending national strikes threatened in the engineering sector. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, defended the softly-softly approach. The bank had to take care that its decisions did not have undesirable effects on long-term interest rates, he said. Up to 80 per cent of German industrial investment is financed with long-term loans. Yesterday's meeting of the central bank council left the lombard rate, the effective ceiling rate, unchanged at 6.75 per cent. The securities repurchase rate, at which the bank supplies short-term liquidity to the market, and which the Bundesbank considers its most important instrument, was also left unchanged at 6 per cent for next week's tender. The repo rate, at which German financial institutions borrow some two-thirds of their short-term funds, has remained unchanged since early December. Mr Otmar Issing, the central bank's chief economist, dismissed as malicious and false suggestions that Bundesbank policy had softened under Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new president. The decision was the 'right mixture', he said, demonstrating the bank's ability to act while allowing caution to prevail. Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt, said: 'As usual, they have made it seem a bit grudging. 'But the main thing is that rate cuts are back on the agenda.' The VoB association of public sector banks said the 'brave' move was not without risks for the D-Mark exchange rate, but that it was a step in the right direction, considering the unsatisfactory state of the economy. However, observers said they expected further cautious reductions in the repo rate as preparation for more moves on the discount rate, the effective 'floor' lending level.

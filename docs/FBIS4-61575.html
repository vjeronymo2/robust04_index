			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "The Problem of the Troop </F> Withdrawal From Germany Is Provoking Needless Tension, the  Russian Foreign Ministry Believes"]    [Text] The problem of the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Germany, which, on the eve of B. Yeltsin's visit, is  causing increasing tension due to a planned send-off scenario,  which is supposedly humiliating to veterans and to all Russians,  is seen differently in official circles.    We learned from the Russian Foreign Ministry that while this  scenario was being formulated, there were no differences in the  sides' approaches. An understanding was reached between B.  Yeltsin and H. Kohl that the send-off for the Russian troops  would be organized no less ceremonially than the send-off for  the three Western countries' troops. The president repeatedly  drew to the chancellor's attention the extent to which this  episode impinges on the feelings of Russians, especially  veterans.    Calls to demand from the German side a joint withdrawal of  the former allied troops are unfounded. Under the four-power  agreement, our troops are supposed to be withdrawn by 31 August,  and the three Western countries' troops by a later date. For  this reason, it is neither legally nor ethically valid to insist  on a change in this scenario, the Foreign Ministry believes.    As for B. Yeltsin's upcoming talks with H. Kohl, certain  details of the send-off will be clarified there. The  culmination of the ceremonies will be in the presence of the  German and Russian leaders in Weimar and Berlin. Nobody  disputes these proposals.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO SOUTHLAND STUDENTS KILLED IN CAR COLLISION ON MEXICAN MISSIONARY TRIP  </P> <P> A Westmont College student missionary died Tuesday from injuries suffered in a  head-on collision near Ensenada, Mexico, that had already claimed the life of  another student, officials said. A third was critically injured.  </P> <P> Garth Weedman, 19, a freshman from Pacific Grove, died early Tuesday morning of  head and internal injuries suffered Monday in an accident on Highway 1, which  runs the length of Baja California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Five Riding in Car  </P> <P> Five Westmont students were in the car, which collided with another containing  an allegedly drunk driver. The students from the Santa Barbara college were  doing missionary work over the Easter holidays, college officials said.  </P> <P> Lisa Bebout, 24, a senior physical education major from Mission Viejo, was  being tested for signs of brain activity, said a spokesman for Sharp Memorial  Hospital in San Diego.  </P> <P> Alan Voorman, 22, a senior in economics and business from Upland, died several  hours after the accident just north of Ensenada about 9 a.m. Monday.  </P> <P> "The description we have from people who saw it was that (Voorman's) vehicle  was like an accordion," Ronald Cronk, Westmont's vice president for finance and  administration, told the Santa Barbara News Press.  </P> <P> Hospital spokesmen said Megan Carter, 19, a freshman from Pacific Grove was in  good condition but will require plastic surgery.  </P> <P> The fifth student, Patty Hallock, 18, a freshman from Woodland, was also in  good condition Tuesday night. She suffered a broken leg.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Driver Is Detained  </P> <P> Mexican authorities said they detained Ruben Rodriguez Guzman, of Baja  California, in connection with the accident. He remained unconscious from his  injuries.  </P> <P> Guadalupe Lopez, a worker for the Baja state government, said Guzman was  believed to have been "very, very drunk" when he was removed from the scene. He  was being detained in the medical unit at the coroner's office in Ensenada,  pending a full investigation, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Control  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol spokesman Dave Robertson in San Diego said Guzman's  1977 Chevrolet was apparently traveling north when he lost control of the car.  It jumped the median and slammed head on into Voorman's 1980 Toyota Corolla.  </P> <P> The students were among about 450 from the Christian college who were in Mexico  to perform services for the poor. The college has been making the pilgrimage  for 11 years; it includes repairing churches and orphanages and medical and  dental treatment work with local pastors.  </P></p>

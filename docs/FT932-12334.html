			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Differences put China-Taiwan talks in jeopardy: Economic issues left unresolved THE CONCLUSION of talks last night between delegations from China and Taiwan in Singapore was postponed until today following sharp differences between the two on economic issues. These are the highest-level talks between the two since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. A joint document was due to have been signed this morning. A Taiwan delegate said that 'taking the totality of the meeting, it is more in the black than in the red'. The China delegation was more upbeat, saying considerable progress on many issues had been made. The joint document is expected to include agreements on the joint development of natural resources and provisions for scientific and cultural exchanges. Arguments centred on Taiwan's insistence that China offer some legal framework for the protection of its investments on the Chinese mainland. Conservative estimates put Taiwan investments in China at nearly Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn). Last year alone more than Dollars 5bn of money from Taiwan was invested in a wide variety of projects in China. At present all such investments are indirect, made mostly through Hong Kong holding companies. The mainland delegation at these talks has repeated Beijing's position that existing investment protection rules in China are adequate. The Beijing side said the formulation of any new laws was outside the scope of these talks. Last night the Taiwan side said it was still hoping to include some concrete joint proposals on the investment protection issue. But the negotiators were reported ultimately to have agreed to discuss the issue at a later date. Beijing has also asked the Taiwanese for direct trade and air links, a proposal Taipei refuses to countenance until China meets certain conditions, including renouncing the use of force against Taiwan and recognising the island as a separate entity and not, as at present, as another province of China. According to delegates from both sides, their long-term goal of reunification would be assisted by closer economic ties and an easing of cold war tensions.</p>

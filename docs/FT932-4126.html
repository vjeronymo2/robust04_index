			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Money Markets: German rate fears DEALERS in German interest rate markets were pessimistic about the prospects for near-term cuts in German rates yesterday as the D-Mark weakened sharply against most currencies, writes James Blitz. The passing of the Spanish general election has extinguished fears about another peseta devaluation for the time being, allowing dealers to sell the German currency - which is itself weakened by poor economic fundamentals. The Bundesbank appears unwilling to cut short-term interest rates while the currency is weak, for fear that this will increase the prospects for imported inflation. The lowest accepted repo rate was left unchanged at 7.60 per cent yesterday for 14-day maturities. For 28-day matur-ities the lowest accepted rate was 7.61 per cent. Yesterday, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, underlined that the central bank will take the value of the currency into account when plotting further rate cuts. According to one dealer, this had the danger of drawing a vicious circle: if the D-Mark weakens, that will leave interest rates high, threatening a recovery, which would in turn weaken the German currency. As a result, Euromark futures fell back yesterday afternoon. The June contract closed 4 basis points down at 92.44, while the September contract ended 5 basis points off on the day at 93.24. The D-Mark's weakness underlined the prospect that French interest rates could come down at a faster pace than is set by the Germans. The bid rate for three-month French francs dropped from 7.38 per cent yesterday to 7.25 per cent. The September French interest rate futures contract rose from 93.41 to 93.45 yesterday, although it later declined to 93.37. Sterling interest rate futures fell back yesterday after Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor, called for an independent Bank of England, saying that interest rate cuts should not be used as a purely political instrument. The September short sterling contract slipped 4 basis points to finish at 94.21, as expectations of another cut in UK base rates diminished. Three-month money was fractionally firmer in the cash market at 5 31/32 per cent. A Pounds 1.15bn shortage was easily despatched, although there was Pounds 40m of late assistance.</p>

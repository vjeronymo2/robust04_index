			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Book Review: Adapt to survive Corporate Culture and Performance By John P Kotter and James L Heskett Free Press/Macmillan Dollars 24.95 Professor Charles Handy, who is probably Britain's foremost management thinker, has made quite a splash with his argument that the purpose of a company these days must be much more than merely to create shareholder value. Instead he says that it must put the interests of customers and employees at least as high in its order of priorities. His message has been decried in some quarters as intriguing yet insufficiently hard-edged. But now two Harvard professors have demonstrated from extensive empirical research that his case is indeed strong. They show that the values he espouses are very much the ones which are associated with  -and may ensure - a company's ability to out-perform its competitors in the long term, both financially and in every other sense. In a nutshell, the message of John Kotter and James Heskett's book is that superior financial performance in most market circumstances is heavily dependent on having a culture which helps the organisation anticipate and adapt to changes in the business environment. One of their paragons in this respect is Hewlett-Packard, the US computer company. Strong but unadaptive cultures, like those of General Motors, can be at least as dangerous as weak ones, they argue. Yet, as British Airways, Nissan and others have shown, strong but inappropriate cultures can be changed, say Kotter and Heskett - given the right sort of leadership. All this will come as especially good news to anyone who invests in, or works for, IBM, ICI, or even troubled BP. These, and a host of other corporations, are expending considerable effort and expense on what they variously call organisational- or culture-change. One of the great virtues of this book, compared with the plethora of others on corporate culture and organisational change which has appeared in recent years, is that it is based on a set of studies into relatively large samples of companies - between 10 and 200, depending on the type of study. Another is its clarity, brevity and lack of evangelistic flannel. Its definition of organisational culture, for instance, is much simpler than most. Whereas previous writers have argued that it consists of multiple layers, Kotter and Heskett delineate just two, each of which influences the other. At a visible level are the behaviour patterns of groups of employees (such as fast or slow responses to customer requests, and the involvement or otherwise of junior employees in decision-making). At a deeper, less conscious, level are values which are shared by people in the group. In some corporate cultures people care most deeply about customers, in others about technological innovation, and in still others about their managerial status. Until a decade ago, most people's understanding of corporate culture extended only as far as the idea that, to be successful, companies require just one or two strongly 'shared values', such as IBM's commitment to customer service and its respect for individual employees. Then the bestseller In Search of Excellence, by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, taught people that culture was much more complex. But what neither school of thought spotted was that, in an age of rapid change, cultures appropriate to today's business environment may be unsuitable - or even lethal - in tomorrow's. Many of the companies lauded by Peters and Waterman stumbled soon afterwards. More recently, IBM and Citibank have done so too. Such companies can do well for quite a while, say Kotter and Heskett, because their cultures fit their relatively static environments. But when these start to change, the company's competitive performance suffers. Kotter and Heskett's empirical research assessed in various ways the cultural characteristics and financial performance of their study of companies over 11 years to 1988. Their prime conclusion from the data is that a company will adapt appropriately only if all its members really care deeply about, and pay constant attention to, what the academics call 'the three key managerial consistencies': customers, stockholders and employees. As each constituency changes its preferences and priorities, the company anticipates or responds. The Harvard pair put the three constituencies in a slightly different order from Professor Handy, but their message is essentially the same as his. And as powerful. The book is slightly less satisfactory in its advice about how companies can turn themselves into adaptive paragons like Hewlett-Packard. It contains plenty of examples of successful change programmes, such as those at American Express, Bankers Trust, British Airways, Xerox and especially ICI and Nissan. Yet some of its judgments of success are premature - at Scandinavian Airlines for instance - despite its own correct warning that culture change can seldom occur quickly. The book is also rather short on evidence that many such change efforts have instilled a really flexible set of 'adaptive' values, rather than just created a more modern but still static culture.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sid still interested in new issues PRIVATE investors are interested in buying shares in new issues, according to ProShare, the body which promotes wider share ownership. This counters a belief among bankers and brokers which have organised flotations this year and found low levels of demand from retail investors, dubbed 'Sid' since the British Gas privatisation marketing programme. ProShare based its view on a survey conducted by ShareLink, an execution-only stockbroker, which suggested small investors would be more interested in issues if they had better access to the shares. Some have found it impossible to acquire shares in flotations. The Stock Exchange has been relaxing its new issue rules since the summer to allow more shares to be placed rather than offered to the public because of the lack of retail demand. It said that it would be looking at the ProShare survey. The Stock Exchange said it had to make a judgment on each issue as to what was the most appropriate way for it to be marketed. Sponsoring banks had to convince the Exchange of a lack of retail demand before the offer structure could be changed. It said it was monitoring new issues closely to see if retail demand was returning.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE REJECTS BAN ON MINE LAND SALES  </P> <P> Spurred by protests from Western states, the Senate late Monday rejected a  proposed one-year ban on selling federal land containing gold, silver and other  hard-rock minerals to mining companies for as little as $2.50 an acre.  </P> <P> The proposed temporary moratorium on issuing cheap titles to federal mining  land was sponsored by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), who called the practice a  flagrant giveaway of public land and "the biggest scam still going on in  America."  </P> <P> Western senators led by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Bumpers' proposal would  devastate the U.S. mining industry and stifle economic development.  </P></p>

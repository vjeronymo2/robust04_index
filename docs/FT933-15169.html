			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Tiphook calls for share fall probe TIPHOOK, the UK transport rental company, yesterday asked the London Stock Exchange to investigate trading in its shares after the price fell suddenly in controversial circumstances for the second time in only three months. The shares had already fallen by 44p to 284p yesterday afternoon when the company announced to the exchange that its 1992-93 results, to be reported next week, would include 'significant changes to accounting policies'. The shares recovered slightly to close 40p down at 288p. The sudden fall bore resemblance to a precipitous slide in April only days before Tiphook made a profits warning. At that time, Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management, said there was 'prima facie' evidence of insider dealing and suggested that nothing would emerge from a formal investigation. He had no comment yesterday. The exchange said yesterday it would automatically look at a big fall in a company's share price. It has already been looking at allegations of insider dealing. Tiphook's statement yesterday said: 'The results for the year-end to April will include significant changes to accounting policies, principles and interpretation, which will bring the company's reporting more into line with US accounting principles.' It added later that it wanted to 'ascertain if there was any reason for the fall' in its share price. One explanation put forward by a financier close to Tiphook is that bankers got wind of the decision to change accounting policy. British institutional investors have been concerned about Tiphook's trading performance and volatile share price since the company's rights issue in 1990. So far this year, TSB, Fidelity and Gartmore have each reduced their shareholdings to below 3 per cent. These shareholders have been replaced largely by US investors, who now hold at least 18.7 per cent in the form of American Depository Receipts. Before news of the accounting change, analysts had been expecting Tiphook's pre-tax profits to be down from Pounds 86m to about Pounds 75m. London shares, Page 15</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Apec officials agree on code for investors Senior officials of the 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum agreed late last night on the text of a new code on foreign direct investment in a move that removed, for the time being, a serious block to progress on trade liberalisation at their meeting here. 'We have reached a constructive conclusion,' said Mr Peter Adams of New Zealand, co-chairman of the group which has been struggling to resolve differences over investment all week. Neither he nor other delegates would comment on details of the agreement, but US officials, who had objected to an earlier draft on the grounds that it was too weak, said they were pleased with the outcome. The text must be approved by Apec ministers who start formal talks here today in the run-up to next week's summit. Several officials warned that the agreement could not be regarded as final since ministers might want to change the text. But they said they had managed to reach agreement on a unified text which should prevent the politicians becoming bogged down in their own contentious drafting process. A row over the investment code has been simmering here all week as Washington sought stronger wording on several clauses. Although the code is non-binding, the US was worried that the original draft offered international investors insufficient protection against regulatory discrimination by the host government. The US felt the code also lacked teeth in combating restrictions on repatriation of profits and the imposition of arbitrary export performance standards. Part of the problem was that the original draft was weaker in this regard than a similar agreement reached in the Uruguay Round. Right up till last night, however, differences within Apec had threatened to create an impasse even before the summit began. Agreement at the official level will improve the mood of today's opening ministerial meeting, but there is no guarantee that this technical advance will make it easier to resolve deep-seated differences over the timetable for full liberalisation of trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Officials said they had not begun to consider the target date of 2020 proposed by Apec's independent group of eminent persons. This is being left for heads of state at their meeting here next week, but Mr Fred Bergsten, the US economist who chaired the eminent persons group, said last night he was optimistic that a decision could be reached. Mr Bergsten said that the Republican victory in this week's congressional elections might make the conduct of US trade policy easier. The Republicans will want to show they can work with the Clinton administration, he said, and they have fewer disagreements on trade and foreign policy than on domestic issues.</p>

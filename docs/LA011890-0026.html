			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: JELLIES, SPREADS AND JAMS CAUSE CONFUSION  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I don't understand the differences between jam, jelly and fruit  spreads. Can you define them?  </P> <P>  -- BETTY, Minneapolis  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Jam is fruit that has been cooked and pureed into a soft and  thick consistency. It can also be made from vegetables -- zucchini chutney or  jam, for example.  </P> <P> Jelly is made from fruit juice or clear liquid and syrup or sugar. It is called  jelly because when cooked the mixture gels.  </P> <P> Fruit spreads are usually smooth and thick, and are made from fruit pulp and  spices.  </P> <P> Since all these different terms can be confusing, the most important thing is  to read the jar label carefully.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I am seriously watching my calories as I fight the ever-present  enemy, my bulging waistline.  </P> <P> One of the hardest tasks for me was dining out with friends or family. I had a  habit of splurging because I would follow their lead when ordering. To finally  get this situation under control I started ordering first, after explaining to  everyone why I needed to do so.  </P> <P> I've almost reached my goal now and I still enjoy dinners out.  </P> <P>  -- GLORIA, Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Often I need to take an entire label off of a jar for a refund or  a special offer and I can't get it off in one piece. It usually ends up in  pieces and in the trash. Do you know of an easy way to remove one?  </P> <P>  -- P. B., Lititz, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR P. B.: One of the easiest ways to remove a label is to moisten a couple of  paper towels or a cloth with hot water and wrap it around the label on the jar.  Leave it on for a few minutes and remove. The label should peel off. If not,  remoisten the cloth and try again.  </P> <P> When the label is damp, peel gently because it will tear quite easily.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a favorite recipe that calls for finely minced candied  fruits. The problem was the fruit was so sticky and difficult to cut.  </P> <P> I cut the fruit into small pieces and put them in the food processor to mince  and now I enjoy baking even more since my favorite dessert is so easy to make.  </P> <P>  -- JAMIE, San Antonio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I just know that my hint will save a lot of moms and dads the  trouble of baby-bottle nipples and caps getting ruined or lost in the  dishwasher. I put them in a small hosiery bag (made to wash hosiery in a  washing machine) and secure them by tying the bag to the top rack of my  dishwasher.  </P> <P>  -- DENISE, Fredericksburg, Va.  </P></p>

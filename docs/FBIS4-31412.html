			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Andrzej </F> Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of  Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] I have read in today's papers that  you participated in a National Defense Committee [KOK] meeting  and that this meeting, devoted to the subordination of the chief  of the General Staff, was very tense.    [Oleksy] This was one of the topics discussed, and it  concerned the specific decision examined by the Council of  Ministers, which, at the president's request, was sent back to  KOK for reexamination. But this is one element of the whole  package of principles related to the defense policies of the  state and its security. This is one big document that was also  examined by the Council of Ministers, and it will be discussed  by the Sejm as well.    [Woyciechowski] What does it mean that KOK's meeting was  tense? What happened there that was so tense?    [Oleksy] I did not have that kind of impression. These were  merely media reports. However, there were indeed different  opinions, and not only about the issue of subordination in the  Armed Forces, which was central to the meeting.    [Woyciechowski] Is this about who should nominate the  supreme chief--the president, the government, or the Sejm?    [Oleksy] No, because Article 35 of the Constitution  specifies  who has the power to nominate the chief of General Staff, his  deputies, and military district commanders. So there are no  ambiguities here, and there can never be any. At issue is to  what extent the civilian control over the Army--something that  is determined by the principles of Polish democracy and that of  other countries and is NATO's requirement for countries that  cooperate with it--so, to what extent this civilian control  should mean the degree of direct leadership executed by the  defense minister over the Army.    [Woyciechowski] By the civilian minister?    [Oleksy] Yes, the civilian minister, because this is  precisely what is at issue. Until now, the chief of General  Staff has been answerable to the defense minister. So it is the  leadership of the president over the Armed Forces that is  executed through the defense minister.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, the civilian tells a general  which way to shoot, and the general shoots?    [Oleksy] I do not think this was the problem. The minister  is a supervisor of the whole thing. He does not interfere, I  believe, with specific matters related to the everyday operation  of the military but ensures conditions for its functioning,  combat readiness, equipment, etc.    [Woyciechowski] Is it true that this is where opinions of  the  defense minister, who is a general, and the president differ?    [Oleksy] I see this in a broader perspective. I had the  impression that the president sought direct control over the  General Staff, whose chief, his deputies, and military district  commanders are appointed by the president himself. However, the  deputies and military district commanders are appointed at the  request of the defense minister. So I think he wants that done  by the chief of General Staff.    [Woyciechowski] Let us now talk about another  Belweder-controlled minister, the interior affairs minister. Do  you think the draft laws on police will be passed?    [Oleksy] They will definitely be heatedly and  controversially  debated. These are new solutions, new in Polish law. The key  witness and controlled purchases are well established parts of  Western law and an unpracticed novelty in our country--hence, so  many fears about the way they will be executed, if passed. I  suspect this will trigger a lot of controversy in the Sejm  because the commission for administration and interior affairs  has already frequently discussed that. One should remember that  those projects were already proposed and then withdrawn. So,  this is their second attempt. On the other hand, the Interior  Affairs Ministry rightly demands resolute decisions to counter  the surge in crime, unlawfulness, and arrogance of the  underworld. I agree with its arguments. Law must be toughened  so that citizens feel more secure. They do not feel safe even on  the streets. The reason may be that the police are very often  powerless and restrained by the current statute. As a matter of  fact, they sometimes find themselves in a worse situation than  the criminal.    [Woyciechowski] Actually, a lot of interesting things will  be  happening in the Sejm now. For example, the concordat. Will it  pass, do you think?    [Oleksy] Everyone is thinking about it, calculating votes,  making up proportions, analyzing political declarations by  various groups. After all, the dispute concerns both politics  and the substance. This concordat is expected to be examined  before the break.    [Woyciechowski] Which is in June or July?    [Oleksy] Which is 1 July, when the Sejm's last meeting will  be held.    [Woyciechowski] So everything will be resolved by that time?    [Oleksy] I do not know because this will depend on how the  motions are worded. The Sejm's Presidium intends to bring up  the concordat in its first reading. Next, there will surely be  a different proposal--to reject the document in its current  reading or to submit it to legislative commissions. I even know  that there will be proposals demanding the concordat's second  reading without even submitting it to the commissions. There  will be a large number of different proposals, and it is going  to be a tough debate--also in procedural terms.    [Woyciechowski] Now, what about abortion? Is the issue of  abortion going to come back to the Sejm before the elections, as  part, as it were, of the election campaign?    [Oleksy] I think this is no longer possible. The first  reading has already taken place; the second reading was even  accompanied by a certain procedural conflict. Let me recall  that this was not finally accepted; now we would need the report  of the committee to hold the third reading and the voting. As  it is known, a number of persons, as well as certain groups are  demanding an even more detailed substantive analysis by  specialists. Thus, I do not expect that abortion will be  discussed before the elections.    [Woyciechowski] What will happen if the Sejm decreases the  severity of this law? If the president does not sign it, the  law will return to the Sejm. From your high place in the Sejm,  you can easily see how the deputies vote. Will the Sejm manage  to force this law with the majority of the votes?    [Oleksy] I think that is possible. Right now this issue is  slightly controversial; some people perceived it as an element  of the election campaign. After the entire procedure, when it  can be assumed that the president will not sign this law, I  expect that it is possible to achieve two-thirds of the votes to  override the president's veto.    [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the National Council of  Radio and Television [KRRiT] in the Sejm? Will it manage to  pass through the Sejm successfully?    [Oleksy] The committee has already worked on the report; it  issued a positive opinion on this report. Discussions are  already under way on whether the report should be accepted,  whether to take some measures to change the KRRiT. My personal  view--not the official view of the Sejm speaker--is that any  attempt to overthrow this council must be approached very  cautiously. After all, it is not a new establishment in the  Polish democracy. Despite all of the remarks that can be made  about it, it is an establishment that has accomplished  something; it has introduced some new order. This was  accompanied by some conflicts, which, however, did not appear in  all of the issues. I also think that the discussion in my club,  the club of the Democratic Left Alliance, as well as in the  other clubs will be quite animated. Criticism is justified in  this case; however, there is the question of whether this  criticism justifies such a dramatic step as overthrowing the  council.    [Woyciechowski] Yesterday the Sejm Committee actually  praised KRRiT, but it kept criticizing Walendziak...    [Oleksy, interrupting] I can see some inconsistency here...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you watch television and do  you not like television?    [Oleksy] I have my own complaints here as well, as it were.  However, I do not have the right to voice them in public; we  have often discussed this. What I want is a more systematic  approach and a certain balance in the activities of the public  media. However, I do not think that the entire issue can be  handled this way--that is, one cannot say that the KRRiT is  marvelous, but its decisions and its results are bad. This is  false. They must be looked upon as one. This direction, I  think... [Oleksy pauses] It will go in the direction of  criticism of the KRRiT, without any firmness in deciding its  fate. There will probably be certain suggestions of changes in  the functioning of the mass media.    [Woyciechowski] What was it like in China? Is it true that  Chinese women are very pretty but have small breasts?    [Oleksy] They have breasts of different sizes. Most of  them are average in size. However, there are also very tall  Chinese women. Most people in Poland think that they are all  slanted-eyed midgets. That is not true. In the fashion show in  Shanghai, there were very tall Chinese girls from the north of  the country, whom Europe can only envy. Now, China from the  point of the visit.... [Oleksy pauses] There was a certain  unpleasant event concerning this visit, which had to do with  Radio Zet. However, I want to consider it a closed case. Now,  China is a country that is incredibly friendly to Poland and  mainly to Poland as a country in Central Europe. It will soon  become the greatest market in the world. It is a country  characterized by enormous investment dynamics, by an enormous  growth rate, which has been going on for many years. It is a  country that is modernizing, ensuring the basic standard of  living for 1.2 billion people....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, does it want to trade  with us?    [Oleksy] And it wants to trade with us. It wants to do this  quite frankly. In line with the protocol, my talks with the  president of the state were supposed to take no more than a  half-hour; in fact, they finished after an hour and a half. It  was not a courtesy. What it really was was the expression of  real cordiality and goodwill. I interpret this visit as a good  declaration of the Chinese party. We formulated our declaration  as well. I believe that this must be developed. There are such  possibilities. We were accompanied by businessmen, entrepreneurs  of large companies. They made good contacts already during the  visit. Three new joint-venture companies were set up during the  visit. As I was told there in China, it is a market where  everything can be sold. The only requirement is that you must  want to do it and know how to do it. I think that we should  follow the example of the powers of the world, which want to be  there on that market at any cost. They realize the advantages  that can be gained in trade and investment cooperation with this  country. It would not be very responsible of us if Poland, for  one reason or another, which may be quite important but  certainly incomparable to the possible strategic advantages,  were to miss the opportunities that are offered by contacts with  China--a country that is friendly to Poland.    [Woyciechowski] The presidential election. What will it look  like, Mr. Sejm Speaker?    [Oleksy] I think my view of it is similar to the views of  most people in Poland: All of the statements, especially sharp  statements, and firm announcements are premature. I think there  is still a lot of time and still....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the election really  be held? Everyone keeps talking about it, but no one knows....    [Oleksy, interrupting] It will be held in October 1995.  Thus, it is still too early. We still must work on the  constitution, which should absolutely be adopted before the  election, so that the election can be held on a new  constitutional base, so that there is a clear separation of  powers....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The constitution has been  discussed for four years now and we still do not have it.    [Oleksy] I will do everything to speed up the work and to  adopt the constitution in the spring referendum in 1995.    [Woyciechowski] The spring referendum in 1995--that is, in  one year's time. Thank you, Mr. Sejm Speaker, for the interview.    [Oleksy] Thank you.</p>

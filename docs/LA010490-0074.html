			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: BURNT OUT ON AEROBICS 'BURN' PHILOSOPHY  </P> <P> OK, left foot forward. Energy! Come on, you can do it! Bring it back, four  counts. If you're getting breathless, slow down. Now step-touch for eight!  Almost done! Good. Let's march it out!  </P> <P> Going for the burn may have gone out of style with Cabbage Patch Kids and video  Ping-Pong, but if you think you can skip aerobics class now that the '80s are  history, think again. Looks like plenty of us are going to be pulling on those  leotards and leg warmers well into the next century.  </P> <P> Of course, '90s aerobics may be barely recognizable compared to those hardy  pioneers who huffed and puffed a decade ago, say Richard and Susan Foley,  husband-and-wife aerobics instructors (yes, they met on the aerobics floor) who  live in El Toro. Founders of the Professional Fitness Instructors Assn. of  Orange County, the Foleys signed up for their first aerobics classes back in  the early '80s, when the field was in its formative stages.  </P> <P> "Back then there was just one kind of class, just plain aerobics," says Susan,  aerobics coordinator at the El Toro Physical Fitness Center. "Now you can  choose from low-impact and high-impact, low-impact with weights, circuit  training, body sculpting, pregnancy classes, classes for seniors -- there's a  lot of variety." And each type of class has benefited from continuing research  on the most efficient and safest ways to burn fat.  </P> <P> "We've learned so much over the years," says Richard, a full-time structural  engineer who also teaches three classes a week at Nautilus Plus Aerobics in  Irvine. "In the early days, everybody did their own thing. There was no central  focus. And a lot of what we were doing then was just plain wrong."  </P> <P> Early aerobics instructors knew that the idea was to help participants increase  their heart rates and keep them up for 20 minutes or more in order to burn body  fat aerobically -- meaning "with oxygen." But many of them didn't understand  that the actual burning sensation satirized in Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury comic  strip back in 1982 ("Yes, but it's a good burn") meant just the opposite. That  burning feeling, aerobics instructors now know, came from a buildup of lactic  acid in muscles deprived of oxygen because they were being worked too hard and  too fast. And without oxygen, fat doesn't burn.  </P> <P> In other words, "aerobics used to be anaerobic," Richard says.  </P> <P> "Back then, it was like, the harder, the better," he says. Except for the fact  that most participants were women, "it seemed a lot like football practice," he  says.  </P> <P> "We really believed that stuff about no pain, no gain," adds Susan.  </P> <P> For some students, the pain involved was far more than a burn. Some exercises,  such as one called the plow, which involves supporting most of the body's  weight with the neck and shoulders, were likely to cause injuries.  </P> <P> Now, however, most aerobics workouts are much less punishing and, at the same  time, more effective, the Foleys say.  </P> <P> The changes have left some participants confused.  </P> <P> "When you sign up for aerobics class, you can't be sure what kind of workout  you'll get unless you know what to look for," Richard says.  </P> <P> And because there is no standardized training or continuing education for  instructors, a class leader may or may not be up on the latest research.  </P> <P> The Foleys founded the nonprofit PFIA a year ago to address both those  problems. Now with more than 100 members, the organization promotes public  awareness about aerobics and serves as a forum for aerobics instructors. At a  typical meeting, members may hear the latest medical information from a  cardiologist or trade tips on choreography and music. The group also publishes  a monthly newsletter and in February will hold its first awards banquet to  honor outstanding instructors, coordinators and fitness facilities in the  county.  </P> <P> "When we started teaching, the only requirements for an aerobics instructor  were to look good in a leotard and have your own music," Susan says.  Eventually, the Foleys say they would like to see some sort of minimum  credentials required for all aerobics instructors.  </P> <P> Music, by the way, has also changed dramatically over the years in aerobics.  "It used to be, you'd just put on a record," Susan says.  </P> <P> And when the record ended, Richard recalls, "we would just go down on the floor  while the instructor found another record and put it on. We didn't know it  wasn't good to just stop suddenly."  </P> <P> Now, however, informed instructors carefully select music with a steady beat,  starting off slow for warm-ups, faster -- but not too fast -- for the aerobic  part of the workout and then even slower for the cool-down at the end.  </P> <P> "You don't want to have any speed bumps, and you want the moves to stay with  the phasing of the music, so people can anticipate when the next change is  coming," Susan says.  </P> <P> If you're considering enrolling in aerobics, don't choose a class solely on the  basis of schedule, location or even price.  </P> <P> "The most expensive classes aren't necessarily the best," Richard says. "Most  places will let you take a class first without signing up, and if you do that  with several, you'll have a basis for comparison."  </P> <P> And if you enjoy aerobics but don't like a particular class, don't give up.  </P> <P> "People can get frustrated," Susan says. "You get a bad instructor, and you  think there's something wrong with you. We don't want people to get turned off  to aerobics because they may have (had) a bad experience."  </P> <P> Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATORS URGE NICARAGUA ARMS TURN-IN;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: DODD AND GRAMM AGREE THAT SURRENDER OF WEAPONS BY BOTH SIDES  WILL PRESERVE THE PEACE -- AND PREVENT THE SALVADORAN CIVIL WAR FROM FLARING  UP.  </P> <P> Two U.S. senators called on Nicaragua's Sandinista army and the Contra rebels  Saturday to turn in their weapons to help preserve the peace in their own  country and to prevent their arsenals from fueling the civil war in El  Salvador.  </P> <P> Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) agreed in a broadcast  interview that a rapid arms cleanup is necessary to safeguard the new civilian  government of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset President  Daniel Ortega at the polls last week.  </P> <P> Former Contra leader Adolfo Calero and Assistant Secretary of State for Latin  America Bernard Aronson, appearing on the same program as Dodd and Gramm,  emphasized the need for government guarantees to ensure the peaceful  integration of about 10,000 former guerrillas into Nicaraguan society.  </P> <P> Dodd, chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on hemisphere  affairs, and Gramm, a leading conservative, said that unless weapons in Central  America's most heavily armed nation are carefully accounted for, they may find  their way to El Salvador.  </P> <P> "Programs that have both the military and Contras turn in their weapons are  very important," Gramm said on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker Saturday"  program.  </P> <P> In the past, Salvadoran anti-government guerrillas have received major support  from the Sandinistas. There have also been unconfirmed reports that despite  their ideological differences, the U.S.-supplied Contras have sold weapons to  the Salvadoran rebels.  </P> <P> Although Contra leaders have refused to order their troops to turn in their  weapons before the 70,000 soldiers of the Sandinista-controlled army are  disarmed, Chamorro and President Bush have urged them to do so. Bush, in fact,  differed publicly with former President Ronald Reagan over the issue during a  meeting between the two in Los Angeles on Friday.  </P> <P> Harry Shlaudeman, a retired U.S. ambassador to Brazil who now serves as a  special State Department representative on Central American affairs, was in  Tegucigalpa, Honduras, this weekend seeking to persuade Contra leaders to leave  their Honduran camps.  </P> <P> At one time, Reagan Administration officials had proposed offering U.S. refugee  status to Contras. Dodd, however, discounted that possibility.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's going to be much appetite to come up with green cards,"  he said. "They've got to (go) back home."  </P> <P> While both Dodd and Gramm warned of fiscal limitations on U.S. economic aid for  Nicaragua, Aronson said the Administration wants to "move very quickly" on a  support package similar to the assistance offered to Panama after the U.S.  invasion.  </P> <P> "There are some immediate steps we're looking at," he said, citing removal of  the trade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration as one example.  </P> <P> Aronson said he will meet Monday with Francisco Mayorga, Chamorro's chief  economic adviser. On Friday, Mayorga said in Managua that the new government  will ask for at least $300 million in U.S. aid.  </P> <P> But Gramm warned that Washington cannot foot the entire bill.  </P> <P> "It's clear that we can't rebuild Nicaragua with American aid," declared the  co-author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. "I'd be willing  to offer Nicaragua a free-trade agreement."  </P> <P> One possible source of aid to Nicaragua was identified in a General Accounting  Office report released Saturday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). The report  said $685 million in aid to El Salvador has not been delivered, making it  potentially available for other uses.  </P></p>

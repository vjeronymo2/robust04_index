He said during the legal proceedings in Moscow on Tuesday  that his guilt was that he had failed to prevent the collapse of  the USSR as a Soviet citizen and a communist.    According to Shenin, the real coup d'etat started not on  August 19, 1991, but on April 24, 1991, with the signing of the  draft treaty on establishment of a union (the Novoogarev  agreement "9+1") and finished on December 8, 1991, with the  agreement on establishment of the CIS. According to the  accused, "this has broken the balance of forces and has been  inevitably leading to the third world war, which is now at hand."    The issue on renewal of the case against Oleg Baklanov  deferred due to his illness was also raised during the  proceedings. However, this issue's consideration was postponed.</p>

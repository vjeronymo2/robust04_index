			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The rush to cash in on savings fears - City Watch No industry is following the fortunes of the two main parties more closely than the savings industry, which directly feeds off tax, pension schemes and other highly politicised legislation. Many investment companies are eagerly cashing in on the rush to buy personal equity plans, with investors calculating that tax breaks which are only marginal in value under the Conservatives would become worth a great deal more under Labour's anti-middle-class tax regime. Save &amp; Prosper hopes to hit Pep sales of Pounds 150m in the financial year now drawing to a close, against Pounds 85m last time. Total industry Pep sales may well be Pounds 2bn or more, against Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91, and if Labour wins there will be a torrent of money into 1992-93 Peps before a Budget can be produced which might end them. Labour has proposed to modify Peps, rather than abolish them. They might be made smaller, but broadened away from their all-equity basis. Mr Julian Tregoning, marketing chief at Save &amp; Prosper, says: 'We would like to give some input to the debate on Peps.' The product area causing most concern to life assurance companies is personal pensions. Labour has promised to cancel the 2 per cent 'bribe' being paid for the next two years to individuals opting out of the state scheme, Serps, and threatens to require personal-pension providers to give a pension guarantee related to growth of average earnings. Mr John Craddock, head of life and pensions at Legal &amp; General, says that the ending of the 2 per cent incentive would be 'very unfair'. L&amp;G fears that as many as 1.5m of the estimated 5m personal planholders might return to Serps. As for the guarantee, Mr Ron Spill of L&amp;G says: 'We cannot accept an open-ended liability related to average earnings.' The very survival of personal pensions might, therefore, depend on some sort of compromise. However, a Labour administration might bring opportunities as well as hazards. At Invesco MIM, Mr Keith Crowley, marketing director, is ready to change direction.' You should have started the planning process three to six months ago,' he says. 'Flexibility is next to godliness.' He sees tax angles becoming more important. Labour's preoccupation with promoting manufacturing investment might provide opportunities, and at the very least there will be scope for some 'buy before the tax deadline' promotions. Meanwhile, life assurance experts argue that tax changes might favour life company 10-year savings plans and lump-sum products, which at present bear both income tax and capital gains tax at the standard rate. This might look more attractive if many more people are paying income tax at up to 50 per cent, and the capital gains tax exemption limit is sharply reduced from the Tory level of Pounds 5,800 for 1992-93. More pessimistic people in the savings business fear that higher taxes and a crumbling house market could cause severe damage. The middle classes struggling to pay mortgages and school fees would have nothing left for savings. The more sanguine argue that higher taxes will generate more opportunities for those savings institutions that come up with the right products. But the tax breaks on mortgages, pensions and life assurance which protected the middle classes in the 1970s have been reduced or eliminated. Most top people in the savings industry will not look forward to testing their powers of ingenuity under Labour.</p>

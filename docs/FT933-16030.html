			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Observer: First and last Too old at 65? One of the unfortunate casualties of the break-up of ICI is the group's house magazine, The Roundel, whose circulation is just under 100,000. ICI was barely two years old when Sir Alfred Mond, ICI's first chairman, sent word that he wanted his employees to have a magazine that would make them all feel they were a 'band of brothers'. It started with the good wishes of King George VI, then the Duke of York, lasted nearly 70 years and, unusually for a house mag, had a mind of its own which is evident in its farewell issue. It was much admired by other in-house publications. In its hey-day it carried 132 pages, and spawned another 80 ICI periodicals. Perhaps its downfall began when it was relaunched and readers were no longer required to pay towards the 70p cost of each copy. Whatever the reason, the magazine is no longer 'appropriate for the needs of the new look ICI'. Something else is planned which will communicate more directly with the workforce, says ICI. Easy to chop - hard to build. Maybe a sign of the times?</p>

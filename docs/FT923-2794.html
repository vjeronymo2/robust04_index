			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / House contents raise Pounds 660,000: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S yesterday realised Pounds 660,330 from the first morning session of a two-day sale of furniture and effects from Groombridge Place in Kent, which was sold in May. Under the hammer are oak furniture, walnut cabinets, and early textiles from the house, used as the setting for Peter Greenaway's film The Draughtsman's Contract. Also for auction is Oriental porcelain and silver amassed during Groombridge's refurbishment by the Mountain family early this century Among items on offer yesterday was a fine group of 17th-century Packer family portraits, now said to be on the shopping list of a distant descendant, Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian entrepreneur. The most appealing of the portraits - of the four daughters of Philip Packer, a founder member of The Royal Society and Groombridge's builder  - by a follower of John Michael Wright realised Pounds 13,200. There was predominantly private bidding and prices frequently made the top estimate. A private buyer paid Pounds 33,000 for a pair of oyster-veneered walnut side tables with cabriole legs, dated around 1745.</p>

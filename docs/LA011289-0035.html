			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO SETS SPECIAL ELECTION ON NEW TAXES  </P> <P> El Segundo City Council members, uncertain whether a recent court decision lets  them impose new taxes without a citywide vote, have decided to hold a special  election on two tax measures.  </P> <P> After meeting in special session Tuesday night, council members let stand their  earlier decision to schedule the March 7 election.  </P> <P> The measures would increase taxes for businesses and property owners and raise  an estimated $6 million for the financially strapped city.  </P> <P> Council members held the special session to reconsider the issue mainly because  canceling the election would have saved the city an estimated $20,000,  according to Councilman Scot Dannen. However, if it had been canceled, the  council majority -- made up of Dannen, Mayor Carl Jacobson and Councilman Jim  Clutter -- could have enacted whatever revenue measures they preferred, and  they have opposed higher taxes on residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Reluctant Compromise  </P> <P> The council's November decision to put the two measures on the ballot, which  under state law requires four votes, was a compromise with which no council  member was happy.  </P> <P> The council majority reluctantly agreed to put the measure affecting property  owners, including residents, on the ballot only after Councilmen Alan West and  Bob Anderson insisted on it. West and Anderson have generally opposed imposing  any new taxes on businesses unless new taxes are also imposed on residents.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council decided to proceed with the election after it was  confronted with conflicting legal interpretations of a decision handed down by  the Court of Appeal in Santa Ana last September.  </P> <P> The appeals court, in an opinion written by Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr.,  invalidated Proposition 62, the initiative sponsored by Howard Jarvis in 1986  that required voter approval for all taxes imposed by cities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confusion Over Approval  </P> <P> The court's ruling held that the city of Westminster had the authority to  impose a utility users' tax without voter approval.  </P> <P> El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley interpreted the higher court's ruling to  mean that the El Segundo council could impose new taxes without a citywide  vote.  </P> <P> But the attorney for the city clerk's office, Stephanie Sher, interpreted the  ruling to apply only to cities that imposed taxes before the passage of the  proposition.  </P> <P> The Westminster City Council enacted that community's utility user's tax in  September, 1986, less than two months before California voters approved  Proposition 62.  </P> <P> Even though El Segundo will hold an election, Councilman West called it a waste  of taxpayers' money because the council has yet to reach final agreement on an  overall fiscal strategy for the city.  </P> <P> "We don't have our act together," he said. ". . . I think it is time to step  back and look at our needs and itemize them in great detail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Right to Decide  </P> <P> But Dannen said the election should tell council members how voters want the  city's money problems to be solved. And regardless of the confusion over the  recent court decision, he said, the electorate should have the right to decide  tax issues.  </P> <P> "If the voters do not have the right to vote on these taxes, they should,"  Dannen said.  </P> <P> One of the measures on the ballot would impose a $60-per-unit tax on  residential property. Owners of non-residential property of less than 5,000  square feet would pay a flat rate of $200 a year. Larger businesses would be  taxed according to floor space.  </P> <P> The other measure would boost the utility user tax, which applies only to  businesses, to 4% and make it permanent. The current 2% utility tax is due to  expire in 1991.  </P> <P> The measures will require a simple majority to pass.  </P></p>

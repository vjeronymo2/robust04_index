			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Fall in company failures continues THE NUMBER of companies entering receivership or administration continued to decline last month, according to the trend in figures from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes analysed by accountants Touche Ross. The October figure of 240, although up from a one-off low of 184 in September, reflected a continuing fall in the number of company failures during the past six months. It brought the number of receiverships and administration orders to 2,808 for the first 10 months of the year, against 4,282 for the same period last year and 4,898 in 1991. Touche Ross said the average size of businesses to which receivers are now being appointed has fallen from earlier in the recession. The proportion of appointments taken by the largest six accountancy firms declined to 45 per cent this year from 50 per cent during 1992.</p>

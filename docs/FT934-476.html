			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Shopping trips Stock market jitters about Christmas sales are as traditional as family rows in front of the television. In 11 of the past 13 years, the UK stores sector has underperformed the market in December. This year's worries have been given added edge by the ominous trading wobbles in the textiles sector. The new-found reluctance of retailers to seep news into the market through tipsy indiscretions at stockbrokers' parties has left investors in the dark. At almost 25 times historic earnings, the stores sector is more highly rated in absolute terms than at any time since the early 1970s. With valuations stretched so tight it is little wonder that the sector slipped at the beginning of the month. Some shareholders clearly feared it was not just turkeys that would be roasted this Christmas. Yet it is a retailing truism that Christmas comes later every year. The Budget may have confused the pattern but sales do appear to have accelerated over the past weeks. The best guess is that it has been a steady, if unspectacular, trading period. The latest John Lewis Partnership figures are certainly showing solid sales gains. The outlook for stores next year is finely balanced. Tax rises will depress consumer spending, although the current savings ratio of 10.6 per cent highlights potential spending power. Investors may also keep faith in a sector that promises earnings growth in line with the market but with no exposure to mainland Europe. The added bonus could come from the consumer cycle being brought back into line with the political one. As the next election looms, twitchy Tory MPs will be pressing for a more consumer-friendly stance.</p>

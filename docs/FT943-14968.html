			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Eli Lilly pays Dollars 4bn for distributor Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, is to pay Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for PCS, a drugs distributor, in the third big acquisition of its kind in the US in less than a year. PCS, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based McKesson, claims to sell drugs to 50m Americans under various healthcare programmes, with drugs sales last year of Dollars 6.4bn, making it the biggest company of its type. The planned deal is the latest sign of the rush by drugs companies to secure distribution for their products in the US, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals market. Faced with pressure to hold down prices, manufacturers have sought to build market share by buying distribution companies or by gaining preferential treatment for their drugs. If completed, the deal will leave three of the biggest US distributors under the control of pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Last year, Merck paid Dollars 6.7bn for Medco Containment Services, while SmithKline Beecham recently agreed to acquire Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn. McKesson had discussed a sale of its retail distribution arm to other manufacturers, but did not hold a formal auction of the company, PCS said. Following other links between distributors and manufacturers, it was the only big retail distributor left on the market. In London, shares in Glaxo, which had been rumoured to be interested in PCS, fell 8p to 563p. The main reason, said analysts, was that a substantial proportion of US patients would now be more difficult for Glaxo to reach, particularly with its top-selling anti-ulcer drug Zantac. Merck, SmithKline Beecham and now Eli Lilly would each push their respective anti-ulcer products, Pepcid, Tagamet and Axid, through their newly acquired prescription management benefit companies, explained Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at Morgan Stanley. These subsidiaries claim to have nearly 50m people covered by their formularies. 'This is a material tightening of the screws for Glaxo,' he said. PCS claimed that it would continue to make available the most beneficial and cost-effective drugs to its customers after the deal, regardless of who manufactured them. 'The deal was not done for us to market Lilly's drugs over other companies.' The structure of the deal still leaves McKesson open to higher offers for PCS. Lilly has launched a tender offer for McKesson's shares. It said it would spin off all of McKesson's businesses other than PCS into a new company, shares in which would be distributed to existing McKesson shareholders. 'It does open the door to other offers,' PCS said yesterday. News of the deal drove McKesson shares up by a third yesterday morning, to Dollars 98 1/8 . By contrast, Eli Lilly's shares slid 12 per cent to Dollars 50 1/4 on fears that it was paying too much for the acquisition. The all-cash purchase would be financed with short and medium-term debt, Eli Lilly said. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said it would review the company's debt for a possible downgrade.

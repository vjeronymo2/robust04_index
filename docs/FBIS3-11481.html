The incidents began when some 500 students -- who were  demonstrating against the government's recent economic measures  and against the constitutional reform in the area of the  ministry buildings -- arrived at the Finance Ministry building.    Instigated by leaders of the National Union of Students  (UNE), a group of demonstrators attempted to invade the building  of the ministry, which had promoted the economic measures  lifting restrictions on the installments paid to private schools  and universities.    For approximately 30 minutes the demonstrators confronted  200  military policemen who were guarding the building. A number of  windows were broken by the stones thrown by the students.    Two policemen and 12 students suffered injuries of a minor  nature, although 8 of the demonstrators did need to be seen at a  Brasilia area hospital.</p>

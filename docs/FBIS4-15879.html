			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, the prime-minister, the Defence  Ministry and both houses of the Federal Assembly are very  alarmed by the position of the Russian Armed Forces as a result  of the current economic situation. The statement was made by  the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin during his Monday  visit to the Chief Staff of the Strategic Missile Force. He was  accompanied by the Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin.    Addressing the personnel of the staff Rybkin stressed that  the repetition of the 1959 situation should not be permitted.  Then 1,200,000 military men were actually thrown out into the  street as a result of cuts in the armed forces. The speaker said  he agreed with the former American president Richard Nixon who  told the press after a recent visit to Russia that the world is  complicated and no one wants any "last breaks to the south"  anymore.    Rybkin said that in questions related to the army one should  be careful with harsh, radical expressions. In his opinion if a  pattern of change is chosen, it should not be revolutionary but  gradual.    Rybkin said that reforms are irreversible but spoke for  tighter measures against those whose "grabbing instincts are  extraordinarily developed, who take enormous credit for making  giant profits." Rybkin stressed that if the president,  government, parliament and other political forces act resolutely  and revenue will grow irrespective of the way in which the State  Duma approves the budget - in parts or for the whole year at  once.</p>

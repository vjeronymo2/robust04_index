			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL LOCKOUT STRIKES OUT ON TALK RADIO;  </P> <P> LABOR: THE SHOWS ARE DELUGED WITH CALLS BUT INTEREST WANES WITH TOO MUCH  DISCUSSION OF ONE SUBJECT.  </P> <P> In place of the "what do you think of the Dodgers/Angels" questions about the  teams and their athletes, the Southland's radio sports talk shows have been  dominated for several weeks by discussions of Major League Baseball's spring  training lockout.  </P> <P> Paul Olden of KMPC-AM (710) estimates that in recent days 70% of the calls to  his sports show have dealt with the lockout. Larry King, who hosts a  general-interest talk show on Mutual Radio, said that about 20% of his calls  lately have concerned the labor dispute -- twice as many as he usually gets on  sports topics.  </P> <P> Too many calls on one subject can lead to bad radio, King says.  </P> <P> "Good talk radio is different avenues of thought," said King, whose show is  heard locally on KFI-AM (640). "If you have too much of the same, listeners  think, 'Here we go again.' When callers are ill-informed and you get the same  pap, it loses me as a listener."  </P> <P> Olden agrees. If a settlement is not reached soon, he plans to broaden his show  so that it is not monopolized by lockout-related calls.  </P> <P> "I'm going to be calling some managers and players to preview the coming  season, and despite what anybody thinks, there will be a season," Olden said.  "I've also been recommending the listeners read certain baseball magazines so  they can read about baseball and not labor disputes."  </P> <P> Hosts and callers more familiar with wins and losses have had problems  discussing the complexities of labor negotiations.  </P> <P> The most common faux pas is terming the current situation a strike. It is a  lockout by the owners; Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players  Assn., has asked for the camps to be opened. Another misstatement frequently  heard is that the dispute is over player salaries. In fact, it is over a  collective bargaining agreement. Other calls complain that baseball players  have no right to a union. The Wagner Act passed by Congress in 1935 guarantees  all workers the right to union representation.  </P> <P> Opinions vary on whether the responsibility for these errors lies with the  hosts or the callers.  </P> <P> King puts the blame on the person at the mike.  </P> <P> "If the host is uninformed, the caller reflects the host," said King, who also  hosts a call-in show on Cable News Network. "This is the kind of subject you  have to know about. It's more than just millionaires having a fight. There is a  long history of mistrust of the owners. Too many hosts are taking stands  without knowledge of baseball."  </P> <P> Olden cites fans' emotions as the reason behind their misstatements.  </P> <P> "I still get a lot of calls saying they want to talk about the 'strike,' "  Olden said. "I take great pains trying to explain the definition of what's  going on, but at this point a lot of the audience isn't in the mood for  rational explanations. What's said goes in one ear and out the other."  </P> <P> King said he senses frustration among his callers.  </P> <P> "People are missing the game," he said. "Baseball is the fabric of American  sport. When your fabric gets taken away, it's sort of that comfort zone that  isn't there. It's certainly not the end of world, but there is a part missing."  </P> <P> Past surveys have indicated that unionization and work stoppages by  professional athletes have been met with hostility by fans, even union members,  who have backed the owners in disputes.  </P> <P> "The audience still equates their salaries and benefits to the players'," Olden  said. "That is the totally wrong thing to do because sports is so separate from  reality that it is not a fair comparison. Fans are just angry because they want  their entertainment and don't want to hear about labor problems from people  making $3 million a year."  </P> <P> Ed Bieler of KABC-AM (790), better known as "Superfan," believes fans'  traditional feelings are a result of media coverage.  </P> <P> "The owners have the press boxes, free food and outlets who cover them and  (thus they) are able to get the story out," Bieler said. "The athletes have a  difficult time getting their story out."  </P> <P> KFI's Joe McDonnell, who has covered Major League Baseball as a radio network  sports reporter for a decade, has relied on his extensive ties to players for  guests on his show, including Mike Scioscia, Matt Young and Tim Leary. He said  that he has also invited Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Executive Vice  President Fred Claire on the show to give their viewpoints, but both have  declined.  </P> <P> McDonnell said that his callers are essentially split between backing the  owners and players.  </P> <P> "Our callers understand both sides," McDonnell said. "What I've tried to do is  educate people and give them facts on what's going on. I may be slanted towards  the players because I think they're being wronged. I've been hammering that  this is a lockout, not a strike, and that the owners have done this to the  game."  </P> <P> McDonnell blames the owners for the current impasse.  </P> <P> "This is a situation they've been planning for years," McDonnell said. "They  have a strike fund between $100-$200 million. They were hoping from the start  that they'd break the union.  </P> <P> "It's almost a direct result of what's happened with the presidential  administrations since 1981. The country is in a very anti-union mood and the  owners are trying to perpetrate that."  </P></p>

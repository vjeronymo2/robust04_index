Just  the job for shield tunneling equipment.    However, there was a snag: the tunnel needed to curve, but  it  was passing under a crowded residential area where there was no  room to dig a vertical shaft to grab in and redirect the cutting  blades.    The answer, thought up by Taisei Corp. engineer Toshihiko  Bessho, was to redesign the shield machine so it could change  cutting direction on its own.    The world's first spherical shield tunneling machine is  already at work digging the rainwater pipeline in Kawasaki near  Tokyo. Taisei is the prime contractor and Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy Industries Co. helped in developing the new tunneling  machine.    The biggest advantage of this new shield machine is that it  can excavate in one direction and then turn 90 degrees to  excavate in a new direction. A sphere housing an auxiliary  shield is attached toward the front of the main shield. This  sphere pivots 90 degrees, at which point the auxiliary shield  can be separated from the main shield for further excavation  work.  <H5>  Globular Thinking </H5>   ``The construction of a shield that can turn 90 degrees has  long been a dream of civil engineers,'' says Bessho, manager of  the technology division in Taisei's Construction Technology  Development Department.    The idea came to Bessho one day while he was staring at a  golf ball. He suddenly realized that a pivoting sphere could be  used to freely change the course of excavation.    Bessho knew that pivoting the front shield would be  difficult. His answer was to house a second, smaller auxiliary  shield on the sphere, and to use this auxiliary shield for  excavation in the new direction. Of course, this results in a  tunnel that suddenly changes diameter, ending up larger at one  end than at the other. But while this would be a complication  when designing, say, an underground train line, it is not a  problem for water lines.    For the Kawasaki project, Taisei is using a tunneling  machine  with a front shield diameter of 5.5 meters, and an auxiliary  shield diameter of 3.6 meters.    Using conventional shield tunneling equipment, there are two  ways to excavate a curve. The usual solution is to gradually  turn the shield, drawing a large arc. But to accomplish this, it  is necessary to stabilize the ground, which significantly boosts  construction costs. An alternative method is to excavate a  vertical hole, lift the shield up with a crane and turn it 90  degrees. But vertical excavation is itself a major operation,  with its own attendant difficulties.    Taisei decided to use the spherical shield in the Kawasaki  project because the tunnel needed to be dug in a densely  populated residential area with narrow streets.    At &yen;600 million ($5.40 million), the spherical shield is  much more expensive than conventional shields. However, it  eliminates the need to stabilize the surrounding earth, which in  the case of the Kawasaki project would have cost several hundred  million yen.    Moreover, Taisei figured that continuous excavation with the  spherical shield would reduce construction time by as much as  six months. Taisei's calculations indicated that the project  would cost a total of &yen;1.8 billion using conventional  construction procedures, but only &yen;1.5 billion with the  spherical shield, for savings of 17%.    Development of this spherical shield opens up a new era in  tunnel construction. Taisei's goal is to develop a tunneling  machine that can turn freely and be used in deep underground  digging projects.</p>

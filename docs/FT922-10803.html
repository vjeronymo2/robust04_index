			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / PM says recovery under way STEADY and stable economic recovery is under way in Britain, which is poised on the brink of a new era of prosperity, Mr John Major, the prime minister, claimed yesterday. In his first keynote speech since the general election, a confident and optimistic Mr Major told the Institute of Directors that Britain was 'ready to move forward, just when some of our main rivals are running into difficulties'. Speaking to 2,500 company executives at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Mr Major claimed that Britain had decisively turned its back on high taxes, high inflation, trade union power and interventionist policies. People recognised that free enterprise  - not state intervention and socialism  - was the route to national health and prosperity. In a passage less strident than Mrs Margaret Thatcher's pledge to destroy socialism, her successor nevertheless said that the government intended to secure continuing prosperity by removing the 'pendulum of uncertainty' that hit business prospects before elections. The prime minister went out of his way to pay tribute to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who he claimed had done 'an outstanding job for Britain' during a difficult 18 months. The chancel-lor, he said, had never taken the easy road 'but always the right one' and had rarely won credit for doing so. Mr Major claimed that, in the light of the election result, he was more confident than ever that economic recovery, aided by the imminent introduction of tax cuts announced in the Budget, was under way. He said the outlook for unemployment was beginning to look more hopeful and the jobless figures could be expected to steady before falling back. 'As spring advances, so will confidence,' he added. Mr Major stressed that Britain needed a recovery that was sustainable, and the government was determined to pursue policies which minimised the risk of a recession occurring again. He added: 'As spring advances, so will confidence.' Mr Major identified his government's targets for the 1990s as 'stable prices, sustained industrial peace, free enterprise given the chance to compete and win, and lasting growth without the scourge of inflation'. The prime minister was applauded when he pledged early legislation to complete the government's reform of trade union laws and said he intended to 'hold at bay' the provisions of the EC social chapter which would add Pounds 5bn to the costs of British industry.

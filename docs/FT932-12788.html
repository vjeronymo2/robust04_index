			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party calls for curb on budget deficit TORY MPs yesterday joined Labour in urging further action to control the government's budget deficit, as a Commons committee published a report highly critical of last month's Budget. The most critical part of the report by the Treasury and Civil Service committee followed an ambush by opposition MPs which led to the inclusion of a call for chancellor Norman Lamont to be replaced by someone 'who can inspire more trust'. This was not backed by Tory committee members, who also voted against the report as a whole being adopted. But Conservative MPs made clear yesterday that they shared the committee's misgivings on a variety of other issues. Principal among these was the committee's concern that the measures announced in the March Budget would not be enough to meet the government's objective of bringing its budget towards balance over the economic cycle. If the government was to achieve such a balance, further action in the form of tax increases or cuts in public spending would be required, the report said. The report also expressed concern that a current account deficit of as much as 2 per cent of gross domestic product should exist 'at the trough of a very long and deep recession'. It drew a comparison with the 2.6 per cent surplus at the trough of the 1981 recession and concurred with the Bank of England that this deficit represented a 'fundamental weakness in the economy'. On mortgages and housing finance, the committee accused the government of embarking 'by stealth' on a policy of phasing out mortgage tax relief by limiting its range of coverage and the rate of relief. Mr Lamont should 'now make this policy explicit and explain the reasons behind it,' it said. While Labour hailed the report as 'a landmark', Mr John Watts, the committee's Tory chairman, admitted the manoeuvrings might affect the seriousness with which the government took its 'more reasoned criticism'.

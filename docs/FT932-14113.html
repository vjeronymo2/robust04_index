			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / China 'dumping N-waste in Tibet': Indian industrial and military facilities within missile range, says report A TIBETAN emigre organisation has accused China of dumping nuclear waste haphazardly on the Tibetan plateau, and establishing missile sites there aimed at India. The International Campaign for Tibet also claimed people living near a top-secret nuclear facility had developed cancers because of careless handling of radioactive material. Chinese officials had no immediate comment on the Tibetan claims. Last year China firmly denied a charge by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, that it was jettisoning radioactive waste in the Tibetan region. The ITC claimed that China had deployed nuclear missiles in at least three sites on the Tibetan plateau. It said that forced prison labour had been used to build the sites. 'China's positioning of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons on the Tibetan plateau has put many of India's major industrial and military facilities within striking distance of short-range missiles,' said the report entitled Nuclear Tibet. The report said the waste from a facility known as the 'Ninth Academy' in Qinghai province north-east of Tibet had been dumped in a 'roughshod and haphazard' manner. ITC also resurrected claims that China was planning to build a nuclear reactor near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Beijing rejects the claims. The US-based organisation, formed in 1988 to monitor human rights in Tibet, said its report was based on interviews with Chinese nuclear experts, government officials, and two ITC fact-finding missions. 'China's nuclear programme is only a fraction the size of those in the United States and the ex-Soviet Union. . . but in areas of nuclear proliferation, lack of worker safety and irresponsible waste disposal, China's record is as poor or even worse than those of other nuclear powers,' said the report. The Ninth Academy was used to design China's nuclear arsenal through the 1970s, and continues to be Beijing's primary nuclear arms research facility, the ITC report stated.</p>

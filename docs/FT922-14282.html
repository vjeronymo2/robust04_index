			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Kingspan shows decline to IPounds 2.6m Kingspan Group, an Irish based and USM-traded maker of steelwork for buildings and metal doors and windows, reported a decline in pre-tax profit from IPounds 3.6m to IPounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.44m), in 1991. The final dividend is 1.2p for a same-again total of 2.2p, although earnings per share declined from 11.7p to 7.5p. At the halfway mark the profit drop was 12 per cent, but directors said there was no reason to believe the UK market had bottomed out and warned that margins could be expected to remain under pressure.</p>

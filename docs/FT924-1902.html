			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Craxi named in Italian corruption probe MR BETTINO CRAXI, leader of Italy's Socialist party and a former prime minister, was yesterday informed that he was under investigation by Milan magistrates, making him the most prominent figure to be caught up in their widening net of corruption inquiries. The magistrates served notice on Mr Craxi that he was being investigated for alleged corruption and illegal financing of the Socialist party. Mr Craxi issued a statement declaring his innocence and saying the move was designed to discredit him and his party. It is the first time in Italy's post-war history that the leader of a main political party has been so directly linked to charges of alleged corruption. Mr Craxi has been Socialist leader for 16 years and was prime minister from 1983 until 1987. Mr Craxi made it clear he would not step down voluntarily as leader of the Socialist party, already weakened by poor election results and the corruption scandal. In recent weeks there have been rumours that Milan magistrates, who since February have arrested and charged more than 70 local and national politicians with alleged corruption, were about to turn their attentions to Mr Craxi. They were reportedly waiting until after last weekend's elections in 55 municipalities throughout Italy. Milan is the centre of Mr Craxi's power base and Mr Paolo Pillitieri, his brother-in-law, former mayor of the city and Socialist MP, has already been charged with alleged corruption. The magistrates' move is a big blow to a party which saw its vote cut to 5 per cent in the pivotal northern industrial cities of Monza and Varese at the weekend. On Friday, parliament agreed to waive the immunity of Mr Gianni de Michelis, the party's deputy leader and former foreign minister, so that Venice magistrates could investigate alleged corruption charges against him. Mr Craxi's statement said: 'I believe this initiative by the prosecutor's office in Milan is wholly without foundation and is no less than an attack against my person and whose purpose is political rather than that of justice.' He went on to say he took full responsibility for the actions of the party. This suggests Mr Craxi has no intention of stepping down from the party leadership although one third of the party is in open revolt against him. The weakening of the party, one of the pillars of the four-party ruling coalition, is likely to complicate the position of Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, although he has recently managed to distance himself from Mr Craxi. Yesterday, the lira declined to L895 against the D-Mark in nervous trading related to the political uncertainty.

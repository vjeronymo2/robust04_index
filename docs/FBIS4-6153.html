			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has tentatively decided to  adopt helicopters built by American Sikorsky Company as a model  to build next-generation multipurpose helicopters (UH-X) for use  by the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], and Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries will build the helicopters after obtaining a license  from the American helicopter builder. The DA, which has  informally notified the American helicopter builder of its  tentative decision, plans to include expenditures for the  procurement of several helicopters in its preliminary budget  request for fiscal 1995. Eurocopter, a French and German  joint-venture helicopter-manufacturing company, has negotiated  with the DA, but it has decided to seek the license for the  production of advanced helicopters from Sikorsky Company which  has granted Japanese defense contractors licenses to build  helicopters for use by the Air Self-Defense Force and the  Maritime Self-Defense Force. The advanced helicopters cost  approximately 4 billion yen each and the DA is expected to  procure about 50 of them in the long run.    The UH-X is a successor to the current UH-H helicopter which  is used by the GSDF for transport of troops and rescue  operations. The DA has classified the successor into two types  -- the advanced model and the conventional model. The UH-X  belongs to the advanced one whereas the UH-H belongs to the  conventional one. The DA has begun to procure UH-J helicopter,  a new version of the UH-H, which Fuji Heavy Industries has built  under the license granted by American Bell Company.    The DA has worked on choosing a model of large helicopter  that exceeds the UH-J helicopter in flying range and transport  capability. Although Eurocopter has negotiated with the DA, it  has tentatively decided to adopt UH-60J built by Sikorsky  Company as a model to build the UH-X helicopters. No decision  has been made on the next plan for defense buildup which begins  from 1996. Details of the DA's plans to purchase the advanced  helicopters are unknown, but it is expected to procure about 50  advanced helicopters.</p>

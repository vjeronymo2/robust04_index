			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Auditors wanted to stay at BCCI Ernst &amp; Whinney, the accountancy firm that is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, was willing to continue as auditor to Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1987, according to documents obtained by the Financial Times. Many had believed that the firm resigned from its work for BCCI, which was closed by banking regulators in July 1991. Ernst &amp; Whinney, however, wrote to BCCI on April 15 1987 saying it was 'entirely willing' to continue, as long as it could audit all of the group's principal companies. The Ernst &amp; Whinney letter appears to modify the stance taken by the firm just two days earlier, when it expressed concerns over financial and managerial controls as well as over its restricted involvement in the audit of subsidiaries. The details emerge as both Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse prepare their defences against legal actions estimated to total Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.4bn) brought by the liquidators to BCCI for allegedly failing to detect fraud within the bank. The latest estimates suggest that there was a 'black hole' of untraced assets in BCCI totalling Dollars 12.4bn at the time of its closure. Most of that went on supporting bad loans and internal treasury losses, or simply never existed. The two firms shared the audits of the main operating companies and subsidiaries to the bank until the 1986 financial year, with Ernst &amp; Whinney as group auditor but PW responsible for some audits. BCCI's board considered both PW and Ernst &amp; Whinney for the sole worldwide audit, but chose PW at a meeting at the end of April 1987 just after the two letters were sent. The letters are addressed to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief operating officer of the bank, who is being tried in both criminal and civil actions in Abu Dhabi, which became the BCCI majority shareholder. A letter in May 1986 highlights Ernst &amp; Whinney's concerns over inadequate financial controls, limited accountability and excessive control in too few senior managers' hands. The firm said it was willing to audit the 1986 accounts but would refuse to be reappointed for 1987 if the management changes were not made. In spite of some subsequent improvements, the letter of April 13 1987 says the concerns remain and it looks forward to seeing strengthening management resources and improvements in board reporting. But two days later Ernst &amp; Whinney said it did not 'wish to make any conditions' on 'future aspects of management and reporting to the board' in accepting reappointment for 1987. Its only proviso was to resolve 'the problem of group audit coverage'. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, confirmed yesterday that the firm did not resign from the audit.</p>

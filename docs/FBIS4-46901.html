			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tatarstan Needs Reforms"] </F>   [Text] On the eve of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet  session, which opens on Monday and whose task will be to  consider the government's anticrisis program, the sociological  service of the Inform-Club-ES agency under the sponsorship of  IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA conducted an express poll of Republic of  Tatarstan Supreme Soviet deputies.    1. Do you believe that Tatarstan's Cabinet of Ministers is  capable of functioning effectively in its current composition?    Yes30 percent    No45 percent    No opinion25 percent    2. What is your assessment of the economic situation in  Tatarstan?    Situation stable3.5 percent    Situation critical2.3 percent    Pre-crisis situation54.0 percent    Crisis situation40.0 percent    3. Does Tatarstan's parliamentary system need to be  reformed?    Yes76.5 percent    No19.0 percent    No opinion4.7 percent    Among parliament members who are directly involved in  decisionmaking as part of the executive authority (heads of  local administration, enterprise directors) and who hold about  one-third of the seats in the parliament, the mood is even more  radical than in the deputy corps as a whole. In this group, 36  percent are convinced that changes in the government are  necessary. They also look more critically at the current  economic situation in Tatarstan.    As to deputy groups and factions, the following picture  emerges.    Representatives of the Party of Unity and Progress believe  that the priority task for the parliament is to change the tax  system and intend to state their position at the session.    The Equality and Legality bloc believes that the issue of  cabinet membership per se is not important--the system of  administration as a whole needs to be changed.    The group Tatarstan expresses the opinion that the  government  has not kept the promise it had given to the parliament, and  instead of an anticrisis program has submitted another  declarative document on a number of priority measures. The  bloc's representatives intend to voice their complaints on this  subject in the parliament.    In the course of the survey, 85 deputies were  polled--35 percent of the deputy corps. The survey was done on  the telephone by random selection. The results are  representative.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Call for merger of all Co-op retailers A call for Co-operative retailers to merge into a single national organisation, which would be one of the UK's largest retailers with annual turnover of Pounds 7bn, was made at the Co-operative Congress. Speaking in the 150th year of the co-operative movement and in its birthplace - Rochdale - Mr Hughie Todner, congress president, backed calls for co-operative societies to join forces. He said the 41 remaining societies should come together in a new Co-operative Consumer Partnership. The Co-op's financial institutions, the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Bank, should also merge. 'The combined resources and enterprise of these organisations could forge new horizons in co-operation which could reach new heights of excellence,' he said. His call is likely to increase the pressure on the movement's two largest retailers, Co-operative Retail Services and the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which are in merger negotiations. A merger would form a group with annual sales of Pounds 3bn, making it the UK's seventh-largest retailer. The last attempt to merge the two groups failed in 1990 when they could not agree on the composition of the board. But both groups are hopeful of success this time. Analysts say a merger is the only way for co-operative retailers to compete effectively in a mature grocery market increasingly dominated by large quoted companies such as J Sainsbury and Tesco. The CWS has absorbed a number of smaller regional societies in recent years, and has formed a buying and distribution partnership - the Co-operative Retail Trading Group - with several others. Mr Todner said that a national partnership would create greater financial rewards for members and staff but it was important to safeguard the movement's system of democratic control.</p>

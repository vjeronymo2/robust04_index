			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Developer faces writ for Pounds 16m transfer Mr John Broome, the property developer behind Battersea Leisure, the scheme that failed to redevelop the Battersea Power Station, is the subject of a High Court writ concerning an unexplained cash transfer. The writ, which was issued by the liquidator of Battersea Leisure on May 27, concerns the transfer six years ago of Pounds 16m from Battersea Leisure to Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park formerly run by Mr Broome. Mr Alan Lewis of Arthur Andersen, accountants, liquidator of Battersea Leisure, is seeking the return of the money. The protective writ was issued just before the six-year time limit for bringing legal action ran out. The proceedings were described as 'preposterous' by a spokesman for the Broome Group. 'The Broome Group strenuously denies that the directors have executed their responsibilities in any way other than with total correctness concerning all financial arrangements in the group,' the spokesman said. He added: 'It is understood that Arthur Andersen had not contacted the company's accountants Touche Ross, due to time constraints, in order to acquaint themselves with the relevant facts prior to issuing a protective writ - which has not been served.' Mr Broome's plans to redevelop Battersea Power station started in 1987 when his company Battersea Group, formerly Alton Towers, acquired 85 per cent of the Battersea site for Pounds 18m. But plans to turn it into a leisure complex were halted in 1990, after the scheme ran out of funds. Battersea Leisure eventually went into liquidation. Control of the site passed to Parkview, a company owned by the Hwang Brothers of Hong Kong, which intends to develop a hotel, office complex and leisure scheme. In 1987, at the same time as Mr Broome's company bought its 85 per cent stake of the Battersea site, Mr Broome bought 15 per cent of the site for his own account. He then sold this minority stake at a sharply increased price of Pounds 16.5m in 1988 to Alton Towers. Mr Broome was paid Pounds 11m of the proceeds in the form of shares in Alton Towers, while he received the remaining Pounds 5.5m in cash. Mr Broome sold Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park, to Pearson, the group that publishes the Financial Times, for Pounds 60m in March 1990. The writ has been issued against ATB (Staffs) Ltd which is Mr Broome's company, Mr Broome, his wife and two other directors of ATB (Staff) Ltd.</p>

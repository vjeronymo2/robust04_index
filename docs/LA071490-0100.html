			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BERKELEY;  </P> <P> ANTI-DRUG MEASURE IS SNUFFED OUT  </P> <P> Anti-marijuana activists could not find enough Berkeley voters to just say yes  to a "Just Say No" ballot measure aimed at forcing police to vigorously enforce  drug laws. The activists were trying to put a measure on the November ballot to  rescind a 1979 plebiscite that forced police to make enforcement of marijuana  laws their lowest priority. City officials of this liberal college town of  106,000 residents said that the anti-drug petition fell 222 votes shy of the  2,304 needed to qualify it for the ballot.  </P></p>

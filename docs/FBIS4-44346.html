			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Johan Cuppens: "European Parliament Gets Unique </F> Opportunity in Discussions About Commission President -- Germany  Ambiguous About Support for Prime Minister Dehaene"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  Unique Chance </H5>   The pressure to find a European Commission (EC) president  quickly is in part based on the wish to not create an open  conflict with the European Parliament (EP), which will gather in  Strasbourg from 19 July. On Monday [27 June], there were calls  for the question of Delors's succession to be presented to the  EP.    And why not? The view that the EP is not empowered to do so  is correct. But no parliament has ever had powers just thrown  into its lap. Power always has to be won, and this struggle  never really stops. In the recent European elections, there  were complaints about the low turnout and the huge gulf between  the EP and the citizen. That does not have to stay that way.  Next month, the EP will get a unique chance to prove itself and  fight for its place in Europe.    Well-informed sources do not rule out the possibility that  the present EC President Jacques Delors will stay on half a year  longer. Delors, according to these sources, is hesitating about  presenting himself as a candidate for next year's French  presidential elections. If he does not do so, then Delors would  be available to lead the EC for another six months.    However, this solution does not address the core of the  matter: The member states will have to settle things in one way  or another. Postponement will yield nothing. The stakes are  high and in the first place do not concern Jean-Luc Dehaene, but  Europe itself.</p>

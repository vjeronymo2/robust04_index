			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFGHAN REBELS TALK OF MILITARY RULE;  </P> <P> FIELD COMMANDERS PREPARED TO ACT IF POLITICAL TALKS FAIL  </P> <P> Afghan guerrilla commanders, disillusioned by incessant wrangling among the  political leaders of the Afghan resistance, are drawing up a "security plan" --  a military operation to keep order in Afghanistan if the Soviet-backed regime  falls with no interim rebel government ready to take its place.  </P> <P> This was disclosed Sunday by Abdul Haq, a prominent rebel commander who has  spent about a third of his life at the forefront of the moujahedeen's war  against the Moscow-installed regime in his country.  </P> <P> Surveying the infighting among rebel politicians as they try to agree on how  things should be run when the Kabul government of President Najibullah  collapses, as expected, Haq said:  </P> <P> "The people are tired. I am tired. Everybody's tired. Up to now there was some  hope they (the rebel political leaders) would come up with a solution. Maybe  some (of us) lost hope six months ago, maybe some two months ago, maybe some  now, maybe some a month from now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wounded 15 Times  </P> <P> The 30-year-old Haq, who has been wounded 15 times and lost a foot and most of  his hair in the war, echoed the sentiments of many other rebel military  commanders interviewed by The Times during the past week as the political  wrangling continued.  </P> <P> "We watch them, we give them a chance," he said of the rebels' political  leaders. "But if we see they are doing nothing, well then, maybe we will have  to decide ourselves."  </P> <P> Interviewed in his hotel room as leaders of the seven political parties in the  rebel alliance continued informal weekend meetings and bargaining aimed at  breaking impasses that forced a temporary adjournment of Friday's rebel  assembly here, Haq talked about the "security plan." He said that rebel  commanders inside Afghanistan have a plan to secure all government buildings,  embassies, international agencies and private property in the Afghan capital of  Kabul and other major cities.  </P> <P> "If they (the rebel political parties) cannot come together for whatever  reasons, we cannot just let the country finish and burn and die and be  destroyed just because of this problem," said Haq, who is regarded as one of  the most powerful rebel commanders in the Kabul region.  </P> <P> "The best way is to have an interim government to install. But in case there is  disagreement, we have to be prepared. If the (Najibullah) regime collapses . .  . there should be at least some security."  </P> <P> In disclosing the plan, Haq also confirmed recent speculation by senior  diplomats and other analysts here that the guerrilla commanders increasingly  are taking over the direction of the war, as the seven-party rebel alliance  appears to be collapsing into internal squabbling. The alliance was created  largely to funnel U.S.-supplied arms and other support to moujahedeen  commanders inside Afghanistan.  </P> <P> "We have been loyal to the (political) leaders," said Haq, who has been  fighting under the auspices of one of the seven parties, despite the fact that  most of his operations have been on individual initiative. "We are still loyal  to the leaders. But when we know there is something they are doing that is no  good for anybody, then it is not enough to be loyal to them."  </P> <P> The focus of the commanders' criticism is the so-called shoora, or assembly,  convened in Islamabad by the alliance last Friday. Haq, like many other  commanders, intellectuals and influential tribal chiefs who have formed the  core of the resistance, is a delegate to the 420-member shoora, which seemed to  have collapsed in chaos an hour after it was called to order Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> In fact, the shoora was just suspended indefinitely, and the rebel leaders met  informally throughout the weekend to sort out differences between the  Pakistan-based, hard-line fundamentalist Islamic parties that dominate the  rebel alliance and the moderate parties, which are allied with Shiite Afghan  groups based in Iran.  </P> <P> An example of the squabbling was provided in a Sunday morning press conference  by the Afghanistan National Liberation Front, a moderate party headed by  Sibghatullah Mojaddidi. Mojaddidi's son, Zabiullah, charged that there is "a  conspiracy to insult" his party's delegates by fundamentalist groups and the  Pakistani government, which, he claimed, jailed two of the party's  representatives to keep them from attending the shoora.  </P> <P> Asked if his party will now boycott the shoora when it reconvenes, which is  expected to occur before Wednesday, the younger Mojaddidi said, "Our pulling  out of the shoora is not at this time a certain issue; it is a possible issue."  </P> <P> In another development, Pakistan's government, which has favored the  fundamentalists in the past but now describes itself as interested mainly in  any compromise that will bring political stability to Afghanistan, was trying  to persuade the leader of the Iran-based rebel groups to attend the next  session.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back Into Afghanistan  </P> <P> Some of the commanders of the smaller, rural rebel groups have been so  alienated by the political fracas that they have crossed back into Afghanistan.  But Haq said the recess in the shoora was welcome because it gave quarreling  groups time to discuss their differences.  </P> <P> Yet he confessed that he was as confused as any outsider trying to understand  the political developments within the rebel movement.  </P> <P> "Honestly, I have more questions than answers," he said. "We still don't know  what's going on. It's a critical moment of the war. People want answers. People  want to see the result of the struggle and the sacrifice they made for 10  years."  </P> <P> Haq explained that most of the commanders inside Afghanistan formed alliances  with the Pakistan-based parties simply because, in a war that appeared without  end, a continuing supply of arms and ammunition meant survival.  </P> <P> At one point during the interview, Haq -- who describes himself as neither a  fundamentalist nor a moderate but as a fervent nationalist -- was asked if he  could live in an Afghanistan dominated by fundamentalist leaders such as Abdul  Rasul Sayyaf, who called a press conference Saturday to spend an hour  reprimanding the foreign press for allegedly misreporting Friday's shoora and  demanding, "You must correct your mistakes."  </P> <P> "We're really tired of being told how to live, what to wear, where to go, what  to eat," he said. "I don't think this will last."  </P></p>

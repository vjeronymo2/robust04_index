			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 15 SAPA -- The South African Defence  Force [SADF] will soon host a one-hour programme on Radio 2000  to communicate with the public, especially the SADF's part-time  forces. A statement issued on Friday [15 April] on behalf of the  SADF by chief director of communication Maj-Gen John Rolt said  the programme, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday evenings,  would be first aired within a fortnight, pending finalisation of  an agreement with the South African Broadcasting Corporation.    The statement also said a newspaper and radio advertising  campaign was in the offing to improve the image of the SADF and  create a climate favourable to the establishment of a new  National Defence Force on April 27. Empahasis would be placed on  communicating with the black community.    Four full-page advertisements would be placed 11 times each,  and 27-second radio spots would be aired 500 times.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses decline as rate prospects pall BOURSES decided that German interest rate prospects could sustain them for only so long, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT eased by a fraction, rate cut hopes holding equities relatively firm against a background of disappointing, or inconclusive company news. The DAX index slipped 4.74 to 1,697.83 in turnover down from DM6.2bn to DM6.1bn. Chemicals were under pressure after the string of accidents at Hoechst, which could trigger a series of government actions to tighten regulations and impose costly new safety controls on the industry. MAN, the truckmaker and engineer, fell DM8 to DM297.50 on a downgrade and sell recommendation from DB Research, which cut its 1993 earnings estimate from DM23 to DM13 and the dividend in prospect from DM10 to DM7; Deutsche Babcock lost Monday's gains and more, falling DM5.30 to DM156.20 as attention shifted to the deterioration in its prospects for 1992-93. Among carmakers, Volkswagen moved with the continental clock, rising DM5 to DM290.50 over the official session in reaction to Monday's late news that Mr Ignacio Lopez, VW's erstwhile recruit, would be leaving GM after all - and falling DM2 after hours as dealers waited for the results of a VW press conference, and mused that Mr Lopez, a tough cost cutter in the US, might find German conditions less to his liking. Meanwhile, Mr Detlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt offered a cautionary word about equity prospects after Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. Relative strength indicators were looking toppy, he said, a limited rate cut from Buba could be seen as solidarity pact window dressing, and the expiry of options contracts on Friday could exaggerate any adverse reaction. MILAN was battered by a sharp fall in Olivetti which followed Monday's news of a L900bn rights issue. After an early suspension on a 14 per cent drop, the shares closed L377, or 17 per cent lower at L1,825. This was reflected in the Comit index which finished 6.00 weaker at 502.42. Mr Carlo de Benedetti has said that the capital increase is needed to help the group take advantage of a possible recovery in the European computer market, where it is perceived to have an advantage over IBM and Compaq because of the strength of the dollar. Some analysts commented that Olivetti had made efforts already to restructure and streamline its business into sector areas with the best growth opportunities, such as telecommunications and computer notebooks. NatWest Securities in London said that the convertible bonds offered as a partial alternative to conventional equity looked attractive: they will be issued at L1,000, and carry a coupon of between 6 and 8 per cent. Olivetti's parent company, Cir, which announced a loss of L540bn in 1992, also eased on the news, closing down L119 at L1,050 while Cofide, another of Mr De Benedetti's companies, was off L122 at L1,138. The Olivetti news weighed on other stocks which, observers believe may make a rights issue; Fiat, for instance, lost L225 to L5,560. PARIS remained depressed with a further fall in the CAC-40 index of 10.78 to 1,975.25 as turnover stayed low at FFr2.3bn. There was activity in Moulinex, which began the week with a decline of some 6.5 per cent and followed yesterday with another fall of FFr6.80, or 7 per cent to FFr90.70. Some analysts remarked that there had been reports yesterday that the group had clarified its shareholding structure, suggesting that it could proceed with a rights issue. The share price had risen to a year's high of FFr107 on takeover speculation. MADRID got the better January inflation figures it expected and sold, the general index falling 2.23 to 235.50. STOCKHOLM staged a modest rally on lower domestic interest rates as the Affarsvarlden general index gained 17.7 to 1,017.8, its first gain in five trading days. Turnover improved to SKr558m from Monday's SKr532m. Ericsson, the telecommunications group, remained the market's most active issue as the B shares rose SKr5 to SKr240 in turnover of some SKr90m. ISTANBUL decided that the results of some 40 companies announced yesterday had failed to match expectations, and the market index closed 75.43 lower at 5,716.82.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 16                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1153.85    1152.19    1151.40    1151.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1221.52    1221.41    1221.06    1222.74  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1152.12    1151.73    1151.42    1151.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1222.69    1221.92    1222.26    1222.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 15    Mar 12    Mar 11    Mar 10    Mar 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1153.62   1145.86   1163.60   1167.52   1164.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.52   1212.44   1232.53   1231.98   1230.72  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1153.85; 200 - 1223.43 Low/day: 100 -  1150.91  200 - 1219.93.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

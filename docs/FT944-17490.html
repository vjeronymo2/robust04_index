			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: CSR expects ADollars 100m from pension surplus CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, announced yesterday that it expects to receive a ADollars 100m (USDollars 73.50m) cash transfer early next year as a result of the surplus in its superannuation fund. The company said that the fund had an actuarial surplus of ADollars 290m when it was last valued. Accordingly, after 12 months of negotiation, it has been decided that CSR will enjoy one third of this; that a further ADollars 100m will be used to improve fund members' benefits; and that the remaining surplus will stay in the fund 'to maintain a buffer'. CSR will treat the bonus - on which it will pay tax - as an abnormal item in its next profit and loss statement.</p>

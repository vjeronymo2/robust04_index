			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Paisley may meet Irish ministers THE UK and Irish governments are preparing for a potentially difficult meeting tomorrow on the future of Northern Ireland that may bring the Rev Ian Paisley, the hardline Democratic Unionist party leader, face to face with Irish ministers, Ralph Atkins writes. The London meeting, agreed only after two weeks of wrangling between the governments over dates, will officially be to 'give preliminary consideration to the issues likely to arise' in the third 'strand' of the nine-week-old all-party talks process. This strand is concerned with relations between the two countries. Unionists regard the meeting as a crucial time for British ministers to press for removal of the Irish constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. The Irish government is putting more emphasis on persuading Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to formally start 'strand two' of the talks - on relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic. Tomorrow's agenda was confirmed in talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, at the European Community summit in Lisbon. The meeting is part of the complex deal struck by Sir Patrick this month to keep the talks going even though agreement has not been reached in 'strand one' - on models of government for the province. The meeting is meant to be between the two governments, but Northern Ireland's main political parties will send observers. The DUP is expected to decide today to send Mr Paisley - more to ensure that the UK government is sufficiently forthright than to put pressure on the Irish.</p>

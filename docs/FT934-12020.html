			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tokyo SE computers derailed by JR East THE Tokyo stock exchange's computer system was on the verge of collapse yesterday as investors crowded to get aboard the partial flotation of East Japan Railway (JR East). Officials suspended trading in the company's shares after the stock surged to value the company at Y2,400bn (Dollars 22.6bn). The unprecedented move caused embarrassment for the exchange and Japan's financial officials. TSE officials said its computer system, installed two years ago, had been on the verge of crashing due to the rush of orders for JR East along with other stock trading orders. The listing of half of the 4m shares of JR East last Tuesday was the biggest offering of a semi-privatised company since the Y18,673.2bn float of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1986. JR East jumped 57.8 per cent from its initial offered price to Y600,000 after remaining bid-only all day Tuesday. In order to attract a large number of retail investors, who tend to be faithful long-term holders of stock rather than active traders, the state-owned Japan National Railway Settlement, had aimed to keep the initial offering price relatively low. After an auction of 400,000 shares in August, at an average price of Y379,806, the remaining 1.4m shares were offered at Y380,000. Investors are worried by the stock exchange's computers inability yesterday to handle trading of the stock. 'It's a highly unusual case, and it really shouldn't have happened,' said Mr Keith Donaldson at brokers Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. There were complaints from brokers that orders for other shares had been affected. The Tokyo stock exchange said it would accept orders for JR East 30 minutes earlier than usual in the morning and afternoon sessions today, when JR East trading would have to be done manually on the floor to avoid disruption of settlement procedures.</p>

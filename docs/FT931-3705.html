			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Promodes ahead 19% in sluggish retail sector PROMODES, one of France's largest retail groups, managed to increase net profits by 19.4 per cent to FFr555m (Dollars 98m)in 1992 from FFr465m in 1991 despite the slowdown in the French economy and the pressures on the retail scene. The group, already one of the largest participants in France's dynamic hypermarket sector and which has recently been expanding its international activities, notably with the 1991 acquisition of Plaza in Germany, saw turnover rise by 10.3 per cent to FFr84.2bn last year from FFr76.37bn in 1991. Last year the French retail sector came under pressure because of the general strains on the French economy. The combination of high real interest rates and fears of rising joblessness has depressed confidence and consumer spending was static during the year. Promodes produced a 32.5 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr1.76bn in 1992 from FFr1.33bn in 1991. The group said that it lost money on some of its new international subsidiaries, but countered this with a strong performance from its existing interests. Earnings per share rose by 19.7 per cent to FFr33.5 last year from FFr28.0 in 1991. The board proposed raising the dividend by 20 per cent to FFr7 a share for 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--At the prearranged hour  this morning, the corridor linking the Serb suburbs of Lukavica  and Ilidza via Sarajevo airport was opened to traffic.    Under a recent agreement between the Serb and Muslim side, a  corridor linking the Muslim-controlled suburbs of Butmir and  Dobrinja will also open today.    First, buses with civilians on board set off from Ilidza for  Lukavica and Pale this morning. A bus left for Belgrade.    For the first time since the airport was handed over to  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, people from Serb  Sarajevo were able to use the Lukavica-Ilidza road. There have  been no traffic problems so far.    The Serb fighters bridge (formerly Brotherhood and Unity  bridge), which links Grbavica with the Muslim part of Sarajevo,  has not yet been opened to civilians because the Muslim side is  demanding that Serb authorities in the Novo Sarajevo  municipality remove the Srpska republic's state symbols from the  Serb side of the border crossing.    The bridge and the Sarajevo-Visoko corridor via Vogosca are,  however, expected to open to traffic later today.</p>

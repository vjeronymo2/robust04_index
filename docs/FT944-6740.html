			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (9): Where there is a will .. - Jane Martinson sees ingenuity at work in the UK, US and France When a full-time energy manager was appointed at Leeds General Infirmary in northern England last year he found a number of targets for his efficiency drive. A year earlier the hospital, which spends an average of Pounds 1.65m a year on energy, received a 'poor' rating when judged by environment department guidelines on energy efficiency. Marcus Tunaley, recently-appointed energy officer at the infirmary, says: 'An environment audit on total energy consumption in one wing was one of the worst I've ever seen.' Faced with a National Health Service commitment to cut energy consumption by 15 per cent over the next five years, the hospital is one of a number managed by NHS trusts to have committed 10 per cent of its annual energy bill to efficiency measures. Some Pounds 165,000 will be spent in Leeds over each of the next four years. The current efficiency measures range from aluminium-clad radiators to updating the outdated building management system. The old system, which controls heating and lighting, was unable to adapt to changing needs. 'The old system provided heat to the hospital 24 hours a day,' says Tunaley. 'We wanted it to work when it was needed.' Most measures have focused on the large Clarendon wing of the hospital built in the early 1970s before the oil crisis encouraged energy savings. 'It was quite obvious that this wing, lovely as it is, was built when fuel was cheap,' says Tunaley. A 'deep plan' building with many windowless rooms, some 40 per cent of its electricity is used for air conditioning. Frequency inverters and air quality sensors, which enable the conditioning system to respond to natural changes in temperature, will save 80 per cent of the electricity used for the air conditioning alone, says Tunaley. With the new system the conditioning system works hardest at busy times of the day, in the canteen at lunchtime for example. Other savings have resulted from fitting ionic fuel technology to old boilers (with an energy saving of 8 per cent) and the installation of high-frequency fluorescent tubes (with a possible electricity saving of 30 per cent). Environmental concerns are one reason for the hospital's efficiency measures but the main reason is to save money. 'Efficiency measures represent a good return on your investment,' he says. 'They are accepted as a good way to save money.' The saving also makes sense in the face of the expected increase in gas prices next year, says Tunaley. He believes that the end of cheap 'interruptible' gas to large consumers because of market liberalisation could result in the price of gas going up by 25 per cent. The hospital uses gas to generate electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The deregulation of the energy market in the UK has encouraged some large users to use CHP plants to generate their own power and enhance the security of their energy supply. The plants can cut the loss of fuel in energy production by using the heat from electricity generation for further energy purposes. The chemicals manufacturing arm of Zeneca, the biosciences group, is to install two CHP plants to supply 23.5MW for its Huddersfield and Grangemouth sites in the UK. The new Pounds 10.6m plant at Huddersfield, to provide the steam and electricity used in the manufacturing process, aims to save an estimated Pounds 2.5m a year in energy costs. Environmental legislation has encouraged the new energy contract. Two of the plant's boilers, which will be phased out under the new scheme, are over 30 years old and do not include pollution-abatement measures. Bob Thompson, Zeneca spokesman, said: 'This equipment needs replacing because of our desire to improve our environmental performance and also because if we don't we will not meet environmental legislation which is coming into force in the next few years.' The new plant would enable the company to keep ahead of controls on carbon dioxide emissions for example. The plant currently burns some 90,000 tonnes of coal a year. In Europe and the US companies have been keen to encourage energy efficiency to comply with legislation - following government commitments at the Rio earth summit to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000 - and to enhance their public image. Electricity companies in the US, for example, entered into a voluntary agreement, called the Climate Challenge, with the Department of Energy earlier this year. The initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gases, was a direct response to a proposed tax on the number of British Thermal Units (the common measure of heating energy) last year. Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, the largest power utility in the US and a party to the agreement, has allocated Dollars 2bn to customer energy efficiency programmes in the 1990s. With this investment the company hopes energy bills will be cut by more than Dollars 2bn net by 2000. Last year more than Dollars 186m was spent on some 50 programmes, resulting in a saving of 491m kwh of electricity. More than 600,000 customers participated in energy efficiency initiatives last year. For one scheme last year the company paid Dollars 30,000 to replace 150-watt incandescent traffic signals with energy-saving 25-watt light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the city of Davis. In spite of these efforts, however, the company failed to meet its 1993 targets on energy efficiency, partly, it claims because of reorganisation and the loss of 3,000 jobs. In France, the state gas company Gaz de France has a team dedicated to encouraging energy efficiency particularly through the installation of combined heat and power plants. Jean-Pierre Roncato, head of the cogeneration development mission, says that by using CHP plants 85 per cent of the gas used in generation can be recovered and used for both electricity and heating. This year the company has started 30 CHP projects compared with just four in 1991. At the same time it is installing boilers with high-energy conversion capabilities. 'Being fuel efficient is a strategic idea for us,' says Roncato. 'It's important as far as our image is concerned to supply an efficient product which uses natural gas.' Up to 75 per cent of France's energy needs is supplied by nuclear electricity. Gaz de France supplies only a fraction of the country's total energy but is hoping that by stressing fuel efficiency - and by offering price warranties to allay fears of a gas price rise - it can increase its share of the market.</p>

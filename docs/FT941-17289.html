			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / How to widen the circle: A bigger Nato should not be more threatening to Russia than German unity was 'A democratic and strong Russia would be the strongest guarantee of peace and stability in Europe.' If that had been said by the US or British or German foreign minister, it would be barely newsworthy. But coming as it does from the Polish foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, during his recent visit to Germany, it should be considered an important contribution to the resolution of Europe's current security dilemma. Accepting the expansion of Nato towards Russia's own frontier does not come easily to Russian political leaders, but there is no reason to think it impossible. Many people doubted in the first half of 1990 that the Soviet Union (as it then still was) would ever allow a united Germany to remain in Nato. But it ended up doing so. Why? First, the US administration was single-mindedly determined to achieve that result, and made this its top foreign policy priority. Second, the West German chancellor, once he saw the strength of US resolve, became convinced that maintaining Nato membership was a condition for German unity rather than an obstacle to it, and acted accordingly. Third, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev himself understood that, having once accepted the basic principle of the right of the East German population to decide its own future, he was ill-placed to impose conditions. Finally, both the US and German governments realised that Mr Gorbachev had to be helped to sell that unpalatable proposition to the Soviet establishment. Accordingly, they made sure that German unity came about as part of a series of changes with which Moscow was associated, and from which the Soviet Union, along with the rest of Europe, could expect to benefit. Why was the united Germany's membership of Nato so important to the US? Because the alternative was West Germany's secession from Nato, which would have meant the effective demise of the alliance. The argument for further expansion of Nato, to include other central and east European countries, is less clear cut. One US lobby, led by Republican senator Richard Lugar but including some influential people within the Clinton administration, has argued that failure to expand, or at least to address effectively the security problems of central and eastern Europe, would be no less fatal to the alliance in the medium term than the departure of West Germany would have been in 1990. 'Out of area or out of business' is this lobby's catchy slogan ('out of area' being Nato's jargon for the world beyond the territory of its existing member states). The opposing view, associated particularly with the new deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, is that over-hasty enlargement itself poses the greater threat to the alliance. It would dilute the mutual defence commitment of Nato members by extending it to fragile new democracies which cannot be relied on not to engage in ill-advised provocations. Above all, it would stimulate a nationalist backlash in Russia, so jeopardising the position of pro-western reformers and increasing the very danger of renewed Russian expansionism against which central and east European states are seeking protection. This second view has apparently come out on top in preparations for next week's Nato summit, and is reflected in the cautious fudge of the proposed 'partnership for peace', which envisages greater co-operation between Nato and east European countries but does not give any clear security guarantees. Mr Olechowski is rightly dissatisfied with that proposal, but his remark shows sensitivity to the thinking behind it. Indeed he went further than the most pro-Russian western analysts in saying that 'without the inclusion of a functioning democratic Russia' there could be no European security. In reality, Poland's first concern is to find ways of making itself and the rest of Europe secure in the all too likely event that democracy in Russia fails - or ceases - to function. Intellectually, the case for Nato enlargement would become more compelling after the failure of democracy in Russia and the re-emergence of a plausible Russian threat. The danger is that politically and militarily it might then be too late. Western governments might be even more reluctant to guarantee Poland's security if there were an imminent danger of having to implement that guarantee by coming to Poland's defence; and if they did so, they might not have the forces available at the right time and place to defend Poland fully. Poland went through that experience in 1939, and has no desire to repeat it. Poles do not want to wait for Russia to turn nasty. They want, in the homely phrase Chancellor Helmut Kohl used about German unity in 1990, to 'get the hay into the barn before the storm'. They need to exploit the present benign phase in Russian policy (or retreat of Russian power) to forge ties with western Europe such that in future a western guarantee to Poland will seem credible and indeed inevitable, because any future Russian attack on Poland would really be an attack on Europe itself. But that can only be achieved if Poland and the other candidates for Nato membership, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, make it clear, as Mr Olechowski is doing, that they more than anyone share the general European interest in the success of democracy and reform in Russia; that their first preference is for a European security system in which a democratic Russia would play a full part. Their membership of Nato, while clearly an insurance policy against things going wrong in Russia, should also be seen as a step towards Nato's transformation into a pan-European collective security system with Russia as a full member, if things go right.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS SKIP WORK IN PROTEST  </P> <P> School bus schedules were thrown into disarray in Miami when at least 70% of  the county's 300 drivers honored a boycott called by black religious leaders in  protest of the Dade County School Board's choice of a superintendent. Several  students and teachers also followed the boycott, staged because the board  passed over Tee S. Greer, a black man with more than 30 years experience in the  school system, and chose a Cuban who has been in the department about seven  years.  </P></p>

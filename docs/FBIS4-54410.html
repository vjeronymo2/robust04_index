			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Ivan Pilip, Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) chairman and first deputy education  minister, who was yesterday nominated by his party for the post  of education minister to replace Petr Pitha, was born in Prague  in 1963. Pitha, who handed in his resignation for health  reasons yesterday, is also a KDS member. In line with the  coalition agreements the post belongs to the party.    Pilip is a graduate of the Prague School of Economics (VSE)  where he majored in international economics and trade. He then  worked at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and VSE. After  restitution of family property near Tabor, South Bohemia, in the  wake of the fall of the communist regime in November 1989, he  was placed at the head of a medical equipment factory employing  80 people. Since August 1992 he has held the post of deputy  education minister (since February 1993 first deputy).    Pilip entered political life after November 1989. Before he  had been neither a member nor a candidate for membership of any  party. He became a member of the KDS shortly after it was formed  in 1990. In December 1993 he was elected the party chairman,  replacing Vaclav Benda. Now the government coalition party has  10 out of the total of 200 seats in the parliament.    Pilip's wife Lucie was Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, but  left  the post after her husband became the KDS chairman to avoid a  conflict of interests. At present she is an executive director  of the Bohemiae Foundation.    Pilip knew Pitha before November 1989 from the Independent  Intellectuals Group. After Pitha became education minister he  offered Pilip a position in a ministerial team in charge of  economic and conceptual issues.    Pitha was born in 1938. He graduated from the Philosophical  Faculty of Prague's Charles University where he studied Czech,  general linguistics and history. He also studied mathematical  linguistics at the Mathematical-Physical Faculty of Charles  University. Privately he studied theology and was regularly  ordained priest in the Netherlands in 1969.    His main task at the ministry was transformation of  education, but his proposals have been criticised by both the  coalition parties and the opposition.    On March 28, 1994, education trade unions called a protest  rally against the proposed changes in the management and funds  distribution at schools. Pitha also came to the rally which he  commented later: "I do not know what the meeting was about and  even after my return from Old Town Square (where it was held) I  was no wiser."    After a government session yesterday, Premier Vaclav Klaus  said that Pitha "has done more than it might seem from the  skirmishes in the parliamentary Education Committee or from  media reports." He added that with his humane and prudent  handling of problems, he will be missed at government sessions.    Pitha is the third minister to leave his post early. The  other two were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party,  ODS) and Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both of them were  strongly criticised for their performance in transforming their  respective spheres of social life.    The present government emerged from the June 1992 elections.</p>

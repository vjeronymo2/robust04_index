			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / US defence decisions hinge on spending review THE Clinton administration has postponed all big decisions on military force structure and defence equipment programmes until it has completed a 'bottom-up review of defence needs and programmes'. Although the Dollars 263.4bn (Pounds 185bn) defence budget for the 1994 fiscal year, presented at the weekend, cuts two Army divisions, two Navy aircraft carriers and the equivalent of nearly three Air Force fighter wings, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said he had only been able to make amendments to the budget bequeathed him by the outgoing Bush administration. 'We are dealing with a 1994 budget, the bulk of which has been written by the previous administration. We are essentially able to add and subtract from that defence budget but not really shape it from the ground up,' he said. The budget projects defence spending dropping steadily to Dollars 246bn in 1997, before rising again to Dollars 253.9bn in 1998. The budget resolves none of the outstanding questions over costly and controversial equipment programmes such as the C-17 transport aircraft, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, or the Seawolf submarine. Procurement costs will be cut by 17 per cent in real terms to Dollars 45.5bn, but this is largely because no new B-2 bombers will be bought, and only three DD5-51 destroyers, decisions already made under the Bush administration. Congressional critics have complained that the Pentagon will not be able to afford all its major programmes within the framework of President Bill Clinton's promise to cut deeply into defence spending, but funding is essentially preserved for all large procurement programmes, pending the outcome of the review. Indeed, Mr Aspin has written back into the budget 24 new F-16 fighters that the Air Force said it did not want, in order to keep the production line open until decisions have been made on future tactical aircraft for the Navy and the Air Force. 'This is a cautious budget on the weapons side. We are maintaining a lot of options,' Mr Aspin said. One weapons area where decisions have been made is the Strategic Defence Initiative, often known as Star Wars. While the new budget funds missile defence development at the same level of Dollars 3.8bn as last year, money is shifted to short-range tactical defence systems such as the Patriot, and away from defences against ballistic missiles. The new administration has, nevertheless, made sharp cuts in personnel and force structure to meet its targets for spending cuts. Active forces will be cut by 108,000 to 1.62m, with reserves dropping 60,000 to 1.02m and the Pentagon's civilian workforce falling by 45,000 to 919,000. Combined with a government-wide pay freeze, this will cut military personnel costs by 9 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms to Dollars 70.1bn in 1994. Mr Aspin claimed that his predecessors, when faced with making budget savings, tended to make horizontal cuts, keeping the same number of divisions, carrier battle groups or tactical air wings, but reducing the number of men in each unit, with the aim of filling them out when war came. 'I am not sure it was the right strategy in those days, in retrospect, but it is certainly not the right strategy now when the force structure is really more than we need for the kinds of threats that we are facing now,' Mr Aspin said. Pending the outcome of his review, Mr Aspin's interim force structure will cut the Army from 14 to 12 active divisions. The Navy will fall from 443 ships to 413, dropping to 12 aircraft carriers with the decommissioning of the Saratoga and the Forrestal. The Air Force will drop from 16.1 active fighter wing equivalents to 13.3, with one-and-a-half wings eliminated in Europe and one in the US, as well as an additional wing from the air reserves. At the same time, Mr Aspin promised to preserve budgets for training and operations to ensure that US forces remained at a high degree of readiness. One new initiative is a specific Dollars 300m allocation for peacekeeping exercises, which the US has previously paid for out of its regular operations accounts. Mr Aspin acknowledged, however, that the allocation was likely to be too small, noting that the US deployment in Somalia was expected to cost Dollars 700m.</p>

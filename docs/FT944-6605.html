			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: At risk from harassment - UK companies cannot afford to ignore sexual misconduct Corporate America blanched in early September when a jury in California awarded Ms Rena Weeks, a former secretary at international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, Dollars 7.2m for sexual harassment by partner Mr Martin Greenstein. Ms Weeks, who had worked for Mr Greenstein for just 25 days, took on the might of the world's largest law firm and won the biggest ever sexual harassment award in a case not involving sexual assault or rape. What, then, might someone in her position inflict on a corporation less well placed than Baker &amp; McKenzie to defend itself? In the search to find a rational explanation for the size of the award in the days that followed, law firms and company executives were tempted to regard it as an aberration of America's bizarre system of punitive damages. After all, the San Francisco jury had awarded Ms Weeks only Dollars 50,000 for emotional distress caused by Mr Greenstein touching her breast while putting sweets into her blouse pocket. The rest of the award was punitive damages. But those who kidded themselves that the Weeks case was a one-off were soon disabused of the notion. The jurors, who had heard testimony of alleged sexual harassment from other Baker &amp; McKenzie employees, told America's Court TV they felt that a message needed to be sent not just to the law firm but to all companies of the dangers of ignoring and covering up unacceptable conduct. The result of the Weeks case, according to US employment lawyer Mr Ronald Green, a partner of New York's Epstein Becker &amp; Green, is likely to be a big jump in the number of sexual harassment claims in the US. Last week, Mr Green, who is widely regarded as America's leading employer defence attorney in sexual harassment and discrimination cases, was in London to talk to UK companies about the rise in this type of lawsuit in the US and the risk this poses to UK businesses. He said the most obvious risk was to companies with operations in the US. His message to them was that their US investment would be imperilled by indifference to this problem and they should take action now, rather than waiting until they faced a lawsuit. His advice was the same as that to his US corporate clients: carry out an immediate risk assessment, look at the company's prior history of complaints, check grievance procedures, and train your staff. 'The aim is to have employees know enough to expand their rights,' he said. But not too much - 'you don't want to create a flow of grievances and complaints'. The second group most at risk comprises UK subsidiaries of US companies. These companies need to be aware of the problem, because the US exercises jurisdiction in this area over a US-owned or controlled employer anywhere in the world. US-owned companies in the UK could find themselves facing lawsuits in the US from UK-based employees. There was a timely reminder of this in April, when three male foreign exchange dealers at the London branch of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, were forced to resign following complaints of sexual harassment from a female colleague. Mr Green also believes the UK could soon face a wave of its own sexual harassment cases. Although awards in the UK are unlikely to reach US levels - because juries do not decide damages except in libel cases, and punitive damages are not generally available - there are signs of an upsurge in sex-based employment actions. The UK Equal Opportunities Commission says the number of complaints of sexual harassment at work that it received last year rose by 58 per cent from 502 in 1992 to 793. In the first nine months of 1994 it had already received 552. Public awareness of the problem in the UK has increased through cases such as that brought by Samantha Phillips, an aviation insurance broker with Willis Corroon. In August she was awarded Pounds 18,000 damages by an industrial tribunal after claiming she was sacked because she spurned the advances of a senior manager. The biggest threat to UK companies from sexual harassment claims will come if the UK allows actions to be brought on behalf of a whole class, or group, of employees. In the US, Mr Green said, class actions in employment cases were well established. In April 1992, for instance, the Illinois-based State Farm Insurance Company settled a sex discrimination class action for Dollars 157m. In May 1993, in the first class action for sexual harassment, a Minnesota District Court found the Eveleth Taconite mining company guilty of sexual harassment for creating a hostile work environment for women. Damages are yet to be assessed. Class actions in this area are potentially devastating. In the US, a woman or a man who has been sexually harassed has the right to go to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which will investigate and prosecute the complaint free of charge. If the complainant is unhappy with the result, he or she is entitled to bring an action for damages before a civil jury. Under a new Federal statute, the damages for emotional distress and punitive damages recoverable by a plaintiff proving sexual harassment before a Federal jury are capped at Dollars 300,000, although the cap does not extend to damages for lost prior or future earnings. In a single action, this law would be of benefit to employers, but in a class action the picture is different. One employee can claim not just on his or her own behalf but theoretically on behalf of all members of the class - which could mean every woman who works for, or has worked for, an employer. With each member of a successful Federal class action entitled to recover up to Dollars 300,000, the potential threat of such a case to a company's finances is enormous. Under state law, however, things are even worse. No state has a cap on damages for emotional distress and only a handful, such as New York State, has a cap on punitive damages. Ms Weeks was able to recover Dollars 7.2m because she brought her case under California state law. 'One large class action under state law could wipe out a corporation,' Mr Green said. Where companies have offices in several states, there is also a potential for forum shopping. Complainants could choose to bring a sexual harassment class action in a state such as Florida, Michigan or California, which traditionally produce the highest jury awards. Mr Green earned his reputation as an employers' defence attorney through tough cross-examination of claimants on their past sexual behaviour and personal history. However, that hard-nosed approach is under threat from new federal laws, extending the shield given to rape victims to plaintiffs in sexual harassment cases. The new law prohibits indiscriminate use of a plaintiff's sex history. Mr Green said this would make it more difficult for employers to disprove plaintiffs' claims that sexual advances were unwelcome and unprovoked. 'You win these cases by destroying the credibility of the accuser,' he said. Such cases look like becoming harder for employers to win. Companies doing business in the US have been warned.</p>

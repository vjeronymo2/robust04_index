			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Cambodia fighting erupts again: Government attacks against Khmer Rouge inflict further damage on UN credibility CAMBODIAN government forces have launched an offensive against Khmer Rouge guerrillas on several fronts in the worst fighting since the United Nations peacekeeping mission was established a year ago. The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) yesterday announced a catalogue of ceasefire violations since Friday in five of the 11 military sectors into which the UN has divided the country, including exchanges of artillery and mortar fire. Although the ceasefire has been in tatters for months, and there were no immediate reports of heavy casualties, the offensive will inflict further damage on Untac's credibility as it attempts to prepare for elections in May. Untac officials said villagers in some areas had fled their homes and government troops had conscripted civilians and former refugees recently repatriated from Thailand. Some were reportedly being used as forced labour to carry ammunition, a practice previously associated with the Khmer Rouge and the military junta in Burma. The Khmer Rouge had almost from the start refused to co-operate with Untac, participate in elections or abide by the peace agreements it signed in 1991, forcing the UN to acknowledge that the existing administration of Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, had the right to defend itself. Yesterday, however, Untac said the latest government offensive could not be justified by concerns about security. Officials of the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government, many of them corrupt and unpopular, are worried about their likely performance in the elections and are probably mounting the offensive in an attempt to strengthen their grip on the countryside. This would give them a stronger hand in any negotiations to form a coalition after the elections. Khmer Rouge leaders are boycotting the polls but are banking on being included in a future administration by Cambodian politicians who will want to avoid the permanent partitioning of the country into Khmer Rouge and government zones. Among other attacks, government forces in the west have advanced to within 20km of Pailin, the Khmer Rouge headquarters near the border with Thailand. Further incidents were reported from a swathe of territory in the north and north-east of Cambodia. Troops of Funcinpec, the royalist party, were involved in at least one clash, but most of the fighting was between the government and the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge was blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians during its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978, when Vietnam invaded and installed a new, pro-Vietnamese communist government. UN military observers and electoral workers have often been impressed with the commitment and discipline of the Khmer Rouge troops they have encountered, and Untac officials have therefore been surprised by the success of recent government offensives. However, there have been signs of differences within Khmer Rouge ranks. Some Khmer Rouge guerrillas have registered to vote. According to a senior Untac officer, at least one Khmer Rouge commander refused to join in a previous battle for the defence of Pailin a few weeks ago.</p>

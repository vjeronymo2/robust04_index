			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Observer: Balanced Czechs Despite widespread opprobrium, European Community farmers still demur at reforming their inefficient farm sector. But Vladimir Dlouhy, economics minister of the Czech and Slovak Republic, is determined to learn from that mess of potage. 'We don't intend to repeat the same mistakes as the European Community in our farm sector,' says he. 'We don't want to see our farmers become a spoiled part of society. They must feel the iron fist of foreign competition. 'We were asked to reform our economy in 1989; we did it and we have borne the consequences. We have fulfilled the conditions imposed on us, and we expect more flexibility on the part of the EC.' Now, Dlouhy thinks, it's time for the community to fulfil its side of the bargain, and to take a ploughshare to tariff barriers blocking Czech and Slovak Republic exports into the EC. When a minister of a former socialist country starts dispensing lessons in simple market economics, the question has to be asked: Can Vladimir Dlouhy succeed where all others have failed?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Give away more  market share, stock ownership and short-term profits in return  for more technology, funds and efficiency -- these are the new  measures taken by the local Guangzhou Government to promote  foreign trade and utilization of overseas investment.    The measures have brought initial success.    Economic development in Guangzhou, capital of South China's  Guangdong Province, has enjoyed a good start this year, as  reflected by the economic figures of the first quarter.    This information was released today by the foreign trade and  economic cooperation committee of Guangzhou city.    The new series of reforms in the tax system, foreign  currency, banking and foreign trade introduced nationwide this  year by the Chinese Government has allowed more margin for the  development of Guangzhou, a city already boasting the most brisk  and prosperous economic activities of the country.    During the first quarter this year, 699 contracts for  foreign  investment were signed and actually-utilized overseas capital  totalled 489 million U.S. dollars, with a growth of 80.8 percent  over the same period last year.    The city has earned 820 million U.S. dollars in exports  during the first three months, up 23 percent over the same  period in 1993.    This has been stimulated by the abolition of the dual  exchange rates and the previous rules that foreign currency  earned had to be turned over to the government.    To further expand exports, Guangzhou has set up three  overseas enterprises and will establish commercial centers soon  in New York, Sydney and Moscow.    According to Wang Deye, director of the Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Committee, Guangzhou has further relaxed  limits on some high-tech enterprises and old enterprises in  urgent need of technological renovation in absorbing foreign  funds.    By the end of last month, projects involving overseas  capital  higher than five million U.S. dollars each had totalled 134,  covering fields like industrial processing, transport, real  estate, tourism and service industry.    The number of countries and regions that have directly  opened  enterprises in Guangzhou increased from 12 to 19 in the first  quarter as against the same period of last year.    Investments in the city totalling more than 20 million U.S.  dollars have come from each of the following: Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Britain and the United States.    Israel, Germany and Finland have also expressed intentions  to  invest or expand cooperation.</p>

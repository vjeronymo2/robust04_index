			<p>BFN     [Text] The blockading of roads on 28 April has had very  little effect on everyday life. The Campesino Confederation of  Bolivia issued a communique calling on brother campesinos to  remain calm, adding that it remains expectant and hopes that the  government will satisfy the needs of the campesino sector.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The blockading of  roads is going ahead as scheduled, but in a minimal way. Here  we have video of the events that took place. At the national  level [words indistinct] and we have strict control by the  police and the Armed Forces. Trucks coming from La Paz were  able to circulate normally [words indistinct]    [Unidentified teacher] We are rural teachers and we have  given all our support to our campesino comrades who have today  called for the blockading of roads at the national level.  Therefore, we are supporting them.

[San Martin] In the locality of [name indistinct] in Tarija  Department, we lament the death last night of a little [age  indistinct] year old girl. This is very regrettable. She was  in one of the trucks that were blockaded and regretfully this  little girl died from the cold.

He stressed that the  police control will continue because the pressure being applied  by the COB continues. This is in strict compliance with the  Constitution.

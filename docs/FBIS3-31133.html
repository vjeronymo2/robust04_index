The major part of the  discussions was devoted to an exchange of opinions about the  current situation in former Yugoslavia and to ways and means to  overcome the Bosnian crisis, bearing in mind the recent NATO  decision and ways to encourage the achievement of a peace  accord, which is the priority at this stage, Presidency  Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu told the media.    In this context, President Ion Iliescu greeted the first  step  toward the normalization of relations between Serbia and Croatia  as an important element in seeking a peaceful solution on the  territory of former Yugoslavia and expressed his readiness to  support the peace process in general, both within the Geneva  conference and through bilateral contacts with the other states  created on the territory of former Yugoslavia.    During the talks, the two sides also discussed bilateral  relations and the determination of the two states to develop  them. The exchange of opinion between the two presidents will  also continue during the official dinner that President Ion  Iliescu is to give in honor of the Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman.</p>

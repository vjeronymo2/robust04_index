			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Four ambitions and a European film studio: Raymond Snoddy on why PolyGram may be laughing all the way to the bank For a few hours on Wednesday evening London's Leicester Square could have passed for Los Angeles or New York on a big movie night. There were the slow procession of stretched limousines, the hundreds of fans behind barriers, and the stars bathed momentarily in flashlights for the UK premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral. An audience which has been longing for the revival of the British film industry was there to salute the success of a movie minnow, a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) romantic comedy shot in 36 days in Britain with the help of Channel Four finance. It has become the first British film for six years to take the number one spot at the US box office. With equally good results coming in from France and Australia, the film  - produced by Working Title, a subsidiary of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment - is beginning to look like a worldwide hit. Yet as Michael Kuhn, the London lawyer president of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, prepared for the premiere he was not donning the Union Jack or planning to claim another rebirth of the British film industry. That sort of thinking Mr Kuhn denounces as 'total crap'. For good measure he says those who seek subsidies for British films 'drive me nuts'. 'Four Weddings is a major movie success and what's 'British' got to do with it?' says 43-year-old Mr Kuhn, whose business is part of the PolyGram group, controlled by Philips of the Netherlands. 'This has been funded by the profits of 32 record companies around the world. That's what paid for this movie and its marketing. It's nothing to do with British. It's the entertainment business and it's ludicrous to keep talking about the British industry in this way,' he adds. Mr Kuhn has set himself the uniquely difficult task of building a European-based 'studio' - on a Hollywood scale but without walls. The studio simply exists as a collection of independent production companies either owned or controlled by PolyGram. Over the past three years with hardly any fuss PolyGram has got on with making films - 29 so far with eight more in various stages of production. No less than Dollars 8m out of a total marketing budget of Dollars 15m for the film - PolyGram's first unambiguous success - was spent in Los Angeles and New York on an intensive advertising campaign for the launch at five cinemas. Average revenues were Dollars 27,000 per screen on the first weekend - the sort of figures that could be used to persuade exhibitors to show the quirky sort of film that rarely makes it to mid-West cinemas. But make it it did, and by the time of the London premiere Four Weddings had taken Dollars 31m at the box office. Mr Kuhn believes Dollars 50m gross could be earned from North America and a similar amount from the rest of the world. That is only a small proportion of the film's financial potential. The typical film earns about a fifth of its revenues at the cinema box office, video 50 per cent, television 20 per cent and other areas of exploitation 10 per cent. 'We need just one more film not dissimilar to Four Weddings and then on a project basis - forget the overheads - these two would have recouped the losses on all the movies we have made to date,' he says. Others have done reasonably well - Backbeat, the PolyGram film about the man who walked away from the Beatles will certainly get its money back. And with others the risk is minimised. The actual cost of the film is covered by selling rights in advance and usually only the marketing costs are at risk. But film history suggests that when Europeans try to challenge Hollywood the moment of success is the moment of maximum danger. Revolution was the expensive flop that did for Goldcrest in the wake of its association with successes such as Chariots of Fire. Raise the Titanic scuppered Lord Lew Grade's film ambitions. 'It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic,' Grade cracked at the time. Mr Kuhn says he has taken a step-by-step approach in putting in place the building blocks of a studio, without property but combining the essential components of production and distribution. 'By 1996 or 1997 if God is in his heaven and smiling on us we will be the only European-based studio. The only and unique case of a (European) film company with its own distribution.' By 1996 he hopes to be producing 15 to 20 feature films a year. Because the company is taking on a larger number of more ambitious pictures and handling more of the distribution itself, Mr Kuhn will later this year have to go back to his board to ask for more backing. The original deal, designed to take PolyGram into the mainstream movie business, announced in 1991, involved an initial investment of around Dollars 200m over three years. That may have to rise to Dollars 400m compared with the Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn of working capital needed by an orthodox major studio. 'Once we emerge from the chrysalis, suddenly you will see, I hope you will see anyway, a significant increase in shareholder value. This is no longer a record company. This is an entertainment company,' says Mr Kuhn. He had to edge into film production through music videos and later music films after a disastrous previous attempt to take on Hollywood with PolyGram Pictures. Combined with the 1979-81 recession in the record business, 'PolyGram was bust,' he says. He had four ambitions: he tackled production first through the acquisition of stakes in independents rather than spending billions of dollars buying an established studio. So PolyGram acquired or took large stakes in independents such as Working Title (My Beautiful Laundrette), Propaganda Films (Wild at Heart) and Interscope (Three Men and a Baby) - the last, a Dollars 35m deal, came with 75 projects in development. The second ambition was to add video distribution to the group's existing international record distribution network. The third was to set up Gramercy as its North American distribution company for smaller films - big pictures in the US still go through traditional distribution channels. Kuhn's fourth ambition is to acquire a major film catalogue to smooth out the troughs in film distribution. As Four Weddings and a Funeral opens in the UK, he is very enthusiastic about a new PolyGram film, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, about three transvestites travelling across Australia to perform at Alice Springs. And that only cost Dollars 2m to make.</p>

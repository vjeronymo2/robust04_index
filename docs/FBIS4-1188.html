			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Neil Lewis] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- Violence erupted in  the KwaZulu capital of Ulundi, where the headquarters of the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] are sited, on Saturday [23 April],  with reports saying at least two people were killed, several  others injured and vehicles torched in clashes between IFP and  African National Congress supporters.    A KwaZulu Police official in Ulundi confirmed the fighting.  "Our men rushed to the scene of the fighting in Ulundi, but we  don't have exact figures on the number of dead or injured. A  senior official is coming here to deal with the media," he said  from the KwaZulu Police pro [as received] headquarters in Ulundi.    Both IFP and ANC officials confirmed the clashes, but  differed in their versions of events. Earlier, IFP President  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State  election roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi, leaving  hundreds of supporters waiting at a rally in Welkom.    KwaZulu government Durban representative Rev Jabulani  Mdlalose said the chief minister had been "summoned" back to  Ulundi.    In its version of events, the IFP said an ANC convoy was  distributing pamphlets in downtown Ulundi and reportedly abused  residents who did not want to accept the documents. "An  altercation developed and ANC members opened fire on a group of  residents. At this time the full extent of casualties is not  known, however at least one resident, Siphiwe Ngcobo, was  seriously wounded by ANC gunfire.    "It has been reported that two ANC vehicles were then set on  fire by angry residents," the IFP said.    The incident, the IFP said, took place along the King  Dinizulu Highway in Ulundi.    The ANC in Johannesburg said it had received reports that  two  people may have died in the clashes.    A Constable Vilikazi at the Ulundi police station confirmed  that ANC canvassers were by 6.25PM still holed up in the  station, where they were seeking sanctuary. Saying further  details would be available from the KwaZulu Police pro, he added  the ANC canvassers were being protected by the policemen there.    "It is too sensitive, we are trying to save them. We are not  allowed to say how many people are here. We are getting the  right people to speak to you," he said, refusing to give his  full name.    ANC media spokesperson Carl Niehaus confirmed his  organisation had received reports of fighting in Ulundi. "We  demand an immediate response from the police and officials  regulating the state of emergency in Natal on events today. We  call on all parties to condemn all attacks and expose those  preventing free and fair electioneering."</p>

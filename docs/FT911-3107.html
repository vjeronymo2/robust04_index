			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Seeds of hope for a troubled industry: Five years after Chernobyl, the outlook for Europe's nuclear energy sector Five years after the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster in the Soviet Union, nuclear power remains the controversial fuel par excellence. Ask a nuclear expert like Mr Jean-Claude Charrault, head of the nuclear division at the European Commission, about the future and the prospects appear rosy: 'Nuclear energy is beginning a new phase . . . For the next century, the nuclear option will remain impossible to do without.' But ask an equally informed commentator like Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear expert at Sussex University's science policy research unit, and the emphasis is different: 'With existing technologies, nuclear power is already on a path of slow, but inexorable decline. World capacity is at or very near a peak it may never exceed.' A similar polarisation of views occurs whenever two or more nuclear pundits are gathered together. Over the past year, however, there has been one change: nuclear enthusiasts say they detect the first tentative signs of a revival, particularly in Europe, as memories of Chernobyl fade. On the face of it, the evidence to support this claim is thin. Nuclear power station construction remains at a very low ebb. Only two new nuclear plants began operating in Europe last year, Penly in France and Neckarwestheim, the last remaining order in Germany. France and the UK are alone in western Europe in having nuclear stations under construction. Yet some recent developments have given hope to the still powerful nuclear lobby. Sweden, boasting the world's largest nuclear power output per head, has reversed the decision made in 1988 to begin phasing out nuclear power from 1995. Facing the prospect of an energy shortfall, many observers now expect Sweden's 12 nuclear power plants to complete their natural lives. In a referendum last September, 53 per cent of Swiss voters opposed the abandonment of nuclear power, though an almost equal number supported a 10-year moratorium on licensing new facilities. The industry also hopes that the government elected in Finland in March will give the go-ahead for a fifth nuclear reactor. It detects signs of a re-think among politicians in Italy, where there has been a moratorium on nuclear power since a referendum in 1987. More important still are indications that east European countries will not abandon nuclear power, despite Chernobyl. Political liberalisation has, however, led to a re-appraisal of the Soviet-designed reactors, many of which fell far short of western standards. The five nuclear stations operating at the start of 1990 in east Germany, for instance, were all closed down for safety reasons. But east Europe has an equally pressing environmental problem - its over-reliance on hugely polluting coal-fired stations. Some countries may plump for nuclear reactors designed to western standards as a partial solution. Czechoslovakia has signed separate agreements with the French and with Westinghouse of the US, both aimed at developing its nuclear industry, which accounts for 28 per cent of its electricity generation. Bayenwerk, Pressenelektra and RWE, the three main German utilities, have plans to build modern nuclear reactors at the east German sites of Greifswald and Stendal, which housed Soviet-designed plant. If these are the seeds of hope for the industry, there is still plenty to worry about. Six smaller European countries - Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Norway and Portugal - have no nuclear power and show no signs of wanting it. Attempts to expand the industry in Spain have run into the brick wall of socialist government disapproval and public distrust following a serious fire at the Vandellos reactor in 1989. Environmental opponents are still active, notably in Germany, where some nuclear stations have been shut down following successful challenges to their operating licences in the courts. In all the struggles between the industry and its opponents, three issues tend to dominate: Political support. Some governments in western Europe are trying to rebuild public confidence in nuclear power. One example was a strongly worded statement backing nuclear's revival issued last month by Belgium, Britain, France and Germany. UK ministers regularly stress their backing for a continued nuclear programme, even though they are committed to a neutral review of the industry in 1994, the scheduled completion date for the Sizewell nuclear station. The next general election is perhaps the most important factor, since the Labour party opposes more stations after Sizewell. Environmentalists believe the industry and its government supporters are fooling themselves when they detect the beginnings of a public groundswell behind nuclear power again. 'They are under-estimating, one, the public sentiment against nuclear power and, two, the degree to which the organisation of the environmental movement has improved incredibly in the last few years,' says Mr John Willis, nuclear power co-ordinator at Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International. Environment. In a neat reversal of roles, the nuclear industry is on the side of the angels on one environmental issue. Unlike coal, oil and gas, nuclear power does not create carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 'The growing concern about environmental problems and the recommendations at national and international levels for limiting air-polluting emissions, bring rather strong prospects for a substantial increase in the production of electricity through nuclear power,' says the EC's Mr Charrault. The green groups are keen to kill this argument stone dead. They argue that the choice between carbon-emitting coal and nuclear power is a false one. There are other options, notably energy conservation. 'Nuclear is a silly option for dealing with the greenhouse effect,' says Mr Willis. 'Any sensible business person would go for the least cost option.' Costs. Two events have focused concern on the cost question. The first was Chernobyl itself, since it led governments and utilities to ponder the huge potential liabilities if a nuclear disaster occurred in a democratic country. The second was the UK government's botched attempt to privatise its nuclear industry. The cold eye turned by the financial community on nuclear's costs revealed as misleading its repeated claims to be supplying cheap power. Even Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear operator in England and Wales, now admits that power from Sizewell will cost 5.2p a unit (kilowatt/hour), compared with 2.9p from a new gas station. The nuclear industry believes smaller, better-designed reactors will cut costs and help to reassure the public on safety. The main manufacturers - Westinghouse of the US, a joint venture between Framatome of France and Siemens of Germany, Mitsubishi of Japan and Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group - are all working on innovative designs. But there is a problem: how to finance the multi-billion dollar cost of bringing these designs to full commercial development. The obvious answer - persuading the electricity utilities to place orders  - seems blocked. Nuclear generating capacity in western Europe tripled over the 1980s, largely thanks to orders placed in the 1970s. This bonanza is unlikely to repeat itself. Even nuclear enthusiasts acknowledge that prospects are dim in the US. France, arguably the world's most successful nuclear nation, has reached saturation point. Belgium is similarly placed. Some experts also say that no new orders are expected in west Germany for 10 years. This leaves Japan, where public opposition is growing; some newly industrialised countries such as South Korea; eastern Europe; and a few orders here and there in western European countries like the UK, Finland and the Netherlands, if political constraints can be overcome. Nukem, the nuclear consultancy subsidiary of Germany's RWE, forecasts that 12 new nuclear reactors may be ordered and operating in western Europe (including east Germany) by 2005. Even this, however, does not add up to a healthy diet for an industry with such a capacious financial appetite. Electricity utilities in much of the world face similar financial pressures to those in the US, where power companies are plumping for smaller, cheaper gas plants which do not bear the potential liabilities of a nuclear disaster. The nuclear lobby points out that some 100 European reactors will reach the end of their operating lives over the next 30 years. But to enjoy its share of the feast, this troubled industry will have to survive the next decade, when there is little reason to expect many of the new orders will be nuclear.

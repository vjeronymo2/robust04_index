			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Australia's prime minister, Paul  Keating, has raised concerns about Indonesia's clampdown on the  media in talks with President Suharto in Jakarta. During a  two-hour meeting at the presidential palace in Jakarta, Mr.  Keating repeated Australia's disappointment with last week's  closure of Indonesia's three leading weekly news magazines.  Michael Maher reports:    [Maher] In telling President Suharto that the Australian  government was disappointed with the media bans, Mr. Keating  pointed out that the magazine closures appeared to conflict with  the openness which has occurred in the Indonesian economy.  According to the Prime Minister, President Suharto took those  remarks seriously and then replied that the banned magazines had  put national unity and stability at risk. Mr. Keating said the  matter wasn't pursued further in a two-hour meeting which dealt  mainly with trade and issues related to the forthcoming  Asia-Pacific economic forum leaders' summit in Indonesia. While  demonstrators had threatened to stage more protests against the  media clampdown during Mr. Keating's stay, there was little sign  of such activity on the streets of the capital.    [Announcer] Up to 21 demonstrators arrested yesterday are to  appear today in the Central Jakarta District Court. They were  detained when riot police broke up a demonstration against the  banning of three Indonesian weekly magazines. A court official  says there will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators  who include the prominent poet Brendra. Indonesia's leading  human rights group, the Legal Aid Foundation, says the 21  demonstrators are considered to have committed minor offenses  under the law and could be dealt with summarily.</p>

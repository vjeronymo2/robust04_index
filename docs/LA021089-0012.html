			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROBBINS SEEKS NEW HEARING ON VAN NUYS AIRPORT PERMIT  </P> <P> State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) has asked Caltrans to reopen a hearing on a  vital state permit for Van Nuys Airport to investigate charges by an anti-noise  activist that Los Angeles city lawyers misled him into supporting the permit's  renewal.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office denies the charge.  </P> <P> Robbins sent a letter to the state Department of Transportation last month,  asking the agency to reopen the hearing into the city-owned airport's variance,  which allows the facility to operate without meeting state noise-control  limits. Like almost all major airports in the state, Van Nuys Airport could not  remain open without a variance because it is impossible to meet the law's noise  standards, airport officials said.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesmen said that the department has not decided what to do about  Robbins' request but that no such hearing has ever been reopened.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bad-Faith Accusation  </P> <P> Robbins acted after Don Schultz of Van Nuys, president of Ban Airport Noise,  accused the city attorney's office of acting in bad faith, misleading him  during negotiations for an agreement that cleared the way for the variance's  renewal.  </P> <P> Schultz has refused to sign his part of the agreement, leaving the issue  unsettled.  </P> <P> Schultz and leaders of other San Fernando Valley homeowner groups demanded a  public hearing on the variance in 1987, urging Caltrans to impose stricter  noise controls on the airport in exchange for the permit's renewal. The city  Department of Airports resisted.  </P> <P> But a state administrative law judge conducted a trial-like hearing at which  the city, Caltrans and the anti-noise forces led by Schultz presented  arguments. In July, the judge recommended to the head of Caltrans, which has  final authority on variances, that the variance be granted with 10  noise-fighting conditions attached.  </P> <P> One condition was an order to rezone a residential neighborhood south of the  airport, containing 26 homes and 151 apartments, to industrial and commercial  use. The aim was to bring the airport closer in compliance with the law  limiting airport noise in residential neighborhoods by eliminating the  residences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fight Promised  </P> <P> The city attorney's office, arguing that the state has no authority to mandate  changes in city zoning laws, asked Caltrans to reconsider the order and  promised to fight the issue in court if Caltrans persisted.  </P> <P> In August, Caltrans attorney Larry Thelen hammered out a compromise with the  Department of Airports. The airports department agreed to eliminate the mandate  on rezoning and also promised to "use its best efforts" to persuade city  officials to rezone the land.  </P> <P> Schultz, representing the "intervenors" who requested the hearing, in turn  agreed to the dropping of the judge's recommendation that the airport be  forbidden to take any action that could increase its "noise footprint," the  zone in which noise exceeds the limit for residential areas.  </P> <P> The alternative, Schultz said, was the prospect of a legal battle between the  city and the state that probably would have lasted five years or more, in which  time the variance would have been automatically extended without any of the  judge's noise-limiting recommendations in effect.  </P> <P> When the reworded agreement was sent to him for his signature, however, Schultz  refused to sign.  </P> <P> He charged that the city attorney's office had concealed knowledge that a  proposed office development at the airport by the Retlaw Corp. would increase  the "footprint." The development will include hangar space for up to seven  private jets.  </P> <P> Schultz maintained that the city attorney's office was guilty of bad faith for  not disclosing that information to him before he agreed to drop the provision  barring increases in the noise footprint. He would not have agreed to the  stipulated settlement if he had known, he said.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office, in a reply to Caltrans, said Schultz had taken part  in a number of debates on the Retlaw plan and was well-informed on the subject.  The city also argued that the anticipated noise from planes at the Retlaw  hangar will add only 3.3 acres to the 549-acre footprint, an increase of .6%,  which the city calls insignificant.  </P> <P> Caltrans now has several choices, said Thelen, the Caltrans' attorney:  </P> <P> "We could honor the city's request for reconsideration of our July order, or we  could go ahead and amend the order in accordance with the stipulation on the  grounds that we don't agree with Mr. Schultz that he was fraudulently induced,  or we could decide that the facts are sufficiently in doubt that we could go  along with Sen. Robbins' request for a hearing."  </P></p>

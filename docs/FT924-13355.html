			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / German immigration vote fails Opposition Social Democrats in the German parliament remain in their seats, boycotting a vote yesterday on changing the constitution to stop the flood of foreign refugees, Reuter reports from Bonn. As a result, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was denied the necessary two-thirds majority and the motion failed. The SPD had wanted the debate postponed until after it holds a special party congress on the issue next month.</p>

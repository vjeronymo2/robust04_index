			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because operation of Libby Dam is considered part of the Coordinated Columbia River System, BPA is also involved in the management of Kootenai River operations. The Coordinated Columbia River System refers to all projects operated under at least three authorities: The Columbia River Treaty, the Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement, and Federal flood control statutes. The Columbia River Treaty of 1961 between Canada and the United States provided for the building of four storage reservoirs including Libby Dam, in the upper Columbia River drainage, primarily for flood control and power production. The Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement, an intricate contract between the Corps, BPA, and Reclamation, calls for the planned operation to accommodate all of the authorized purposes of the Columbia River hydropower system. These authorized purposes include flood control, navigation, irrigation, and power production (System Operation Review Interagency Team 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The aforementioned treaty and contract, and various Federal flood control statutes, have established stringent planning and operation criteria for the Columbia River system. In addition, alternative operational scenarios for the 14 Federal hydro projects of the Coordinated Columbia River system are being developed and analyzed by the Systems Operations Review (SOR) program. The Resident Fish Technical Work Group of SOR is evaluating alternative operations at each of the Federal projects that address the needs of Kootenai River white sturgeon, and other resident fishes. At the time of this rule, the SOR is still undergoing NEPA review and analysis. Therefore, operational changes at Libby Dam to benefit white sturgeon and other resident fish in the Kootenai River basin resulting from the SOR process are not likely to be implemented any time soon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service joined efforts in June 1992 with IDFG, MDFWP, the Corps, the Kootenai Tribe, and other U.S. and Canadian regional agencies to form a Kootenai River White Sturgeon Technical Committee (Committee). The goal of the Committee was to identify factors affecting Kootenai River white sturgeon and develop a regional, prelisting recovery strategy that would form the basis of a Conservation Agreement (CA) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Service and the various agencies. The Service noted the MOA would need to include measures to remove threats to the sturgeon and include long-term provisions to modify flows in the Kootenai River below Libby Dam that would result in successful spawning and recruitment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on discussions and recommendations by some members of the Committee, the Service adopted an interim flow proposal as the basis of any prelisting CA or MOA. This alternative attempted to match flows of 1974, the last year of successful reproduction and measurable recruitment to the population, but reduced peak flows to 35,000 cfs (1,000 cms) to minimize flooding impacts and dike damage at Bonners Ferry and reduce nitrogen supersaturation effects below Libby Dam. The interim flow strategy specified that discharge from Libby Dam be regulated so that river flows through the suspected spawning reach near Bonners Ferry stay at the 35,000 cfs (1,000 cms) discharge throughout the white sturgeon spawning, egg incubation, and early rearing period. The flow strategy also contained provisions to eliminate peak-loading during the enhanced flow period. Prior to publication of the proposed rule (58 FR 36379), the Service was unable to successfully negotiate a CA to implement the interim flow proposal developed by the Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partially as an outcome of the Committee discussions, the Corps and BPA provided 400,000 acre-feet of water from Lake Koocanusa as a test flow to stimulate white sturgeon spawning in 1993. The water was initially stored to provide flows for federally listed salmon in the lower Columbia River. However, the water was shaped and released in a manner to provide a test for white sturgeon. This water was released from Libby Dam between May 28 and June 16 to elevate Kootenai River flows at Bonners Ferry to approximately 20,000 cfs (566 cms), to provide information about sturgeon spawning activity at that flow (BPA 1993). BPA acknowledges that the duration of the 1993 test flow ``*&blank;*&blank;* was probably not sufficient to allow all white sturgeon an opportunity to spawn.'' Intensive egg sampling and monitoring by the IDFG and Kootenai Tribe of Idaho during and following the test flow period collected three sturgeon eggs, presumably spawned by at least two female sturgeon. Based on monitoring results from the 1991 and 1993 spawning test flow, the Corps and BPA have suggested that white sturgeon will successfully spawn at flow levels lower than the `shaped' 35,000 cfs peak flows some members of the Committee, including the Service, believe are needed to maximize sturgeon reproduction opportunities (BPA 1993; Corps 1993). Subsequently, these agencies have proposed an alternate flow strategy to provide for ``*&blank;*&blank;* maximum spawning opportunity'' in 3 out of 10 years starting in 1994 based on research to date and dependent upon flow forecasts and water availability. General provisions are as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In May, release flows to maintain 15,000 cubic feet per second at Bonners Ferry, Idaho, as local inflow subsides. Increase flows to 20,000 cubic feet per second at Bonners Ferry beginning at the time when water temperatures there have reached 12&hyph;13 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C, and maintain for 25 days for sturgeon spawning. Commencement of 20,000 cubic feet per second flows would generally occur in early June. Flows would be reduced over 3 days to 11,000 cubic feet per second at Bonners Ferry and maintained for 28 days. Load following would be eliminated during May through July in years that proposed sturgeon flows are attempted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service considers the proposal an acknowledgement by the water management agencies that flows are indeed an important component affecting sturgeon recruitment and is encouraged that the effects of flow stability, i.e., duration of and load-factoring, on sturgeon reproductive success are addressed in the flow proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Service believes the proposed action is deficient in at least four areas: (1) The flow proposal is not based on empirical evidence or data to support the conclusion that sturgeon spawning opportunity will be maximized throughout the potential reproductive season; (2) there is no agency commitment to initiate proposed sturgeon flows early in the 10 year cycle. For example, the flow proposal as currently worded would allow enhanced flows to start in year 7 or 8; (3) providing sturgeon flows each year is solely dependent upon ``above average'' water availability and will not reduce refill in Lake Koocanusa; and (4) there are no provisions to adjust flows or modify operations in future years if monitoring demonstrates a need for additional flows for white sturgeon recruitment. Additionally, the question whether successful natural recruitment 3 out of 10 years is sufficient to maintain this population still needs to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the BPA and the Corps have committed to only providing experimental flows for white sturgeon in some years with several qualifying conditions. They have not yet committed to implement long-term conservation measures on Libby Dam operations for non-hydropower purposes, specifically to protect and enhance recruitment opportunities for white sturgeon in the Kootenai River basin. Additionally, BPA has previously stated that additional conservation measures to benefit sturgeon would be available if the species were listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

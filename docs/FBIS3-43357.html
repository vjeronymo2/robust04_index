			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The resumption of the Angolan peace talks due in  Lusaka this afternoon has been overshadowed by inauspicious  events back in Angola. Four American congressmen were flying to  the city of Malanje on a fact-finding visit. They never made it.  The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  rebels launched a bombardment of the city and the plane carrying  the Americans turned back. So did the United Nations plane in  which our correspondent Chris Simpson was travelling. He is now  back in Luanda and sent this report.    Flagelamentos [shellings] is what we heard over the radio as  our plane was 30 minutes away from Malanje. It is a word you  hear a lot in Angola. Loosely translated, it means attacks or  bombardments. Confirmation rapidly came that UNITA had indeed  been shelling Malanje and the four U.S. congressmen and [words  indistinct] in the other plane had been turned back for security  reasons. Malanje was, at least temporarily, off limits, just as  it was for weeks on end last year when the city starved for lack  of food aid. At least it is never dull here, an aid official  [word indistinct] observed, amid a series of urgent radio  messages.    The World Food Program, which is currently sending eight  planes a day to Malanje, put its Malange operations on a standby  and the congressmen's itinerary was rapidly rearranged. Angolan  national radio later claimed that UNITA had been shelling  persistently since the early hours of the morning, causing at  least (?two deaths).    Why now, why today, of all days, when the peace talks are  back on? These were the questions everyone was asking. It  remains to be seen whether UNITA will have any answers to offer.  Jonas Savimbi's movement might argue, however, that all  publicity is good publicity and that having been left off the  visiting congressmen's itinerary, it was only fair that UNITA be  allowed to spoil the rest of the program.</p>

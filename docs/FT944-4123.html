			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: CS Holding proposes single class share plan CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has proposed creating a single class share structure, converting its bearer shares into registered shares and eliminating all voting restrictions. The move follows the controversial unification plan adopted at Union Bank of Switzerland last month. But the form of the CS proposal is embarrassing and potentially damaging for UBS because it provides for the registered shareholders to vote separately on the removal of their extra voting power. The UBS plan is being contested in the courts partly because the bank did not allow its registered shareholders to vote separately. The bank's directors claimed there was no legal requirement for a separate vote, even though several precedents exist. The UBS registered shares trade at a substantial effective premium to the bearer shares. But the bank offered no compensation for the loss of that premium. Thus, it was highly likely that a meeting of registered shareholders would have rejected the plan. In the CS case, the registered shares trade at a slight effective discount to the bearer shares so there is unlikely to be any resistance to the conversion. The proposal calls for the bearers, which have a par value of SFr100, to be split five-for-one and then exchanged one-for-one for the SFr20 nominal registered shares. The registered shares closed at SFr105 yesterday, the bearers at SFr528. The CS plan, which will be put at the annual meeting in May, also differs from the UBS scheme in retaining the registered share. 'A registered approach will enable easier and direct communication between CS Holding and its shareholders and be consistent with the principle that a modern corporation should know its shareholders,' the group said.</p>

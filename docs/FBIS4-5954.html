Also attending the meeting were the members of the  congratulatory group of Koreans from Japan led by Yi Chin-kyu,  first vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon),  which is visiting the homeland to participate in the April 15  celebrations, and other congratulatory groups, delegations and  visiting groups of Koreans overseas from different regions of  the world, Choe Hong-hui, president of the International  Taekwon-do Federation, and other Koreans overseas.    Premier Kang Song-san made a report at the meeting.    He said the Korean people in the North and the South and  abroad and the world's revolutionary people are significantly  celebrating the birthday of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  as a great auspicious fete of the nation and as a common  revolutionary holiday of mankind.    The whole course of the revolutionary activities of Comrade  Kim Il-song is shining brilliantly as decades of tremendous  struggle and creation in which he has devoted his all to the  national liberation and prosperity and to the people's freedom  and happiness, the reporter said, and went on:    Comrade Kim Il-song is an unexcelled great man and an elder  in the world revolution who has brought about a fundamental  change in the destiny of our nation and made immortal  contributions to the human cause of independence, the cause of  socialism, covering the whole course of his life with the 20th  century which witnessed a new epoch in the history of the  struggle for human liberation and great changes on the world  political map. Human history records many high-reputed leaders  of the working class, but it knows no such a leader as respected  Comrade Kim Il-song who has adorned the most profound, diverse  and long annals of heroic epic with the greatness of his  leadership and the rich content of his exploits in triumphantly  paving the path of the revolution through raging storms and with  his influence on the times and the development of history.    Comrade Kim Il-song is the great leader of the working class  and other working masses with extraordinary ideological and  theoretical wisdom, leadership ability and virtues.    He is a great master of thought and theory who founded the  chuche idea reflecting the demand of our era, the era of  independence, indicated the path of the Korean revolution and  provided the working class and other working masses with an  invincible weapon for freedom, liberation and socialism.    Basing himself on the chuche idea, he propounded theories,  strategy and tactics for all stages and fields of the revolution  to realise the independence of the popular masses and  systematized the leadership method to guide the people's cause  of independence to victory, thus developing the revolutionary  thought of the working class to a new, higher stage.    He is a great statesman and a genius of creation and  construction. With an unexcelled clairvoyance, scientific  penetration, iron will and rare leadership ability, he trained  the Korean people into a revolutionary people with a strong  sense of independence through the application of the chuche idea  and victoriously led the difficult and arduous Korean revolution  in reliance on the inexhaustible strength of the people and  built a powerful country of chuche, an impregnable fortress of  socialism, in the East of the world.    He wisely guided the work to strengthen the driving force of  our revolution and enhance its role, pushing through manifold  trials and crossing the deathline and thus liberated the lost  country, founded the Workers' Party of Korea, a new type party,  and consolidated it into a steel- like party.    He made much effort to firmly equip our people with a  revolutionary idea of independence and train them into an  invincible combat unit harmoniously united with the party by  giving definite precedence to the ideological revolution and  consolidated the driving force of our revolution into an  unbreakable socio-political organism.    His clairvoyance finds expression in that he perfectly  prepared the inheritance of the revolutionary cause as required  by our revolution and people's desire from long ago with an  insight into its historical necessity and gave guidance in  firmly establishing the organisational and ideological basis and  leadership system of the party to carry forward the  revolutionary cause of chuche to a brilliant completion through  generations.    In Korea today, the invincible Workers' Party of Korea  firmly  stands in the centre of the revolutionary ranks, and the popular  masses, who have withstood all trials, sharing their destiny  with the party in the protracted course of revolutionary  struggle, are unreservedly displaying their creative ingenuity  in the revolution and construction, united around the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in one mind, upholding the noble  intentions of the great leader with loyalty.    The whole party, the entire army and all the people has  formed a mighty driving force to successfully carry forward the  revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment through  generations, firmly united around the dear leader in one idea  and purpose on the basis of revolutionary obligation and noble  comradeship. This shines as the most precious feat which will  remain recorded forever, which Comrade Kim Il-song has performed  for the party, the revolution and the people, putting forth all  his energy till this day.    Comrade Kim Il-song has resolved all the problems  independently and creatively in conformity with the specific  conditions of our country from the chuche-based stand in the  whole period of his revolutionary activities, carried out the  anti- imperialist, anti-feudal democratic revolution and the  socialist revolution successfully and in a unique way and  accelerated socialist construction to perform feats for the  century in building socialism of chuche on this land where  independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in national  defence have been definitely realized.    Noting that he is a tender-hearted father with a noble  virtue  of holding the people dearest, the reporter said: The idea  "believing in the people as in heaven" is the great ideological  source of popular politics which he has applied consistently as  the maxim of his life.    The feats performed by Comrade Kim Il-song in leading the  revolutionary struggle and constructive work of our people along  an ever-victorious road are a most precious revolutionary wealth  which is of immortal significance in the revolutionary cause of  the working class and other popular masses for independence.  They will shine forever along with the onward movement of  history and the revolutionary cause of our party and people  advancing under his guidance will be always invincible.    The whole party and the entire people should hold tighter  the  socialist banner of chuche, upholding the leadership of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order to defend the socialist  cause from the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the  imperialists and reactionaries and further develop it.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said:    "The whole party and the entire people must fully support  the  leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il to defend our socialism  centred on the popular masses and successfully accomplish the  revolutionary cause of chuche. Herein lies the firm guarantee  for carrying forward the socialist cause to accomplishment."    In order to firmly defend and accomplish the socialist cause  of chuche started by Comrade Kim Il-song and promote the  reunification of the country, big efforts must be continuously  directed to the strengthening of the singlehearted unity of the  party and the revolutionary ranks around the leader and  uninterrupted innovations be effected in socialist construction,  the reporter said.    Noting that the United States and its followers, the South  Korean authorities, are rushing headlong along the road of  confrontation and division and bringing the situation in Korea  again to the perilous brink of war, committing all manner of  perfidious acts, the reporter said: This only reveals their  vulnerability.    He further said:    We do not like empty words.    The entire people and officers and men of the People's Army  will maintain a more mobilized and strained posture than ever  before in face of the prevailing situation and, if the enemy  unleash a reckless war of aggression, ignoring our patient  peaceloving efforts, the army and people will unite in one body  and mete out a stern punishment to the enemy and resolutely  defend our socialist motherland and the sovereignty of the  nation under the ever- victorious leadership of the supreme  commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces Comrade Kim Chong-il  so that it could not tread on an inch of our land and a blade of  grass.    Then a speech was made by the head of the congratulatory  group of Koreans from Japan visiting the homeland to celebrate  April 15.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABB in takeover ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, is taking over control of ACC-Babcock, a loss-making boilermaker in India, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. ACC-Babcock has been managed by an Indian government agency for some time because its private sector shareholders did not consider it viable. Associated Cement, India's leading cement maker, has a 28 per cent stake and Babcock of the UK has 11 per cent. According to Indian news agencies, ABB will pay Rs520m (Dollars 16.5m) for a 76 per cent stake in the company. The idea would be to integrate it with other ABB subsidiaries in India to bid for turnkey power plant contracts. ABB said that it would be making an announcement today. According to the Indian reports, the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the government agency that nurses ailing companies, had approved the takeover.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides an expeditious procedure for the investigation and payment of claims (regardless of the amount claimed) that may be without extensive investigation. If it appears that a claim should be denied or cannot be settled within the limits specified in this section, it will be fully investigated under normal procedures. The use of small claims procedures is not mandatory; however, these procedures should be used whenever considered appropriate in the judgment of the claims approval or settlement authority, as considerable processing time and expense is usually saved thereby. If a fully investigated claim is received by an approval or settlement authority, which in his or her opinion could properly have been processed under small claims procedures, the claim will be settled in accordance with normal procedures. Appropriate corrective action will be taken to ensure the use of small claims procedures in similar future cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.39  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The investigation will be made so as to develop most expeditiously the facts necessary to determine whether the claim is meritorious and in what amount. The evidence required may be obtained by telephone, from incident reports, and other forms of hearsay evidence. Written statements of witnesses, written estimates of repairs, and the like are not required. The approving authority must be convinced and state on DA Form 1668 that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The United States is liable for the damage or injury incurred. (b) The claimant is a proper claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The amount approved, as claimed or agreed upon, is reasonably substantiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.40  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Report of investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When it appears that a small claim may arise, the report of investigation will be prepared on DA Form 1668. The investigator will append a brief summary of the evidence developed. The summary may be used as a basis for completion of the investigation after a claim has been filed. This report is exempted from control in accordance with AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 7&hyph;2t.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.41  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If the amount claimed under chapter 11 is not more than $1,000, or in the case of a tort claim is not more than $2500, and is considered meritorious in full, the claims JA/attorney will complete DD Form 1842 or DA Form 1668 and pay the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A claim under subpart K is meritorious in an amount of $1,000 or less, or if a tort claim is meritorious in the amount of $2500 or less, the claim JA/attorney may settle the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) After coordination with the responsible approving or settlement authority, unit claims officers may be authorized to attempt to procure a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement is obtained, the claims officer will complete the small claims certificate for amount of recommended payment and transmit it, in triplicate, with the claim and settlement agreement, to the approval or settlement authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If a claimant refuses to accept a sum offered under this section or if it appears that a claim should be disapproved, the small claims procedures will not be employed; the claim will be fully investigated and processed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Nonappropriated fund claims will be forwarded by the approval or settlement authority for payment as prescribed in subpart L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Claims under chapter 11. DA Form 1668 will not be employed in the settlement of small claims under chapter 11. Such a claim will be submitted on DD Form 1842. Procedures in subpart K will be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.42  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a claimant is available and agrees to accept a sum less than originally claimed, he or she will be requested to sign, in ink, a statement to that effect on any open space on each copy of the claim form (SF 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death)). If not readily available, the claimant will be requested to sign and return in triplicate a DA Form 1666 or Standard Form 1145, which will be attached to the claim form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.43  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If a small claim is payable under any chapter except subparts G and I, the approval or settlement authority will allow the procedures of either &sect;536.35(a) and &sect;536.35(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) [Reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Except for claims cognizable under subpart K and personnel claims cognizable under subpart L an approval authority who has been appointed an agent officer under AR 37&hyph;103, chapter 15, may pay the claim, and will require the claimant to sign, in triplicate, a receipt in the following language:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Date) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I hereby acknowledge receipt of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in full satisfaction and final settlement of the within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Signature) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Name printed) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) This above receipt may be printed, stamped, typed, or written in ink in any available space on the front or back of the signed claim form.

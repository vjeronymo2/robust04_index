			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Madras, May 7.    `Believe us; we will not betray your trust' -- with this  slogan Mr. V. Gopalsami launched his election campaign at  Mylapore on Friday night in support of his party, the  Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) candidate, Mr.  (Kalaipuli) S. Dhanu.    Only 12 hours earlier, the name and the design of his party  flag were finalised and announced marking his group's complete  break with the parent organisation, the DMK which once held him  out as its `battle sword'.    Mr. Gopalsami began his speech well after midnight and kept  his sway over the audience till the end. The late C.N. Annadurai  was sought to be projected at the venue of the meeting through  an illuminated cutout and a huge painting which formed the  backdrop at the dais.    While his attack on the AIADMK was sharp and forthright, his  snide remarks on the DMK drew cheers from the crowd.    Mr. Gopalsami relied on the record of his group's conduct in  politics in the last six months since its exit from the DMK to  make that appeal to the electorate of Mylapore. `People should  realise that Tamil Nadu now needs a disciplined force like  ours', he said and shared his perception that the electoral  verdict in Mylapore and Perundurai would decide the future of  the State.    That he was keen to woo all segments of society was evident  from the way he began his speech. He recalled the great people  in the different sects who had made Mylapore proud and said he  had come to the same place to seek the support of the people.    He branded the AIADMK Government under Ms. Jayalalitha as  the  most corrupt in the whole country. `We don't want gun culture;  we don't also want suitcase culture,' he said.    The sizeable Brahmin population in the constituency appeared  to have weighed with some of the speakers.    Mr. L. Ganesan, the theoretician for the MDMK said the word  `Marumalarchi' (renaissance) in the party's name did not mean  going back to the roots of the Dravidian movement and revive the  anti-Brahmin attitude. At one point of time a movement against  Brahmins was needed but now it was only against brahminism.  Brahminism need not be with Brahmins alone but could be found in  other sections of society also. The party was also not  irreligious.    The candidate Mr. Dhanu himself opened the speech by  reciting  Sanskrit slokas and a reference to his worshipping at the temple  before setting out to file his nomination. What, however, went  down well with the crowd was his offer of thanks to the 67  candidates who had arrayed themselves against him in the  election and his homage to late T.M. Rangarajan whose death in  an accident caused the bye-election.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 9m losses at Estates &amp; General Estates &amp; General, the property group, had a poor first half. It moved into a trading loss which was exacerbated by a significant write-down through pulling out of a development in Norwich. As a result it will not be paying the half yearly dividends on the two classes of cumulative preference shares, nor on the ordinary (1.225p last time). The loss for the half year ended June 30 worked through at Pounds 1.96m (profit Pounds 1.48m) and the write-off at Pounds 7.4m pushed the pre-tax deficit to Pounds 9.36m. Mr Peter Prowting, chairman, said the principal negative factor was the reduced level of sales activity from investment and trading stock. The profit on both showed a decline of Pounds 2.77m and Pounds 504,000 to Pounds 529,000 and Pounds 130,000 respectively. Gross investment rental income rose by 3 per cent over last year. Regarding the development of the Castle Mall Retail Centre at Norwich, Mr Prowting said it became clear that the ongoing commitment could not be met given the group's increasingly restricted financial position. Accordingly, the partners will take over the interest, although the group will still be involved as project managers. Mr Prowting said the bankers had agreed in principle to provide continuing support.</p>

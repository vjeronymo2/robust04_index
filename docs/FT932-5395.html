			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / US urges plan to prise open Japanese economy THE US will next week present Japan with a proposed framework for opening sectors of the Japanese economy to foreign exporters, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said in Paris yesterday. The US proposal will include a call for Japan to halve its current account surplus, from the present level of 3 per cent of gross national product to 1.5 per cent. The framework, intended to replace the Structural Impediments Initiative of 1989, will embrace sectors such as computers and supercomputers, cars and car parts, and financial services. 'In vital areas, Japan's economy is not open,' Mr Kantor said during ministerial talks of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 'It will be difficult to have substantial global growth, and to recover from recession among developed countries, unless something is done about this imbalance in trade,' Mr Kantor added. Japanese officials said 'managed trade' proposals would be rejected. In a six-point memo to the US, setting out the principles that would underly talks on the framework, they also said numerical targets, such as those suggested for cutting the current account surplus, were unacceptable. Japanese negotiators have said discussions on the framework could only occur if the US agreed not to threaten unilateral sanctions, but to settle any disagreements in international forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the OECD. 'Japanese representatives understand their responsibility in trying to provide leadership along with the US and the EC in promoting growth. In this context, they understand the importance of addressing the (trade imbalance) issue,' Mr Kantor said. Earlier, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, went further: 'Japan has both the means and the need to increase domestic demand and reduce its external surplus. The recent fiscal stimulus package is a useful step, but it needs to be sustained.' A senior Japanese trade official said in Paris: 'If the US sets aside the threat of using Section 301, and really wants to find a solution bilaterally, then we have no reason to reject it.' He said the idea of setting specific targets - like those setunder the US-Japan Semiconduc-tor agreement for foreign companies to win a 20 per cent share of the Japanese market - was not acceptable 'because it is not the Japanese government that conducts import business'. Mr Kantor also said the US 'was not pleased' with the EC decision to counter-retaliate in their dispute over access to the EC's telecommunications market. The EC foreign affairs council is expected next Tuesday to impose sanctions estimated to be worth about Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) a year against US companies bidding for public supply contracts of less than Ecu125,000 (Pounds 98,750), and public service contracts worth less than Ecu200,000. Larger contracts in dredging, transport, legal services, hotels and restaurants, security services, health and telecommunications, will also be closed to US bidders. The list virtually mirrors US sanctions imposed after negotiators failed to agree on liberalisation of the EC's procurement market. These are estimated to shut EC bidders out of contracts worth about Dollars 19m a year. Both sides appear to have reacted mildly in the dispute to prevent it from jeopardising progress in Uruguay Round negotiations on global trade liberalisation.

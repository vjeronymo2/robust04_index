			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (2): Adapting to modern demands - Ian Rodger compares regulations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein FORGET the traditional image of Switzerland as a place where the nervous rich can hide their money from snooping taxmen or other investigators. The country's bankers, who manage nearly SFr2,000bn in private fortunes, are in the midst of significant change to adapt themselves to the demands of a new legal environment and of a new generation of high net worth customers. Since last year, Swiss law obliges the country's bankers to know the beneficial owner of every account they keep and to co-operate with domestic and foreign authorities in criminal inquiries. Liechtenstein, the tiny principality wedged between Austria and Switzerland, still allows customers to hide behind lawyers or other intermediaries. But the principality has shown in a number of investigations - the most recent one being the Robert Maxwell case - that it is not willing to conceal egregious criminality. Moreover, both the Swiss and Liechtenstein banking communities suspect that it is only a matter of time before they will have to conform with pan-European practice, even in terms of sharing information with foreign tax authorities. When and if the two join the European Economic Area (EEA), they will have to comply with the European Community directive prohibiting money laundering, but both already try hard to steer away drug money. They have fought against mutual assistance on tax matters and appear to have won a respite, at least for the time being. Even if Switzerland and Liechtenstein wanted to remain in splendid isolation, it is doubtful that they could. The fund management business has become global in its operations, and the leading Swiss and Liechtenstein financial institutions all have substantial assets placed in financial markets throughout the world. These are easy targets, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission has shown, for pressuring institutions to co-operate in criminal investigations. All this does not mean that the Swiss and Liechtenstein private bankers are about to roll over and die. On the contrary, they are working hard to retain their competitiveness in an increasingly demanding environment. Swiss banks are still undoubtedly the world market leaders in the business of managing the fortunes of the rich. Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel of Zurich's Vontobel Bank has calculated on the basis of declared expenses that Swiss-based banks manage some SFr1,800bn in assets, of which 70 per cent are foreign owned. This dominant position was built up through this century mainly as a result of the country's image as a haven of political and currency stability in a world frequently racked by wars. The former stiff bank secrecy provisions enabled the world's rich to escape taxmen, families and various other plaintiffs who laid claim to part or all of their fortunes. Today, however, the environment has changed dramatically. The Swiss franc is no longer obviously more stable than any of a dozen other currencies, and tax evasion is no longer a prime concern of the new breed of rich. The typical new clients today are entrepreneurs whose businesses have been bought by big groups, high earning self-employed professionals or well-educated young people who have inherited fortunes from less financially sophisticated parents. 'Most of them can find adequate means of sheltering themselves from tax in their own countries,' says Eduardo Leemann, senior vice-president of Bank Julius Baer, one of the top Zurich banks. Swiss bankers acknowledge that there is still a substantial clientele that seeks secrecy for any of a number of reasons, but they just have to go elsewhere. 'We carry out our policy as if there was no banking secrecy at all,' a Credit Suisse spokesman says. It is thought that hundreds of millions of dollars have fled Swiss banks for Liechtenstein in the past two years since the introduction of the law requiring a banker to know his client. Some may also have gone to Austrian banks, which still allow anyone to open an anonymous numbered account. But Swiss bankers say most clients are won and held today mainly on the basis of fund management performance and service. Thus, they do not see themselves as competing so much against other well known offshore centres, such as the Channel Islands, Luxembourg, Gibraltar or the Isle of Man. Rather, competition is against other banks specialised in private banking, regardless of where they may be based. They admit that their main competitive strength at the moment is service. 'The Swiss are absolute market leaders in delivery of fast and error-free service,' says Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts &amp; Co, the Zurich-based international private banking division of Britain's National Westminster Bank. Because of their long experience in dealing with a substantially international clientele, the Swiss banks have staff even at a very junior level who are comfortable handling transactions involving several currencies, countries and types of financial instrument. They also provide ancillary services, such as estate planning and insurance selection, even helping sort out disputes within rich families. 'We are stock brokers, portfolio managers, global custodians and private family advisers,' says Jacques de Saussure, a partner in Geneva's Pictet &amp; Co, the largest Swiss private bank. By contrast, the typical branch of a typical German, Austrian, Spanish or French bank is simply not ready for these demands, Swiss bankers say. The Swiss also point to what might be called the amenities they offer for the high net worth clientele. Geneva and Zurich, the two main private banking centres, both offer excellent shopping, accommodation and medical treatment facilities, and Switzerland has several delightful resorts where they can rest and enjoy themselves. Until recently, the Swiss franc was an important part of this amenity, but it has lost some of its lustre of late. However, bankers are quick to point out that its weakness is not an important element in the real business of managing funds for top performance. 'If I have 25 per cent of even a Swiss client's assets in Swiss francs, that is already too much,' says Mr Leemann. Little is known about the international competitiveness of Swiss fund management because up to now few statistics have been published, but it is generally thought that it has not been sparkling. Bank Julius Baer will make audited information on its institutional funds available this year for the first time, and others will undoubtedly be forced to follow.</p>

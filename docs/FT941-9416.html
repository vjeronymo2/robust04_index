			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Gremlin in the gearbox: Uncertainty for Russia's largest carmaker When Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, recently announced he would 'correct' economic reforms to help 'factories which are now standing idle', he might have had in his mind Avtovaz, Russia's largest car producer. The maker of Lada cars shut down its sprawling plant because of a shortage of raw materials and components, and sent most of its 102,000 workers on part-paid leave, for the whole of January. Traditionally considered a jewel in the crown of Russian industry, Avtovaz, which has 75 per cent of Russia's car market and exports 40 per cent of its output for hard currency, had incurred difficulties in adjusting to market reforms. The problems were common to most Russian manufacturers: low productivity; a refusal by companies to pay their debts to each other in the hope the government would step in to help them; and a lack of capitalist institutions such as banks that would enable companies to supply goods without demanding upfront payments. Two weeks ago, however, the Avtovaz plant ended its stoppage without Mr Chernomyrdin's help. It used export revenues to repay its debts to domestic suppliers, which had stopped deliveries until they were paid, and used the shutdown as a chance to re-equip its production lines for a new model it plans to launch at the end of this year. Avtovaz managers, with their long experience of international markets, have in fact been more energetic than those in many other companies in responding to the challenges of the radical reforms now being ditched by Mr Chernomyrdin. In January Avtovaz signed a memorandum of understanding with General Motors of the US to explore setting up an assembly plant to produce Opel Astras in its home town of Togliatti, south of Moscow. The plant would provide western production expertise, create up to 60,000 jobs, and help ensure a higher-quality product than Avtovaz has achieved to date. For GM, which already had a Dollars 750m contract to supply Avtovaz with more environmentally-friendly fuel-injection systems, the main attraction of a partnership with the Russian carmaker would be easier access to a potential consumer market of 150m people. 'We recognise the high potential of the Russian market,' says Mr Leo Kalageorgi, GM's liaison manager for relations with Avtovaz. 'But we're also aware of the risk.' In an ambitious step to win the confidence of international capital markets, Avtovaz has also hired accountants Price Waterhouse to train staff and help produce financial reports which correspond to international standards. Avtovaz is aware that it needs restructuring to make it competitive in world markets once it loses the advantage of Russia's lower production costs: energy prices, for instance, are fast approaching world levels. Productivity at Avtovaz, which makes 670,000 cars a year, is reckoned to be significantly lower than for western counterparts. Avtovaz is keen to take advantage of the respite it is currently enjoying - as a result of prohibitive import tariffs - from competition in its domestic market. A Fiat Uno, for instance, costs Dollars 16,000 after Russian import taxes, compared with Dollars 9,000 for a Lada. But Avtovaz is worried by Mr Chernomyrdin's announcement that he plans to use 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation - a move regarded as departing from the tough fiscal and monetary policies of Russia's radical reformers. Mr Nikolai Lyachenkov, Avtovaz's vice-president, says: 'You can't stop inflation with political declarations.' Inflation, currently about 20 per cent a month, is seen as the company's biggest enemy because it discourages investment, and destroys the value of its own working capital as well as the savings of Avtovaz's potential customers. It was only the financial squeeze maintained by the government last year which forced Avtovaz to realise that it had to dig into its hard currency revenues to pay off its suppliers. Similarly, suppliers were pushed into stopping deliveries to Avtovaz once it became clear the government would not step in to pay company debts as it had in 1992, when Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, wrote off the outstanding debts of all Russian companies. Yet financial discipline alone will not succeed in turning around companies such as Avtovaz. The government has yet to implement the industrial policy it proclaimed more than a year ago, when the radicals were in power, of picking winners and letting go of the losers; but it is clear that restructuring will still require state support. Avtovaz's size means it is unrealistic for a western investor to make the necessary financial commitment. 'They're too big for us to get involved in any significant way,' says Mr Roger Gale, Moscow representative of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm. Proposals Avtovaz has made to international organisations for helping it modernise and expand its existing plant would require almost Dollars 2bn. 'Who saved Chrysler?' asks an executive at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 'The US government. The role of the government in Russia is to know how much it can afford to invest and to help the people displaced by restructuring.' Mr Kalageorgi of GM says: 'What Avtovaz is going through is what we had at GM . . . We had social security and unemployment benefit, but here the company has paid for healthcare, housing and transport. They can't just let people go all at once. With time, however, they will emerge stronger from having to reorganise as we did.' Some state support has been forthcoming: a recent presidential decree promised a three-year tax holiday for the car plant Avtovaz hopes to build with GM. But until Avtovaz draws up a detailed restructuring plan it will not be clear how much extra aid will be required from the state. Meanwhile, as a sign of its determination to join the ranks of world car producers, Avtovaz has begun selling to the Russian public Rbs2 trillion (Dollars 1.3bn) worth of shares in a new consortium with other Russian companies to help finance the plant it hopes to build with GM - even before the latter has agreed to the project's go-ahead. To attract Russians eager to protect their savings from inflation, the consortium is offering shareholders the chance to win a car by entering a lottery rather than waiting for dividend payments. But its efforts to behave in a market-oriented way are threatened by Mr Chernomyrdin's promised 'policy corrections'. At best they mean a reversal of policies which had only just begun to show benefits for Avtovaz - for instance by enforcing financial discipline. At worst, they threaten to unleash either hyperinflation, or a return to old-style state control of the economy - both of which would set back, and perhaps bury, Avtovaz's hopes of thriving on the world industrial stage.</p>

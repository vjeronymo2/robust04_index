			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 MISL ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> EAST ROSTER ADDS MUSCLE FOR STAR WARS;  </P> <P> ALL-STARS: TO COUNTER THE WEST'S SCORING PROWESS COACH KENNY COOPER HAS ADDED  THE BRUTE FORCE OF CLEVELAND'S BERNIE JAMES AND MIKE SWEENEY.  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if you go to the 11th MISL All-Star game tonight at the  Sports Arena and a hockey game breaks out.  </P> <P> No, there won't be any high sticking, but Eastern Division Coach Kenny Cooper,  of the Baltimore Blast, seems to have used half of his four roster choices on  players who have done more scuffling in their careers than scoring.  </P> <P> Certainly, that's no crime in this league, but remember that the All-Star game  is traditionally a showcase for offensive prowess, not brute power.  </P> <P> The two controversial picks are defender Bernie James and midfielder Mike  Sweeney of the Cleveland Crunch.  </P> <P> Both are first time All-Stars despite long careers in the league (James has  been playing since 1982, Sweeney since 1984).  </P> <P> There's a reason for their prolonged absence.  </P> <P> As Sweeney explained it, "We've always been involved in a lot of scuffles and  had a lot of penalty minutes. And that kind of player doesn't get selected."  </P> <P> Now their time has come. Apparently, Cooper is relying on some elbow grease  from the twosome to keep the West's forwards off the ball.  </P> <P> It's not really the plan of a desperate man, but Cooper is 0-2 against the  Sockers' Ron Newman in All-Star games and 0-3 against him in championship  series. And, well, something has to change.  </P> <P> So it might as well be strategy. Forget the offense, Cooper has got to keep the  West from scoring. The best way to do that is to keep its players from  shooting.  </P> <P> "Don't get me wrong," Cooper said. "I think we have some firepower. We have  some guys who can put the ball in the back of the net, but before we do that we  have to keep the ball from getting in the back of our net."  </P> <P> For that reason James and Sweeney are making their All-Star debuts. Some argue  that it is long overdue for James.  </P> <P> The Cleveland defender is the MISL's all-time blocked-shots leader with 848. He  has yet to gain the reputation of, say, a Kim Roentved, a nine-time All-Star,  because of his physical style of play.  </P> <P> "He should have been here a long time ago," Cooper said. "He's the top defender  in the league. He deserves to be here and he gets the job done and the same  goes for Mike Sweeney."  </P> <P> Sweeney, however, is not a defender. He's a midfielder, although he has gained  a reputation as a defensive midfielder.  </P> <P> Had Cooper wanted to match the West's scoring ability, there were other  midfielders available.  </P> <P> Most notable among the group: David Byrne. Byrne, now with Wichita, has scored  14 goals and assisted on 16 others for 30 points in 26 games this season.  Sweeney, on the other hand, has accumulated 23 points in 33 games.  </P> <P> Cooper doesn't admit to making his selections on the basis of players'  reputations as scrappers. But he doesn't deny it.  </P> <P> "I think the indoor game is an intense game," Cooper said. "It is a contact  sport and we lose sight of that. As a coach, you look for guys who aren't  afraid to leave a piece of themselves on the carpet. You look for an honest  effort and Bernie James and Mike Sweeney are two of the most honest players  I've seen."  </P> <P> What Cooper is most concerned with is a trio of Western players who are not  only top goal scorers, but also three of the most creative passers in the  league.  </P> <P> Dallas' Tatu heads the list. In 33 games, Tatu has scored 41 goals and assisted  on 33 others. Tacoma's Preki has 18 goals and 26 assists in 28 games. San  Diego's Branko Segota not only has a first and last name, but also probably the  league's most powerful legs. Segota's shots are considered among the league's  hardest, although this year, because of injuries, he has played in only 27  games, some at three-quarter-speed. In that time, he has scored 16 goals and  assisted on 24 others.  </P> <P> Another offensive threat from the West is Kia, Preki's teammate in Tacoma, who  has scored 24 goals and assisted on nine others in 34 games.  </P> <P> Cooper knows that if his East team is to win, it's going to have to out-work  the West. In fact, it has been brought to his attention so often this week,  he's getting a little irritated.  </P> <P> "Everyone's calling this a blue-collar team, a hard-working team," he said.  "But when we win the game (tonight) they won't say that any more."  </P> <P> The label may not even fit going into the game. In the midst of all the Western  goal-scorers monopolizing the attention, few have bothered to look at the  league's scoring leaders and notice that nine of the top 12 are on Cooper's  roster.  </P> <P> They are: Kansas City's Jan Goossens (No. 2 with 41 goals and 33 assists),  Wichita's Chico Borja (3-21, 30), Cleveland's Michael King (4-32, 18), and  Hector Marinaro (5-24, 20), Wichita's Dale Irvine (7-31, 12), Kansas City's  Dale Mitchell (8-29, 12) and Baltimore's Domenic Mobilio (10-27, 11), Tim  Wittman (10-27, 11) and Carl Valentine (12 -- 15, 21).  </P> <P> Cooper has noticed this. And he's happy with what he sees as a perfect balance.  While his forwards will be letting shots fly, his defenders will be letting  their elbows and feet fly. "At the end of the day," he said, "it's a team  game."  </P> <P> But he's not waiting for the end of the day to prove his philosophy. He's  waiting for it in hopes his record against Newman will no longer begin with  zero.  </P> <P> "Sooner or later," Cooper says, "the law of averages is going to turn."  </P> <P> A LOOK AT THE MISL ALL-STAR LINEUPS  </P> <P> WESTERN DIVISION  </P> <P> No.: 4  </P> <P> Name: Gary Heale  </P> <P> Team: St. Louis Storm  </P> <P> Position: Forward  </P> <P> Comment: Scrappy.

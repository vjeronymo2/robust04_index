			<p>BFN     [Text] The Transkei Defense Force has denied that SANDF  [South African National Defense Force] soldiers have taken over  control of military bases in the Transkei. However, SANDF  soldiers were deployed at bases at the Transkei's request to  quell the mutiny. This follows rioting last week when soldiers  in Port St. Johns and Umtata protested against low salaries and  held a senior officer hostage. The officer commanding the SANDF  in the Transkei, Major General Themba Matanzima, said 195  Transkei Defense Force members were being held in connection  with the mutiny.</p>

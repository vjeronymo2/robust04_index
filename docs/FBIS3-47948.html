			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on  Friday [21 January] voted down the government's political reform  package, dealing a severe blow to the five-month-old  administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The vote was 118 for and 130 against.    The voting on the four bills came in an upper house plenary  session that opened at 3 p.m.    Some members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ], the biggest force in the seven-party coalition, voted  against the package. Other SDP legislators abstained.    The SDP members who voted against the bills or abstained are  said to be dissatisfied with the bill calling for a mixture of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation in  elections for the House of Representatives.    The exact number of rebellious SDP members was not  immediately available.    They outnumbered, however, those Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills.    Although the coalition earlier vowed to seek to revive the  package through bargaining at the 20-member consultative Diet  body comprising executives from both the coalition and  opposition parties, the prospects of such a revival are  virtually nonexistent, Diet sources said.    In the face of the failure of the package, Hosokawa has a  choice of disbanding his cabinet or dissolving the House of  Representatives for a snap general election.    If he chooses to have the cabinet resign en masse, Hosokawa  would most likely quit as premier and another coalition leader  would take over the post, analysts said.    If he opts for a snap general election, it would be seen as  a  call for the electorate's judgment on political reform but  would, of course, be held under the current system of electing  511 members of the lower chamber through multiple-seat  constituencies.</p>

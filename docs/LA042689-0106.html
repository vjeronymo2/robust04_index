			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 UCI BRAIN RESEARCHERS HONORED  </P> <P> Two world-renowned brain researchers at UC Irvine have been elected to the  National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors a scientist can  achieve.  </P> <P> Officials announced Tuesday that honors went to James McGaugh, chairman of the  department of psychobiology and director of the Center for the Neurobiology of  Learning and Memory; and Ricardo Miledi, a distinguished professor of  psychobiology and founder of UCI's Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular  Neurobiology.  </P> <P> Miledi was elected as a foreign associate of the academy, an honor bestowed on  researchers who are not U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> The academy, which has its Western headquarters at UCI, elected 60 new members  and four foreign associates this year. Members total 1,573; foreign associates,  262. The academy was established by Congress in 1863 to advise the federal  government on science and technology.  </P> <P> The honors are the latest of many for McGaugh and Miledi. McGaugh, former vice  chancellor and executive vice chancellor at UCI, has studied the effects of  drugs, hormones and electrical stimulation on memory storage. McGaugh has  received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American  Psychological Assn. and the UCI Extraordinarius Award.  </P> <P> In addition, McGaugh is the founding editor of the Journal of Behavioral and  Neural Biology and has been on research committees for the National Institute  of Mental Health and the National Research Council. He has also been a governor  of the American Psychological Assn. and has been at UCI since the campus was  founded in 1965.  </P> <P> Miledi, who came to UCI in 1984, is an expert on the physiology of synapses --  the point at which messages are transmitted from one neuron to another -- and  the transmission of those messages to muscles. His research into how the brain  processes information has led to treatments for nervous disorders including  myasthenia gravis.  </P> <P> Miledi was named one of two winners of the $100,000 King Faisal International  Prize for science and medicine last spring and has received the Luigi Galvani  Medal for excellence in neuroscience research. He is also an honorary member of  the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> Born in Mexico, Miledi lived in England for 26 years and holds British  citizenship.  </P></p>

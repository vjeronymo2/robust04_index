			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE ANC's threat of strikes in South Africa prompted a sharp bounce in the PLATINUM price yesterday, following substantial falls earlier this week. The afternoon fixing in London saw the price at Dollars 383.40 a troy ounce, up Dollars 6.15 from Wednesday's fix, though it drifted lower in later trading. Meanwhile the GOLD price, having been fixed at a fresh 7-month high of Dollars 359.50 an ounce, eased back to close at Dollars 358.75 an ounce, down 50 cents on the day. Gold chart patterns still looked positive, analysts said, noting the lack of stiff resistance up to Dollars 370 an ounce. Jitters in the financial markets and the dollar's recent plunge to near record lows against the mark had sent funds surging into the metal, they added. COCOA prices built on this week's rally, with London's September futures position ending at Pounds 599 a tonne, up Pounds 14. Dealers attributed the advance to speculative buying and the continued absence of producer selling, underpinned by the Ghanaian cocoa workers strike and dry weather in the Ivory Coast. Most London Metal Exchange contracts lost some of Wednesday's gains. The main exception was TIN, which rose another Dollars 72.50 in the cash position to Dollars 7,120 a tonne.

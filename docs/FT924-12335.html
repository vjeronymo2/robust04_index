			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Just as the enthusiasm among current affairs producers for programmes about child sex abuse seems to be waning they have come up with a new horror to appal us: abuse of the elderly. Dispatches (9.00 C4) has commissioned a report from the Office Of Population, Censuses and Surveys which, they claim, 'reveals that as many as 3 million people over the age of 60 are at risk'. We shall have to see what is meant by 'at risk', but the forms of abuse, we are told, range from kicking to rape.' I wish I liked the human race, I wish I liked its silly face ..' Having watched the first two episodes of BBC2's drama Downtown Lagos and, as puzzled as everyone else I have spoken to, I shall monitor the final episode (9.25) to see whether they can tie off all the ends or whether it will all turn out to be a dream. Michael Palin seeks to repeat the tremendous success of his 'Around The World In 80 Days' series with another set of travel documentaries. This time he goes Pole To Pole in eight programmes, travelling as nearly as possible down the 30 degrees east line of longitude. The opening episode (9.30) takes him from the north pole to Russia.</p>

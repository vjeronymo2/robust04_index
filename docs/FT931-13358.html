			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Warm glow of profits keeps out chill of recession - Nick Garnett visits the London Scarf Company, where first-year sales totalled Pounds 870,000 'I'VE been in the British textile industry for 30 years. It has been one long retreat. Those of us who are still here think of ourselves as equivalent to the survivors of Stalingrad.' PETER Duxbury is looking forward now to a business life better than mere survival. The London Scarf Company, which he set up a little more than a year ago designing and contracting out the printing of scarves for big department stores, has turned in remarkable first-year sales of Pounds 870,000. 'We have just started in the tie market as well. I'd hope to do overall perhaps Pounds 1m in our second year.' London Scarf is a classic example of an infant business created by people already experienced in the same trade by working for large companies. Duxbury was a manager at Josef Otten, an Austrian textile distributor. He finished his days there in 1991 by winding up that company's British trading operations. He decided to set up on his own, taking with him two Josef Otten employees. He had promised orders from Jacqmar, a UK scarf brand whose operations had been serviced by companies Duxbury had once worked for. The idea was to design scarves in London and have them made by low-cost printers in China, Japan and Italy for importation into Europe. 'We decided we could develop a product which we would target on major retailers rather than a mass of small shops. Joseph Otten had 400-500 customers for its scarves. We have 23 which are most of the big department store groups.' Duxbury had Pounds 100,000 of his own to put at the company's disposal. 'The company is well funded. It had to have good secure footing or I would not have gone into it.' On top of that, Duxbury negotiated with Hambros Bank a reserve figure of more than Pounds 40,000 to be tapped into if necessary. 'Hambros have been wonderful. They have given us every support.' As it happens, setting up London Scarf was not expensive. Duxbury puts start-up costs at about Pounds 15,000. That included legal fees and first payments on a smallish works studio whose yearly rent. for 500 square feet in London is a rather high Pounds 14,000. In its first year, the company produced 100 designs and close to 200,000 scarves, all but 10 per cent of which were silk. A little over a half of production was supplied wholesale to department stores. The rest - still using London Scarf designs - were bought direct by stores from the scarf printers, Duxbury's company collects an agency fee. London Scarf takes most of its designs from paintings submitted by freelance artists. An artist receives about Pounds 350 for a design and its colour work. Selected designs are air-mailed to one of London Scarf's three manufacturers - in Tokyo, Shanghai and in the scarf printing area near Lake Como in Italy. A typical London Scarf product uses 10 to 12 colours. Much more expensive Hermes scarfs might have up to 30. In preparation for printing, each colour (with its own part of the overall design) must be converted by the printer into an individual 'screen', usually made of nylon. Each colour with its pattern is printed separately on each scarf, the silk moving underneath the fixed screens through which dye is poured. 'Surprisingly, the process is much more automated in China than in Japan but actual material handling is much more advanced in Japan,' says Duxbury. 'For the same money you get a better scarf from China than from Japan,' says Jane Swan, who also came from Josef Otten. 'It is thicker and hemmed by hand.' The cost of designing a scarf and producing its colour screens (a further Pounds 1,000) must be absorbed in the price. Production runs for a scarf design range from 500 to about 6,000. London Scarf makes a relatively tight average return of between a third and 40 per cent, measuring the price it receives for each scarf against the cost of producing them. The biggest margins, as so often happens, are enjoyed by the retailers. A silk scarf retailing at Pounds 20 will be bought by the retailer for about Pounds 7. Duxbury says the pre-tax margin for the first year was about 5 per cent but he is looking for an eventual return on capital of 30 per cent. London Scarf's main competitors include two US companies, Echo and Liz Claiborne, as well as in-house designers some stores employ. About a quarter of the company's sales are in France. The Monoprix chain placed the largest order the infant company has so far enjoyed - one of Pounds 50,000. Duxbury is keen to find agents for his scarves in Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. Apart from reducing dependency on the UK's Pounds 7m silk scarf market, such expansion would prove particularly lucrative. The idea is to sell the design in a number of countries. This would raise profits by spreading design and screen-production costs. Nylon screens, which are stored at the scarf printers, last for three years before corroding. London Scarf caters for the middle mass market. 'We'll wait for two years before deciding whether to go into boutiques. A typical boutique buys from a merchant a scarf for Pounds 15 and sells it for Pounds 50.' The downside is that this would force London Scarf into becoming a holder of stock, another cost burden. Duxbury would like to have scarves printed in the UK but says the one silk printer capable of doing it - a company used by Liberty's - has high production costs. London Scarf will almost certainly stick to overseas silk printers for its ties. 'We are crashing into the tie market although it is very competitive,' says Duxbury. 'We have so far done 7,000 for France. We are expecting to do 60,000-70,000 ties this year.' In recession, retailers squeeze the margins of little companies like London Scarf. But tough trading has a silver lining. Swan says: 'What has helped us is that department stores are cutting their numbers of buyers and, as they are more hard pressed, they tend to depend more on our advice.'

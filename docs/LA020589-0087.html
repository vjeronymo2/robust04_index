			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'UNNECESSARY' MONEY SPENT BY DEVELOPER  </P> <P> The developer of Chatelaine, a community of 236 townhouses in Torrance,  reported the sale of 42 units in its first two increments, without models,  brochures or other merchandising tools. Yet, Watt Homes went ahead and  furnished models, finished a brochure and invested in a sales office.  </P> <P> Why? Robert A. Perlberg, a spokesman for the development, said:  </P> <P> "First, it was not a one-phase product, and the developer can't predict what  the economy will be like (as future phases are released), but basically, Watt  spent well over $100,000 more than was really necessary because the company is  planning other projects in the area." Watt has built a number of residential  communities in Torrance during the past 30 years.  </P></p>

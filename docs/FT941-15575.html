			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Power 'bills' issued to foil VAT East Midlands Electricity is sending blank 'bills' to millions of customers to help them avoid the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. The 'bills' are going to 2m homes and invite people to pay as much as they like in advance for their power. Customers who build up credit will avoid the 8 per cent fuel tax which begins on April 1. Next year it rises to 17.5 per cent. The company said: 'It is no different from hearing that petrol prices are going up in the Budget - and driving straight to the garage to get a full tank.' The carbon tax proposed by the European Commission would have nearly the same effect on consumers as the government's plans to put VAT on household fuel, a report argued yesterday. The tax to help combat global warming would raise the price of household fuel by about 18 per cent, according to a paper published in the Consumer Association's policy review journal.</p>

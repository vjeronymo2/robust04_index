			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Falling bond market brings party-time for lenders - US mortgage borrowers are taking advantage of interest rates at historic lows THE US financial industry is bracing itself for a record-breaking wave of refinancings by mortgage borrowers, prompted by falling long-term interest rates. The result: a boom for companies that generate new mortgage loans, but bad news for those that service them and for the many investors in mortgage-backed bonds who are seeing their investment returns reduced. The bull market in bonds that has driven domestic mortgage rates down to historic lows, along with other long-term interest rates, has prompted previous waves of mortgage refinancings in the past two years, but none as big as the one that is now washing over the financial sector. As mortgage rates fall, many borrowers pay off their old fixed-rate loans by taking out new, lower-interest ones. Around four-fifths of the Dollars 3,000bn of home mortgage loans in the US are on fixed rates. The surge in mortgage pre-payments is reflected in the refinancing index constructed by the Mortgage Bankers Association. This leapt to two peaks in 1992 and a third in March of this year, as investors reacted to sharp falls in long-term rates. Its latest jump, as the yield on the 30-Treasury bond has fallen below 6 per cent, is the biggest yet. The index (at 100 in March 1990) climbed above 1500 for the first time at the beginning of this month, reaching 1731 in the latest figure released yesterday. Last year, Dollars 450bn of mortgage loans were refinanced. This year, the figure is set to top Dollars 500bn. Only homeowners unlucky enough to have been left with properties worth less than their loans (an experience generally confined to California and the north-east) have been unable to join in the party. New mortgages mean new fees for lenders. Most charge a fee of 1.25 to 1.5 per cent when making a loan, whether it is taken out to repay an old loan or to buy a house. Fee income at Countrywide Credit Industries, the US's biggest home mortgage company, leapt from Dollars 38m to Dollars 92m in 1992. However, falling mortgage interest rates have also hit the results of some banks. Most recycle their mortgages as mortgage-backed bonds, and retain an involvement only in servicing the loans - for a fee. That gives servicing rights a value, and has led to a market in which some banks have become big buyers of the rights to service portfolios of mortgages. If those mortgages are repaid early, the value of the portfolio falls. This cost Citibank Dollars 255m last year. 'When it hit, it hit hard and unexpectedly,' said Mr Pei-Yuan Chia, senior vice-president in charge of Citibank's consumer banking business. 'All the mortgage banks are looking at (the implications of refinancings) at the moment,' he says. The cost to the banks this year may turn out to be lower than in 1992. Citi, for one, says it now hedges against impairments to its mortgage portfolio in the Treasury bond market: if rates fall and refinancings rise, the costs are balanced by profits on the bond holdings. The refinancing boom has also been bad news for investors who hold the near-Dollars 1,500bn of mortgage-backed bonds in issue. Most new mortgages are not held on bank's balance sheets: they are eventually repackaged and sold to investors. Since many of these bonds are recycled through Fannie Mae and carry a federal guarantee, they are relatively free from credit risk. Prepayment risk is something else. As interest rates fall and the loans backing the bonds are repaid, investors are left to reinvest their capital in bonds at much lower yields. As a result, mortgage-backed bonds under-perform other fixed-income securities during a bond market rally. That has been especially true in recent weeks as investors have reassessed the prepayment risk. 'The market has gone through a pretty enormous revaluation in the last month,' says Mr Christopher Flanagan, director of mortgage-backed research at Merrill Lynch. Current-coupon mortgage-backed bonds (those which pay an annual return close to current bond market yields) now yield around 100 basis points (one percentage point) more than comparable US Treasury bonds, up from less than 80 basis points in the middle of August. The picture is even worse for bonds issued before the latest rally, which pay higher coupons and are the most in danger of being repaid early. 'Price spreads have collapsed in the last two or three weeks,' Mr Flanagan says. Worst hit of all have been interest-only 'strips' - the future income streams on mortgage-backed bonds which are detached and sold separately. As the mortgages are repaid, these future income payments simply vanish. The readjustment in the bond market is partly due to the faster pace of refinancings, which are running at a far higher level than in 1986 and early 1987, when mortgage rates last fell sharply. Mr Mark Obrinsky, senior economist at Fannie Mae, says the rate has picked up in part because most lenders are now prepared to roll their refinancing fees into the balance of the new loans. Also, he says, 'it's like going to the dentist': the many borrowers who have refinanced once already in recent years have less resistance to doing it again. The fact that it now takes a smaller fall in interest rates to produce a larger volume of refinancing has blown a hole in the financial models used by traders of strips and other derivative-type instruments. The pricing and hedging strategies based on outdated assumptions about refinancing rates have not held up well in the current boom. While it is hurting bondholders, the latest refinancing wave could help to lift the average homeowner's disposable income - and, by implication, the sluggish US economy. By locking into lower interest rates on Dollars 500bn or more of their household debt, Ameri-cans are freeing themselves to spend more in the shops. The benefits will not all flow through at once, though. Many homeowners are taking advantage of lower interest rates to shorten the length of their debt. According to Fannie Mae, two out of every five people who refinanced a 30-year mortgage in the first half of this year chose to replace it with a 15-year one instead. As a result, their monthly interest payments may actually have risen, not fallen.</p>

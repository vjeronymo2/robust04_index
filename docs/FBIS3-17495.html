The Chechen republic  attached no other conditions to the conclusion of a treaty with  Russia.    If it were suggested, as a preliminary condition, that  Chechnya be regarded as a constituent part of the Russian  Federation, it would make no sense for Groznyy to send a  delegation to Moscow, said Akbulatov.    He continued that, detrimental as they were to the Russian  interests, the political games around Chechnya would inevitably  produce a new Russian-Caucasian war, and claimed that President  Dudayev was concerned exactly about that possibility.    Akbulatov dismissed, as an obvious journalistic error,  reports that the Moscow-based negotiations had been broken-off  and the Chechens were to blame for it. He said the negotiations  were continuing and no chance would be overlooked for a  reasonable compromise. The Chechen and Russian delegations were  to meet again on Saturday, March 26.    Chechnya was seeking the closest and neighborly relationship  with Russia, said Akbulatov, with sovereignty as a safeguard  against the possible repetition of an attempt to exterminate the  Chechens.</p>

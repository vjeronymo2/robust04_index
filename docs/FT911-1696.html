			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Opposition to bank reform plan spreads DOMESTIC and international opposition is growing to a US Treasury proposal that foreign banks should put all their American activities into separately capitalised local subsidiaries if they wish to engage in securities and insurance operations. This recommendation, in the Treasury's bank reform legislation, has already been strongly criticised by international banking groups and by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who argue that it would unnecessarily increase costs and could deter foreign banks from operating in the US. Until the last few days, the chances of such a proposal being approved looked slim, in view of the desire of Democratic leaders of the House banking committee for a narrowly-based bill focusing mainly on the recapitalisation of the fund insuring bank deposits. But following lobbying by Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, House Democrats have agreed to consider the administration's wider-ranging proposals, including those affecting foreign banks. Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Commission, this week warned that the proposals would severely limit the ability of EC banks to compete effectively in the US market. Foreign banks wishing to engage in securities activities would have to convert their existing banking operations from a branch or agency into a separately capitalised subsidiary. They would have to conduct their activities on the basis of local US capital rather the worldwide capital, as is now the case. Mr Greenspan yesterday argued that the US 'sorely' needed to reform its banking industry, but warned that bankers would 'make a big mistake if they anticipate that modifications in laws and regulations alone will solve their problems.' He argued that to avoid a further credit crunch, bankers needed to raise their capital ratios and lower their asset risks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Our province's exports have increased gradually.  By the end of this March, export volume of the whole province  reached approximately $25 million, which accounted for 23.65  percent of the total export volume for the whole year, and  registered an increase of 30.25 percent over the same period  last year.    This year the provincial economic and foreign trade  department and various specialized companies have firmly grasped  the fine opportunity of speeding up the pace of transforming  operational mechanisms, unifying foreign exchange rates, and  abolishing foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over  foreign exchange to the state, to solve new problems arising in  the foreign trade system through deepening reforms. They have  also overcome various unfavorable factors such as an  insufficient supply of goods and increases in export costs and  loan interest rates. They have devoted their main efforts to  tapping internal potential and enhancing economic efficiency.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: ING chairman resigns suddenly MR Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, chairman of ING, the Dutch banking and insurance group, resigned unexpectedly yesterday in response to a series of reports in the Dutch press about the private investments of former senior executives from the group's banking arm. Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom, who took over as ING's chairman just 12 week ago, said he was stepping down because he had increasingly become the focus of negative press publicity in the Netherlands. His successor in one of the Netherlands' top financial posts is Mr Aad Jacobs, who until now was vice-chairman and head of the group's insurance operations. Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom decided to resign after weekend consultations with ING's supervisory board. The move followed recent allegations in the press that he knew about the personal investments of Mr Ton Soetekow, who resigned from ING's board in the summer, as well as a report on Saturday in the newspaper De Volkskrant that Mr Scherpenhuijsen had made private investments in the late 1970s in a small property company that had a banking relationship with NMB Bank, which he then chaired. An ING spokesman said that Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom's property investment was ended in 1981. The investment was legal but Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom pulled out after a few years at a time when the Dutch financial community began debating the propriety of bankers investing in clients, the spokesman said. This summer, four former senior executives at NMB Bank, which has since been renamed ING Bank, resigned or retired early.</p>

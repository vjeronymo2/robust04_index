			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Against the Wishes of Western </F> Oil Giants, Russia Is Returning to Wells on the Caspian Shelf"]    [Text] The question of developing the Azeri and Shirak  fields -- the richest on the territory of the former USSR, with  reserves of more than 50 million tonnes of oil -- was agreed  upon at the London meeting between President Geydar Aliyev of  Azerbaijan and British Prime Minister John Major. So far it has  been announced officially that a significant, 70-percent share  in the development will be given to a Western consortium headed  by British Petroleum. According to IZVESTIYA's exclusive  information, however, the new government of Azerbaijan has  confirmed its intention to grant the Russian oil company Lukoil  a 12-percent share in the development. Lukoil has also secured  approximately 10 percent from that part which now belongs to  Azerbaijan.    An agreement to develop the Caspian shelf was earlier  concluded with Western firms by the Elchibey government, and at  that time no provision was made at all for Russia's  participation. In the opinion of observers, the revision of the  preliminary accords in Russia's favor attests to an attempt by  Geydar Aliyev to enlist the support of his northern neighbor in  resolving Azerbaijan's internal problems, including the Karabakh  crisis. It cannot be ruled out that Azerbaijan will go still  further in its concessions to Russia and will opt for  transporting the oil not across Turkey as originally proposed,  but through Novorossiysk and the "Friendship" pipeline. The  unstable situation in Iranian Kurdistan, across whose territory  the oil pipeline proposed by the Western side was to have  passed, militates in favor of this decision.    According to preliminary information, another promising  deposit at Gyunashlty might be taken away from the Western  consortium altogether in favor of Lukoil. The final details of  the agreement, which at present is being kept top secret, will  be agreed during the 15 March visit to Baku by Lukoil President  Vagit Alekperov.    Meanwhile a scandal is developing around a court action  brought against Lukoil by the small Liechtenstein company of  Frankenburg. The Lukoil leadership believes that the huge  $550-million suit for breach of contract with regard to  restoring wells in West Siberia has been provoked by Western  competitors so as to compromise the Russian oil company at the  moment of its entering the world market. In addition to  Azerbaijan, Lukoil has penetrated the markets of Tunisia, Egypt,  Nigeria, and Trinidad and Tobago. According to recent  information received from Lukoil Vice President Leonid Fedun,  Frankenburg has spent approximately $300,000-400,000 on a  newspaper campaign over its suit. Strange though it may seem,  the Estonian press stands out for being particularly active. As  L. Fedun said, Frankenburg will endeavor to "fleece" Lukoil of  approximately $10 million, but nothing will come of this venture.    To date the Southern District Court of the State of Texas,  United States, with which the statement of claim has been  lodged, has not accepted it for examination. The development of  the court investigation has been hampered for legal reasons,  above all. At the time of the conflict in 1992 Lukoil was a  state company (the first check auction is only now being  scheduled), and under U.S. legislation suits directed by private  companies against the state property of other states may not be  accepted for examination in the usual manner. Lukoil President  Vagit Alekperov calls his former partner's claims ridiculous and  expresses doubt that a court at any level will accept the  scandalous case for examination.    In the macroeconomic sense the Russian oilmen's emergence  onto the world market expresses a change in the strategy of the  sector's development. The sales crisis in Russia and the huge  nonpayments, which in 1993 exceeded 450 billion rubles for  Lukoil alone, essentially leave the company with no other way  out. So it cannot be ruled out that Lukoil will channel the  considerable credits from Mitsui ($700 million) and the World  Bank ($268 million) partly into developing its own business  abroad. But the company's strategic goal of stabilizing Russian  oil extraction by 1995 is not yet subject to revision.</p>

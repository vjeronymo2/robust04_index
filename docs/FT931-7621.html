			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (1): Running to catch up with reality - Living standards are still high, but Ontarians find themselves in less comfortable circumstances since recession hit the province NASTY WINTERS aside, the 10m inhabitants of the Canadian province of Ontario enjoy a lifestyle which most other parts of the world can only dream of. Generous social security, free medical care of the highest quality, an ultra-modern telephone service, superb public transport, a low crime rate . . . such are the benefits of living in Canada's industrial heartland - the wedge of North America squeezed between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay. High living standards have given Ontario the luxury of breaking new ground in public policy. It is a pioneer in pay-equity, which seeks to provide equal rewards to men and women for work of equal value. An Environmental Bill of Rights, now under discussion, would give the public a degree of power over polluters which is matched by few - if any - other national or regional government. Ontario even copes well with its frigid winters. Office workers and shoppers in central Toronto can stroll warmly through miles of underground malls. The Rideau Canal in Ottawa becomes a five-mile skating rink for commuters and tourists between January and March. And yet, for all its attractions and its leading-edge policies, Ontario is not a happy place these days. Far from feeling comfortable, the province is struggling to come to grips with some harsh realities. The problem is summed up by Mr Peter Barnes, the province's most senior civil servant, who is spearheading an overhaul of the industry and trade ministry: 'Ontario has had a very easy time of it since 1945; it was a complacent place. Now, we're having to run to catch up.' Ontario has traditionally been the object of envy and resentment among Canadians in other parts of the country. Contributing 40 per cent of the country's output, it is the Canadian base for Detroit's Big Three carmakers and the hub of Canada's steel industry. Ontario has drawn far more foreign investment than any of the other nine provinces - including all but one of the Asian car plants in Canada. Toronto, the provincial capital, is Canada's financial centre; site of the country's principal stock exchange, the head offices of five of the six biggest banks, and several dozen foreign banks. Mining and forestry have been the backbone of many smaller Ontario communities. A large chunk of the world's nickel is mined in Sudbury, north of Toronto. Gold and zinc, among other minerals, are found in abundance. But many of the industries and resources which for years seemed to give Ontario a competitive edge have lately turned out to be a millstone. No region of Canada (and few anywhere else) enjoyed stronger economic expansion in the early and mid-1980s. Real growth soared at an annual rate of 6 per cent between 1983 and 1988. But Ontario's 'rust-belt', its service and resource industries have also been hit hardest by the recession. The economy contracted in 1990 and 1991 and barely grew last year. Dofasco and Stelco, the pillars of the province's steel industry, have racked up combined losses of CDollars 1.4bn in the past three years. Toronto's office vacancy rate of almost 25 per cent is about five points above the national average. Slumping prices have devastated low-grade uranium producers, and forced cutbacks by Inco and Falconbridge, the two nickel mining companies. Similarly, falling demand and stiffening competition have doomed old and inefficient newsprint mills. Ontario's structural weaknesses have been further exposed by the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and the trend among North American companies to integrate their US and Canadian operations. Investors increasingly compare Ontario not to other provinces in Canada, but to the states south of the Canadian border. While they may appreciate Ontario's skilled labour force and its low health-care costs, their enthusiasm for doing business in the province is dampened these days by high taxes, ever-tightening environmental and workplace rules, and soaring electricity costs. The investment climate has not been helped by a spendthrift Liberal government, which held office from 1985 to 1990, nor by its more left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) successor, which surprised everyone (including itself) by winning a snap election in September 1990. Despite the surge in economic growth, the Liberals ran a hefty budget deficit in all but one of their years in office. The recession's squeeze on tax revenues pushed up the deficit from CDollars 3bn in the year to March 1991, to almost CDollars 11bn in each of the last two years. The debt burden has soared to the point where the Province of Ontario has recently had the dubious distinction of being among the Euromarket's four biggest borrowers. The present government, backed by labour and social activist groups, has done little to brighten the business mood in its first two years in office. Some NDP ministers, drawn from the ranks of organised labour or special-interest groups, have either been out of their depth or ideologically antagonistic to management concerns. 'There's a lack of understanding of what government costs do to make industry uncompetitive,' says Mr Richard Sexton, president of ED Smith, an Ontario-based food processor which recently hedged its bets by acquiring a company in Mississippi. The NDP government proposed - and then backed away from - a government-run car insurance scheme. But other contentious insurance reforms are still on the table. For instance, in the interests of gender equality, insurers will be compelled to quote the same premiums to young male and female drivers, despite the wide disparity in risk. Mr Bob Rae, the provincial premier, has unsettled prospective investors with his strong opposition both to the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and to the North American pact, including Mexico, which the federal government would like to implement in January 1994. The NDP has so far ignored pleas from business to harmonise the province's sales tax with the federal government's politically unpopular Goods and Services Tax. The business community is especially angered by a new labour law which gives more muscle to trade unions. Among other things, the law known as Bill 40 bans the use of 'replacement' workers during strikes or lockouts. In these days of just-in-time delivery, the ban means that a work stoppage at a small components supplier could bring General Motors' or Ford's assembly lines to a halt. On the brighter side, the deepening fiscal mess and the loss of jobs appear to have had a sobering effect on Mr Rae and some of his colleagues. 'There's no question that necessity is the mother of invention,' Mr Rae said in a recent interview. 'It's given us a tough framework in which to respond.' To its credit, the NDP government has begun to crack down on ballooning health-care costs, which make up about a third of the total provincial budget. A decision to delay a CDollars 1bn pay-equity plan for the provincial civil service flies in the face of the NDP's traditional priorities. Mr Rae has given notice of plans to overhaul welfare programmes, another costly budget item, linking them more closely with job training. Transfers to universities, hospitals, schools and municipalities have barely risen in the past year. Meanwhile, new brooms are starting to sweep through Ontario Hydro, the beleaguered power utility, and the trade and industry ministry, responsible for attracting new investment to the province. These signs of a shift from ideology to reality at Queen's Park, the seat of government in Toronto, have yet to translate into an improved climate among the business community or the public at large. An accelerating economy should give the province a lift this year and next. But several years of disciplined and far-sighted government are also required if Ontario is fully to recover its reputation.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW, IT'S 'GET ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, LIE'  </P> <P> With regard to Charlie Francis' March 1 mention of former and present abusers  of steroids, I am absolutely certain that neither Evelyn Ashford nor her former  coach, three-time Olympian Pat Connolly would ever use any  performance-enhancing drug of any kind.  </P> <P> I have known Evelyn since her last year in high school (1975) as a competitor,  teammate and friend. I've traveled and trained with her and know her personal  convictions on the use of such drugs, and she is vehemently against it.  </P> <P> Her talent has never required artificial stimulation. She got her records the  old-fashioned way. She earned them.  </P> <P> As for Pat Connolly, my association with her began in '75 when she re-entered  the women's track and field program she herself initiated in '73 at UCLA. She  has been my mentor and friend ever since. She is a longtime opponent of drug  use, and I and many other honest people are stunned and outraged by Francis'  attempt to implicate Pat and Evelyn in his illegal and reprehensible coaching  practices.  </P> <P> KARIN SMITH  </P> <P> Four-time Olympian (javelin)  </P> <P> Salem, Ore.  </P></p>

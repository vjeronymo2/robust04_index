			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Officials sued over diversion to reduce deficit - Legal briefs California state officials are being sued for the return of Dollars 700m allegedly taken illegally from the state's 700 'special funds' to pay off a deficit in the state's 'general fund'. The action has been brought by the California State Electronics Association and others which have contributed to the special funds over the years. Money in the special funds comes from licensing fees and is earmarked by California law to be used only to regulate businesses and professions and provide consumer protection. The action claims the state legislature illegally authorised the state government to transfer money from the special funds to the general fund between 1991 and 1994. Mr Richard Fine, attorney for the plaintiffs, said that, as a result, the reserves of the special funds had dropped by more than Dollars 720m from Dollars 1.56bn on June 30 1991 to Dollars 848m on June 30 1994. 'This 46 per cent reduction will deny Californians the level of consumer protection they have a right to,' he added.</p>

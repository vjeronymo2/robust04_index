			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The Lusaka peace talks continue to be heading no  where. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has  already arrived back from his trips to secure help from  Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Moroccan King Hassan II.  Whatever he may have brought back has not yet had any effect on  the obstinacy displayed by the negotiating teams.    In Zimbabwe, the UN special representative talked of  progress  and accused the media of speculating when it talks of a  stalemate at the talks. There is arguing against facts, though:  No plenary meetings have been held in the Zambian capital over  the last 20 days because there has been nothing to narrow the  gaps between the two sides.    Simultaneously the least and most important thing to have  happened at the peace talks so far is that the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, has rejected the  ministerial portfolios, provinces, and communes proposed by the  government.    Lusaka-based analysts are advising that the talks go into  recess, at least until some new and active influence can be  brought to bear on the correlation of forces. They note that  international observers are also beginning to disagree among  themselves.    The Angolan Government team went to State House again today  to meet Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. The UN special  representative's spokesman was here at the hotel for talks with  the government team.</p>

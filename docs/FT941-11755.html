			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UN reassessing role in Somalia The UN Security Council is considering a radical contraction of its peacekeeping operation in Somalia (Unosom), after the departure of US forces in March, and a diminished role for the UN in brokering a political settlement among Somalia's fractious clans. Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy to Somalia, said a draft resolution before the Security Council envisaged a role for UN troops stationed in Somalia restricted to monitoring voluntary disarmament. It was a tacit admission that the UN's coercive strategies had failed. 'The UN is correcting its course, and adopting a more realistic approach to dealing with Somalia's problems,' he said yesterday in Nairobi. 'The period of coercive disarmament is over.' In addition, a donors' conference held in the Kenyan capital agreed to work directly with Somalis in the reconstruction of their country - in effect sidelining the UN. Politically, too, Unosom has been told to avoid the flurry of contacts now taking place between Somalia's clans in various capitals of east Africa. 'Discussions between Somalis are like three-dimen-sional chess,' Mr Oakley said. 'They may be difficult for outsiders to understand, but it is my impression that a lot of work is being done, and that differences are being narrowed.' Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi, Mogadishu's two rival warlords, have yet to meet for face-to-face talks, but spokesmen for both sides say prospects for a political settlement are good. Aid workers, however, fear Somalia will slide back into anarchy when the 4,000-strong US force departs, preceded by the Belgians and closely followed by the French, Italian and German contingents. Many believe the peacekeeping operation will fall apart without the air defences, communications and logistics provided by the Americans. Violence has returned. Bomb blasts rocked the town of Baidoa yesterday. Similar attacks over the past week hit the Christian charity World Vision and seriously wounded a Colombian aid worker. The charity said yesterday it was temporarily withdrawing its five expatriate workers. Food warehouses have been looted in Belet Weyne and aid workers have received death threats in the southern Jubba Valley, forcing their evacuation. In Mogadishu, US troops killed three Somalis on Monday when a diplomatic convoy they were escorting came under fire. Admiral Jonathan Howe, in charge of the UN operation in Somalia, regretted the violent incidents, but insisted that most of the country was peaceful.</p>

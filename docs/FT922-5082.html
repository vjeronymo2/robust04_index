			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Eurofighter heads for German crash-landing GERMANY'S aerospace industry has made serious tactical blunders in its campaign to participate in building the European fighter aircraft (EFA), and now has virtually no chance of winning a majority for the project in the Bundestag, said a leading parliamentary defence spokesman. Dr Werner Hoyer, the defence expert for the Free Democrats (FDP) in the Bundestag, warned that the issue would be decided on an emotional, not a factual basis. He is one of the six-man working group which met last night to recommend the degree of Germany's future participation in the project. In an interview shortly beforehand, he said there was no hope of a parliamentary majority in favour of allocating more funds to the EFA project next year in the current climate of budget cuts. The deep disagreements about the aircraft within the governing German coalition were made clear yesterday when two leading politicians differed fundamentally over what should be done. Mr Erich Riedl, a member of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) and state secretary in the Economics Ministry, said tens of thousands of jobs in the German aerospace industry would be lost if Germany pulled out of the project. 'Every politician thinks he will win elections at home if he is against the EFA,' he said in a radio interview. 'But it is wrong, even irresponsible, to think like that.' The opposite viewpoint was put by Mr Peter Hintze, newly appointed as secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). He said the EFA was not appropriate 'in the changed financial and security situation in a united Germany'. The CSU has succeeded in having a decision on the project deferred, with tomorrow's joint meeting of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group postponed to June 16. Dr Hoyer believes that in spite of the delay, the fate of German participation is sealed. 'The decisive point in our report is whether the working group recommends, or whether the defence minister recommends, allocating some DM100m (Pounds 34m) in the 1993 budget for pre-production costs (for EFA), to purchase the tools needed for later construction,' Dr Hoyer said. 'The industry insists these tools will be needed. The decision to put this into the budget will be seen as a point of no return. But there is no majority in the Bundestag in favour. 'It is a catastrophic mistake by the German (aerospace) industry to have insisted on this. They thought they could get a positive decision now.' Dr Hoyer said that no alternative aircraft should be automatically excluded. However, he said he would not vote for any solution which would be more expensive than the EFA.</p>

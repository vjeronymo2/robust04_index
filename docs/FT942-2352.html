			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Monday Interview: Italy's player in a different world cup - Guy de Jonquieres talks to Renato Ruggiero, who seems set to become the EU's candidate as founder director-general of the WTO Italy is not over-endowed with experienced public figures equipped, by temperament and background, with a genuinely international outlook. Fewer still can plausibly present themselves as convinced free-traders. Exclude the many casualties of the country's political scandals, and the ranks look even thinner. Renato Ruggiero is a rare exception. A former diplomat, trade minister and latterly Fiat's top international representative, he has spent much of his career negotiating in Brussels, Geneva, Russia and at world economic summits. As well as gaining an inside view of the global power game, he has picked up a working knowledge of half-a-dozen languages and been decorated by the British and Japanese governments. He can also claim to be an advocate of an open world economy. He played a prominent role during a crucial phase of the Uruguay Round trade talks and was one of the first Europeans to back the idea of a more powerful World Trade Organisation to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In just over six months' time, that idea is due to become reality. The 64-year-old Ruggiero is now engaged in an energetic diplomatic shuttle to canvass support among Gatt's 123 members for his bid to become the WTO's founding director-general. The first declared candidate for the job, he has won enthusiastic backing from Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, who no doubt hopes the Italian government will return the favour by supporting his own campaign for the commission presidency. In recent weeks, Sir Leon has coached his man like a boxing promoter grooming a heavyweight for a title fight - an analogy encouraged by Ruggiero's heavy-set physique and pugilist's appearance. If all goes to plan, his candidacy will be endorsed by EU leaders at their Corfu summit next weekend. However, both Ruggiero and Sir Leon know that that will not be enough to win the prize. 'The players in international trade are no longer the usual old ones,' says Ruggiero. 'It would be wrong nowadays to suppose you have won the game if you have US and European support. You have to pay attention to Latin America, Asia and Africa.' Many developing countries - which comprise four fifths of Gatt's membership  -think that after decades of European leadership of that organisation one of their own should head the WTO. Brazil has already nominated Rubens Ricupero, its respected finance minister, and Carlos Salinas, Mexico's outgoing president, is testing the water, apparently with US encouragement. They may make a virtue of their national and regional affiliations. Ruggiero, by contrast, has to go out of his way to prove that his origins are not a handicap - a task made no easier by developing countries' suspicions about the depths of the EU's commitment to free trade. 'The new director-general will succeed or fail, depending on whether he represents not just one set of nations, but a much larger group,' Ruggiero says. 'He will have a responsibility to help developing countries enter the multilateral trade system in a real way and not as in the past, when there was trade among the rich and aid between the rich and poor. That situation has changed completely.' He is also steering a careful line on the links between labour standards and trade - an issue which has sparked bitter controversy in Gatt. He says that those in the west who seek to promote stronger workers' rights worldwide need to recognise that the objective is best achieved by increasing the prosperity of poorer countries through free trade. Such sentiments seem to have gone down well with the developing country representatives he set out to woo in Geneva last week. 'He seems quite folksy,' said one Asian ambassador approvingly, while emphasising that the WTO contest remained wide open. Ruggiero believes his strongest credentials are his record as an effective negotiator and administrator, and his commitment to act as 'honest broker' between WTO members' different interests. These qualities, he argues, will be invaluable in the early stages of the WTO's existence, when the requirement will be for efficient management, rather than revolutionary change. The top priority will be to implement the complex provisions of the Uruguay Round, which runs to 28 separate agreements and 27,000 pages of text. Equally important will be the proposed creation of stronger procedures for settling trade disputes. The effectiveness of those mechanisms will determine the WTO's political authority and, Ruggiero believes, its success in persuading its members - above all the US - to forsake bilateral trade weapons in favour of multilateral rules. The importance of those rules will, he argues, become even greater as global economic change accelerates and world trade policy focuses on new challenges. In the future, he says, the biggest will notbe to resist a relapse into 1930s-style trade protection, because liberalisation has already demolished so many obstacles at frontiers. That step, he insists, is irreversible. Politicians, in Europe or elsewhere, who pretend otherwise are deluding themselves: 'It would be a mistake to believe Europe can still choose between openness or protection. Europe's options are closed. Only one is left - to prepare industries and their management for global competition. There is no other way. We have already lost too much time.' In his view, the WTO's central task will be to organise a framework for that competition. The biggest threat Ruggiero sees is from regional trade blocs. Though the barriers around their markets are falling, he says, there is a risk that regions will try to use their political muscle to impose trading rules on the rest of the world. He also believes the WTO will need to take a lead in defining international competition policy disciplines. 'Until now, Gatt has been mainly concerned with the interests of governments. The future system must also take into account the attitudes of big multinational companies, some of which have sales bigger than the GDP of medium-sized countries.' Ruggiero is less forthcoming about how that prospect is viewed by Fiat - and the several other big companies which he serves as director or adviser. However, he insists that should he fail in his bid to become the trade system's global gamekeeper, he would be content to return to hunting with the corporate pack. 'I have a position which satisfies me completely. I am not looking for a change of job.' But he swiftly adds: 'I am looking for this job.'</p>

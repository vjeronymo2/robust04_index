			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Fears over loss of funds for union ballots THE ABILITY of unions to use strike ballots as a bargaining tactic will be undermined by the withdrawal of public funds for ballots, according to industrial relations experts. Some unions have exploited the law requiring strike ballots by winning large majorities for industrial action, putting pressure on employers even when few workers intend to strike. Mr Bob Simpson, senior labour law lecturer at the London School of Economics, said the withdrawal of funding plus the requirement for postal rather than workplace strike ballots, included in the Employment Bill, would reduce union bargaining power. 'Unions could eventually find themselves unable to make viable threats of industrial action because employers will know they cannot afford to ballot,' he said. The phased withdrawal of ballot money came as a surprise to unions and employers. One employers' representative warned that it might increase the incidence of unofficial action. Most union ballots have been workplace ballots which have not been eligible for state support. Workplace ballots, however, cost only about 60 per cent of postal ballots. The Electoral Reform Society calculates that postal ballots cost about 50p a head, including postage and printing costs. The trade union certification officer said the TGWU general union - the largest union - claimed Pounds 900,298 for postal ballots last year, nearly a quarter of the Pounds 4m total. The union said the claim was high because of the cost of running elections for its general and deputy general secretaries. In 1990, the union claimed only Pounds 15,994. Last year the AEEU electrical and engineering union claimed Pounds 461,374, the GMB general union Pounds 302,915 and the Bifu banking union Pounds 107,732. Mr Simpson also said that the withdrawal of Pounds 2m of public money from union training would not be felt for 'some time' but if union officials were not trained they would lack negotiating skills. More than  1/2 m union officials have taken government-funded courses since they were set up in 1976.</p>

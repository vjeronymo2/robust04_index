			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Norway's PM in warning on EC entry: David Gardner interviews Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland on the fishing demand Brussels may not grant NORWAY'S determination to retain exclusive right to its rich fishery resources could prevent it from joining the European Community, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, warned yesterday. This confirmed fears that Norway's application for membership will be the toughest to negotiate in the current talks on enlarging the EC. 'On the issue of fish we are talking about a vital issue, something which left Norway outside European co-operation in 1972 and could so so again,' Mrs Brundtland said in an interview. Norwegian voters rejected EC membership in 1972, when the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the Community. Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are all negotiating to join the EC. Polls this month show Norwegian opinion running 53 per cent against EC membership, with 36 per cent for and 11 per cent undecided. Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government is plummeting in the polls ahead of a general election in September which will be dominated by the EC membership debate. The right-of-centre coalition she replaced in November 1990 was brought down by internal differences over Europe. Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's fisheries minister, said in a separate interview that Norwegians 'have no fish to give away'. He said Oslo had already given away too much through restricted fishing rights in Norwegian waters conceded to EC countries when Norway joined the European Economic Area (EEA), set up between the EC and European Free Trade Association countries. Norway's Storting (parliament) was expected to ratify the EEA treaty last night. 'If the EC asks for more quotas it could stop Norway joining the Community,' Mr Olsen said bluntly. The 200-mile limit around Norway's coast is 'our arable land', he added. Mrs Brundtland supported Mr Olsen's hard line, saying: 'Norway was squeezed sufficiently over the EEA treaty and you cannot repeat that. He is not alone in his evaluation.' The fisheries issue alone is certain to spark hostility from fishing nations like Spain, which wants access to Norwegian waters in compensation for unimpeded access for Norway's fish products in the EC single market. But Norway's insistence on reserving half of all exploration rights to its rich oil and gas reserves for its state oil company Statoil, is another point of friction. Draft legislation being prepared by Brussels would outlaw this preference as discriminatory. Oslo will insist the draft directive is shelved until Norway enters the EC, senior officials say. Unlike its fellow applicants which hoped to conclude entry negotiations this year, hold referendums next year, and accede to the EC in 1995, Norway is resigned to a long haul, probably extending well into next year. Although Norway's hardline negotiating tactics have caused dismay in Brussels and provoked the hostility of member states like Spain and the Benelux countries, Mrs Brundtland feels it is better to get the difficulties of Norwegian membership out in the open from the start. For the government to have any chance of winning over the electorate requires 'clear answers around the negotiating questions which have been raised,' she added.</p>

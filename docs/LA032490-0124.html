			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-DEA CHIEF PRAISES AID FROM MILITARY, WARNS OF RENEWED THREAT FROM HEROIN;  </P> <P> DRUGS: JOHN LAWN WILL BECOME AN EXECUTIVE OF THE N.Y. YANKEES. HE DOUBTS BUSH  WILL PICK ANOTHER FBI AGENT TO HEAD AGENCY.  </P> <P> Only two years ago, a Navy commander who had done a bang-up job of training  Bolivian naval officers to run anti-drug river patrols turned down an offer to  extend his six-month tour with the Drug Enforcement Administration.  </P> <P> As a career move, "it would have been to his detriment to continue to assist  us," recalled DEA Administrator John C. Lawn, who was so pleased with the  commander's performance that he had personally urged him to extend his  temporary assignment.  </P> <P> Today, however, a stint with the DEA, as part of the military's expanded  participation in federal anti-drug efforts, would be viewed as career-enhancing  instead of damaging, Lawn said. Although the military has had to adjust to its  role in the drug fight, the joint effort is starting to mesh, he said.  </P> <P> Lawn, in an interview this week marking his career switch from federal drug  enforcement chief to New York Yankees executive, discussed the military  campaign and his "sense" that President Bush will break with precedent by not  turning to the FBI to find Lawn's successor.  </P> <P> In addition, he underscored the renewed threat to the United States of heroin  smuggling, rejecting suggestions by critics that the DEA's warnings about  heroin were motivated by the desire for a bigger budget.  </P> <P> Lawn's praise of military cooperation was voiced a week after the Pentagon  announced unprecedented drug-interdiction initiatives, including an increase in  the number of military personnel assigned to full-time details with other  federal agencies involved in the anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> Only 40 U.S. military personnel served with drug-fighting units of the Justice  and Commerce departments in 1989, but about 275 will be assigned to those  agencies this year.  </P> <P> More significant than those numbers, however, is a change of attitude that Lawn  said stemmed from the emphasis placed on anti-drug work by Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> "Now, it's a two-year assignment and it's career-enhancing," Lawn said. As a  result, he said, it is in an officer's "best interest to seek out such an  assignment."  </P> <P> To be sure, the expanded role of the military in anti-drug campaigns has caused  some headaches. The Navy's plan to station a drug-interdicting armada off the  coast of Colombia was denounced by Latin American leaders and was shelved.  </P> <P> "The military are take-charge people," Lawn said, "so there was a learning  curve and sensitivity training that the military and intelligence communities  had to go through."  </P> <P> Military officials "had to recognize that sovereignty issues are most important  and that the role of the DEA is not unilateral enforcement action, but one of  working with local counterparts" overseas, he said.  </P> <P> "My guess is that the military planners remembered the difficulties of  Southeast Asia (Vietnam) and felt that, if given the mission, they should carry  it out without guidance from other components that had been involved," Lawn  continued. "That period of sensitivity training is over, and the military and  intelligence communities clearly understand the role they will be playing."  </P> <P> Lawn said that he did not expect the President to turn to the FBI when choosing  the next DEA chief, although both Lawn and his predecessor, Francis (Bud)  Mullen, were veteran FBI officials before taking command of the drug agency.  </P> <P> "The visibility of the DEA in Congress and at the White House is now such that  I believe the candidates will be individuals of substantially higher visibility  than people from a domestic law enforcement environment," Lawn said.  </P> <P> By moving outside the FBI to find Lawn's replacement, Bush would underscore the  independence of the DEA, which, during President Ronald Reagan's  Administration, was often regarded as a subordinate unit of the FBI.  </P> <P> Lawn said that he had been asked to "be available" to discuss the job's  requirements when Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh begins drawing up the list of  possible nominees to recommend to Bush, a process that Lawn and a Justice  Department spokesman said has not begun.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Thornburgh picked the DEA's second-ranking official, Terrence  Burke, to become acting administrator after Lawn officially departed on Friday.  Burke, 51, has held several DEA posts and served overseas with both the drug  agency and the CIA, which awarded him the Intelligence Star of Valor, the  civilian equivalent of the Medal of Honor.  </P> <P> Lawn, who is retiring after 27 years of government service, will become vice  president and chief of operations for the Yankees. He is an acquaintance of  Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and will handle business affairs for the  team.  </P> <P> Staff writer Melissa Healy contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Myong-hwa] </F>   [Text] North Korea is celebrating the cloistered country's  No. 2 man's birthday, Feb. 16, in a less flamboyant manner  compared with his previous birthday parties, a development  raising speculation about his position and future. The  Stalinist country's newspapers, radio stations and televisions  are still engaged in the campaign to inculcate loyalty in the  people toward Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of the North's  supreme leader Kim Il-song. It is reported, however, that  various celebrations this year are being held mostly on a  domestic basis and on a smaller scale.    The small scale of the celebration has surprised many South  Korean experts on North Korea affairs. After no clear step was  taken for a power transfer from the aging leader Kim Il-song to  Chong-il at the Workers' (Communist) Party central committee  meeting and the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1993,  many analysts in Seoul said that Pyongyang was highly likely to  announce a final power transfer schedule around Kim Chong-il's  birthday this year.    Their predictions were based on the North Korean news  media's  sudden spate of reports beginning late last year that the junior  Kim had joined the party central committee in 1964 and was  designation on his father's heir in early 1974.    Churning out those reports, the North's media announced that  the junior Kim would mark the 30th anniversary of his political  debut as well as the 20th anniversary of his heir-designation on  his 52nd birthday in February 1994.    The gist of the so-called "February final power transfer  schedule" is that an important turning point for the resolution  of the North Korean nuclear issue will be issued in the name of  Kim Chong-il and that concrete plans for Kim Il-song to hand  over the presidency or party general secretaryship to his son  will be made public on that day, according to North Korea  observers here.    Recently, however, the thorny North Korean nuclear problem  seems to be dragging on with no signs of easing tensions on the  Korean Peninsula. Also, there are no clear-cut indications that  the junior Kim will consolidate his position around his birthday.    Under these circumstances, some analysts even wonder if the  junior Kim may be facing a crisis.    In North Korea, the period from Feb. 16 to April 15, Kim  Il-song's birthday, has been designated the "Loyalty Festival  Period" since 1976, when the junior Kim's birthday joined his  father's as a national holiday. During this period, all North  Koreans are mobilized to participate in various congratulatory  events across the country. Among major events held or now under  way are the fourth 2.16 [February 16] Arts Award, the Athletic  Championship for the Mt. Paektu Award, and the third National  Exhibition on Youth Science and Technology.    As a prelude to the celebrations, the 2.16 Arts Award opened  Jan. 18 and its preliminary contests are under way. Korean  musicians in the instrumental and vocal music fields from at  home and abroad usually compete with one another. This year,  however, overseas Koreans were barred from attending, thereby  remarkably downsizing the congratulatory event.    "Annual events are being held there as scheduled, but on a  noticeably smaller scale," a high-ranking official at the  National Unification Board (NUB) said early this week. He  added, however, that he would not jump to the conclusion that  the downscaling has some political implications related to Kim  Chong-il's status.    In 1993, with Pyongyang heavily bent on escalating the cult  of the junior Kim, the streets of Pyongyang were bedecked with  2,160,000 flowers of various kinds to represent his birthday,  Feb. 16. Radio Pyongyang reported at the time that the city  authorities had been busy cultivating these flowers for the past  several months. All gardeners in the country were mobilized to  prepare for the birthday festivity.    In sharp contrast, the Administration Council, the North's  cabinet, simply ordered flower gardens to be trimmed and ditches  to be cleared in downtown Pyongyang late last month.    As of Monday morning,the northern side of the South-North  Liaison Office at the truce village of Panmunjom had not  informed its southern counterpart of any decision to close its  operation for the Kim Chong-il birthday celebration. It has  been customary for the North to inform the South liaison  officials of a closure two days before the birthday, the NUB  official said, adding that the lack of an announcement suggests  this year's celebration of the junior Kim's birthday has been  scaled down.</p>

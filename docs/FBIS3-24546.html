Yarovenko, Moscow State Correspondence </F> Institute of the Food Industry]    [Abstract] The interaction of the components of the  principle of preservation of sterility in a multistage system is  described as fermenter sterilization that is coincident with the  inflow of the nutritive medium and the outflow of the mature  culture fluid, with a clear-cut separation of the new and old  fluids. The principle itself is such that if the movement of the  fluid coincides with the successive prophylactic sterilization  of the unoccupied parts of the viaduct, the controlled sterility  of the fermentation medium is preserved, and the medium remains  uncontaminated for an infinitely long time. As a corollary of  that, if the prophylactic sterilization of individual parts of  the viaduct coincides with the continuous movement of the fluid,  the controlled (or initial) sterility is maintained for an  infinitely long period of time. The researcher suggests that all  biotechnology production be converted to the contamination-free  continuous method, which will also result in a twofold gain in  productivity.

			<p>Polemics'': ``The Academy Again Demands the Blood of Saltykov'']  txt}[Text] From what we see on television and read in the  newspapers we know that President of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Yuriy Osipov is extremely worried about the financial  situation of academic science and is particularly outraged by  the fact that in the draft of the budget for 1994 the lifeline  of Russian basic science--the separate line ``Russian Academy of  Sciences''--has disappeared.  <F P=103> 947A0029C </F> <F P=104>  Moscow SEGODNYA </F>  Language: <F P=105>Russian and read </F> Article Type:CSO     Yuriy Osipov blames directly for the loss of the line two  Borises--Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Minister of  Science and Technical Policy Boris Saltykov. In the opinion of  the presidium of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences], which on  14 December was set forth in the appeal of academicians to Boris  Yeltsin, these two ministers are purposefully and systematically  destroying the academy. The decree of the presidium of the RAS  of 21 December contains the threat of the public impeachment of  the mentioned Borises.    In the appeal to the presidium the indignant scientists  propose to put an end to this disgrace, to transfer to the  jurisdiction of the academy of sciences all basic research of  the country, and to eliminate the Ministry of Science. This  demand is being advanced by the leadership of the academy for  far from the first time. But for the first time all this talk  has been brought from the offices to the public at large. And,  perhaps, for the first time the ``immortals'' are so close to  the desired goal. The battle under the carpet has ended, war has  been declared.    They are bombarding the Ministry of Science with angry  telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare you leave academic  science without means for existence?'' Deputy Minister Andrey  Fonotov shrugs his shoulders in bewilderment. In his opinion,  the panic arose due to a misunderstanding.    ``We thought that this problem was over long ago. For the  new  dummy of the budget, in which this line existed, was sent out to  all interested departments back during the summer. And not the  academy, but we directed the attention of the Ministry of  Finance to this detail. The draft was very poor, we sent it off  with a large number of critical remarks, on 28 October the  ministry agreed with our criticism, and the line about the  academy was returned to its legitimate place. It is strange that  Yuriy Osipov did not try to find out from the minister of  science the true state of affairs before scribbling one  denunciation after another.''    But, to all appearances, the president of the RAS did not  define more precisely the state of affairs because this was not  in his interests. The available facts force one to suppose that  he needed a panic precisely at this, post-election moment, when  Boris Yeltsin had announced the coming reduction of the number  of ministries and their staffs. Panic was needed around any  problem, be it even a nonexisting one. It is hard for us to  believe that the leaders of the academy for all their friendly  relations with the president and prime minister of the country  did not have access to the latest dummy of the budget.    But the facts are as follows. Back on 14 September Nikolay  Malyshev, adviser of the president of Russia for science and  education, sent Yeltsin a note, in which what the presidium of  the RAS is now talking about was proposed--the transfer of all  basic science to the jurisdiction of the academy and the  elimination of the Ministry of Science. Then the dissolution of  the parliament occurred, and the chair of Boris Saltykov for the  first time in many months ceased to rock. The minister of  science as a man of the Gaydar team during this period without a  constitution was absolutely inviolable. As soon as the election  concluded in the way we know, the note of Malyshev with the  presidential resolution to ``consider'' lay on the desk of Yegor  Gaydar.    The suggestions of Malyshev, taken separately, could hardly  damage the ministry--the advanced accusations did not conform  too much to reality. The ministry was accused of the inordinate  inflation of staffs at the moment when staffs had been reduced  appreciably--due to low wages people are now fleeing the  Ministry of Science. The ministry was accused of working ``in  the old way'' and of the fact that here they were not dealing  with anything, except for ``petty tutelage and the distribution  of finances.'' But it is hard to call ``petty tutelage'' the  establishment of new structures like the state science centers,  which literally saved from collapse several tens of the largest  scientific organizations of the country. It is hard to call work  ``in the old way'' the development of a completely new method  for us of distributing finances with the help of scientists  themselves--the establishment of the Russian Basic Research Fund  is meant. This fund, incidentally, in spite of all the criticism  leveled at it, revived much stalled research. ``Instead of  complaining,'' one scientist said,`` we are not writing  applications for grants.''    At a pre-election meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov  spoke about the establishment of a similar fund for humanities  scholars, about a Technology Fund, and about the possibility of  establishing a fund for the payment of $1,000 stipends to  representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now  everything may end in failure.    Malyshev's proposals, which are supported by surprisingly  similar proposals of the presidium of the RAS and have been  multiplied by an exactly chosen moment, may thus overthrow the  ministry that is hateful to the academy. According to  information from the state apparatus, there is on the desk of  Boris Yeltsin a document on the elimination of the Ministry of  Science and the establishment in its place of a department for  science. Which Malyshev, of course, is being appointed to head.  Already a once former minister of science. For a whole month.    ``The ministry in its present form is not the most ideal  structure for the extrication of science from a state close to  clinical death,'' believes Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the  Russian Consultative Council of the International Science  Foundation and an active supporter of reforms in science, whom  one can sooner call an opponent than an admirer of the Ministry  of Science. ``They often and at times quite justly criticize the  ministry. Like any Russian department, it is very slow, and any  innovation--be it a statute on the tax benefits of international  charitable organizations on the establishment of a new  fund--comes to it with extreme difficulty. However, this is the  only department that is taking steps in the correct direction,  which is not typical of the Soviet methods of management. If the  ministry is eliminated and the financing of basic research  leaves the academy, the only thing for Russian scientists to do  is to put on their mourning clothes--the hopes for the  improvement of the situation, which as it is are small, will  decrease practically to zero. Practical experience has shown:  The only thing that the leadership of the RAS can do effectively  is to beg well for money. The presidium of the academy is not  capable of carrying out reforms that make it possible to  preserve the scientific potential, inasmuch as any of the  reforms weakens its power. It is capable only of dragging out  the agony and making it irreversible.''    A short addendum to this article.    The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, which is constantly  crying about budgetary support, for example, has at its disposal  several joint ventures, including together with an Austrian  firm--the five-star Palace Hotel. Another five-star hotel is  located on the grounds of the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry  of the RAS, an automobile showroon also operates there. Where  the considerable currency assets are going is unknown. In  particular, during a check of the Palace Hotel $860,000 in  uncollected cash, which belong to the academy, were discovered.  One must think that scientists did not need it very much or it  was put aside for a rainy day.</p>

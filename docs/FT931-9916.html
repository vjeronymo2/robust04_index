			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Exports 'aiding recovery': CBI finds regional rises in foreign orders since sterling's devaluation EXPORT demand is shaping the regional pattern of economic recovery in Britain, with industry in north-west England, Wales and Scotland reporting increased foreign orders following sterling's devaluation after it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September, says a survey published yesterday. The latest quarterly survey of regional trends from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, found that total manufacturing orders and output fell in all UK regions except Wales in the four months to January. But export orders rose in Wales, Scotland and north-west England between last October and January, while manufacturers in the north-west and south-west increased deliveries to foreign customers. Manufacturers in all regions expect increased export orders in the first four months of this year. On balance, industrialists in all regions expect to deliver more goods abroad - except in the east Midlands where export deliveries are expected to be unchanged. The survey of 1,173 UK companies, which was carried out between December 21 and January 11, found increased optimism about the business situation and export prospects over the next 12 months in all regions. Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the fact that increased optimism was so clearly linked to improved export prospects gave some hope that the expected recovery would not be another false dawn. According to Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs, business confidence improved most in south-west England, the west Midlands, Wales and south-east England. The smallest rise in optimism was reported in the east Midlands, northern England, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Anglia and Northern Ireland. The survey found that manufacturers in all regions expect increased orders in the first four months of this year but output is expected to grow less robustly as companies run down stocks. Companies in northern England anticipate a sharp reduction in stocks over the coming months with the result that output in that region is expected to continue falling. Capital spending on plant and machinery is also expected to keep falling in all regions except East Anglia, Wales and south-west England. Mr Burton said that planned increases in investment might have been triggered by the government's decision in the Autumn Statement to increase capital allowances for a limited period.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 31 May (DPA) -- The Dominican Armed  Forces have seized 33 vehicles and a boat as they were preparing  to take fuel and other goods to Haiti. Of the 33 vehicles, five  trucks belong to Haitian merchants, and the remainder, made up  of trucks, jeeps, and cars, belongs to Dominican citizens. All  vehicles seized were taken to Armed Forces headquarters in Santo  Domingo for investigation.    Regarding the boat, reports indicate that it was a barge  carrying 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel and heading toward "Fort  Liberte" in Haiti. According to the Armed Forces Ministry,  sailors said it was heading north of Monte Cristi and that  later, it turned toward the south, entering Haitian territorial  waters.    Personnel on a Navy craft fired several shots, forcing the  barge and its seven Dominican crewmen to head toward a Dominican  port, where the men were arrested and the barge seized. Reports  indicate that all these cases are under investigation.</p>

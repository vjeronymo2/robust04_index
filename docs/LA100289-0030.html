			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHOREOGRAPHER ADRIA WILSON AT WESTSIDE  </P> <P> Adria Wilson, who self-produced a program called "Art in Motion" Saturday at  the Westside Academy of Dance, boasts many ambitions.  </P> <P> Little wonder at that. As a CalArts graduate, Wilson has been exposed to the  avant-garde. As a TV and night-club performer she bears commercial influences.  She has also taught dance and appeared in Helsinki and Tokyo, which gives her  an international breadth.  </P> <P> But few of these experiences coalesced into a smoothly sophisticated or even  artistically savvy whole for this eight-member ad-hoc group.  </P> <P> In "Preliminary" -- a strange and stilted title for dirty dancin' to a fusion  salsa beat -- Wilson had her best shot. Here she outfitted the ensemble in chic  street wear, and the dancers finally did not look like trick-or-treaters.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, their sequence was so brief and under-rehearsed that it failed to  end the evening on a triumphant note, even without a timing snafu in the  blackout climax.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the dancer-choreographer either squandered her ideas or didn't think  them through. In "Spider," she let glitzy show-biz effects undermine Matt  Easton's atmospheric score. Otherwise this portrait of a Black Widow might have  conjured the arachnid menace she had in mind -- especially with the  considerable talent of Kenneth Bowman and Theodora M. Fredericks, whose  long-limbed entanglings looked positively deadly.  </P> <P> "Piece of a Dream," however, was hopelessly sophomoric and confused. Actor Ron  Mesa's virtuosic delivery of his Mephistophelean monologue did little to pull  this hocus-pocus, balloon-and-smoke bonanza out of its embarrassing  pretensions. DONNA PERLMUTTER  </P></p>

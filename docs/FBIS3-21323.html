			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arun Nehru: "The Challenges Ahead"] </F>   [Text] In a few days the new year will commence and with it  there will be new challenges and opportunities. We are a nation  of 900 million people, living in an age where unprecedented  changes have taken place and like other large populated  countries such as China we have to find the "Indian remedy" to  play a more meaningful part in global affairs. The last few  years have been traumatic and the changes, both political and  economic, in the global order mean a realistic change in our  political and economic thinking. It would be fatal to delink the  two or to think that we can take an isolated stand on global  issues. There are no simplistic solutions, no magic formulae;  hard assessments and firm decisions will be necessary.    The break-up of the Soviet Union, the winds of change in  Eastern Europe to a democratic system, the growing problems and  the great economic hardship in Cuba and North Korea, the  emergence of the United States as the sole superpower, must  necessarily mean new political alignments. There are no premiums  on conflicts, and it should be no surprise that peace, economic  development and prosperity will be the challenges of the future.  We have peace in South Africa. Both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Nelson  Mandela richly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. We have peace in  West Asia, the PLO and Israel, North and South Korea are  talking; the British Government is looking towards the end of  the conflict in Ireland.    On the economic front we have witnessed the emergence of  large trading blocs. The United States, Canada and Mexico have  taken a significant step forward on NAFTA (North American Free  Trade Agreement). The European concept of a single entity is  slowly but surely becoming a reality. Japan and the Pacific rim  are becoming areas of high growth and prosperity. China has  emerged as a major economic power. At the same time cyclic  changes and a "peaceful environment" have created a recession in  the developed nations. The economic chaos in Russia and the new  States, the monetary crisis in Eastern Europe, the perilous  situation in Africa, and the Third World living on borrowed  funds, are all looking for better days. All economic indicators  are showing that the future lies in Asia--the Chinese economy is  booming, so is Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Japan despite  a recession continues to generate record surpluses. In a  difficult situation it is only natural that economic reform and  the dismantling of controls will be the objective of the  developing reforms. Investigation in the current recession will  only flow to high growth areas. The U.S. President, Mr.  Clinton's success on NAFTA made it almost certain that the  agreement on GATT would follow and despite the usual  brinkmanship to satisfy local political pressures, the agreement  was signed. The Third World will sadly suffer and suffer because  its economic clout is minimal. In the future there will be  furious competition to draw investments from financial  institutions and countries. India will compete with the others  for its share and it will not be easy.    India's relevance as a political power and an economic  entity  is being closely monitored by the global community and future  success and failure will largely be determined by our own  internal strength and achievement. Self-reliance was the slogan  and the driving point of Panditji's policy and it is with  gratitude that we must acknowledge that the cumulative wisdom of  our past leaders has provided us with the infrastructure to deal  with the future not only in terms of industrial capacity but  also in the creation of the world's third largest technical  manpower. Comparisons are unfair, but perhaps it would be  relevant to mention that China has never indulged in  vilification of its past. The reform process did not follow the  World Bank manual but rather relied on a "local formula" for  implementation. The world today is seeking China both for  investment and trading. China with its population and industrial  growth will be one of the largest consuming countries for a  variety of products. The key factor in its success was that  reforms benefited the vast majority of its population.    The world and the business community look towards India for  political stability for its existing Government and more  important for a continuation of its democratic structure.  Military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes have a tendency  to give an impression of firmness and stability, but in the long  term tend to degenerate into a chaotic and uncertain future. The  past decade in India has not been an easy one. We have witnessed  two tragic assassinations. We have seen the forces of caste and  religion dominate our electoral stage. We have witnessed serious  law and order situations. We have seen four Governments come and  go. We have survived all these traumas and it is to the credit  of our people that they have continuously reaffirmed their  adherence to democratic institutions and to a secular future.    To predict national trends for the general elections on the  basis of current election results will require the services of  an eminent astrologer. The possibility of mid-term elections is  now no longer a reality after the recent events. The  Congress(I), generally expected to do little, won handsomely in  Madhya Pradesh and Himachal. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]  after the dismissal of its Government was expected to retain the  States where it was in power and it was tactically natural for  it to fight a high profile election and advance its claims for  the general elections. The loss in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal  was a disaster, but the failure to form a Government in Uttar  Pradesh, was calamitous. In Rajasthan it barely won. The Delhi  victory was spectacular. The Janata Dal predictably simply  ceased to exist.    On the surface the Congress(I) and the Prime Minister are  the  big winners. The BJP has suffered a serious setback, and the  Janata Dal is hurting towards self destruction. The regional  forces gaining firm roots in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, the  North-East, Bihar and Orissa have made a historic gain with  Uttar Pradesh and Mr. Mulayam Singh. Between 1994 and the  general elections there will be State elections in Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar. To predict winners and losers at  this stage would be presumptuous. The policy initiatives however  cannot be put off as a strategy for the future must evolve.    The Congress(I) and the Prime Minister will have to  determine  if the party is strong enough to emerge with a simple majority.  Both in 1989 and 1991 the dismal results in Uttar Pradesh and  Bihar denied the party the success it sought and the position  there now is perilous. An alliance with Mr. Mulayam Singh or Mr.  Lallu Yadav may work in the short term but the future  implications could be catastrophic. Ram Manohar Lohia prevailing  over the Nehruvian concept could have a snow-balling effect. The  Congress traditionally looks to the future. The Congress(I)  became the Congress(R) when Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister  and now it is Congress (PVNR) [P.V. Narasimha Rao]. Sheer logic  indicates that the Prime Minister would have to pursue an  independent course of action if he is to lead the party in 1996  and avoid dissident activity in the immediate future. The  failure in Uttar Pradesh cannot be attributed to the Prime  Minister, but the coming Andhra Assembly elections will be a key  factor in determining his capacity to lead.    The Janata Dal will claim all-India status but is primarily  confined to Orissa and Bihar, both States run by charismatic  leaders who will now ponder over their future course of action.  The party has ceased to exist in Uttar Pradesh and in the coming  months the party or what is left of it will continue to  splinter. Mr. Ajit Singh may once again decide to support the  Congress(I) in a "principled" stand. The National Front has a  bleak future but NTR [N.T. Rama Rao] in Andhra, Mr. Biju Patnaik  in Orissa, Mr. Lallu Yadav in Bihar have a strong regional base  and will naturally protect their interests. Fortunately the  projected caste war has not come about and as the BJP may  realise governance is the key issue. Caste and religion in their  ugliest proportions have created a limited following. But the  vast majority of the electorate have opted for governance and in  Uttar Pradesh where the decline, almost total eclipse of the  Congress(I) and the Janata Dal has given limited opportunities,  the results have been splintered. The biggest State with 85  seats has gone into a state of uncertainty.    The new year is coming and with it must come the optimism of  a better and brighter future. The future rests with all of us.  We are a nation of 900 millions. We have the ability. We have  the talent. We have the determination and will to succeed. The  cumulative wisdom of India does not lie in the Cabinet or in the  hands of the few. Everyone has a single vote and it is this  power that determines victory and defeat. Victory cannot lie in  the twin evils of caste and religion. The lessons of history  indicate that we were enslaved for a thousand years because of  these contradictions. There can be no future for India unless  there is economic prosperity and growth. These are the global  issues and challenges and it is to this direction that we must  channel our vast reservoirs of talent.</p>

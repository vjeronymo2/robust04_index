			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Burlington footwear group goes into receivership BURLINGTON International Group, the footwear manufacturer, yesterday called in administrative receivers after amassing unsustainable levels of debt, which are estimated at Pounds 10m. A total of 1,200 jobs in the Midlands, Ayrshire and London were put at risk by the company's collapse. Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers, immediately made 200 employees redundant, mainly in Northampton. In a further blow to the Midlands economy, Albert Martin Holdings, a clothing supplier, announced it would make 195 compulsory redundancies by stopping production at its Nottingham factory in June. The group has a workforce of 4,300. Burlington International Group was formed when a management group, backed by Schroder Ventures, the venture capital company, paid Pounds 10m for 15 British Shoe Corporation factories owned by Sears. At that time the BSC factories had annual sales of Pounds 50m but Burlington expanded rapidly by acquiring a string of financially troubled rivals. The company's pension fund later made significant investments in the business. The receivers said they had been informed by the trustees that all pension commitments were fully covered. Northampton-based Burlington was the UK's third-largest footwear manufacturer until it closed six of its nine Northampton factories in January, shedding more than 500 jobs. The company also has production plants at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire; Wembley, north London; Atherstone, near Birmingham; and Kettering, Northamptonshire. It ran six loss-making retail outlets. Industry observers believed that the receivers might find buyers for Burlington's Kettering and Kilmarnock plants but would find it more difficult to sell the Northampton units. The receivers said several potential buyers had expressed interest in parts of the group. Mr Nicholas Calvert, director-general of the British Footwear Manufacturers' Association, said: 'The recession has put enormous pressure on the industry. Manufacturers have been caught between falling sales and rising occupancy costs. Rents have spiralled upwards and the uniform business rate has been an additional heavy burden.' Retailers have been buying an ever-increasing proportion of footwear from overseas to try to keep prices low. Sears, owner of the BSC, by far the biggest retailer of footwear in the UK with almost one-fifth of the market, now places orders in many overseas countries. It said Burlington's collapse would have a 'negligible impact' on supplies. Mr Calvert said: 'Retailers have been cutting back on ordering in the UK and have bought at the lowest cost they can get.'</p>

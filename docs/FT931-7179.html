			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC likely to set price floors on fish imports THE EUROPEAN Community is tomorrow expected to set minimum import prices on white fish, to check the surge of produce coming in, which has been dramatised by Breton fishermen protesting against depressed prices. Commission officials warned yesterday, however, that the fishermen were likely to be disappointed with the results, in view of the still unresolved structural problems of the industry. EC fishermen have long been subject to quotas under the common fisheries policy. These have come down sharply in recent years, to conserve stocks threatened by overfishing. As part of a major conservation effort, Brussels has also obliged fleets to tie up for prescribed periods, and/or enforced use of bigger net meshes to let immature fish escape. Last year the EC also agreed an 8 per cent reduction of the community fleet over the next four years, although scientific studies cited by the commission in 1990 claimed a 40 per cent reduction of the EC fleet was needed. Before imports are taken into account, the current regime itself creates surges in supply - especially about this time of year. Overall quotas are exhausted towards the end of the preceding year, leaving many vessels idle during winter. With bad weather usually keeping fishermen in port through January, February often sees fish flooding on to the market as the industry rushes to regenerate its flagging cash-flow. All this is now combining with three factors, of which cheap imports from Russia, Iceland, Poland and Norway is only the most egregious. Recession has led to a fall in consumption in France - one of the EC's biggest fish-eaters - and growing competition from rival foodstuffs like poultry and pork, prices of which had fallen 25 per cent before the recent 15 to 30 per cent drops in white fish prices. The spate of EC devaluations has also bitten into the French market. While Paris maintains its franc fort big fish producers like the UK and Spain, which have devalued their currencies, can sell more cheaply into France. But cheap imports from outside the community, especially from Russia, are now a big destabilising force because Commission officials maintain a good deal of Russian fish is coming in from Iceland with disguised rules of origin certificates. Russia's fish would normally pay a 12 per cent tariff, against the 3.5 per cent charged to Iceland under a bilateral agreement. The minimum import prices the commission is set to fix tomorrow are likely only to be the reference prices the EC uses to monitor the market, and will last six months. But if this does not work, commission officials say an embargo on imports is virtually certain. 'If they don't get the message, or they can't control what their fishermen do, that's the next step,' one Commission fisheries official said. 'I think the Icelanders will get the message,' he added.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up despite intervention THE DOLLAR rallied yester-day in spite of a second day of co-ordinated intervention by European central banks. Demand for the US currency increased as the market continued to take an unfavourable view of the D-Mark. Other European currencies, such as sterling, did not provide any great attraction, but the yen was relatively steady. The German Bundesbank led co-ordinated intervention by European central banks, selling the dollar at around DM1.7450, but by the end of the day it had failed to hold it below DM1.7500. By the time trading closed in Europe there was no sign of the US Federal Reserve joining the action of other central banks. The Bank of Japan has also stayed out of the market so far this week, reflecting the better performance of the yen, in comparison with European currencies. There was no important US economic news yesterday, leaving the market to wait for tomorrow's data on US gross national product, and for any official reaction to the dollar's recent advance from this weekend's Washington meeting of ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. US GNP figures for the first quarter are expected to be weaker than the 1990 fourth- quarter decline of 1.6 per cent. Economists are looking for a fall of about 2.5 per cent, amid suggestions that this may mark a low point in the current recession. The figures will be closely analysed for signs of economic recovery and, therefore, could have a significant effect on the dollar. At the same time, there is likely to be caution ahead of the G-7 meeting for fear of moves aimed at preventing another surge by the dollar. At last night's close in London the dollar was up to DM1.7535 from DM1.7420; to Y138.05 from Y137.90; to SFr1.4715 from SFr1.4590; and to FFr5.9125 from FFr5.8750. The D-Mark continued its recent decline against the Japanese yen, slipping in London to Y78.70 from Y79.15. Concern about the economic situation in Germany, following unification, and political unrest in the Soviet Union weighed on the German currency, keeping it among the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling weakened in the ERM, but remained the third strongest currency, behind the Spanish peseta and Italian lira. The pound lost 1.70 cents to Dollars 1.6945. It also fell to DM2.9725 from DM2.9825; to FFr10.0175 from FFr10.0550; to SFr2.4925 from SFr2.4975; and to Y234.00 from Y236.00. Sterling's index shed 0.5 to 91.2. In New York the pound recovered 70 points to finish at Dollars 1.7015. The French franc, weakest member of the ERM, was little moved by news that France's trade deficit in March widened to FFr4.70bn from February's FFr3.48bn. In the FT Guide to World Currencies table on Tuesday, the exchange rate for the Italian lira should have been: sterling 2206.50, US dollar 1303.69, D-Mark 737.96 and yen 934.96.</p>

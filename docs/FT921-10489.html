			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Venezuelan reform may be victim of failed coup BUSINESSES and offices re-opened in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas yesterday, one day after an attempted coup d'etat was crushed by military units loyal to the government of President Carlos Andres Perez. However, many Venezuelans, still shocked by the attempted coup, formed long queues to buy extra supplies of food and petrol. The uprising, in which about 150 army officers and over 1,000 enlisted men participated, left as many as 78 people dead, most of them civilians caught in crossfire. General Fernando Ochoa Antich, Venezuela's minister of defence, said 133 officers and 953 enlisted men had been arrested. The rebel Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement for National Salvation was unhappy with the course of Venezuela's modern history and the divergence from the ideals advanced by Simon Bolivar, the father of Venezuela's revolution, Gen Ochoa Antich said. While it is not clear what kind of a government the rebels would have installed if successful, it appears that the officers were not only concerned over the country's economic and social problems, corruption, and the image of the armed forces. They were also highly motivated by an ideological attachment to Bolivar's notions on democracy and the state. One detained coup leader, Lt Col Francisco Arias, said the rebels sought to 'rescue the Venezuelan people from politicians, from demagoguery and bureaucracy.' The general public offered no support to the rebels on the day of the uprising. However, public opinion polls regularly show that Venezuelans are unhappy with the country's current situation and are particularly opposed to the government's economic reform programme. Publicly, administration officials said there would be no witch hunts against the military. But the fact that leaders of the attempted coup, including Lt Col Arias, were involved in past rebellions has raised questions about how well the military has dealt with its black sheep. Businessmen are asking whether the government will ease the commitment to free market policies that has caused so much social unrest since 1989. They are worried that the government may try to devote more money to social welfare and other projects aimed at easing social tensions. Many politicians say the attempted uprising proves that the government's unpopular economic policies, initiated three years ago, must be changed. However, many in the business community would argue that these tough policies are only just starting to bear fruit and must be continued in order to provide the country with long-term growth and low inflation. A country with a democratic history of more than three decades may turn violent and unstable, with repetitions of last year's sustained street protests and further unrest among the military. In one respect, however, Venezuela is lucky. Thanks to its oil export revenues it has the financial resources to address its problems better than most developing nations.</p>

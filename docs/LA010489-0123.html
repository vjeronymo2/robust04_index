			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> '89'S 1ST BIG STORM TURNS NORTHEAST INTO AN ICEBOX  </P> <P> Howling winds and plummeting temperatures -- a backhanded swipe from the first  major storm of 1989 -- turned the Northeast into a giant icebox today from  Caribou, Me., to New York City.  </P> <P> Winds gusted to 110 m.p.h. on top of New Hampshire's Mt. Washington this  morning and combined with temperatures of 17 degrees below zero to produce a  wind chill of minus 85 degrees.  </P> <P> "That's cold enough to make you put your earmuffs on," Mt. Washington  Observatory spokesman Peter Crane said. He said winds at the summit averaged 89  m.p.h.  </P> <P> An ice climber who got lost Tuesday on the 6,288-foot mountain, the highest in  the Northeast, was rescued today, though the cold did some damage to his feet.  </P> <P> Hundreds of homeless people crowded into New York's shelters as temperatures on  city streets hovered in the upper teens and winds gusted to 35 m.p.h.,  producing a wind chill of 20 below.  </P> <P> Forecasters said it would get worse as the day wore on -- with winds  strengthening to 50 m.p.h. and temperatures falling toward single digits.  </P> <P> In Maine, brisk winds dropped the wind chill to between 45 and 55 degrees below  zero this afternoon at Caribou, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> Forecasters said the wind and cold were part of the first major storm of 1989,  which dumped up to 8 inches of snow on parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania by this  morning, but skipped across the East Coast without delivering on its promise of  heavy snows in large population centers.  </P> <P> Weather service spokesman Lyle Alexander said that storm was well off in the  Atlantic early today, but he said it intensified once it hit the water and  pulled arctic air and strong winds into the East from Canada.  </P> <P> The storm deposited 8 inches of snow by this morning on the Cleveland suburbs  of Bedford and Garfield Heights, Ohio, and in the mountains of central  Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> But forecasts of up to 6 inches of snow from New York to Washington, D.C.,  never materialized. Suburbs of the nation's capital received 2 inches of snow  and New York was left without a trace.  </P> <P> At Mt. Washington, N.H., Jim Church of Pleasantville, N.Y., was found shortly  after 10 a.m. today by rescue crews as he began his descent from the mountain.  </P> <P> "He's essentially OK, but he does have some cold injury to his feet," Mike  Torrey of the Appalachian Mountain Club said. "The fact that he survived at all  is to his credit."  </P> <P> Church hiked up Mt. Washington on Monday with Mark Fedow, 34, of New York City.  They decided to leave the summit after a "whiteout" -- an intense blizzard --  obscured visibility.  </P> <P> The two spent Monday night below the summit and began to hike down Tuesday but  became separated, Torrey said. Fedow made his way to the base to find help, but  Church became lost.  </P> <P> "The conditions on the summit are brutal," said Maj. Henry Mock of the state  Fish and Game Department. "But he's in good condition."  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer A 3 per cent fall in your share price on the day you turn in an unexpectedly good 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits must seem scant reward for hard work. That, sadly, is the cross Marks and Spencer has to bear. Its gross margins are 36 per cent while its net margins are an astonishing 13 per cent. Those looking to make a quick buck from economic recovery ogle the likes of Burton with 50 per cent gross margins but only 3 per cent net figures and dream of what might be. Certainly those retailers which suffered in the recession have plenty of room for improvement. Yet that is to miss the point. Marks has a quality of earnings which is almost peerless. Even its great rival, J. Sainsbury, carries greater risks with its massive capital expenditure programme and very expensive sites. Marks' investment in systems and staff will also continue to provide long-run productivity gains. Yesterday's angst about the company's pay award emphasises the conflict. Short-termists worry that Marks needs to keep volumes growing this year to pay for the 6 per cent rise in staff costs. That is true as far as it goes, but the company is opening 3 per cent more selling space this year, and its 'outstanding value' promotion is timed to increase market share at precisely the right moment in the cycle. Longer term growth will come from continental Europe. The company has has finally got its formula right and is expanding into a weak property market. Rolling out across Europe provides plenty of elbow room for sales growth. Given that Marks' shares are only 3 per cent higher than they were this time last year, it may be wondered what management has to do to please.</p>

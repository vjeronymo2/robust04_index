			<p>BFN     [Text] A short time ago UN official Gustave Feissel  returned from Vienna, where efforts to persuade the Turkish side  to accept the 21 March document were unsuccessful. In addition  to Mr. Feissel, the two-day consultations were also attended by  two Rauf Denktas advisers; Robert Lamb, U.S. special coordinator  on Cyprus; and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik.    In a statement made after his return, Mr. Feissel noted that  all of the elements needed to implement the confidence-building  measures were discussed at the Vienna consultations. He said he  would be submitting a report to the UN secretary general, and  added: Of course, we are proceeding with the UN secretary  general's report to the Security Council, which is expected to  circulate around the middle of this month as scheduled.    Responding to a question on the results of the Vienna  meetings, Mr. Feissel said he did not want to discuss it because  the UN secretary general should be briefed first. He added: I  would like to note that we have covered all aspects because we  want to know where the Turkish Cypriots stand; this is important  as the time is nearing for Mr. Butrus-Ghali's report to be  submitted to the Security Council. Asked if progress was made  at the talks on the confidence-building measures, Mr. Feissel  reiterated that he did not want to divulge the details of what  transpired but he described the meeting as useful. Mr. Feissel  responded negatively to a question on whether he plans any more  meetings before the Butrus-Ghali report is submitted, but he  added that he would be briefing President Glavkos Kliridhis next  week.    At the same time, Robert Lamb left Vienna for London, where  this evening he will meet with Joe Berg, acting director of the  South European Department at the British Foreign Office.  According to our London correspondent, this meeting is a  briefing on the latest Vienna talks and will also be attended by  (William Shapcoat), director of the Foreign Office bureau on the  Cyprus issue.</p>

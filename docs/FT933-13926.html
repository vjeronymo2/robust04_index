			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Moorgate lifts net asset value by 9% Moorgate Investment Trust recovered from a fall in net asset value at halfway to finish the 12 months to May 31 with a value of 140.1p per share, an increase of 9.4 per cent. Net revenue dipped to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.5m) reflecting reduced deposit interest and, according to Sir Mark Thompson, chairman, a 'particularly harsh environment' for dividend payments from UK smaller companies in which the trust is predominately invested. Earnings per share emerged at 5.09p (5.37p) and the total dividend is maintained at 5.5p via a proposed final of 3.8p. Sir Mark said, however, that the total for the current year would be reduced to 4.25p.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: A WEARING EXPERIENCE;  </P> <P> CLOTHES MAY MAKE THE MAN, BUT TO A WOMAN THEY'RE A MOOD-ELEVATING DRUG  </P> <P> THE MIRACLE has happened again. I was sad, the sun wasn't shining, the computer  was making funny noises. Fortunately, I knew exactly what to do. And now,  sitting in my closet, carefully wrapped in tissue paper, emanating healing  radiance, is a pristine white cardigan. And I'm cheerful and optimistic.  </P> <P> Saved! By the miracle of new clothes.  </P> <P> I'm lucky. I can afford to ease my pains with a shot in the wardrobe. And I'm  female. I know what joy a silk camisole or a paisley scarf can bring. Men don't  seem to get the same kick out of clothing acquisitions. Not once have I heard  my husband say, "Honey, look at the great socks I found today."  </P> <P> "Men don't use clothes as a mood-altering drug," Duke says. "We go for cars and  boats."  </P> <P> Clothes take up less space. Besides, the only thing you can control in life is  your wardrobe. Cars break down when you least expect it. Boats eat money and  gas. Your house, your mate, your friends, your family, even your career, are  beyond your control. However, you're in total command of what you put on your  back each morning.  </P> <P> "But sometimes what I have to wear takes over," argues my sister, Laurie. "Like  if I have a business meeting, I have to put on the power suit. I can't wear the  funky dress with the fringe."  </P> <P> That's only because that dress is olive and Laurie lives in Manhattan, where  the women are in official mourning. "Everyone wears black all the time," she  concedes.  </P> <P> A few months ago, I went to New York on business. At the time, the only black  thing I owned was my car. I stood in the baggage claim area at Kennedy airport,  wearing a teal-blue coat and red pumps, surrounded by women in funeral garb who  stared at me as if I were Bozo the Clown. It was a little disconcerting.  </P> <P> "Put this on," Laurie said tactfully the next day when I appeared in a tropical  print. She reached into her closet, rummaged through racks of black skirts,  black blouses, black sweaters, black shoes and even black sneakers -- and  handed me a black jacket. It made me look and feel surprisingly sophisticated.  "You should get one," my sister said.  </P> <P> I was bound to succumb. The beauty of new clothes is that you can magically  change your image with the wave of a charge card. Besides, fashion is a  universal female bonding experience. My friends and I used to dress Barbie. Now  we dress ourselves.  </P> <P> "Male bonding is about sports," Duke says. "When a man visits another man, the  last thing in the world they would do is try on each other's clothes. Or shop.  I can't imagine saying to another man, 'Hey, that sweater would look really  great on you.' "  </P> <P> He doesn't know what he's missing. My sister took me to Nicole Miller, a sleek  boutique on Madison Avenue. The ultra-chic, ultra-thin saleswoman in widow's  weeds was aghast when I pounced on a red miniskirt. "No, no, it comes in  black," she cried. But red always makes me happy.  </P> <P> "I don't know how you found that," my sister marveled. "I've been shopping here  for three years and never noticed any color." Laurie did get me to buy slinky  black slacks and an elegant black coat dress with jet buttons. But I returned  the favor. I talked her into a purple suit.  </P> <P> "Maybe I need a new look," Duke said when I modeled my purchases.  Unfortunately, he was joking. As far as he's concerned, the old shoe is the  best shoe.  </P> <P> For years, I've been trying to purge his closet of a pair of virulent green  velvet pants -- the color of an old wine bottle or Astroturf, depending on the  light. Recently, I took them to the cleaners. "What do you want me to do?" the  cleaner asked.  </P> <P> "Lose them," I replied. (Alas, they're still here.)  </P> <P> For the record, I'm not one of those slaves to fashion who refuse to wear the  same outfit twice. And I'm not a compulsive buyer. I just like to wear pretty  things. I wander through boutiques the way I wander through gardens, checking  out the flowers in bloom. But I can say no.  </P> <P> "Try this little dress," my friend Wendy said recently, holding up a dainty  floral frock. We were in Suji, the cozy shop in Santa Monica, where she works.  </P> <P> "I don't need the little dress," I said.  </P> <P> "It's only $48," Wendy said. "It would look cute with lace leggings." True, but  when I tried it on, I didn't get the feeling that something wonderful could  happen at any moment. And what's the point of new clothes if you don't get that  feeling?  </P> <P> "Duke would really love it," Wendy said. I couldn't argue with that, but . . .  </P> <P> Fortunately, at that moment, a dejected-looking woman trudged into the shop.  Her face lit up when she saw the little dress. "Oh, what a beautiful dress,"  she said wistfully.  </P> <P> Saved! By the miracle of new clothes.  </P></p>

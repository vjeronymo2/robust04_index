			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting United States  Defense Secretary William Perry said here Friday [22 April] that  the U.S. should solve the nuclear development issue in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "with greater  patience and extensive diplomatic efforts."    Perry, who arrived here on Thursday from South Korea, told a  press conference that the United States places great hope in  China in efforts to persuade the DPRK to relinquish its nuclear  development program.    Perry said that if the DPRK's attitude does not soften  despite diplomatic efforts, the U.S. and allies such as Japan  and South Korea will impose sanctions against the DPRK.    Perry did not rule out possible military pressure on the  DPRK, but he believes that would run the risk of bringing about  a large-scale war.    If the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions against the  DPRK,  they will be "moderate and step-by-step ones," Perry said.    The U.S. defense secretary noted that if the DPRK fulfills  its international duty on the nuclear issue, the United States  is ready to discuss the issue of the normalization of political  and economic relations.</p>

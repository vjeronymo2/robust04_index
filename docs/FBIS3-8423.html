According to federal statistics, although the cost of living  for a four-member family in February has dropped by one-quarter  as compared to January, average salaries are on a subsistence  level.    According to statistics, a four-member family needed 440 new  dinars (or 440 German marks) for a normal diet in January and  340 dinars in February.    Official data have not yet been published but estimates are  that average salaries in February amounted to 50 dinars. This  means that one needed almost seven salaries to ensure a quality  diet.    Average salaries in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia amounted  to 35 dinars (or 35 German marks) including payments in kind  recieved by employees of many companies. In comparison, the  average salary at the end of 1990 amounted to 560 German marks.    Massive impoverishment of the population began in 1991 when  the Yugoslav Federation disintegrated, rocking the foundations  of the economies of all six former members.    The drop of the standard of living became dramatic in May,  1992, when the U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions  on the Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro.    The new economic measures, enforced late January, prevented  a  total financial and economic collapse and are being implemented  without foreign aid or loans.</p>

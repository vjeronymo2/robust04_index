			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fedor Grigoryev, economist, and Lyubov Dobrota, </F> KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent: "An Investor Gathers  Momentum"]    [Text] The Kazzagotkhlopkoprom Production Association has  earned a reputation as an active investor in South Kazakhstan  Oblast. Its capital, invested in several joint ventures with  Western companies, is helping "develop the economy from within"  and meet the demands of the consumer market.    South Kazakhstan, the most northerly cotton-growing area in  the CIS, produces high-quality raw material for the textile  industry. Several mills in France have been using our cotton  fiber for quite some time now. The fact that excellent cotton  quality has been achieved is not attributable to the farmers,  but rather to procurement specialists. They help select the best  plant types and decide on the optimum planting schedule. Another  weighty argument has also been added since the arrival of the  market economy: the dollar.    Prior to 1988, each year South Kazakhstan Oblast, like all  parts of the Central Asian republics, would receive an "order"  from Moscow, telling it where to ship its cotton, and how much  to send. Accounts were paid in rubles at stable low prices.  Later permission was granted to sell an insignificant amount of  cotton on the world market for dollars. However, the return was  small.    Incidentally, even today, when the export quota for the  "distant abroad" totals 25,500 tonnes, or one-third of all  cotton procured, net revenues in dollars and marks is extremely  small. Customs duties and all sorts of other fees consume more  than one-half of hard currency receipts, with only 40 percent  going to the association and cotton farms.    There is only one other legal way to make ends meet: barter.  But in contrast to some other enterprises that have also  obtained the right to engage in foreign economic operations,  Kazzagotkhlopkoprom has not gotten into buying pantyhose or  automobile cassette players. It uses its hard currency to buy  whole factories at once.    When the official opening of a a joint venture with the  South  Korean Telbone Company to manufacture VCR-TV combinations was  held in Shymkent a month ago, many of those attending were  surprised to learn during the presentation that cotton growers  were among the founders. Improvements have been made in the  design of the NAM system. The new Ordabasa videocassette system  is markedly technically superior to its predecessor.    The cotton company was the first in the CIS to assemble  Rank-Xerox copying equipment, selling more than 1,000 fax  machines at comparatively low prices in every oblast in the  republic. The Farat Joint Venture provides servicing and repairs  for them.    The next stage in cooperation was the establishment of a  joint venture with the English to manufacture cotton wool. The  raw materials for this facility, located in Turkestan, will be  noils -- a waste product of cotton processing. The construction  is being closely watched by Uzbekistan, which at this time has  no facilities for the manufacture of absorbent sterile cotton.    The first unit of the plant should begin operations in  December. Negotiations are under way regarding the purchase of  equipment for a second unit which will manufacture various  cosmetic and medical items. In this way the joint venture will  have a guaranteed profit both in rubles and in hard currency.  Kazzagotkhlopkoprom will also get a share of the dividends, and  that means it will be able to finance the construction of a  copying equipment plant, a cotton spinning mill and other  facilities that the oblast and the republic badly need.    The South Kazakhstan association currently has companies  from  eight developed countries around the world as its partners. Its  specialists find equipment that other enterprises in the region  need on the world market at low prices.    The production association would seem to be in a very secure  position. But in these unpredictable times no one can guarantee  prosperity. The association and its customers were hit hard by  the introduction of a 30-percent duty on cotton exports to  countries in the "near abroad." The government has promised to  repeal this duty for enterprises in those republics which are  parties to intergovernmental agreements, but that has not  happened yet.    Much time and effort must be expended on filing raw cotton  procurement prices with the republic's State Committee on  Prices. Do they not realize that it is simply not to the  association's advantage to artificially deflate or inflate  prices? The former would drive a wedge between suppliers and the  association, and the latter would weaken the cotton's  competitive position.    One constant headache for the association's management is  connected with directed state loans for raw cotton procurement.  The new year's cotton harvest has begun, but the R64.5 billion  [rubles] required to purchase it are not in the Agro-Industrial  Bank yet. There is no money for fuel or spare parts for cotton  harvesting combines, nor any money to pay off last year's debts  to farms. The CIS's epidemic of defaulted payments for products  has not spared cotton growers either. Payments from customers  are not being received on time, and so it was not possible to  pay off last year's debts on schedule. The capital promised to  extend the term of the loan until 1 October, but did not keep  its promise -- money was needed immediately for the grain  harvest. Yet under contracts concluded with the farms any  default on payments to them will result in substantial fines.    The solution, according to Sh. Usmanov, general director of  Kazzagotkhlopkoprom Production Association, is to issue stock in  the association as soon as possible and establish a commercial  bank. The farmers and their authorized representative -- the  production association -- are fully mature enough for greater  independence. Even now, foreseeing delays in funding from the  budget, they have reached agreement with the Telbone Company  regarding favorable hard currency lending during the harvest  period. Yet this will only cover less than one-third of their  financial needs. So at this point there is still no way to get  by without state support.</p>

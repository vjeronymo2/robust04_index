			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith outlines plan for constitutional change MR JOHN SMITH last night called for 'a fundamental shift in the balance of power between the citizen and state' as the central goal of a wide-ranging programme of constitutional reform. In a clear effort to seize on the widely-perceived 'atmosphere of decline and gloom' across Britain, the Labour leader attributed the mood to poor and unaccountable government feeding a sense of impotence among the public. He poured scorn on Mr John Major's claims to champion citizens' interests by warning that 14 years of Conservative rule had reinforced alienation and centralised power and had left Westminster 'dictatorial and remote'. Siding firmly with the modernising faction in his party, he said: 'It is clear to me that the institutions which purport to embody our country's democracy no longer do so. Instead they hold real democracy back.' Among a long list of proposals aimed at extending citizens' rights, Mr Smith advocated an end to the practice of 'Budget purdah' - the traditional news blackout before Budgets - and new legislation obliging companies to detail remuneration packages for their directors. Arguing for greater transparency in government, he also said that the Central Statistical Office should be made statutorily independent and accountable to Parliament as one of a number of measures aimed at de-politicising the dispersal of official information. A further move proposed in his speech in London to Charter 88, the lobby group for constitutional reform, was the introduction of an annual State of the Nation speech to the Commons in which the government would outline the economic outlook. A 'green budget' might also be published to inform a wider debate on the economy. But Mr Smith was careful to stop short of declaring his own position on electoral reform, now being debated by the Plant committee, which will report to the Labour party conference later this year. He would not be drawn on his views on House of Lords reform, beyond reaffirming his opposition to the hereditary principle. The bulk of his 21-page speech covered familiar territory, not least the long-promised revival of the powers of local government and a new tier of government for Scotland, Wales and the English regions. It also included Labour's longstanding commitment to freedom of information legislation and the incorporation of European human rights principles in a Human Rights Act, overseen by a Human Rights Commission. Alongside these came a pledge to create a Justice Ministry, empowered to pull together supervision of the law and its reform under one departmental roof. Party officials underlined that the speech built on Mr Smith's address to Labour's local government conference at Bournemouth last month in which he attempted to redefine the party's central goal as broadening opportunities for individual citizens. That message has been echoed in speeches by other Labour frontbenchers, including an attack on vested interest groups by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.</p>

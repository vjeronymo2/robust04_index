Castro was distressed by the uncomfortable  situation caused by the Collor couple's visit to Cuba. Sen.  Lando returned on 31 January from Cuba, where here attended the  Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity and Peace.  Pleased with the simplicity and sincerity demonstrated by Fidel,  Lando comforted Fidel: "Collor has always been a good actor.  He made that same good impression in Brazil, deceiving 35  million people."    The incident ended by being a long subject during their  conversation, which was about the two countries' economic  situation and political and trade relations between Cuba and  Brazil. Worried about the bad impression Collor's visit might  have made on the former rapporteur for the CPI on PC [Paulo  Cesar Farias], Fidel stressed to Lando that the former Brazilian  president did not come to Cuba as an official guest nor did he  receive him in an audience.    During the conversation, Fidel told the Brazilian senator  that Collor had expressed his interest in visiting the island  when he was still president of the Republic. Now, after the  impeachment, Fidel says his reasoning was simple: Given that he  is a common citizen, there is no reason to receive him with any  special honors; this also does not justify any persecution by  Cuba by prohibiting his visit.</p>

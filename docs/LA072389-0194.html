			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT WEATHER CAN CAUSE LAWN TROUBLE  </P> <P> Hot weather can mean trouble for lawns. Good watering habits, like watering  more deeply and less frequently, will make your lawn look better. Dry, brown  spots or an entire unhealthy lawn can be caused by the lawn moth, packed soil,  poor watering methods or fertilizer burn.  </P> <P> Never fertilize wet grass because it is likely to cause burns, even when the  correct amount is used. Find out from a certified nurseryman how to tell when  your lawn needs water depending on the needs of your particular grass.  </P></p>

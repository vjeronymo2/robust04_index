			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- The Islamic Jihad Movement  of Palestine on Tuesday [17 May] accused the REUTERS of  distorting the remarks made by the secretary-general of the  movement Fathi Shaqaqi in an interview with the daily AL-QUDS.    REUTERS quoting Shaqaqi had earlier reported that the  Islamic  Jihad Movement was considering a new strategy to prove that it  was a political movement, and that it was ready to cooperate  with the Palestinian police to enforce the Gaza-Jericho deal.    The movement in a statement published Tuesday, reiterated  its  commitment to its strategy of confronting the Zionist regime,  and said "this policy is definite and unalterable."    It said that struggle is a legal, historical and religious  right for the Palestinian people that can by no means be  ignored. The movement would encounter the Zionist aggressors  any time and anywhere, it stressed.    Fathi Shaqaqi had told the daily that "the movement would do  its best to avoid clashes with Palestinian police in Gaza and  Jericho even though this might make us change some of our  tactics."    Shaqaqi had continued by saying that the principled stance  of  the movement was based on rejecting and disgracing the  Gaza-Jericho compromise deal, and opposing any measure which  would likely legitimize the occupation of each and every part of  Palestine.</p>

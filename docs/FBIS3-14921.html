			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the night of 28 February-1 March unknown people  blew up an electric power line pole supplying electricity to the  Russian radar station in the Latvian village of Skrunda.  Interfax was told at the Russian Foreign Ministry that the  terrorists failed to put the radar equipment out of action since  the staff immediately switched over to another power line. As  is known, there was talk at the Russian-Latvian negotiations of  renting the Skrunda radar station for four years. However,  certain political forces in Latvia are in favor of closing it  down by the time Russian troops are withdrawn from the country  this summer.</p>

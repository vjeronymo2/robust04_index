			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES WORRIED ABOUT VOTER BACKLASH;  </P> <P> PROP. 143: OFFICIALS OF STATE'S HIGHER-EDUCATION SYSTEMS FRET THAT DWINDLING  SUPPORT FOR BONDS COULD SINK $450-MILLION MEASURE.  </P> <P> Arguments over Proposition 143 -- an initiative that would provide $450 million  for public colleges and universities -- generally mirror the debate over using  bonds to alleviate crowding in California's public schools.  </P> <P> Officials of California's public colleges and universities fear that voters,  tiring of repeated calls to support construction bond issues, may reject  Proposition 143 on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> "We're worried about the trend line," said William B. Baker, the University of  California's vice president for business and university relations, noting that  voter support for higher-education bond issues has dropped from 60% in 1986 to  58% in 1988 and 55% in last June's primary election.  </P> <P> "We're also worried about a general voter backlash against taxes and the  anti-government sentiment that seems to be sweeping the country," Baker added.  </P> <P> Steve McCarthy, spokesman for the 20-campus California State University system,  said: "Our concern is that if we have to keep going to bond financing -- if  another source isn't found -- one of these times we're going to lose one."  </P> <P> David Mertes, chancellor of the statewide community college system, said he  felt "positive" about Proposition 143's outcome because "the voting public has  always supported our need for new facilities, but there is increasing concern  that these bond measures can't continue forever."  </P> <P> Leaders of the three systems had hoped for a single vote on a $900-million bond  issue last June, but Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders decided  instead on two measures, each for $450 million.  </P> <P> The money would be divided equally among the three higher-education segments.  It would be spent to accommodate growth, to make technological improvements in  both instruction and research and to improve earthquake safety.  </P> <P> Enrollment at UC, CSU and the community colleges is expected to increase an  average of 57,000 students per year through the year 2005.  </P> <P> Opponents argue that students who benefit from a college education should pay  for it.  </P> <P> "Something worth having is worth paying for," the official ballot argument  against Proposition 143 states. "Therefore, if this $450 million is truly  needed at these schools, then the people who use the facilities should pay for  them."  </P> <P> The "no" argument was signed by Thomas Tryon, chairman of the Board of  Supervisors in Calaveras County; Anthony G. Bajada, professor of music at Cal  State L.A., and Ted Brown, chairman of the Los Angeles County central committee  of the Libertarian Party of California.  </P> <P> If the bonds are approved, in the Los Angeles area they would provide $32  million for earthquake renovations at the Powell Library at UCLA, $27 million  for a new engineering building at UC Irvine, $11.5 million for utility  improvements at Cal State Northridge, $7.9 million to begin construction of a  new classroom and laboratory building at Cal Poly Pomona and $4.5 million for a  business/technology building at the two-year Mt. San Jacinto College, among  many other projects.  </P> <P> The legislation approving the bond measure calls for the money to be spent on  existing campuses, not on the new campuses that all three systems are planning.

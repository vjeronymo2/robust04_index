			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mitsukoshi in red as retail sales plummet MITSUKOSHI, Japan's most prestigious retailer, yesterday underlined the severity of the downturn in consumer spending in Japan by announcing it would make a pre-tax loss of Y2.5bn (Dollars 21.5m) in the year to February. Mitsukoshi has been hit by rising costs from its heavy investment programme in the late 1980s and a slump in demand for luxury goods. The company, which made a Y10.9bn pre-tax profit last year, had estimated it would make a Y1.8bn profit this year. But the sharp downturn in consumer spending in the second half, which continues unabated, has forced a further downward revision in profits. The company will make an after-tax profit, but only by selling assets. After-tax profits are expected to fall by about 70 per cent to Y1.5bn. Takashimaya, another leading department store, also recently lowered its profit forecast for the year. More retailers are expected in the next few weeks to announce profits sharply lower than expected last year. Suntory, the leading liquor manufacturer, reported an 11.3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits in the year to December. The company's sales were 5.2 per cent down at Y758bn. Pilot, the pen and office equipment manufacturer bucked the trend of recent results by announcing a 25.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y418m in 1992. Canon, the camera and office equipment maker, yesterday reported a 31 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y101.63bn for 1992. Sales edged up by 2.4 per cent to Y1,910bn from Y1,870bn, held back by the appreciation of the yen, while earnings per share fell 29 per cent to Y46.82. Canon said its markets in south east Asia and China grew further in 1992 and those the US economy crept back in the second half. But these bright spots were countered by the slowdown in western Europe and Japan.</p>

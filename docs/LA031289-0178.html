			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS GET NEEDED BREAK, POUND WINGS, 10-6  </P> <P> Nights off have come with regularity thanks to this season's stretched-out  Major Indoor Soccer League schedule, but rarely have they occurred on nights  when games are played.  </P> <P> The Sockers, in need of some relief after an exhausting loss to first-place  Baltimore Friday night, got the soothing tonic they needed Saturday from the  last-place Wichita Wings at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Tired legs seemed revived and worn-down emotions seemed refreshed after a 10-6  victory over the Wings, who not only provided little resistence but also threw  in a free goal or two as part of the deal.  </P> <P> Branko Segota scored four goals, but it was Zoran Karic who received the  evening's biggest gift in front of 8,740 fans when Wichita goalkeeper Cris  Vaccaro assisted on his second-quarter goal.  </P> <P> Vaccaro, standing to the left of the penalty box, tried to clear a ball but  instead passed to Karic at the Wichita red line. Presented with an empty net,  Karic scored easily to give the Sockers a 5-2 lead.  </P> <P> There was little worry after that for the Sockers, who snapped a three-game  losing streak and moved back into a second-place tie with the Dallas Sidekicks  at 19-17.  </P> <P> "Lately, we've been getting chances but not putting them away," Segota said.  "But this time, we finished off our chances and got ahead early."  </P> <P> That was important, because the Sockers were a step slow, especially in the  second quarter when they were whistled for a season-high 12 fouls. To show how  little it mattered, however, it was the Sockers who scored three goals during  that period to take control.  </P> <P> Segota, who had scored off a pass from Karic in the first quarter, notched his  second goal of the night midway through the second quarter when he stepped  around Victor Moreland and beat Vaccaro with a line-drive shot on the short  side.  </P> <P> An unmarked Paul Dougherty scored on a shot that was deflected by the Wichita  defense to make it 4-2, and then Vaccaro made his ill-fated clearing pass to  Karic just before halftime.  </P> <P> Chico Borja scored for Wichita (15-21) to start the third quarter, but Segota  scored twice more, once on a penalty kick and once on a free kick, to push the  Sockers' advantage to 7-3.  </P> <P> Segota, who it seems has needed some off-nights this season while trying to  carry the bulk of the Sockers' offensive load, wasn't in a restful mood against  the Wings. Along with his four goals, which gave him a team-high 27 for the  season, he added three assists.  </P> <P> Segota now has 42 career hat tricks, and his seven-point game was the first by  a Socker since Segota himself scored seven (six were goals) in a victory over  Cleveland in December of 1987.  </P> <P> Steve Zungul added three goals for his 99th career hat trick, and Karic had two  to raise his goal total to 26 as the Sockers reached double-figures for the  first time this season and reached 2,000 regular-season goals in their history.  </P> <P> "This game was a lot of fun," Sockers' Coach Ron Newman said. "When you have a  lead, you can play more comfortably."  </P> <P> Segota scored 9:54 into the game to put the Sockers ahead, 1-0, but Wichita  tied the game less than a minute later when Erik Rasmussen scored on a penalty  kick. Vaccaro sent Terry Rowe in alone with a length-of-the-field pass, and  Waad Hirmez fouled Rowe from behind to set up Rasmussen's attempt.  </P> <P> Rasmussen, the league's Most Valuable Player a year ago, mis-hit his penalty  kick, but the slow-paced shot fooled Victor Nogueira and beat him low on the  left side.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS BUILDER FOR TITAN PROJECT;  </P> <P> FULLERTON: CITY APPROVES TAYLOR WOODROW DESPITE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING  COMPANY'S WORK AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. -- a company that recently filed a  lawsuit against the county and is embroiled in controversy surrounding its work  at the John Wayne Airport terminal -- is one step away from building a $7.9  million sports complex at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday approved Cal State Fullerton's choice of Taylor  Woodrow because the contracting company was the project's lowest bidder, met  qualifications required by the California State University system and is  involved with successful construction projects at Cal State campuses in Long  Beach and San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Final approval of Taylor Woodrow is expected in September when the Cal State  University board of trustees vote on the selection. The complex is a joint city  and university project.  </P> <P> City Manager William Winter expressed apprehension over the university's choice  of Taylor Woodrow, saying the city is "relying completely" on Cal State  Fullerton's report.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton has "done some extensive checking on Taylor Woodrow and  feel they can handle the job," Winter said. "We're just pleased that we were  able to get a bid that meets our cost parameters."  </P> <P> Since last year, Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. has been under  attack by county officials for alleged cost delays in its construction of the  John Wayne Airport terminal. In May, the company sued the county alleging  breach of contract after it was stripped of the $25-million road and parking  garage contract at the airport. The company is seeking $7.2 million in damages.  </P> <P> Besides the Orange County airport terminal, Taylor Woodrow California is  involved in a $30-million project on the Anaheim Convention Center, which city  officials have said is three months behind schedule.  </P> <P> In addition, Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd., a subsidiary of Taylor  Woodrow Construction California Ltd., is involved in a dispute with the city of  Laguna Niguel, which is threating to halt some housing construction on 99 acres  of park land the company received.  </P> <P> Despite the controversy, city officials still are confident in Cal State  Fullerton's choice.  </P> <P> "We've had numerous conversations with the university about its choice of  Taylor Woodrow," said City Councilman Richard Ackerman, noting that the  "airport issue" was a the primary topic. "But I feel comfortable with the  choice."  </P> <P> Ackerman said a penalty clause is included in the proposed contract, and would  fine Taylor Woodrow if it is not able to meet the completion date.  </P> <P> Jay Bond, associate vice president for facility planning for Cal State  Fullerton, said the company would be assessed a daily fine of $3,000 every day  it goes beyond the completion date.  </P> <P> Depending on whether the board of trustees approves Taylor Woodrow,  construction is scheduled to begin Sept. 24. The project is expected to be  completed by the fall of 1992.  </P> <P> According to state guidelines regarding the Cal State University bidding  process, if a contractor meets the university's qualifications and guidelines,  the school must pick the lowest bidder.  </P> <P> The university was hoping to build the complex for $6 million. But of the three  bids submitted in June to the university, Taylor Woodrow was the lowest at $7.9  million. The entire project is expected to cost $10.2 million.  </P> <P> Judy Johnson, a consultant hired by Taylor Woodrow to act as the company  spokesperson, defended Taylor Woodrow's record, saying the company is involved  in a wide variety of jobs, and it would be unfair to compare the magnitude of  the John Wayne Airport project to a project such as Cal State Fullerton's  sports complex.  </P> <P> Sal Rinella, Cal State Fullerton's vice president for administration, said the  city plans to front the entire $10.2 million for the project, of which $4.7  million will be paid back by the university through annual revenues based on  its share of the Marriott Hotel.  </P></p>

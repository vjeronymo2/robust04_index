			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thomson expands broadcasting interests THOMSON-CSF, France's state-controlled defence electronics group, is expanding its broadcasting interests by buying the transmitter, antenna and electron tube businesses owned by ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-based power engineering concern. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, will involve the transfer of companies with combined sales of FFr500m (Dollars 93.28m) in 1991. They include an electron-tube production plant in Switzerland and a joint-venture in Poland, as well as an antenna plant in Germany and a broadcast transmitter unit in Switzerland. Thomson, which was last year clouded by controversy over its attempt to expand its defence interests by taking over the missiles division of the LTV group in the US, has for some time been keen to augment its broadcast activities, where it services both private and public sector television companies. The French group already owns electron-tube factories and plants for broadcast transmitters in France and the US. Thomson said yesterday that the acquisition of the ABB businesses would enable the group to 'maintain critical mass and to continue to increase sales through external growth in a contracting market'. The ABB deal is the latest in a number of acquisitions for Thomson-CSF. The French group has bought a series of businesses over the past three years in order to consolidate its position in specific sectors and to sustain sales growth. Thomson-CSF last year made sales of Dollars 6.2bn. For ABB, the disposal is part of an ongoing process of shedding peripheral interests. The Zurich-based group mustered turnover of Dollars 28bn last year. It specialises in sectors such as electro-technology, environmental technology and transport systems.</p>

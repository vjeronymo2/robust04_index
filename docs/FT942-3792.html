			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Hopes raised for return to stability - International Signs that, at long last, investors are prepared to take their chances on new issues which they believe to be attractively priced have raised hopes that after several difficult months, some degree of stability has returned to the eurobond market. Among last week's issues, the three deals which appeared to have worked the best were the Province of Ontario's Dollars 1bn offering of 10-year global bonds (its first global deal in its new fiscal year), Wal-Mart Stores' Dollars 250m issue of five-year eurobonds and the Dollars 250m issue of 10-year eurobonds from Unilever. 'When a deal is fairly priced, it is selling well,' says Mr Simon Meadows, joint head of syndicate at CS First Boston, adding that one month ago this would not have been the case. However, while there is evidence that the market has stabilised, it will take a long time for activity to return to the levels seen at the start of the year, he says. Closer inspection of these deals suggests that issuers are having to scale down the size of their offerings and give up several basis points on pricing in order to encourage investors to buy the bonds. 'Last year, if Ontario's bonds were trading at a yield spread of 64 basis points over Treasuries in the secondary market, it could raise Dollars 2bn at 63 over,' says one syndicate manager. 'But this year, Ontario has to make do with Dollars 1bn at 67 over.' The market has also been unwilling to believe estimates from the book-runners that 60 per cent of Ontario's bonds were placed with investors in North America. Many syndicate managers say that as much as 80 per cent went to North America, which reflects badly on the level of demand in Europe, where investors have been badly hurt by the sharp slide in European government bonds this year. 'The market is still in a sensitive state, and as the Unilever deal shows, it is still a domain for the tip-top names,' says Mr James Garvin, head of syndicate at SG Warburg. Investors who are willing to return to the market are selective about currencies, although they appear to be more comfortable with longer maturities than they were only a few weeks ago. Deals denominated in dollars and yen remain the most attractive, while the recent rush of Canadian dollar offerings has appealed mainly to retail investors wishing to roll over expiring Canadian dollar holdings. Redemptions of Canadian dollar eurobonds are estimated at CDollars 1.9bn this month, CDollars 500m in July and CDollars 1.9bn in August. There is some speculation that last week's successful deals will prompt more dollar offerings this week, including a five-year global issue from a European sovereign borrower. The market can also expect the first global offering from Freddie Mac, the US government agency, to emerge in the next three weeks. The mandate for the issue, which is likely to raise Dollars 1bn and have a maturity of five years, has been awarded to Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers. By contrast, deals denominated in sterling, French francs and D-Marks are having a rougher ride, mainly due to continuing interest rate uncertainty in the underlying bond markets, though structured deals denominated in Italian lire have been popular. Many issuers who want to access these sectors of the eurobond market are waiting for the results of the European parliamentary elections, since a large protest vote could unleash a fresh bout of volatility in government bond markets. Argentina is also expected to show some flexibility on pricing when it braves the D-Mark sector this week. It is expected to raise between DM400m and DM500m through an issue of short-dated eurobonds, via Deutsche Bank. The three-year bonds are likely to be priced to yield between 220 and 240 basis points over the corresponding German government notes, which compares with a secondary market yield spread of 200 basis points on Argentina's outstanding five-year bonds.</p>

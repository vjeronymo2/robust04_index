			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Hungary in public sector purge Hungary's new Socialist-led administration yesterday sacked most of the directors of two large state companies and is expected to announce similar changes at its oil and electricity monopolies shortly. Mr Laszlo Pal, trade and industry minister, said the head of MVM, the electricity monopoly, had used company revenues to support the previous conservative government's electoral campaign and that several MVM board members were not qualified for their jobs. He said eight of the 11 board members would be removed next week. AV Rt, the state holding company, said it had dismissed the general director of Antenna Rt, the radio and television transmission operator, from its board for failing to notify it and co-directors of a Ft1bn (Pounds 5.8m) contract. It said it had dismissed five of the nine directors of TVK, the country's largest chemical company, in order to facilitate privatisation. Western observers in Budapest welcomed some of the changes, which had been expected for some time, and said that overall the new appointees were well qualified.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (22): No longer smothered by paper documents - Stockbroking applications / David Tebbutt tells how stockbrokers Hoare Govett are moving away from data on paper FORWARD-LOOKING companies have dispensed with their dusty libraries, and even dustier librarians. In their place they have high-tech information centres and information services managers. The library function is, of course, still there. It has simply been enhanced and improved by the addition of electronic, and therefore easily accessed, information. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, was drowning in paper documents on the business activities of thousands of companies. This had a number of disadvantages. First of all, finding the exact record of interest was only possible if its identity was already known. Searches could only be made by company name, not by its attributes. Other problems with paper-based systems include mis-filing. A mis-filed record was lost for ever. Theft is perhaps too strong a word, but brokers and analysts would often borrow paper records which would never be seen again. And, of course, the costs of paper-based systems were high because of the storage space and filing staff needed. Hoare Govett's first move away from paper came when it started using microfiche pictures of original documents. This was more a mechanical process, but it did give a glimpse of the improved security, staffing and space savings which were to come with the advent of CD-ROM and on-line databases. The company's first on-line systems were Datastream and Textline. Datastream is a statistical database, covering companies, commodities, government and economic statistics, while Textline contains synopses and full articles from the world's press. When the present information services manager, Janet Inglis, joined the company in 1986, both systems were already running on dedicated terminals. Later that year, Hoare Govett signed for its first on-line service, the McCarthy press cutting service. Previously McCarthy had provided press cuttings reproduced in card index format. The Hoare Govett staff were quite resistant to the idea of electronic information. They felt more secure with the familiar paper documents. Even now, according to Mrs Inglis, they still hanker after the cards. More recently, information providers have begun to publish their less frequently changing information on CD-ROM. Mrs Inglis subscribes to these services if the data is going to be accessed frequently. Her job is to weigh the cost of the CD-ROM service against the cost of pay-as-you-go on-line services. In the case of Kompass and CD Europa, for example, the CD-ROM option has been chosen. Twelve disks are provided through the year and the two services cost Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 15,000 respectively. CD Europa provides Dun &amp; Bradstreet reports for the whole of Europe. OTHER CD-ROM information sources include: Disclosure - information on US companies, SEC registrations, quarterly reports etc; Moody's International; Standard and Poor's stock reports - historical information about share price, dividend record, balance sheet and profit and loss; and Lotus One Source - the IDD Mergers and Acquisitions database. Hoare Govett used to take the IDD information on-line, but it was a long-winded process and the telephone connection kept breaking. The company also has a personal computer dedicated to the Amdata mergers and acquisitions database. Once a month, Amdata squirts its updates over the telephone where they are stored in the hard disk of this dedicated machine. Monthly CD-ROM disks are preferred, however, because these take up a tiny fraction of the room needed by a dedicated PC. Hoare Govett uses a range of conventional on-line information services, spending approximately Pounds 10,000 a year on Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Dunsprint on-line service. This provides information on unquoted companies around the world, especially north and south America, and is a useful way of finding out about company subsidiaries. For UK companies, because Companies House is just around the corner, it is more convenient to use the Chorus on-line ordering service and a few minutes of a messenger's time. For just Pounds 3, Mrs Inglis can obtain a microfiche record of a company's memorandum and articles of association and at least five years' worth of annual reports and other financial information. FOR press information the company accesses Reuters' Textline through the FT Profile service. Searches can be refined by subject matter, by industry and by geography. The service provides very sophisticated search options and delivers a list of headlines which meet the criteria. The user decides from this list which articles or synopses should be downloaded to Hoare Govett. The monthly cost of this service is Pounds 5,000, before any volume discounts have been applied. Other on-line services used include: Extel Workstation - historical company financial information; Dialog - an umbrella, or host, service which gives access to hundreds of databases through a consistent user interface. (While this saves users from having to learn many different access methods, it does result in a loss of flexibility, especially with a sophisticated system like Textline); Thomson Financial Services' Investext - brokers' reports on quoted companies; and Perfect Information - press cuttings, company news, company circulars and press releases. Perfect's services are unusual because they give users access to images of the original documents. These are held on optical disc juke-boxes at Perfect Data's premises. Because Perfect Information is used so heavily, Hoare Govett accesses the service over a tied telephone line. Datastream and Extel are accessed over tied lines for the same reasons. In order to keep a control of the costs of these two services, the company pays a flat rate for each one. Pay-as-you-go systems are best operated by skilled users, otherwise costs can spiral out of control. The alternative is to pay a fixed sum and let users do their worst. As a rule of thumb, the power of the search tools is in inverse proportion to the friendliness of the user interface. Datastream, which can be difficult to use, can for example, provide sophisticated graphing facilities based on the users' own equations. Mrs Inglis would like to see the flat-rate and CD-ROM information services delivered to the users' desktops across the company's networks. As people move up the company they become more reluctant to use the keyboard, but the Windows environment overcomes some of these difficulties. One of the problems for users is that most information services differ in how the information is accessed. There is a clear limit to how many different methods the user can be expected to learn. CD-ROM and on-line systems vastly increase the range of accessible information, on offer, however, and this is their great advantage. ' At Hoare Govett, for example, a research analyst wanted a breakdown of the population of California by sex age and racial origins. Mrs Inglis knew of a database that could help - Donnelly Demographics. She dialled in and within five minutes delivered the information to an astonished analyst. She points out that you cannot afford not to get what your competitors have got. She also notes that electronic information can be downloaded easily into spreadsheets and other documents. Some software packages are now available which do all the work - they dial the service, download the information and integrate it into your applications. Information Partners from New Information Paradigms is a good example. On-line and CD-ROM information frees up skilled library staff for much more sophisticated information provision. In the future, Mrs Inglis would like to connect these sources of information directly into the company's computer networks. Instead of a printout, information would be delivered directly to the user's screen. This kind of service would enable the end users to become much more accurate and precise in finding their own information.</p>

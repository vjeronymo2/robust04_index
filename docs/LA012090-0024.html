			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRING BACK FTOREK TO REPLACE WEBSTER  </P> <P> Is Tom Webster too nice a guy? Is it too late to reinstate ex-King coach Robbie  Ftorek?  </P> <P> Last year, the Kings appeared to unarguably get the best of the Gretzky trade.  This year, with the Oilers leading the NHL and the Kings sinking in the West,  we're not so sure.  </P> <P> No doubt Gretzky is a great player and we fans love him. But, turmoil or not,  isn't the goal to get a Stanley Cup championship? Mr. Vachon, won't you please  bring back the man in the sweater? Or do you need Mr. Gretzky's permission  first?  </P> <P> TED HIBSMAN and MARK KOCHANSKI, Redondo Beach  </P></p>

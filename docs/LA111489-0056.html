			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOWER INTEREST RATES HELP HOME RESALES RISE 2.7%  </P> <P> Resales of single-family houses increased 2.7% in the third quarter, spurred by  lower interest rates and recovering markets in the South and Midwest, the  National Assn. of Realtors reported Monday.  </P> <P> In California, 501,600 existing single-family homes closed escrow during the  third quarter, down 4.2% from the previous quarter and 14.6% below the third  quarter of 1988, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> Statewide, the median price of a home slipped 0.4% from $201,729 in the second  quarter to $200,933 in the third quarter. Even with the decline, the  third-quarter median price was 14.6% higher than the like period a year ago,  when the median price was $175,400.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the national median price for a house rose 2.1% to $95,000, although  there were wide regional differences, the realtors group said.  </P> <P> "What we've got here is a picture of a housing market in which activity remains  historically strong, but varies across the country," said John Tuccillo, the  realtors' chief economist.  </P></p>

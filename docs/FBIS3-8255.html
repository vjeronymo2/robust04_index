			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alain Bommenel] </F>   [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 8 (AFP) -- UN  peacekeepers now guarding Tuzla's military airport must clear  the area of mines and tighten security before the resumption of  aid flights in a few weeks, officers said on Tuesday.    Barely 24 hours after taking control of the airfield, the  140  Swedish and Danish troops under the command of the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) have deployed across the north-east base,  ensuring around-the-clock security along the 2,400-metre  (3,000-yard) runway.    The bid to open the airfield to humanitarian flights for the  first time in 23 months of war, in an operation codenamed  Pegasus, is to officially begin at noon Tuesday. It follows an  agreement by Bosnian Serbs encircling the area to allow two air  corridors into the Moslem-held city airport.    Backed by machinegun-mounted armoured troop carriers and six  Leopard tanks, they have been instructed to watch movements by  Bosnian Serb forces dug in eight kilometres (five miles) away  but in a direct line with the runway, which can take heavy  transport aircraft.    The men must also pinpoint attempts to infiltrate the  airfield perimetre, seven kilometres (4.2 miles) long. "I don't  want to see flocks of sheep on the runway when the planes begin  to land," an officer said.    But one of the top priorities for now is to clear the field  of mines. "This military base has been mined three times," said  the Swedish commander Magnus Lavman.    The army of former Yugoslavia laid mines, especially  anti-tank devices, when the airport was built. It has remained  in disuse since 1992 when troops avacuating the field  booby-trapped the airport and commandeered its technical  equipment and fighter planes, including MIGs. Last year, troops  from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army fearing attacks from enemy  Bosnian Serbs laid new mines in the woods surrounding the field.  French bomb disposal experts have already been ordered to the  base.    A first military plane carrying technical equipment is  expected within five to seven days. "We must move swiftly. The  UN's credibility is at stake," one western officer said. During  the first stages of the operation, UNPROFOR planes alone will  land on the runway. The Russian-built Ilyushin 76s, Antonov 32s  and Yakovlev 40s are to transport electronic, fire-fighting and  loading and unloading equipment to be used for the relief  flights.    Once this part of the operation is complete, within several  weeks, UNPROFOR will have to establish flight approach routes to  avoid over-flying combat zones. When the field has been secured  and equipped, transport planes carrying aid for the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will be able to start bringing  in relief. The relief flights will enable much-needed supplies  to reach some 700,000 people, most of them refugees who fled  from other areas and have been surviving on deliveries made by  road convoys that cover only 30 percent of their needs. Aid  flights are to come in from Zagreb and the Croatian port of  Split under an agreement between the United Nations and the  Bosnian Serbs. The airport is located about 15 kilometers (nine  miles) from Tuzla.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Russia's secrets chief warns west The head of Russia's foreign intelligence service yesterday warned the west that it must accept the re-integration of most of the former Soviet Union - or face the danger of a return to cold war postures fed by false fears. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, in a rare public appearance, said: 'Integration (of the Commonwealth of Independent States) is an undoubted fact. If a negative attitude towards this becomes accepted in western capitals, then it could very adversely affect relations between them and Moscow.' Mr Primakov also took the unprecedented step of releasing a report - 'Russia-CIS: Does the West Need to Change its Position?' - which says an economic union of the CIS states is inevitable and a defence and political union desirable, and that such unions would safeguard the independent and democratic development of these states. The report appears only a few days before President Boris Yeltsin leaves for the UK and the US for meetings with Prime Minister John Major and President Bill Clinton. Mr Primakov denied any link between the two events, saying that the report had not yet been shown to the president and that he doubted it would form part of his talks with the other two leaders. The report says that leading politicians and analysts in the west see the continued disintegration of the former Soviet Union as being in their interests - while believing that a re-integration is against these interests. It calls for a recognition that a re-integrated union, shorn of communist ideology and guaranteeing independence to each state, 'will lead to stabilisation and democratisation, promote reform and encourage some CIS countries to opt for a federal structure, all of which will diminish the threat of ethnic and inter-state conflicts within the CIS'. The alternative was a rapid worsening of the economic position in CIS countries, with a 'lurch towards nationalism accompanied by growing authoritarian and anti-democratic tendencies'. The report says that Russia has been grievously misunderstood in western 'circles' - though only two westerners are named Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski,the former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a consistent opponent of what he sees as Russian expansionism; and the US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, who is quoted as opposing Russian troops operating abroad.</p>

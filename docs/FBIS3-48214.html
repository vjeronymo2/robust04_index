"We shouldn't blindly oppose it. We will review it," Yi  said.    "Proposals for rezoning in the past were just gerrymandering  before an election, but as long as it is conducted fairly, it's  worth consideration," the Democratic Party leader said.    DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won confirmed Yi's remarks, saying the  redistricting "should be done if necessary."    The realignment of administrative units would include  merging  cities and counties before the mayoral, gubernatorial and local  elections in the first half of next year.    Stories were floated last week that the ruling party was  ready to split up Seoul as well because it was concerned an  opposition figure would be elected mayor, a position so powerful  it is called the no. 2 post after the president, and hamper the  administration.    President Kim immediately dismissed the idea, and Yi said  Friday that Seoul "can never be" divided.    DP officials said a party leadership meeting early next week  will formulate the party's official position on administrative  redistricting.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Markets: Investment hopes rise - Economic Notebook When politicians and opinion formers worry about an economic trend, it is often a sign that something is about to go right. This could be the case with Britain's laggard investment performance, which has long been of concern to the government and groups such as the Confederation of British industry. Investment has so far played only a small part in the UK's two-year-old economic recovery. The picture of a consumer-led upturn was apparently confirmed by last week's news that manufacturing industry's capital expenditure fell in real terms by 1 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1993. Recent CBI polls of manufacturers' investment intentions give little hint of strong growth to come. The April survey showed that the number of companies planning to increase investment in plant and machinery exceeded those planning a decrease by only 4 percentage points. The CBI's latest economic forecast cautiously predicts an increase in manufacturing investment of just 2.7 per cent this year and 4 per cent next year. But the chart shows that a subdued level of investment intentions among manufacturers is not unusual for this stage of the business cycle. When the UK was at exactly the same point of recovery from the recession of the early 1980s, the balance of companies planning to raise spending on plant and machinery was also just 4 per cent. It turned out that April 1983 was the start of a two-phase investment boom. Central Statistical Office figures show that the quarterly level of business investment grew by a strong inflation-adjusted 32 per cent between the second quarter of 1983 and the beginning of 1985. After a pause, the economy picked up again, so that in 1989 business investment hit a record Pounds 71.25bn in 1990 prices and was 72 per cent higher in real terms than in 1983. Capital expenditure by manufacturing industry - the type of investment surveyed by the CBI - only accounts for about a fifth of total business investment. It takes an even smaller share of overall UK gross fixed capital formation. This broadest measure of domestic investment, which includes some non-business investment such as housing, was up by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 compared with final quarter of 1993 and was 3.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of last year. The idea that the UK could be heading for a period of robust investment has supporters in the City. Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities, believes that investment in Britain is set to follow the US pattern of the past 12 months of strong growth after a hesitant start. An extended period of low interest rates has enabled companies to repair balance sheets damaged by the recession and build up liquidity, providing a good springboard for increased investment. With UK final demand moving into its third year of recovery, Mr Doyle thinks 'everything is in place for a year of double digit business investment growth.' Mr Kevin Gardiner, Morgan Stanley's UK economist, believes that capital spending will gather pace this year and next and give the recovery an extra boost. Corporate profits, he says, held up well in the recession and will continue to grow so that rates of return are likely 'to return to levels not seen since the 1960s.' Although Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, last week told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee that he was still concerned that UK companies were holding back from investments because they were demanding too high a rate of return, Mr Gardiner thinks strong profits will mean that high 'hurdle rates' may be less demanding than many observers fear. However, Britain would not be Britain, if there were not some fly in the ointment. James Capel's UK economics team subscribes to the view that investment and manufacturing output will be increasingly important motors for the UK recovery over the next two years and believes that higher investment will eventually strengthen Britain's exports. But, argues Capel's Mr Adrian Cooper: 'Long term gain may imply some short term pain.' Because Britain's investment goods industry is relatively weak, UK investment is very import intensive. Imports account for nearly 34 per cent of UK spending on fixed investment, compared with only 21.5 per cent of consumer spending. Strong growth in domestic investment could therefore lead to a short-term increase in Britain's current account balance of payments deficit. Indeed, it may be optimistic to think that a revival of investment will ease the UK's current account problems in the longer term. In the jargon of economists, the UK can look forward to a deepening rather than a widening of its industrial base. The recession of the early 1980s left Britain an insignificant competitor in several manufacturing sectors. While the UK has some world beating companies and areas of excellence - such as pharmaceuticals, processed food and jet engines - it relies mainly on foreign suppliers for many products, including machine tools, 'white goods', such as refrigerators, kitchen furniture, and mens' suits. Even if business investment takes off over the rest of the 1990s, it is unlikely to provide the industries that Britain no longer has, leaving it to depend heavily on imported manufactured goods.</p>

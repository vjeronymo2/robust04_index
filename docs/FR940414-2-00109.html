The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ``Morgan Stanley Group'') constitute a global financial services firm. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated (``MS&amp;Co.''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., is the principal broker-dealer affiliate of the Morgan Stanley Group and is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''). MS&amp;Co. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Partnership is a newly-formed Delaware limited partnership that was formed for the purpose of enabling certain employees, officers, directors, and advisory directors of the Morgan Stanley Group to pool their investment resources and to participate in various types of investment opportunities, including venture capital and private equity investments, without the necessity of each investor seeking to identify investments and to analyze their merit. The pooling of resources permits diversification and participation in investments that usually would not be offered to individual investors. The goal of the Partnership is to reward and retain key personnel by enabling them to participate in investment opportunities that would not otherwise be available to them and to attract other individuals to the Morgan Stanley Group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Partnership will operate as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. The Partnership will seek to achieve a high rate of return through long-term capital appreciation by providing expansion capital to a diversified group of private emerging growth companies. The Partnership will co-invest alongside two venture capital funds (the ``MS Venture Capital Funds'') that recently were organized by the Morgan Stanley Group for third party investors. The MS Venture Capital Funds are exempt from registration under the Act in reliance upon section 3(c)(1) thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The general partner of the Partnership is Morgan Stanley Venture Partners II, L.P. (the ``General Partner''). At present, the sole limited partner of the Partnership is Morgan Stanley Venture Capital II, Inc. (``MSVC II''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The General Partner and MSVC II are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act. MSVC II is the managing general partner of the General Partner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Interests in the Partnership will be offered without registration under a claim of exemption pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''). Interests will be offered and sold only to ``Eligible Employees'' of the Morgan Stanley Group or trusts established by such Eligible Employees for their benefit or the benefit of their immediate family. To be an Eligible Employee, an individual must currently be an employee, officer, director, or advisory director of a member of the Morgan Stanley Group and, except for certain individuals who will manage the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership, and ``accredited investor'' meeting the income requirements set forth in rule 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The limitations on the class of persons who may acquire interests, in conjunction with other characteristics of the Partnership, will qualify the Partnership as an ``employees' securities company'' under section 2(a)(13) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Three of the individuals who will manage the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership are not ``accredited investors.'' Each of these individuals is a partner of the General Partner, had reportable income from all sources in the calendar year immediately preceding such person's admission as a partner of the General Partner in excess of $120,000, and has a reasonable expectation of reportable income in the years in which such person will be required to make capital contributions to the General Partner of at least $150,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Dragons mark City boundary change City limits: a dragon marking the edge of the City of London was moved 200 yards north yesterday after boundary changes came into effect. Dragons have been used to mark the Square Mile's territory since 1870. The changes, which were made by the Local Government Boundary Commission, increase the City's population by 1,300 - more than 31 per cent</p>

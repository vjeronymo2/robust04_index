Privatization: Step by  Step"]    [Text] The first strike of the bookmaker [as  published] hammer put a decisive end to a chain of tiresome  discussions on the topic whether privatization in the Republic  of Moldova is or is not to be. Long live the wonderful paradox:  In the harsh struggle to guard the interests of the state, a  decisive and inevitable step has been made in the direction of  depriving this very state of its monopoly on property. Truly,  you do not always pick things up where you once put them....    The wine has been poured, wise men say, and has to be  drunk. We have much more reason--and much less time to  hesitate--to go through the next step than we had before we  started.    For this very reason, our meetings with the head of the  State Privatization Department became more frequent, and we are  here again conversing in Vissarion Cheshuyev's office.    [Kazakov] Vissarion Borisovich, as they say, the process has  gotten under way. And immediately one has to worry whether we  would replace the monopoly of the state with the monopoly of  clans. This is not an idle question: Figuratively speaking,  faces familiar to all of us are beginning to appear in the back  rooms of privatization, do you not find it so?    [Cheshuyev] I have heard of such concerns. I would not deny  it--not all of them are groundless: Whoever is the real owner of  the property will rule the ball. The marketplace is not the best  environment for displaying altruism. At the same time, I am not  inclined to exaggerate the danger of some or other political  groups gaining a monopoly on the initiative. It is not so easy  to do, especially here, where, as they say, each person is  watched, especially if it is a prominent figure.    [Kazakov] Still, you will not deny that as soon as an  opportunity comes along to accumulate the population's  privatization money--let us call it this way--a concentration of  ownership rights immediately takes place, and on the same scale,  at that. This process, as any oscillatory phenomenon, is capable  of becoming an avalanche. The experience of managerial science  does not deny the fact that effective management of production  manifests itself especially when property is concentrated among  a limited number of owners. So here is the contradiction: On the  one hand, the negative effect of a monopoly; on the other--the  well-known problems of a child with seven nannies. What to do?    [Cheshuyev] I repeat once again: Let us not dramatize the  situation. Both contentions have been supported by empirical  evidence. The famous General Motors company, for instance, has  almost million stockholders, but its manageability does not  suffer a bit from it. A bitter fight may ensue, on the other  hand, among two co-owners, even relatives, who sometimes run  their economic ship aground by trying to take the controls from  each other. I see a different danger here. Let us take the  experience of Russian privatization. The number of enterprises  privatized through conversion to joint-stock ownership is  reaching the tens of thousands, but turnover of securities is  extremely low. As a result, the pressure of the gigantic money  supply on the consumer market is not easing at all, and goods  are becoming increasingly scarce. As a consequence, the  government is forced to regulate the state of the market with  the same administrative measures. First and foremost by running  the printing press overtime. The Government of Russia has  allocated additionally more than 1 trillion rubles [R] for  procurement of agricultural products. Where will this money come  from if the printing press operates much more productively than  a weaving loom or a metal-cutting lathe? One may assume....    [Kazakov] The indexation of working capital in Romania is a  phenomenon of the same order.    [Cheshuyev] Of course. Hence, the conclusion: One of the  most  important privatization tasks--creating an active securities  market--has not been resolved. I am increasingly inclined to  believe that at the first stage of privatization, at the very  beginning of it, the effectiveness of investment funds, which  concentrate considerable means in their hands, is not  significant. It appears that preference should be given to trust  companies, which will help the population to acquire registered  stock for registered bonds. I emphasize--registered. This is the  only way to create a real securities market.    [Kazakov] It would be good to demonstrate it on an example.    [Cheshuyev] Certainly. The average value of a BND [national  wealth bond] is, let us say, 400,000 monetary units. For this  money its owner may purchase 400 shares of stock at R1,000 each.  Why keep them all under the mattress? A person will try to sell  for profit if not one-half, then at least one-third of this  stock. In my estimate, one out of every three of our citizens  will make this decision. The result is a securities market,  which will tie up huge amounts of money, thus relieving the  pressure on the scarce consumer market. Commodity prices will  stabilize. The economy will gain what it had been deprived of up  till now--the economic motivation for labor.    [Kazakov] Are you not afraid that the securities market will  soon become wild, as does everything here?    [Cheshuyev] I am, and therefore I believe that the state  should quickly get its bearings. Buying and selling of stock  should not become the prerogative of street trading. The  organizational mechanism for a securities market was developed a  long time ago. We do not need to invent anything.    [Kazakov] Let us go through it once more. For certain  reasons, unlike the Russian version of privatization, we have  made our BND registered. Will they not lose this quality once  they are turned into stock?    [Cheshuyev] The task of the BND's is not to preserve forever  the situation of the initial stage of privatization. Their task  is to launch a market. They do not give a person the right of  property per se--only the right to acquire it and dispose of it  at his discretion. A BND, if you wish, is the starter of  privatization. It helps to implant in a person's consciousness a  qualitatively new notion of social justice as the equality of  initial conditions rather than the equality of pieces of the pie  handed out through the window of a state distributive agency.    [Kazakov] So we can put it this way: Distributing bonds to  everyone in the country is a distribution of fishing rods, not  the fish. Take it and fish in the places where you think the  fish would take the bait best. Go fishing alone or in company  with others. Create, invest, experiment!    [Cheshuyev] This is the only way. A sense of ownership--as  all other senses, as a matter of fact--has to be nurtured and  developed. There will be mistakes; losses are also inevitable.  And there will be the development of a person as an individual  capable of walking through life on his own, without grasping all  the time for the handrail of state support.    [Kazakov] You mentioned that preference should be given to  trust companies over investment funds. At the same time, it was  you who did not allow trust companies to participate in the  first auctions. Why?    [Cheshuyev] Only one reason: We did not have a statute on  trust companies. Now it has been developed, and one hopes that  it will be approved soon. Then--be my guest; convince your  compatriots of your competency and integrity. Earn their trust.  Offer programs, compete. Make money for yourself and for others.    [Kazakov] Privatization is being conducted on a national  scale, but it involves quite specific objects, located on  specific territory. Hence, a question: the place and the role of  municipal organs in the privatization process. What do they get?  And something else: A store is sold at an auction. To be  precise: What is being sold is the former property of the  Ministry of Trade--counters, scales, refrigerators, hangers,  other equipment. As to the building itself, let alone the land  underneath, they still will not become the property of new  owners. One beautiful day the true landlord decides to put his  property to a different use, and the new owners are left on the  street with a pile of quite worn-out equipment. Or, a different  version: Impose such lease terms that it will make more sense to  just give your property away to the lessor. What to do?    [Cheshuyev] I have heard quite a lot about this problem. It  is interpreted in two ways: To some, it seems that the  municipality does not possess any property, and therefore city  authorities find themselves on the sidelines of privatization.  Others, on the contrary, are afraid of arbitrariness on their  part and thus sow the seeds of doubt in the minds of potential  owners.    Both positions are not quite correct. Municipal authorities  are not at all devoid of rights. They are the owner of  everything that is on the books of the municipal services  system, as well as of all enterprises that provide life support  for populated areas. The government decree envisages the  transfer of this type of enterprise from the jurisdiction of the  sectoral ministries to that of the local authorities. Frankly, I  am not certain that the latter are ready to take upon themselves  this load and to manage it rationally. They may end up creating  their own sectoral ministries. And there is nothing frightening  in this, in my opinion. As is known, one possesses only that  scope of power one is capable of taking upon himself.    [Kazakov] What if he takes on too much?    [Cheshuyev] That is also possible, and that is why a law on  municipal property is urgently needed--which we still do not  have. This law should regulate the procedure of managing the  property of regional authorities, its sale, leasing, and so on.  The latter is especially important. Such procedure at the level  of a law will rule out any doubts with respect to potential  arbitrariness of the sort "today I lease it, and tomorrow I  change my mind." We asked the municipal authorities to develop a  statute on the procedures of privatization of municipal  property. So far without any result, although I do not know of  any party that has more at stake in this document than they do.    [Kazakov] This part is clear. Let us return to auctions.  What  considerations were you guided by in entrusting their conduct to  some or other company? Who are those lucky guys? There are  rumors of some clan or even personal interests.... And  generally, why would your state department not take upon itself  this "honorary" function? Why do you need middlemen?    [Cheshuyev] I have to point out that conducting auction  sales  is an undertaking that is both time-consuming and expensive. We  do not have the money or the manpower for such specific work.    [Kazakov] Is it really that much hassle: a bookmaker [as  published], champagne, music--nothing but a celebration.    [Cheshuyev] A ballerina's leap on the scene also looks  effortless, but behind it is the exhausting, hard labor of a  workhorse. The spectator does not see it, but this only makes it  harder for the ballerina. Judge for yourself: Before a lot does  up for sale, it has to be studied from all angles and a  technical certificate issued for it. You have to know everything  about it: the condition of the foundation, of the building  itself, its communications, equipment, power system, and many,  many other things. Mountains of documents have to be processed  within a very short period of time. It is in essence a very  complex expert evaluation. Do note: If the lot purchaser  believes he has been cheated--for instance, if he discovers  hidden defects--he has the right to sue us for compensation. We  have to trust the experts very much in order not to make  ourselves vulnerable to new owners.    [Kazakov] What does the experience of past auctions show?    [Cheshuyev] We commissioned their organization and conduct  to  Moldprivatinvest Joint-Stock Society, and here is why. Two units  of this solid company undertook this task: the Industrialproekt  design and construction institute and the Azimut-tsentr company.  The former has highly skilled specialists and undertook  professional development and preparation of all technical  documentation, the intellectual potential of sorts; the latter  undertook organization and financing for the entire action.  Personally, I do not see how the state department could possibly  carry out this grandiose task in practical terms. We have  neither the specialists nor the money. A small item for  reference: To prepare three lots for the auction took about R20  million. All in all, there are about 40 enterprises. I doubt  that I would find support in the Ministry of Finance had I asked  for such amounts to prepare enterprises for the auction. I have  to give Moldprivatinvest its due--they did their work superbly.  As the saying goes, "Their example is a learning experience for  others...." Everything was organized and carried out at the  highest level of professionalism, rapidly and precisely. I have  to admit that they set the plank so high at this first auction  that subsequent organizers will have a hard time reaching for it.    [Kazakov] Is anybody already reaching for it?    [Cheshuyev] Yes, the next in line are the Gliya, Lara, and  Moldova exchanges. We will gladly consider any proposals, but I  have to warn: You may do it better than Moldprivatinvest, but  not worse.    [Kazakov] Why then spread yourself thin? Let them conduct  the  auctions. Why not leave well enough alone?...    [Cheshuyev] I cannot. I am in principle against monopolies.  An exclusive right to anything whatsoever begets exclusive  interests, behavioral motives, and many other things. Everyone  who goes into a business should have a chance.    [Kazakov] A rather slippery one, judging by what you say.  You  ask them to play a nocturne on the flute made of drain pipes, as  Vladimir Vladimirovich [Mayakovskiy] used to say.... There  probably is good profit from such a zeal--is there not?    [Cheshuyev] Not too good. The money they put into doing this  work could be "turned around" with much greater  effectiveness--which, I must tell you, they know how to do. No,  they are not driven by profit. There are certain company  interests that transcend mercenary motives. The company image,  for instance; its rating.    [Kazakov] Let me ask you one more question. You said that in  privatization you prefer trusts over other structures because  they reflect most fully the interests of their principals, that  is, the BND holders. Are there not other interests involved?    [Cheshuyev] There are other interests, too, and I have  already mentioned them. Privatization through trust companies,  in my opinion, will allow us to create a securities market in  the shortest time possible, thus relieving the money supply  pressure on the consumer market. I am not certain that there is  a more effective way to stabilize the economic situation in the  country.    Let us summarize the first results.    Legislative acts on privatization are far from  perfect--there  is no argument about that. There have been many comments on this  topic, and there will be more. But what do we have today that is  perfect? And do we have the right to expect laws passed in a  hurry to be perfect? And can we afford not to hurry?    We have to admit that all these questions are rhetorical. It  cannot be otherwise.    I personally like the position of the general director of  the  privatization department: In order to learn how to swim, you  have to at least get into the water. You will take in a  mouthful, sink perhaps, if you cannot avoid such a turn, but you  will be learning how to swim. Let us not assume that a law is  something cut in stone. The constitutions of most democratic  countries contain many amendments--is this not evidence that  they were not perfect originally?    First lots; first auctions; first joys and  disappointments.... We will learn. And we will master it if we  really want to.</p>

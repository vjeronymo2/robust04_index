			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY TURNS TEENS INTO TOTAL PHONE FREAKS  </P> <P> Monique Polizzi, 16, talks to girlfriends on a private telephone line. When  she's in a hurry, she pushes a button for speed dialing; when she is getting  dressed, she uses the speaker phone.  </P> <P> But Polizzi's mother drew the line at call waiting.  </P> <P> "She didn't want me to get it because she was afraid I'd be on the phone  constantly. So I just called the phone company myself and got it."  </P> <P> Polizzi, a junior at Chatsworth High School, was eventually caught using the  forbidden service. But although she said her mother wanted her to pick up the  tab for speed dialing, "I never ended up paying for it."  </P> <P> "Now I'm constantly on the phone," Polizzi admitted. But "I've learned to talk  and do homework at the same time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Telephone Hogs  </P> <P> Teen-agers are notorious telephone hogs, and with today's technology --  separate phone lines, call waiting, call forwarding, speed dialing, three-way  calling, speaker phones, cordless phones, car phones and, of course, answering  machines -- they never have to miss a word. Even the parents who pay -- or at  least approve of -- all this technology seem to feel that hours of telephone  time are an inevitable part of the growing-up process.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I get really frustrated," said Jeri Shipp, the mother of Stephanie  Shipp, a 17-year-old senior at North Hollywood High. "I'd say, 'Can you get off  the phone so we can eat dinner?' I'd just put everything on a plate and leave  it there, and when I'd come back half an hour later, it'd be untouched. She'd  still be on the phone. It's frustrating, but I remember what it was like. I did  the same thing, so it's hard to get mad."  </P> <P> Burbank psychologist Mark Imhoff says teen-agers talk on the phone all the time  "because of their changing focus of their libidos from the family to the peer  group. The family isn't as psychologically significant as the peer group now  is. They're trying to find out who they are, what their identity is, where they  fit into the peer group.  </P> <P> "The kids who don't go through this normal pathology of talking on the phone a  lot are the ones in the high-risk groups," Imhoff said. "They're not going  through what they need to go through as teen-agers, the whole identity issue.  Those are the teen-agers we kind of raise our eyebrows about."  </P> <P> </P> <P> '6 People on the Phone'  </P> <P> Imhoff probably wouldn't raise his eyebrows over 17-year-old Jenny Carpenter, a  senior at Chatsworth High School. Carpenter has her own line, call waiting,  three-way calling, speed dialing, a speaker phone and a cordless phone. "When  I'm on the phone with a friend, we can talk to another friend. But lots of my  friends have the triple line too, so, at times, you can have up to six people  on the phone."  </P> <P> In addition to the many phone services that are available, retailers report  that teen-agers are concerned about style -- and cordless and transparent,  neon-lined phones are the big winners.  </P> <P> "They love the cordless phone," said George Iglesias, manager of Future Tronics  in Northridge, where cordless phones sell for between $199.95 and $239.95. "The  cordless phone looks like a cellular phone. It always stands up, has a rubber  antenna. Teen-agers like that high-tech 'space' look."  </P> <P> The transparent, neon phone is less expensive at $49, and Iglesias said he  sells about 25% of his stock to teen-agers. "Teen-agers say that phone is rad,"  he said. "Boyfriends and girlfriends buy them for each other." And both phones  are considered status symbols. "You see the junior high kids walking around  with pride, saying, 'Oh, man, I'm going to get that phone.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 45 Cents Per Minute  </P> <P> The telephone obsession extends to the car, where expenses mount up quickly.  Circuit City, for example, charges $400 on average to install a car phone,  after which L.A. Cellular will bill customers $45 a month plus 45 cents per  minute.  </P> <P> Shana Dishell, a 17-year-old senior at the private Buckley School in Sherman  Oaks, has had a car phone since her 16th birthday. "I'm only supposed to use it  for emergencies," Dishell said. "Like to call my mother if I'm driving to a  friend's house, or to call the barn where I'm going to be horseback riding.  But," she giggled, "I also use it to call friends."  </P> <P> "The car phone was for our peace of mind," said her mother, Marilyn. "With her  driving, and this crazy world today and the shootings on the freeway, I was  very nervous. I wanted her to be able to dial 911."  </P> <P> Luka Pecel of Studio City, another 17-year-old senior at Buckley School, said  there's a car phone in his future. "My mom wants me to get it because she wants  to keep track of where I am."  </P> <P> Stephanie Shipp thinks that her parents will get her a car phone when she goes  to college next year. "If I go to USC, they might want me to have a car phone  to see if I'm OK, or to say, 'Can you pick up the milk on the way over?' " she  said.  </P> <P> An employee at Circuit City in Woodland Hills confirmed that parental concern  is the main reason teen-age drivers acquire car phones. In a typical month, he  will sell 23 phones, and about one-third are purchased for teen-agers.  "Typically, it's middle-class parents coming in and getting the car phone for  their kid's safety. They usually buy a simple, bottom-of-the-line car phone for  birthday or graduation or whatever."  </P> <P> Since almost all of the students interviewed have their own private phone  lines, what was it like when their families had to share one line?  </P> <P> "In our house, we have one upstairs bedroom," said 15-year-old Kristen Strong,  a 10th-grader at Chatsworth High. "I talk on the phone all the time. My parents  could never get any calls. My brother couldn't either.  </P> <P> "My mom didn't want me to have my own line," said Strong, who indeed has her  own line, call waiting and three-way calling. "She just thought I shouldn't be  talking on the phone that much anyway. She objected to the whole thing. So my  dad pays for it. I've had it since the seventh grade. I used to get in trouble  a lot for it -- I'd say, 'OK, I'm off the phone,' then I'd stay on the phone,  but whisper so my mom couldn't hear me."  </P> <P> Missy Pecel, Luka's 14-year-old sister -- and an eighth grader at Buckley  School -- talks on the phone for three hours a night. She doesn't have her own  line or any of its frills -- yet. "In a few months, I'm going to get one," she  said. "Luka got his first, I guess, because he's older."  </P> <P> Missy remembers the fights that used to break out when she and her brother had  to share the same line. "He'd always want to talk to girls, and I'd want to  talk to my friends," she said. "He'd get mad when I'd pick up the phone and  listen, but I'm interested in his conversations. I like to hear what he says to  girls and stuff, to see where he's ranked in his grade, how popular he is."  </P> <P> Now that Luka has his own private line, Missy's solved the dilemma of not being  able to eavesdrop. "I just sit outside his door and listen," she said.  </P> <P> Patricia Polizzi decided to get her daughter her own line because "Monique has  abundant energy. With her on the phone in her room, she keeps it centralized --  the whole house isn't 16."  </P> <P> "I really think it's a waste of her time," she added. "But I'd rather she do  that than watch TV. It's the lesser of the two evils. At least I know where she  is when she's on the phone. She's in my home, rather than someplace else."  </P> <P> Jeri Shipp says Stephanie has had her own telephone since she was 12 years old.  "I couldn't stand sharing it with her. Two females in one house with one phone  doesn't work. We were always fighting over it. I do mind paying her bill (about  $40 a month) but she's real good about it. When she made some new friends in  different areas, it went sky high. I tell her to watch it, but then she'll go  use my phone."  </P> <P> Shana Dishell, 17 on phone in her BMW as friend, Eden Krell, listens  </P></p>

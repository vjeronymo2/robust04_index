			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (9): Perfection may be within reach - Joia Shillingford looks at trends in mobile handsets So small and perfectly formed are today's mobile phone handsets that many question whether they will get much smaller. In fact, the perfect mobile phone handset - small, light and cheap - may not be far away. Ms Diana Jones, marketing manager of service provider Mercury Communications Mobile Services, says: 'I don't believe handsets will get much smaller than the smallest models produced by Sony and Ericsson because of the mouth-to-ear ratio.' She believes that 'handsets could even move in the other direction like calculators. Calculators got smaller and smaller, but then people found them fiddly to use. And larger calculators with easy-to-press buttons started to be sold as well.' So on traditional analogue networks (like those operated by Vodafone and Cellnet), she expects most business people to stay with middle-sized phones about the size and design of NEC's P4. However, there is still scope for phones designed for the newer digital services to get smaller and lighter. Mr Byan Van Dussen, a senior analyst at Yankee Group Europe, says: 'Improvements in battery technology are the key for weight to reduce, profiles to become slimmer and talk time to increase.' Restricted battery life is a problem for both analogue and digital phones. The current generation of batteries typically give two hours of continuous talk time and lasts 22 hours if left on and not used. This means that heavy mobile phone users often have to carry spare batteries and charge them up at night. The problem is worse with GSM, which can drain battery life more quickly. But battery technology is changing. Nicad batteries have been replaced by Nickel metal hydride on the latest phones - some give a choice of Nicad or Nickel metal hydride. The next step will be metal ion batteries. Phones using metal ion could be more expensive initially but will have more power. Improvements in battery technology are likely to benefit service providers and manufacturers. Airtime distributors such as Securicor Cellular Services and Mercury Mobile Services should gain if users can spend more time talking on the phone. Manufacturers should benefit because, as the weight and profile of handsets falls, they will become more pocketable and therefore more appealing to the mass market. Price is also critical. Mr Terry Barwick, director of corporate affairs for Vodafone, says: 'Customers always ask three questions: How much will the equipment cost? How much is the monthly charge? and How much are the calls? The lower the cost of entry, the faster the market will grow.' At present, analogue phones can cost as little as Pounds 49 and are sometimes given away free. Those aimed at business users will usually cost Pounds 99 to Pounds 299. GSM phones cost about Pounds 100 more for the same type of handset, and range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 500. They are more expensive than their analogue counterparts because they are not yet sold in the same volumes. But because the GSM standard has been adopted across Europe, manufacturers will be able to make large quantities and lower prices. This has not yet happened and in fact component shortages have restricted the supply of GSM phones. However, because any GSM phone should work with any GSM network, it is possible to buy a phone in one country for use in another, where it may be dearer. It pays to shop around. But before long, prices for GSM phones should fall to the same level as more expensive analogue phones. Ms Sandra Richards, cellular phones marketing manager at NEC of Japan's UK subsidiary, expects this to happen by the end of the year. Call charges and monthly charges for UK analogue business services have fallen in real terms, according to Mr Barwick. He says the monthly charge has stayed at around Pounds 25 and peak call charges at 25p a minute since 1985. Charges for GSM services offered by Vodafone and Cellnet are similar (though their GSM services are completely separate from their analogue services and require different handsets). Though service providers and network operators argue otherwise, there will be continued pressure on charges with the entry into the market of Hutchison's Orange and Mercury's One-2-One services - both based on PCN digital technology - a variant of GSM. But there are still areas where charges will be high for some time. One of these is pan-European roaming, which allows a GSM user in one country to send and receive calls in other countries with GSM networks. Roaming works through reciprocal agreements, with each operator adding a premium. Handset manufacturers will be able to charge more for handsets that do more than just connect to GSM. For example, Nokia of Finland sells a phone that can be integrated easily into mobile data applications - such as sending and receiving text on the move. In the longer term, dual handsets may start to appear, which can connect to more than one network. The drive for these is mainly coming from the US, where there is more than one digital standard. But in Europe, dual handsets could be used to connect to both GSM and Dect - a European standard starting to be used to provide wireless office switchboards. The idea is that when customers phone a business, they could be put through to the person they want (without redialing) whether that person is in the office or on the move. Mr Van Dussen believes that in three or four years' time, this area could be 'a terrific bonanza' for the few leading handset manufacturers who are looking into it. This is because though dual-purpose phones may be small and light, they are unlikely to be cheap. Joia Shillingford is associate editor of Business Computing Brief, a Financial Times newsletter.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis improves in second half but cuts dividend SOME MEASURE of improvement was achieved by Jarvis in the second half, and for 1991 overall this contracting, construction and property group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 238,000. However, that compared with Pounds 1m previously, and the final dividend is cut to 0.325p for a total of 0.575p, against 2p. Earnings per share were 0.8p (4.2p). Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said the construction division did not produce a satisfactory result. There was a poor performance from the building side, offset to some extent by a good result from civil engineering and a reasonable show in products and services. The building side had to suffer a material reduction in staffing and overheads to shape it to meet the available opportunities. The substantial cost of such had been included in the accounts. The property division made a continuing improvement following further rent reviews. At the year-end net borrowings were equivalent to 24 per cent (34 per cent) of shareholders' funds.</p>

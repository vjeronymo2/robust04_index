			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Guillermo Endara during a ceremony </F> transferring command of the Public Force to the Electoral  Tribunal from the National Theater in Panama City--live]    [Text] Mr. Vice President of the Republic; state ministers;  comptroller; attorney general; honorable magistrates of the  Electoral Tribunal; honorable magistrates of the Supreme Court;  vice ministers; directors and subdirectors of autonomous and  semiautonomous institutions; governors; mayor; members of the  diplomatic corps; directors and subdirectors of the Public  Force; members of the Justice and Peace Commission; electoral  delegates; representatives of the political parties; national  and foreign media representatives; ladies and gentlemen:    As a Panamanian I have always loved my fatherland with the  firm feeling my parents instilled in me since I was a child.  Later, as an adult, this feeling was nourished by the teachings  of my tutor, Arnulfo Arias Madrid. Also, there is no situation  that intensifies patriotism more than being exiled, finding  oneself forced to be far from one's homeland. I have  experienced this situation twice, the first when I was seven  years old.    I have always been convinced as an attorney of the  irreplaceable value of the existence of the state of law as a  foundation for stability and social development. I have  defended throughout my life as a politician the moral principle  that sovereignty resides with the people; consequently, it is  only the people's will, which is a manifestation of divine will,  from which the authorities' origin and reason for being stem.    As constitutional president of the Republic, I have always  wanted the best for my fellow countrymen. Despite the  limitations, we have achieved an impressive material and  institutional growth over a short period, while it was estimated  in 1989 we would need at least a 10-year period to achieve what  we have. Above all, as president I have considered as my  primary duty ensuring that all citizens have the right to vote  freely. These considerations on the whole serve to explain the  significance of this act.    This is not a mere symbolic event. For the first time in  our republican history the president of the Republic, by virtue  of his powers, cedes to the Electoral Tribunal the command of  the Public Force, thus complying with the guidelines established  for the electoral process. This healthy measure was proposed by  the executive branch and adopted by the Legislative Assembly,  and it has been incorporated into the current Electoral Code.  It is for the purpose of guaranteeing Panamanian voters pure  elections, free from any shadow of undue influence.    Gentlemen, directors, officers, and Public Force members, as  supreme chief of the Panamanian Public Force and abiding by  existing laws, I hereby notify you that as of this moment and  until the proclamation of the president-elect of the Republic,  you are under the command of the Electoral Tribunal for all  purposes that will guarantee the freedom, honesty, and integrity  of the 8 May elections.    Honorable magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, please  receive command of the Panamanian Public Force for the above  mentioned purposes, and with it you receive the guarantee you  have full authority and full responsibility. In addition,  receive the assurances the men and women under your command as  of today will know how to fully comply with the historic tasks  you are assuming.    I want to give one final message to my fellow countrymen. I  said five years ago the world is watching us. I quoted that  from the Communal Action anthem. Today, that is as true as  before.    Our fatherland needs for the culmination of the electoral  campaign on election day and the subsequent vote count to  develop in an atmosphere of peace, order, and harmony.    The people's inherent enthusiasm can take place within a  framework of civic spirit and respect for each other and the  authorities. Nothing could contribute more to improve Panama's  image before the international community than the massive and  orderly turnout of citizens to a democratic, clean, and peaceful  process.    May God enlighten us in the upcoming days with the brilliant  light of His eternal wisdom so that everything will be for the  fatherland's well-being and progress. Thank you. [applause]</p>

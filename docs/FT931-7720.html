			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Leading Article: When Brussels lacks steel LITTLE BY little, the rationalisation of the European steel industry seems to be slipping into the dateless future. This Thursday's meeting of EC industry ministers was supposed to be making concrete decisions on capacity cuts, aid and imports. Instead, it is to pass a resolution broadly supporting an outline plan yet to be drawn up by the EC Commission. If this sounds wishy-washy, it is probably meant to be. Killing off steel plants is a politically hazardous business. If the trigger must be pulled, no one wants their prints on the gun. It is possible to feel a twinge of sympathy. Even the more extreme ideas emanating from the Commission are too half-hearted to be worth taking risks for. The ideal result would be a European steel industry which is not just smaller than now, but is concentrated on the most efficient plants. No mechanism has even been suggested for bringing this about. If agreement were reached on taking out capacity, it would be left to the steel companies themselves to thrash out who should close what. This cartel approach certainly has the virtue of simplicity. Whether the result would approximate to a market-based solution, or indeed serve the interests of consumers, is another matter. It might be argued that no such immediate solution was on the cards. Politics is inherent in European steel, if only as a matter of history. Perhaps all Brussels can hope to do is to hand out central cash to persuade member states to spend less on individual subsidies. That way, the disciplines of the market may be allowed to work more effectively in the long run. The alternative would be for the EC to specify which plants should be closed. Not only would that further step be politically impossible: it is far from clear that the EC is equipped to take it. The one matter which is wholly within the jurisdiction of Brussels is that of steel imports from eastern Europe. Here the EC faces a genuine dilemma. It is doubtless true that, at the margin, imports from the east are disruptive. If obsolete plants are run for cash with no thought of replacement, a business run as a going concern cannot hope to compete on price. Thus, to allow free access to eastern steel risks adding to the ranks of jobless EC steelworkers. The snag is that the alternative might be playing host to jobless Polish and Czech steelworkers instead. In such a situation, the only answer is compromise. But in debating how much subsidy and protection to allow, Brussels should remind itself of a simple fact. In the face of small-scale, flexible methods of steel production, Europe's huge integrated steel mills may be industrial dinosaurs anyway. The longer they are propped up, the more the EC risks ending up without a steel industry in the long run. In terms of comparative advantage, that need not necessarily be a bad thing. But in social as well as economic terms, it points an obvious moral. Rather than keep workers unproductively employed, the trick is to find them something better to do.</p>

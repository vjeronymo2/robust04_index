			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- France and the United States  are cooperating in the effort to get a clause on workers' rights  added to the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  accord, French Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said Thursday [31  March].    The idea is being fiercely resisted by developing countries,  who see it as a protectionist measure by industrialized nations,  and threatens to mar the April 12 opening at Marrakesh of a GATT  conference scheduled to climax in the signing of the biggest  trade liberalization package ever.    Longuet, speaking to members of the French employers'  organisation, said he had discussed the question with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor Wednesday.    French government sources said they had agreed that Longuet  would lobby European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittain and  also Germany, which is particularly unenthusiastic, while Kantor  would approach GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland, who  supports the developing countries.    Longuet said it was a matter of "making people realise that  freeing up the world economy must be counterbalanced by the  respect for the mimimum standards of the International Labour  Organisation on child labour and forced labour by those  benefitting from free trade."    In addition, countries that have reached a certain level of  development have an obligation to harmonise over the long term  with developed nations on labour questions, he added.    "Experience proves that when France and the United States  share the same point of view, there is a chance not necessarily  to settle the problem but at least open the door, or put a foot  in it so that it can not be closed."    In Geneva on Wednesday failure to agree on the question of a  social clause led the United States to block the final draft of  a Marrakesh ministerial declaration and a document on the  mandate of a preparatory committee for a new World Trade  Organization.    European Union negotiators proposed a compromise wording  referring to the possibility of raising "new issues" without  mentioning the trade-workers' link, but Washington and Paris  dismissed it as too weak.</p>

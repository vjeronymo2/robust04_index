			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Observer: When teacher knows best Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, has stirred up a storm in Bonn with his new book which fiercely criticises the quality of the country's political leadership. So who does run Germany today? One group whose influence certainly has not waned is the august body of German economics professors. Sixty members of this fraternity discomfited the government only last week by signing a petition against European monetary union. Theo Waigel, the finance minister, staunchly backed by the chief economists of the big three German banks, did his best to counter the academics' criticisms. But, if history is anything to go by, it seems likely that the professors' views will prevail. The last time that the economics profession caused a similar flurry was in 1969, when 100 economics professors signed a public statement condemning the government's refusal to revalue the Deutschmark. The episode was one of the contributory factors behind the breakdown of the Grand Coalition government led by Kurt Georg Kiesinger. Five months later, the professors won the day when the Bonn government - a Social Democrat administration under Chancellor Willy Brandt, following Kiesinger's ignominious autumn departure - decided the second revaluation of the D-Mark since the war. German professors are long-lived animals. So, for conspiracy theorists at least, it is worth pointing out that the latest professorial broadside was supported by several who also signed the 1969 petition - including, notably, the redoubtable Herbert Giersch, the former head of the Kiel economic institute.</p>

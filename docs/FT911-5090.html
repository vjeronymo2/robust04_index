			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Treuhand restrains media barons in sale of newspapers TEN OF east Germany's former communist newspapers were sold to west German publishers yesterday for a total of DM850m (Pounds 284m) in a fiercely-contested bidding battle. However, the Treuhand privatisation agency intervened to ensure that they did not all fall into the hands of the big four west German media barons. The Treuhand is anxious to see that west Germany's publishing giants do not dominate the press market in the east, so it employed New York investment bankers JP Morgan to organise the bidding and assure the 'highest degree' of objectivity. The largest west German publishers secured only one each of the dailies they bid for. Axel Springer, the nation's largest newspaper publisher, and Madsack publishing house jointly bought the Leipziger Volkszeitung, which has a circulation of 379,000. All other Springer bids were turned down, as were multiple tenders by Hamburg publisher Gruner &amp; Jahr, which was only allowed to take a majority stake in Sachsische Zeitung in Dresden, the largest of the regional dailies with a circulation of 517,000. Heinrich Bauer obtained the Magdeburger Volksstimme (which has a circulation of 374,000), but likewise failed in its bid to other regional papers. Contracts finalising all the takeovers have yet to be signed. Another large west German magazine publisher, Burda, obtained only the 180,000-circulation Schweriner Zeitung. However, Burda plans to launch a mass-circulation newspaper in Berlin next month in a head-on challenge to Axel Springer which dominates tabloid circulation in the capital. Only two of the 15 east German dailies now remain unsold, and they will come on the market later when technicalities regarding the sale are resolved. Three have already been sold. The purchase by Maxwell Communications and Gruner &amp; Jahr of Berliner Verlag, publisher of the 300,000-circulation Berliner Zeitung, from the east German Communist Party was approved by the Treuhand last month. Mr Karl Schirner, a member of the Treuhand board, said yesterday that the buyers of the 10 newspapers intended to invest DM1.3bn in them and would expand overall jobs by nearly 10 per cent to 8,800 by the end of next year. The Treuhand has also agreed in principle a restructuring programme for east Germany's shipyards which is likely to cost several billion D-Marks, writes David Goodhart in Bonn. The DMS group in Rostock is expected to receive Treuhand-backed liquidity credit of DM500m but will need at least DM3bn in new investment for a full restructuring. MR HERO BRAHMS was yesterday appointed vice-president of the Treuhand, a newly-created post under Mrs Birgit Breuel who last weekend succeeded the assassinated former president, Mr Detlev Rohwedder, writes Leslie Colitt. Mr Brahms is a member of the executive board of Hoesch, the steel company formerly headed by Mr Rohwedder.</p>

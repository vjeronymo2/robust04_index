			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 115 (605): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has given his backing to  the economic program of Ukraine's new Prime Minister Vitaliy  Masol and expressed his hope that it will be implemented.  Addressing students and teachers of the Odessa Polytechnical  Institute, Kravchuk underlined that "the main thing is that  nobody hinders him."    According to Kravchuk, Masol meets all demands of the  parliament and the Ukrainian society which they put forward with  respect to the head of the government. "Masol has re-oriented  both in his ideology and in his perception of the Ukrainian  economy and the program proclaimed by him in the parliament  testifies to this fact," Kravchuk said.    At the parliament's session Masol declared that he is in  favor of introduction of several changes into Ukraine's  Constitution, which would stipulate that the prime minister is  the head of the executive power and carries personal  responsibility in for the economic transformations in the  country in the face of the people.    "The crisis is not over yet, it is deepening and we are  probably on the threshold of a burst," he said. However, he  reassured the deputies that "the government would do its utmost  to stabilize the situation" but this will begin "not earlier  than in a year or in a year and a half."    Masol called his election to the post of the head of the  Cabinet "a chance for those who want to work." "The future  Cabinet of Ministers, he continued, will consist of like minded  professionals who stand on the market platform and are outside  any political orientations. Ukraine's national interests will  be their major goal," Masol stressed.    He addressed to Ukraine's political forces and people with a  request "to abstain from destructive moves."    The parliament has proposed to the premier to present a plan  of urgent measures to stabilize the social-economic situation in  the country to the parliament for consideration and to make  necessary changes in the composition of the cabinet.    After Masol's election the parliament speaker Aleksandr  Moroz  declared to journalists that substantial changes would take  place in the government. In his words, "the Cabinet will be  primarily formed on the professional basis but not in accordance  with political points of views."    Deputy Yefim Zvyagilsky, former acting premier, gave a  positive assessment to Masol's election because "he knows Masol  as a professional, an experienced industrialist."    Deputy Petr Simonenko, leader of Ukraine's Communist Party,  said that the new head of the government "as well as we, the  communists," understands the problems of the Ukrainian people."  "We have several differences but they are not principal ones  and will not prevent our work," he added.    At the same time leader of the Popular Rukh Vyacheslav  Chernovil believes that "the government headed by Masol will go  along the way of reforms too slowly." In his opinion, "Masol  would not have been elected" if the voting had not been  postponed for Thursday morning but was held the previous  evening. Chernovil asserts that "an active work to buy over the  deputies was being conducted" at night from 15 to 16 June.    Leader of the Ukrainian conservative republican party Stepan  Khmara called the premier's elections held before creation of a  necessary legislative basis, in particular, before the adoption  of the decree on the government as premature.</p>

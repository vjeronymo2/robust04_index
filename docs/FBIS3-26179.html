"President Kim gave me a message to give to President  Clinton. It will be in his hands tomorrow (Friday) morning,"  said Graham, talking for the first time about his trip last week  to Pyongyang.    The message was being carried to Washington by one of  Graham's aides.    The globe-travelling preacher, who arrived in Pyongyang last  Thursday for his second visit in as many years, said he was "not  free" to say what was in either message.    But he revealed that Kim was "very interested" in what  Clinton had asked Graham to convey to him.    Graham, 75, said he discussed a wide range of subjects over  lunch with Kim, 81, whose Stalinist state is suspected of  developing nuclear weapons, upsetting East Asia's strategic  balance.    "He appeared to be vigorous and in good health. My strong  impression was that he continues to be the dominant figure in  North Korean political and social life," he said.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This week): Reed Elsevier under post-merger scrutiny - Other companies Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, will announce on Thursday its first full-year results since the merger. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 530m (Dollars 773.8m). Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says that as well as a pre-tax figure of Pounds 530m - Pounds 280m for Reed's share - he will be looking for further evidence that the merger is producing benefits. Ms Lorna Tilbian of SG Warburg is looking for Pounds 535m - Pounds 283m accounted for by Reed. During the year the group finally took over Official Airline Guides, sold its stake in British Sky Broadcasting and expanded into legal publishing in France and Italy. More small-to-medium 'filling in' acquisitions are now expected to add to Reed Elsevier's professional and specialist publishing activities.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Yeltsin starts his campaign with defence of free-market policies PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin last night launched his referendum campaign, promising Russians there would 'no second shock' in economic reform but making clear his radical programme would continue. In his most personal defence of free-market policies so far, he said he saw his main role as 'the guarantor of proprietors' and urged his weary electorate to resist nostalgia for their Soviet past. 'Don't believe any talk about socialist heaven and kind Soviet power,' he told a group of students in his first big campaign speech. He said the April 25 referendum was about a decisive choice between reforms and 'those who want to slide back to the past and put a cross on reforms and therefore on Russia'. He also defended his pro-western policies, proclaiming on the eve of talks of assistance for Russia in Tokyo that there had been a 'breakthrough in western attitudes to Russian reforms'. But promising there was 'no need or objective reason' for a new shock after price liberalisation last January, he said it was time to 'take a deep breath and shift gear in the reforms'. He did not specify which gear he would shift to, but everything else in the speech pointed to a continuation of radical reforms launched last year. He said state-owned enterprises could no longer expect 'free credits' and would have to speed 'structural change'. He said the government's main mistake last year had been to try to 'appease' opponents of its policies. But he also stressed the need for better legislation to guarantee property rights, in particular of land, the free sale and purchase of which is still forbidden by the Russian constitution. The speech was a vintage Yeltsin combination of brave economic slogans and populist promises, in which he sought to soothe hurt and confused national pride. He reassured a weary and impoverished electorate that Russia 'was, is, and will be a world-class industrial power'. He added that Russia would not blindly copy the US, the country which Russians are most used to comparing their country with in terms of military might. 'A market system will not work as strictly as in the US. The state will be the guarantor of traditional values in this country like social justice. . . and social protection.' He won his greatest applause when he announced he had signed a decree increasing student grants, minutes after calling in his speech for a slowing down of the printing of money to fight inflation. Speaking hours after the results of various provincial elections showed low voter turnout, he recognised the danger of voters not turning out to vote in large numbers but said he had no choice but to put his fate in their hands. Relatively dull elections for governors of four Russian provinces attracted turnout of between 32 per cent in the Orlov region and up to 47 per cent in Krasnoyarsk area - a particularly low turnout for a country which for decades was forced to vote. But the flashy campaign of a 30-year-old rouble billionaire in presidential elections in the autonomous republic of Kalmykia, which is part of the Russian Federation, may give some heart to President Yeltsin. Having subsidised bread and dairy prices in the run-up to the vote, Mr Kirsan Iliumzhinov beat two former Communists with 65 per cent of the votes cast, and very high turnout of 82 per cent.</p>

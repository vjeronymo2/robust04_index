			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (2): A year of rising output - Harsh economic medicine is starting to work POLAND was the first country in post-communist central Europe to embark on radical economic reforms. It now has the satisfaction of being first to see light at the end of the tunnel after 3 1/2 years of wrenching economic change. Industrial output, which dropped like a stone for two years after the introduction of a crash economic stabilisation package in January 1990, has been rising for over a year from a low point 40 per cent below 1989 levels. Official figures show that April output was 8.1 per cent above the same month last year, and 7.6 per cent higher on average over the first four months. Official unemployment, the surest indicator of the depth of the industrial surgery which has pared down the state-owned enterprises, remains at a high 14.3 per cent of the labour force. But the rate of increase in unemployment has declined sharply and it now looks as though more jobs are being created in the dynamic private sector than are being shed in formerly bloated and inefficient state enterprises. Registered unemployment actually dropped by more than 6,000 in March. A recent World Bank report found that many state owned enterprises are also now showing the benefits of better management, lower labour costs and other delayed adjustments to the harsh external environment imposed by the government's tough fiscal and monetary policies. Some, such as the Szczecin shipyards, have shown remarkable turnrounds and are now exporting profitably without subsidies. Strong growth in the chemical, electrical machinery and construction industries is leading the industrial recovery, accompanied by signs of a revival in investment and consumer demand. Higher output and rising real incomes, however, have put pressure on the external account with an 8 per cent drop in exports to Dollars 3.04bn in the first quarter contrasting with a 16.5 per cent rise in imports to Dollars 3.41bn. The deepening recession in EC markets, especially Germany, has made exporting more difficult, while the continuing effects of last year's drought, the EC ban on livestock imports, and poor prospects for the current farm season have cut into farm exports and led to an increase in grain imports to make up the 7m tonne shortfall in last year's 20m grain harvest. Were it not for the drought, Poland would have registered a 3-4 per cent rise in GDP last year instead of just over 1 per cent. This year the GDP growth target is 3-4 per cent and, longer term, the government is looking for a resumption of steady growth averaging 5 per cent annually for the next decade. The Central Planning Office (CUP), which advises the government, has drawn up two growth projections for 1994. The slow growth variant looks for 2.7 per cent GDP growth, a modest rise in exports and imports, but 18 per cent unemployment and 32 per cent inflation. The fast track variant opts for 6.5 per cent growth, an 8 per cent rise in exports, double the rate of capital formation, 15 per cent unemployment and 36 per cent inflation. To move to the fast track, the CUP calls for income tax relief for investors, lower interest rates linked to the producer price index (and not the consumer index), tax breaks for high unemployment regions and export promotion through the creation of a new export credit and insurance agency. Economists believe the shift from a Dollars 385m trade surplus in the last quarter of 1993 to a Dollars 370m deficit over the first quarter of 1993 reflects the high import elasticity of Polish industry - which increasingly incorporates sophisticated imported components in its products - and the desire of Polish consumers for quality imported goods. But the deterioration also reflects an over-valued zloty. The government imposed a 6 per cent import surcharge on December 17 to restrain imports and followed this up last month by raising the daily devaluation of the zloty from 12 to 15 zloties, equivalent to a 1.85 per cent monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation. The government has been reluctant fully to devalue the zloty in line with domestic inflation, which has declined sharply over the last three years but is still affected by the phasing out of energy subsidies, government deficit spending and the impact of devaluation itself. Consumer prices are currently rising at 32/34 per cent on an annual basis with a smaller rise in producer prices. Reducing inflation to single digits remains a key policy target. The outgoing government's main policy anchor was its commitment to limit the budget deficit to around 5 per cent of GDP. This was the central plank in its letter of intent to the IMF which agreed a Dollars 660m standby loan in March. This was followed two months later by two further loans totalling Dollars 750m from the World Bank to help finance farm reforms, bank restructuring and debt repayment. Holding the line was politically difficult for the minority coalition government which was brought down by trade union and opposition demands for higher pay and higher pensions for public sector employees. Had the government given in to the demands the 21,000bn zloty (Pounds 840m) extra spending would have breached the budget deficit limits. Shortly before dissolving parliament President Lech Walesa vetoed the parliamentary vote for higher pension payments and Ms Hanna Suchocka, re-appointed as acting prime minister, publicly welcomed the fact that with parliament in abeyance the government would have an opportunity to prepare next year's budget in peace. Keeping to agreed IMF parameters is essential if Poland is to reach a debt reduction agreement with foreign bank creditors. Much hangs on the outcome of forthcoming negotiations with the London Club of commercial bank creditors to whom Poland owes Dollars 12.1bn in capital and accrued interest. Negotiations due to take place earlier this month have been postponed to the end of June, ostensibly to give the banks more time to study a report of the state of the economy and Poland's ability to pay. Poland is faced with a serious bunching of repayments on its Dollars 33bn debt to the Paris Club of official creditors and recent borrowings from international institutions in the first years of the next century. So Poland's debt negotiators are seeking a 50 per reduction in overall debt, similar to the Paris Club deal two years ago, with a significant buy - back component, and repayment of the outstanding debt over 30 years. Agreement with the London Club would remove one of the main restrictions on Poland's ability to attract foreign equity investment and permit the normalisation of relations with the commercial banking system. Until now Poland, in spite of its 40m internal market and rapidly growing private sector, has attracted relatively little foreign investment. That is now changing, however, as foreign investors gain experience in the market. A combination of rapid growth in the locally owned private sector and foreign investment is helping to change the product mix and the quality of Polish exports. The traditional sinews of the old centralised economy - especially coal, steel and heavy engineering - have withered. Coal output this year will be under 120m tonnes, only 60 per cent of its 1980s peak; steel output has more than halved since 1989; heavy engineering output fell over 10 per cent last year. The painful shift away from energy, labour and raw material intensive industries has reduced power consumption, done more for cleaner air and water than expensive environmental control equipment, and released resources for more profitable employment. Inside some of Poland's former satanic mills, international companies such as Fiat, Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Philips, Unilever and Thomson have introduced new management and new machines to produce first class industrial goods for both export and the home market. Fiat now sources Europe-wide sales of the new Cinquecento from its plant in southern Poland and has pledged to invest Dollars 2bn before the end of the decade. Consumer product and food corporations with worldwide brand names, along with the global detergent and soap companies, have set up plants, attracted by low wage costs, a 40m strong domestic market hungry to adopt western consumption patterns and the prospect of re - expanding trade links with the Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine. Poland's capacity to absorb higher foreign investment has grown steadily over the last three years as a series of structural, institutional and legal reforms have created the most privatised economy in the region. Most foreign trade, over 80 per cent of retailing, 75 per cent of construction, over 60 per cent of road transport and nearly 30 per cent of industrial sales now come from the private sector which accounts for over 50 per cent of GDP and nearly 60 per cent of employment, including agriculture. The pace of privatisation is due to accelerate next year with the formation of 20 National Investment funds (NIF), which will manage 600 former state enterprises under the mass privatisation programme, and government encouragement for wholesale worker and management buyouts.</p>

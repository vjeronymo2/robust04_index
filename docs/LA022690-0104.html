			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: CYNICAL, ARROGANT, DUMB -- BUT NEVER A RACIST  </P> <P> You write a column of opinion, you're called names. It comes with the turf.  </P> <P> I've been accused of being dumb, evil, sinful, petty, arrogant, phony, cynical,  vicious, hypocritical and dumber than dumb, all perhaps with justification.  </P> <P> I've been called a facist. I've been called a communist. I've even been called  a facist-communist.  </P> <P> I've been called a Nazi and I've been called a dirty Jew. Someone else charged  that I was such a self-hating Jew that I should return my circumcision. And one  woman wrote me a letter insisting that I was so sexist that I deserved  castration.  </P> <P> I've also been labeled a homosexual more than once -- by persons who presumed  that this, above all else, would cut me to the quick.  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> What cuts me to the quick is being called a racist.  </P> <P> One good thing about being called a racist: It makes you more careful about  calling others racist.  </P> <P> But that's the only good thing.  </P> <P> The angry message on the telephone recorder said, "I thought your column was  very racist." There were other calls and many letters saying essentially the  same thing: that either I was racist or my column was.  </P> <P> All right, you turn out a column contending that allegedly racist remarks  attributed to "60 Minutes" commentator Andy Rooney -- which he denies making --  are not really racist, and you expect to be called racist yourself. You brace  yourself and await the onslaught. Again, it comes with the job.  </P> <P> This is not the first time I've been called a racist.  </P> <P> It happened after I wrote critically about KABC Channel 7 sportscaster Jim  Hill, who is black.  </P> <P> It happened after I wrote a dumber-than-dumb negative review (since recanted  many times) of that splendid CBS series "Frank's Place," most of whose cast was  black.  </P> <P> It happened when I defended Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder's bumbling remarks  relating to the superiority of black athletes as being not racist, but  essentially truthful.  </P> <P> It's probably also happened other times that I no longer recall.  </P> <P> Despite my experience at being called a racist, it still stings.  </P> <P> Some might see this as a cover up, that "the truth hurts" and that "he doth  protest too much," that what I subconsciously fear is that, deep down, I am  exactly what I purport to loathe, and that failure to accept this is a form of  self-denial.  </P> <P> Well, we do accumulate a lot of baggage beginning in infancy, and there's no  telling what's gathering dust in the sub-basements of our minds. Me a racist,  though? Call me self-deluding, but . . . nahhhhh.  </P> <P> Why, some of my best friends . . . no, scratch that.  </P> <P> Actually, what bothers me most about all of this is how wildly and randomly the  charge of racism is made these days, like unloading an AK-47 at a crowd to hit  a single target.  </P> <P> Hate and hurt linger in America, nourishing a siege mentality in which the  worst is usually expected and the benefit of the doubt is rarely given.  Television daily envelopes us in its angry, violent world, feeding our fears  and suspicions, turning George Bush's kinder, gentler society into dreamy myth.  We're not so scared of the Commies anymore, but isn't that a killer outside  your door? A Colombian drug dealer hiding in your closet? A racist under your  bed?  </P> <P> Institutionalized bigotry does live, and given this nation's racist history  (we're on safe ground using "racist" here, yes?), the hair-trigger paranoia is  understandable.  </P> <P> That doesn't make it any more rational or easy to live with, however.  </P> <P> Even before the Andy Rooney incident, a point was reached where writing  something critical about a black person -- or disagreeing with someone else's  definition of racism -- positioned you at the end of a plank above waiting  sharks.  </P> <P> The government or thought police didn't censor you, but you were still in for a  lot of trouble. To many of those who might disagree with you, you were not  merely wrong, you were also racist.  </P> <P> A sign of maturity is the ability to accept responsibility for the bad along  with the good. In the present atmosphere, however, aggressive reporting on  embattled Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion S. Barry, for example, is seen by some  as automatically racist, as are stories seeming to put Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley in a harsh light.  </P> <P> And in this environment, anyone challenging the prevailing wisdom that Rooney's  alleged remarks were racist -- while also noting his slurs against gays -- is  labled racist. I can't be merely dumb, evil, sinful, petty, arrogant, phony,  cynical, vicious, hypocritical or dumber than dumb. I have to be racist.  </P> <P> It doesn't seem fair. However, that doesn't mean I hold a grudge or am  prejudiced against those people who have made this foolish charge. After all,  some of my best friends are fools.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa stages recovery with Pounds 2.28m Havelock Europa, the store-fitting company, yesterday met expectations with a turnround from losses of Pounds 3.07m to profits of Pounds 2.28m pre-tax for 1993. Turnover was up 7 per cent at Pounds 35.3m (Pounds 32.9m). The improvement was attributed to measures taken to reduce the cost base and raise productivity following the 1992 financial restructuring, as well as to stronger demand as the economy recovers. Net cash at the year end was Pounds 2.5m, compared with net debt of Pounds 2.2m. The company, which last paid a dividend in 1991, is proposing a final of 2p, payable from earnings of 8.4p (losses 15.4p) per share. Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said the payment was a good foundation on which to base a progressive dividend policy, and reflected the fact that the company would eventually be subject to a full tax charge. Havelock, which operates from plants in Dalgety Bay, near Edinburgh, and in Nottingham, designs, builds and installs commercial interiors. Most of its turnover comes from retailers, led by Boots and Marks and Spencer, with further work for Woolworths, Burton and House of Fraser. It is, however, doing increasing work for the financial services sector which accounted for 17 per cent of turnover in 1993, against 12 per cent in 1992. 'This will be the major area for our growth,' Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive, said. Havelock serves institutions such as National Westminster Bank and the Co-operative Bank. In 1994 it has installed pre-fabricated installations for First National Bank of Southern Africa in Johannesburg and for Yapikredit in Istanbul. On both it worked with AT&amp;T Global Solutions, formerly NCR, which supplied self-service banking equipment. Mr Lessels said the order book was substantially ahead of last year's, though there was marked resistance to price increases in traditional business.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPLORING 'THE MEAN- SPIRITED LITTLE-BOY FANTASY OF HOW WOMEN OUGHT TO RESPOND  TO CRUELTY.'  </P> <P> Thank you John Henken, Barbara Isenberg, Don Shirley, Sylvie Drake, Daniel  Cariaga, Lewis Segal and Jan Breslauer for lopping off four decades from my  life, making me enter the new decade 40 years younger.  </P> <P> If all of you could scare up only one female in "Faces for the Nineties," we  are indeed in the 1950s again.  </P> <P> Gosh, Lewis Segal, it's nice that you were able to dig up Judy Mitoma and drag  her out of that cave where she and all the other women in the arts were hiding,  when your colleagues were searching out those bright pusses to adorn the coming  decade.  </P> <P> Ten to one. Great. Really. Time stands still for The Times.  </P> <P> RACHEL ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shiny Li] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten has issued his sternest  warning yet to the United States not to tamper with China's  trading privileges as a lever to bolster human rights.  Repeating the ramifications for Hong Kong of a Sino-U.S. trade  war, Mr Patten said the withdrawal of China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) status could undermine the effective  implementation of the Joint Declaration. The Sino-British Joint  Declaration sets out the conditions under which Hong Kong will  revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr Patten warned that if  China's U.S. trading privileges were withdrawn, the crippling  effects for Hong Kong would undermine the "one country, two  systems" concept under which the territory would operate after  the transfer of sovereignty.    It was the first time that Mr Patten had linked economics to  politics, having strenuously urged China not to do so during the  current Sino-British stalemate. "It's (the implementation of  the Joint Declaration) which will be the principal task for  Britain and China in Hong Kong until ]997 and afterwards," Mr  Patten said. "(The withdrawal of China's MFN status) would be a  body blow to confidence in Hong Kong at a crucial time. It  would put at risk all that we are trying to do to secure Hong  Kong's future," Mr Patten told the American Chamber of Commerce,  adding that the territory's economic growth would be cut by more  than half and unemployment trebled.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has stated that the renewal of  China's preferential trade status hinged on whether it could  demonstrate a marked improvement in its human rights record.  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned yesterday  that China still had time to make sufficient progress on human  rights by early June to justify maintaining its MFN status.    The Governor yesterday dispatched his deputy, Chief  Secretary  Anson Chan, to the U.S. to lobby the Clinton administration to  renew China's trading privileges. Mr Patten himself spearheaded  the campaign in Washington last year. His strongly-worded  warning yesterday, on the eve of Mrs Chan's visit, appeared to  mark the start of Hong Kong's annual lobbying campaign to  preserve China's trading privileges. A high-powered Hong Kong  Chinese business delegation has been in Washington this week to  press for MFN renewal, and the American Chamber of Commerce --  the biggest outside the United States -- plans to do likewise in  the coming weeks.    Mr Patten insisted that Hong Kong people were concerned  about  human rights and the conduct of China in jailing MING PAO  reporter Xi Yang for allegedly stealing state secrets. But  curtailing trading privileges was not the answer, he said.  "It's possible to have a serious dialogue, for example, as  Australia is doing with China, without mixing up trade and  politics," Mr Patten said.    U.S. investment in Hong Kong was worth more than $1.2  billion, Mr Patten said. Arguing that free trade leads to  greater human rights -- and noting that Libya and Iran had MFN  status -- he said that it would be China's masses who would be  paying the price of a Sino-U.S. trade war. "The people who are  performing the Chinese economic miracle are above all the  ordinary people, the entrepreneurs, the small businesses, the  investors," Mr Patten said.</p>

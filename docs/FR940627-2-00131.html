			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the Yankee Nuclear Power Station plant-specific evaluation, the NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical justifications for this exemption. In particular, the NRC evaluated the current Yankee status, that is, the plant is permanently shut down and defueled, the license has been amended to authorize ``possession only,'' the possession only license amendment prohibits fuel movement from the spent fuel pool into the reactor building, and the fuel is stored in a low density configuration. The staff concludes, after evaluation of the remaining spectrum of accidents and considering that the stored fuel has decayed for over two years and seven months and is stored in a low density configuration, that any such accident would result in greatly reduced offsite consequences. Thus, the staff further concludes that the YNPS meets the criterion established in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 for relief from the full financial protection requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the licensee presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4), the staff did not concur with those legal views and opinions and concludes that the licensee has not demonstrated the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 to the YNPS. The staff has also concluded that the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI&hyph;2) claims settlement experience (an accident which did not result in a significant release of radioactivity) provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI&hyph;2 claims have reached $60 million and a large number of TMI&hyph;2 claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that a level of $100 million for primary financial protection coverage is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993, based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, for relief from financial protection requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff, based on its independent evaluation, consistent with the Commission July 13, 1993 SRM based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded that sufficient bases exist for approval of a partial exemption from the financial protection requirements for the YNPS. The staff has also concluded that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of any accidents or reduce the margin of safety at the facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the discussion presented in Sections III and IV above, the Commission has determined, that pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, this exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission grants an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection in the amount of $100 million shall be maintained, and an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection) is granted for the YNPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 31651). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is effective immediately. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 20th day of June 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Brian K.

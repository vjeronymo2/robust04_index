			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Sterling convertible for Lonrho Lonrho, the international conglomerate, yesterday ended its four-year absence from the Eurobond market with a widely expected convertible bond offering, the first in the sterling sector this year. Demand was such that Lonrho was able to increase the 10-year offering from Pounds 60m to Pounds 64.5m, achieve a coupon of 6 per cent, at the low end of the indicated range of 6 to 6 1/4 per cent, and a conversion premium of 20.25 per cent, above the indicated range of 16 to 20 per cent. Lonrho shares eased from 164p to 160 1/2 p. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose from an issue price of par to 103 as investors sought to top up their allocations. Dealers said that the bonds, which offered a 3 per cent premium over the yield on Lonrho's ordinary shares, represented good value to investors who still regarded Lonrho as a recovery stock. However, they noted that Lonrho had opted for a shorter maturity - most of the sterling convertible offerings in the past year have carried maturities of 15 years - and a call option after three years rather than the usual five years. An official at lead manager CS First Boston said the issue was a critical step for the company since it was seeking to re-launch its newly-improved credit perception with investors in both the bond and equity markets. Lonrho said the proceeds would be kept in fixed-rate sterling and would be used for general corporate purposes. BNP, the French bank, added to the supply of bank paper in the Eurosterling sector when it raised Pounds 200m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said the the wider yield spread of 32 basis points over UK government bonds helped BNP's bonds to compare favourably with the other recent issues. Elsewhere, Dresdner Bank got its timing right by issuing a DM1bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds shortly before the Bundesbank surprised the market by cutting the discount rate. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose from their fixed re-offer price of 99.50 to 99.80. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the Baa1 ratings on the foreign currency debt of the Bank of Greece under review for a possible downgrade, citing the continued deterioration of the country's fiscal balances and the rapidly growing debt burden. Around Dollars 10bn worth of debt is affected. Until the start of this year, the Bank of Greece acted as the issuer on behalf of the Hellenic Republic. Moody's action did not come as a surprise to syndicate managers, who had been expecting the news since November last year.</p>

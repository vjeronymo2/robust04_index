			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors argues for bigger payments to budget THE competitiveness of EC industry could be damaged if member states' budget contributions are frozen, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, warned yesterday. EC officials claimed that the crisis in other areas of Community policy had not affected discussions on the 'Delors II' package, covering Community spending from 1993 to 1997. But the budget question at yesterday's meeting of EC finance ministers was greatly overshadowed by the anguished debate on the future of the European monetary system. Mr Delors told the ministers that capping contributions at 1.2 per cent of GNP was bound to hit spending on training, research and development, and EC-wide telecoms, road and rail networks. The Commission wants to raise contributions to the 1993-97 budget to 1.37 per cent of GNP. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, claimed in a paper presented to ministers that if contributions were held at 1.2 per cent the EC's resources for 1997 would increase by Ecu15bn (Pounds 11.7bn) from Ecu66.6bn this year. But the Commission argued that Britain had included in its calculations agricultural surpluses which could not be redistributed to other areas of EC policy. The calculation was also based on annualised growth projections of 2.5 per cent, which now look unrealistic. According to Brussels, the increase would be Ecu11bn in 1997 - not enough to cover the Commission's plans for spending on so-called 'internal policies'. Yesterday's meeting was the last chance for finance ministers to state their position on the proposed budget before serious negotiations begin. Since July, national officials have been discussing an 85-point British questionnaire on the budget plans. Foreign ministers will take up the debate at their meeting next Monday. Several states, including Belgium, Germany and France, took the opportunity to argue for a new political discussion of the long-standing British budget rebate.</p>

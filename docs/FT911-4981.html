			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Jury told of breach of Stock Exchange disclosure rules COUNTY NATWEST Securities breached Stock Exchange rules by delaying in reporting to it that it held more than 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, Mr David McMullan, then finance director of CNWS, told the Blue Arrow trial yesterday. Mr McMullan, a prosecution witness, told the court that since CNWS held just less than 5 per cent of the company, he checked daily to see that the level requiring disclosure to the Stock Exchange was not reached in normal trading. When that happened, and CNWS's holding briefly exceeded 5 per cent, he informed Mr Peter Dale, then managing director of CNWS. Mr Dale refused to allow him to report the holding to the Stock Exchange within the statutory five days, Mr McMullan told Mr Nicholas Purnell, QC, prosecuting. 'I kept telling him we were in breach of Stock Exchange rules - this really can't go on.' Mr Dale had told him there were other matters that were more important, everything would fall into place, and the reporting would be done as soon as possible, Mr McMullan said. The report was made to the Stock Exchange more than two weeks after the 5 per cent limit was reached. Later, when County NatWest announced that it had a 9.5 per cent holding in Blue Arrow, he understood why Mr Dale had wanted to delay reporting the matter. Mr Dale told him he now knew the whole picture. Mr McMullan also told the court that concern over a possible Stock Exchange inquiry into CNWS's backlog in processing settlements led to alteration of the accounting treatment of CNWS's largest holding of 31.5m shares being considered. Unlike other Blue Arrow shares held by CNWS, this stake, kept on a 'back, back book', was not marked for market (adjusted to current market prices) because of the unwritten indemnity against loss given to CNWS by its co-subsidiary, County NatWest. The holding would have had to be marked for market and that would have involved using profits from an option hedge to compensate for losses incurred, he said. 'This was the indemnity under a different disguise,' he said. Mr McMullan said that on September 29, when first told CNWS was to take a large holding, he was also told by Mr Philip Rimell, who was then CNWS chairman, that Phillips &amp; Drew, the brokers to the issue, also had a holding. He left the meeting with the impression that it was of a similar size. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the 1987 rights issue which funded Blue Arrow's take-over of Manpower, the US employment group. The trial continues today.</p>

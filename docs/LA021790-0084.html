			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A Soviet exhibition that was supposed to open Monday at the San Diego  Convention Center has been delayed until Friday because a fire-extinguishing  system in the special-events area failed to operate, said Donna Alm, a  spokeswoman for the center.  </P> <P> Dan Wilkens, spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, said the city's  contractor did not release the special-events area to the Convention Center  because a water-cannon test failed to meet the Fire Department's standards.  </P> <P> "The water cannon, which looks like the end of a firefighter's hose, did not  shoot water the distance it was supposed to and in the sufficient amounts  required by the city's Fire Department," Wilkens said.  </P> <P> Alm said a steel-framed tent will be put up on a 17,000-square-foot parking lot  behind the Marriott Hotel and Seaport Village for the exhibit.  </P> <P> The exhibit will include artwork, photographs and an audio-visual program about  the Soviet Union. Fifty people accompanied the exhibition, which arrived in San  Diego on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The San Diego display will be the third and final showing of the exhibition in  the United States, Alm said.  </P></p>

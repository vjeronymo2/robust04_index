			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: TLS Range returns to profits with Pounds 34,000 TLS Range, the USM-quoted vehicle rental concern, returned to profits with Pounds 34,000 for the first six months of 1993 on turnover of Pounds 5.03m. This compared with losses of Pounds 77,000 last time, from Pounds 4.7m turnover, which increased to Pounds 190,000 by the 1992 year end. Tax for the half year of Pounds 34,000 left the company at break-even; nil earnings were against 0.41p losses. There is again no interim dividend - a single final 0.25p was paid for 1992 - but the directors were optimistic that a return to a 'progressive dividend policy' would be achievable in the short term. Mr David Yeomans, chairman, stated that operating lease rentals, which contained an element of interest included in cost of sales, resulted in a reduction in operating profits from Pounds 466,000 to Pounds 294,000. However, this also involved a significant fall in finance charges to Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 545,000). Mr Yeomans pointed out that utilisation levels had increased from 72 per cent last January to 86 per cent in June, while rises in revenue per unit 'had been evident across the fleet'. He added that the company's car and civil engineering fleets grew by 24.8 per cent and 28.5 per cent respectively, reflecting growing market penetration. Gearing, he stated, had been brought down from 168 per cent to 97 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING HEALTHY: WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE -- IS IT FIT TO DRINK?  </P> <P> Just when many of us had finally trained ourselves to drink bottled water  overseas came the news last year that bottled water isn't always perfect. If  Perrier can contain impurities, is anything safe?  </P> <P> Well, yes. But just because water is sold in a bottle labeled "spring," "pure,"  "mineral" or "natural" doesn't mean it cannot make us sick.  </P> <P> Generally, bottled water comes from either ground springs or is processed tap  water. For such water to be pure, the springs must be continually monitored  and/or the water carefully purified. Otherwise, it may not be any safer than  tap water.  </P> <P> Bottled water generally is safer while traveling because tap water everywhere  contains microorganisms which, if sufficiently different from those in your tap  water at home, may cause intestinal upset.  </P> <P> If you can find them, known bottled-water brand names such as Evian,  Montecantini, Vittel and, yes, Perrier, are probably safest to drink,  especially in developing countries. Those companies use sophisticated  techniques to remove potentially harmful chemicals and microorganisms from  water, techniques that local bottlers may not.  </P> <P> Insist that bottles be opened in your presence to ensure that bottles are not  filled with tap water.  </P> <P> Some hotels in developing countries provide unsealed canisters of water in  guest rooms. But even if the water is safe -- and it may not be -- the  canisters may be unclean. In countries where sanitation is poor, double check  water safety and if in doubt, do not drink the water in the canisters or use it  for brushing teeth or cleaning contact lenses.  </P> <P> Generally, deluxe hotels in developing countries purify tap water but systems  may break down. It probably is safer to drink bottled water. It also makes  sense to drink bottled water at airports and on flights originating in  developing countries.  </P> <P> When only local brands are available, drink carbonated bottled water or soft  drinks. Carbonation acidifies water and can kill some microorganisms.  </P> <P> Minerals in water do not kill microorganisms or prevent disease and may  increase the cost. In addition, some minerals may not be healthy for people  with heart and kidney conditions and those taking certain medications. Ask your  physician if there are any minerals you should avoid.  </P> <P> Ice cubes are generally made from tap water and as such, may not be safe. But  if you must have a cold drink, carry clean, leakproof plastic bags with you and  place cubes inside one before placing the bag in your drink.  </P> <P> Carry an electric immersion coil to boil water for making coffee or tea or for  brushing teeth. Boiling for five minutes or, at high altitudes, 10 minutes will  help kill microorganisms. Coils are available in many department stores but  probably will require a current converter and a plug adapter to make them work.  </P> <P> Use chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine or commercial water purification  tablets (Halazone, for example) to disinfect water when boiling is not  feasible. Add two drops of 5% chlorine bleach or five drops of 2% tincture of  iodine to a quart of water and let stand for 30 minutes before using. But  remember: Like heat, chemicals can kill microorganisms but have little or no  effect on chemical impurities. So your best bet for safety probably remains  drinking bottled water.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: New Round-up MEXICO The finance ministry has said that foreign financial institutions, including banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, will be allowed to begin operating in Mexico in the second half of 1994. The new ruling will not be open to just US and Canadian financial institutions, but will be extended to other overseas institutions that have a branch in one of those two countries. Mexican equities were volatile last week following the sharp rise in interest rates. Kleinwort Benson, in its latest Latin American bulletin, remains reasonably cheerful about the situation. 'If, for the foreseeable future, 10 per cent is to be the real interest rate that foreigners demand for the risk of selling their dollars at 3.36 pesos, then the current gloom will have been well founded, and even 2 per cent GDP growth may prove to be too optimistic,' they say. 'We would, however, remind investors that eight months remain of this year, that the exchange rate has already dropped 8 per cent since January and that government spending remains heavy. It is our view that any signal that interest rates can ease by 6 per cent or 7 per cent by the third quarter will calm many of the market's current worries.' TURKEY The Istanbul equity market lost 18 per cent over the week, with most of the selling following from a crisis in the country's banking system. The stock exchange suspended trading in Marbank, a small trade finance bank, during the week, after the Treasury closed down the the Istanbul-based Turkish Tourism and Investment bank. The government is intending to introduce new laws which will give more power to the central bank to defend the system. PRAGUE The Czech economy should grow by an annual rate of 7 per cent by 1998, with inflation slowing to 6 per cent, according to a report released by Salomon Brothers. STRATEGY North African markets showed good first quarter performances, extending last year's gains, according to research published last week by Kleiman International, the US-based independent group, which analyses emerging banking and securities markets. Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia saw respective local gains in the first three months of 28, 17 and 18 per cent, largely, says Kleiman, on optimism over economic improvement, privatisation and increased foreign investor interest. Cyprus's OTC market was another notable riser, climbing 14 per cent in local terms and thereby reversing 2 years of decline. AMMAN The Amman stock exchange continued a downward trend at the end of the week's trading on worries concerning Jordan's economic role following the implementation of a PLO-Israeli accord. The general price index fell 1 per cent to 156.9. Brokers said that sentiment was not helped by a liquidity shortage accentuated by a fall in overall demand in the economy. Turnover last week dropped 2.4 per cent. CHILE Shareholders of Endesa, Chile's main electricity producer, have authorised the company to raise 48.4bn pesos (Dollars 113m) in new capital, including a placement of ADRs in July or September. Mr Jose Yurasek, president, said that the company hoped to raise Dollars 50m through the placement.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Pay-for-distance motorway toll ruled out for five years MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday firmly ruled out the introduction of pay-as-you-go tolls on Britain's motorway system for at least five years. However, he left open the possibility that money could be raised from road users earlier than that by requiring them to buy and display an annual permit if they wanted to use the motorways. Mr MacGregor is shortly expected to publish a green paper setting out the options for raising more money from motorists to help finance the government's Pounds 19bn roadbuilding programme. Yesterday he visited the world's most advanced experiment in road pricing technology at a test site in Gothenburg, Sweden, to see how charges could be collected electronically from motorists using roadside beacons that debit devices inside their vehicles. But Mr Jonas Sundberg, senior researcher for Sweden's Transport Research Institute, told Mr MacGregor that even when the technology had been fully developed, it could not be introduced nationally in Britain until at least 1998 because of the time it would take to fit the devices to the country's 25m vehicles. Mr MacGregor has already ruled out the idea of collecting charges through Continental-style toll-booths because they would slow traffic and take up too much land. That leaves annual permits as the only short-term measure available. Mr MacGregor conceded that electronic road tolls could not be introduced in Britain for at least five years. 'I have certainly been told by all the experts I have spoken to so far that the first feasible moment is 1998,' he said. But he added that electronic road tolling was not an issue that could be rushed. 'You have to have a political debate, you have to decide whether you take up this option, you have to get legislation for it and you have to prepare for it.' Mr MacGregor said the permit system was a possible alternative. 'There is a discussion about that in the green paper, but there is a lot of difficulty about it because it doesn't have the flexibility of the electronic system. It would be feasible and technologically possible, but you would have to iron out a lot of practical problems.' One of the chief objections to a permit system is likely to be the difficulty of reconciling it with privately built toll roads, which the government is keen to encourage. Drivers would be reluctant to pay tolls on privately built roads if they had already paid for a permit to use the state-owned motorway system. One solution likely to be explored in the green paper, due out within four to six weeks, is the idea of so-called shadow tolls. Under this system the government would reward private sector operators for building motorways by paying them a fee according to the number of vehicles that used them.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up TURKEY Equities finished last week higher after another volatile ride in previous sessions as the country's parliament passed laws on tax and privatisation which are among the government's main efforts to reduce the budget deficit. The privatisation law allows the cabinet decree powers for three months to sell off state companies. The World Bank has approved a Dollars 100m loan for the privatisation programme. The loan had been suspended in March because of worries over the financial crisis. CHINA The Bank of New York has forecast that China will become its most important new market for American Depositary Receipts within the next three to five years, agencies report. A bank spokesperson said that between 10 and 12 Chinese companies would establish ADR programmes in the US during 1994. China's economic problems and the introduction of new taxes has dampened the Shenzhen B share market, with an indicative measure - Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia's Shenzhen B index - at, or around, year lows. Commentators observe that there is little incentive for foreigners to come into the market at present, with overseas institutions mainly targeting the Shanghai market, which has a much larger capitalisation. In Shenzhen daily turnover is estimated at 0.05 per cent of total market capitalisation. Last Thursday, for instance, turnover was just HKDollars 800,000. INDIA The country's financial markets are expected to remain under pressure following the cancellation of VSNL's Euro issue last week. However, Ballarpur, the country's biggest papermaker, has said that it has no immediate intenetion to delay its proposed Dollars 35m Eurobond issue with plans to launch it later in the month. The company said it would take a decision this week. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Willoughby's dives In the six months ended March 31 1993 pre-tax profit of Willoughby's Consolidated dived from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 225,000. In line with distributing the maximum amount of cash remitted from the Zimbabwean operations, the interim dividend is halved to 0.5p. Earnings fell to 2.8p (14.9p). The directors warned that the final was likely to be reduced from the 1.5p paid last time. Lower profits reflected reduced gold production, increased mine working costs and a delayed cattle slaughter season. The outlook was better, with higher production anticipated at the mines, a stronger USDollars price of gold and high slaughter prices for cattle. Comparisons have been restated for FRS 3, and the profit pushed up by Pounds 109,000 on a change of accounting policy for livestock.</p>

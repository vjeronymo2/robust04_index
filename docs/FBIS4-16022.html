He met President Lennart  Meri, Defence Forces Commander in Chief General Aleksander  Einseln and Defence Minister Indrek Kannik. A news conference  was held in the evening.    General Gustafsson announced that the strict rules  concerning  the export of Swedish weapons prevent the sale of arms to the  Baltic states. But the embargo may be lifted in the near future  as the Baltic conditions will meet the requirements of Sweden's  legislation, he added. General Gustafsson explained that  Swedish-Estonian military cooperation would primarily take the  form of training. The first programmes may be started this  autumn already, he said.    General Einseln stressed the importance of cooperation with  Sweden considering its closeness and the good relations.    General Gustafsson is to visit Narva, the Viru Infantry  battalion in Jdhvi [as received], and Tartu today. He is to  leave for Riga in the evening.</p>

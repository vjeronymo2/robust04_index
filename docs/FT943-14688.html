			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Dutch purchase for Waddington - Fl 113.3m acquisition of Imca to be funded by Pounds 42m rights issue John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, yesterday announced a strategic expansion into Europe with the Fl 113.3m (Pounds 41.7m) acquisition of Imca Beheer, the privately owned Dutch cartons business. The deal, funded by a Pounds 42m rights issue, is expected to transform the company from a UK-dominated group into a pan-European food packaging business. Mr Martin Buckley, chief executive, said Imca would complement Waddington's existing operations - supplying blue-chip clients such as Cadbury and Nestle  -and provide access to a wider customer base. 'The acquisition should put us at the forefront of the carton packaging industry in Europe and provide improved prospects for medium-term earnings growth,' he said. Yesterday's announcement followed lengthy negotiations between Imca and Waddington, which has been looking to establish a European presence since late last year. The group received a number of approaches but Mr Buckley said only Imca met its criteria of profitability, modern manufacturing techniques and a secure order book. The Dutch manufacturer, based at Hoogerheide near the Belgian border, made operating profits of Fl 10.8m on turnover of Fl 73.1m in the year to December 31. Waddington will pay Fl 71.5m for Imca's share capital and Fl 41.8m to take over inter-company loans owed to Imca Holding, a private company controlled by Mr Cornelis Baartmans, the group's founder and chief executive. Mr Baartmans is expected to act as a consultant to the enlarged group from next year. If the deal is approved at an extraordinary meeting later this month, Waddington shareholders will be offered up to 23.12m new ordinary shares at 190p. The issue, underwritten by Robert Fleming with Cazenove as brokers, is being made on a 2-for-7 basis. Recommending the deal yesterday, Mr Buckley said contributions from Imca would enhance profits this year. Profits are also expected to grow with increased demand in Britain and North America, while the provisions which held back last year's results are unlikely to be repeated. A Pounds 7.4m provision to settle a US antitrust investigation involving two Waddington subsidiaries pegged pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.07m in the year to April 2. COMMENT The Imca acquisition raises the prospect of long-term growth at Waddington. It offers access to new markets and gives the UK group added weight in negotiating favourable raw material prices. However, the shares fell 9p to 221p on fears that the purchase price could be expensive if the Dutch company proves earnings dilutive. Yet the strategic arguments behind Waddington's expansion are persuasive. It will offer product synergies and lead to substantial cost savings. With the shadow lifted from the US antitrust action and first-time contributions from Imca, profits this year are expected to exceed Pounds 23m. The shares, on a multiple of 12.5, are worth considering.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with President Vaclav Havel by </F> Robert Tamchyna in Prague on 7 May -- recorded; from the  "Conversations at Lany" program]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tamchyna] It is likely that  some people felt a shiver down their spine just a week ago when  on Sunday at the May Day rally organized by the Communist Party  of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] its Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek  called for actions by individual citizens going as far as civic  disobedience. [passage omitted]    [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic  disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group  of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and  so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical  reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where  power has really come from the people -- in free elections.    It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is  voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions  throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I  wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist  methods of conquering power.    [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that  all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused  primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first  multiracial elections are over and the results known, and  probably no one expected those results and the new division of  political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of  South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will  the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be  able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of  its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and  responsibilities it entails?    [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication  from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one  which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the  fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for  universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces  a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves  from colonial domination have experienced and are still  experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass  through this phase.    Since you are asking me, I would like to take the  opportunity  to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one  time paid an official visit to our country during which we  talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a  decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that  after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and  which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential  office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he  is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly  awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that  Nelson Mandela did not deserve it. All that remains for me to  wish him is that, if he is indeed elected president at the  beginning of next week, he might lead his country wisely through  the period which awaits it.

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: The making of a fool NOBODY'S FOOL by Richard Russo Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 552 pages IT IS not easy being nobody's fool. In fact, for Donald 'Sully' Sullivan it has turned out to be a full time job. For his entire adult life the sometime construction worker, sometime philosophy student has been able to keep the residents of North Bath, New York, from making a fool of him. Unfortunately in the process he has managed to alienate just about everyone he knows. Richard Russo's remarkable third novel is about the few weeks in Sully's 60th year when he finally decides to let down his guard and let in some of the people he has been keeping at bay. For all his headstrong independence, Sully has precious little to show for himself. He lives in a barely furnished apartment in the house of Miss Beryl, a common-sensical widow who has had Sully's measure since she taught him in the eighth grade. Sully's neurotic ex-wife dropped him 30 years earlier, moving as far uptown as you can in the claustrophobic environs of North Bath. His son Peter lives in West Virginia, still smarting from Sully's decision to walk away from him as a boy and avoid the potential cap and bells of fatherhood. And his married lover, Ruth, has just about had it with him as well, thinking with some justification that if a man at 60 is not prepared to settle down then he probably never will. So Sully spends his time with the few people who will have him - his woebegone and odoriferous co-worker Rub, the butt of countless jokes; his drunken, one-legged lawyer Wirf, who tries with scant success to keep Sully out of trouble; and his womanising boss Carl Roebuck, whose wife Toby is the true apple of Sully's eye. Their protracted drinking sessions at the local bar are hilarious set-pieces, scruffy jewels of buffoonery and smart-aleck dialogue. Sully's independence is sorely threatened over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays of 1984, however, when Peter returns to town, escaping a troubled marriage and a ruined career. To his surprise and initial horror, Sully is forced to be both the father he never was and the grandfather he hoped never to be, helping Peter and his own troubled son Will land on their feet. In the process, he comes to terms with the ghost of his abusive father, Big Jim, whose constant belittlement of the boy Sully might be the cause of his lifelong pigheadedness. Nobody's Fool is big, funny and richly human, a garrulous book that button holes you in the first few pages and does not let you go until it has had its say. The town of North Bath is a wonderful creation, the sort of place where Texan investors choose not to build a theme park because, well, the people there look sort of funny. It is a place of beautiful old houses occupied by widows who refuse to die simply for the sake of a property boom; of doomed civic boosters who will run off with S &amp; L funds at the drop of a hat; of middle-aged Lotharios and their fading cheerleader mistresses. Like Garrison Keillor, Russo is able to show small-town life warts and all. In fact, half the time he makes you think it is nothing but warts. And in Sully Russo has created a character you cannot resist - as long as you are reading about him and not related to him. He is 'the uncontested master of the futile gesture' and a 'case study underachiever', the sort of man people think could have been so much more, though they could not say exactly what if pressed. But just when the reader is at the point of getting fatally exasperated with Sully, Russo shows the real pain that has caused him to be the way he is. Sully's conversion to his own rough and ready form of responsibility is both comic and strangely moving. In the end, he learns what most people know and he should have known all along - that everybody has to be somebody's fool.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS BUREAU WILL STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT COUNTY'S INDIANS GET FAIR COUNT IN  1990  </P> <P> It may not be readily apparent, but San Diego County has one of the largest  Indian populations in the nation, living on 18 reservations and in its cities.  </P> <P> As a result, officials from the federal Bureau of the Census expect to make a  special effort to make a more accurate head count of tribal members  concentrated here when the census is done next year.  </P> <P> Mary Cleghorn-Vann, a community awareness specialist with the federal bureau,  said analysis of the 1980 census indicated that certain ethnic groups were  "under-counted" by as much as 6% a decade ago. It is Cleghorn-Vann's job to see  that doesn't happen again for the Indian population in 13 California counties,  including San Diego.  </P> <P> Her offensive began early this year, more than a year before the census  questionnaires will be dropped into the mail on March 21, l990. A meeting of  Indian leaders and representatives of organizations serving urban Indian groups  drew a group of 30 and started the ball rolling to apply peer pressure on  Indian families to stand up and be counted.  </P> <P> Next month, she will return to conduct a training session for tribal delegates  from each of the reservations on how to accomplish the task of having everyone  living on the reservations counted. Although the census is again being  conducted by mail, as it was in 1980, tribal rolls will aid in checking to see  that all receive the questionnaires. Follow-ups by the trained tribal helpers  will assure that all questionnaires are returned.  </P> <P> "The big problem is in the urban areas," she said. "The task will be most  difficult." There Indians and other of the under-counted groups blend in and  are hard to ferret out for follow-up visits from census enumerators.  </P> <P> She is enlisting the aid of organizations serving Indians: churches, athletic  associations, social services departments, community-based groups of all kinds  to pass the word that Indians must step forward and be counted if they expect  to obtain the political power and government aid they deserve.  </P> <P> The 1990 census is the basis for reshaping federal, state and local political  districts and the basis for distributing $37 billion in federal aid, she  explained.  </P> <P> Susan Decker, bookkeeper for the Pauma band of Mission Indians, believes that  the participation of tribal members in the census will help ensure a full count  and a fair share for Indians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distrust of Government  </P> <P> "Native Americans tend to distrust the government, especially the Bureau of  Indian Affairs," she explained. Indians must realize that the tribes will not  "get the things we need" if their numbers are diluted.  </P> <P> In the last census, 83% of the nation's households returned their census  questionnaires without prompting, Dan Conway, San Diego spokesman for the  census bureau, said. Follow-ups by trained census workers brought the return  rate up to 98.5%, but that still left at least 3 million Americans uncounted.  </P> <P> "This time we are trying for the ripple effect, to get the word out to every  group and to have each participate in the process," Cleghorn-Vann said.  </P> <P> She acknowledges that she probably does not have the hardest task in the  bureau.  </P> <P> Census officials dealing with other minority groups, such as blacks, among whom  an estimated 20% of young males went uncounted last time, newly arrived  Indo-Chinese still struggling with the language barrier, illiterates, Latinos  with many illegal immigrants among them and street people with no permanent  addresses will have more problems, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Rejected  </P> <P> The Census Bureau had planned to use a sophisticated sampling system to  recapture the uncounted Americans in 1990, but the Reagan Administration  rejected the plan, and it became snarled in litigation by states and cities.  </P> <P> California, which has the largest percentage of minority populations most  likely to be "under-counted" in a census, has filed suit in an attempt to have  the new estimating technique reinstated in time for the 1990 count. In  contrast, other states are challenging the counting of illegal aliens.  </P> <P> Cleghorn-Vann said that the old-fashioned door-to-door method of conducting the  U. S. census might resolve some of the problems faced by the mail census, but  added that the cost is too great to be justified.  </P> <P> "A questionnaire costs 22 cents to send out. A census enumerator probably costs  about $25 a household," she said. "We must count on the follow-up visits to  make up the difference."  </P></p>

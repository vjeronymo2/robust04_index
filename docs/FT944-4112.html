			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: US investors put pressure on Dylex to restructure board A group of US investors appears to be on the verge of forcing Dylex, one of Canada's biggest fashion retailers, to accept new corporate governance rules, including a shake-up of its board. River Road, a Connecticut-based limited partnership which owns about 13 per cent of Dylex, has been putting pressure for some time on members of the Posluns family, who hold a majority of the group's voting shares. River Road is controlled by the Paloma Group, a widely-held investment fund. 'We feel that Dylex has been under-performing given its asset base and potential,' Mr Bob Poile, River Road general partner, said yesterday. Dylex owns about 1,000 stores in Canada and the US, with 1993 sales of CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn). But it had losses totalling CDollars 140m in four of the past five years. The outside investors' disquiet centres on Dylex's unwieldy 18-member board, most of whom are members of the Posluns family, their advisers and senior Dylex managers. 'We're looking to shake up the status quo and get a new board in place,' Mr Poile said. The company's three independent directors are expected to echo these concerns in a report, which is due to be released later this month. River Road cemented its position earlier this week by buying all Dylex's Class C preference shares. These shares are convertible into Class A preference shares. Class A shareholders will gain voting rights at the end of this month if Dylex fails to reinstate dividends on the stock, which were suspended almost two years ago. The outside investors were concerned that the Posluns and their allies would use their voting control to approve a dividend. However, Mr Wilfred Posluns, chairman and chief executive, said that 'any indication that we would oppose the elimination of the next dividend payment is erroneous'.</p>

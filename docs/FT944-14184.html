			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Monaco acts to cut down dirty laundry: Andrew Jack on moves to stop crime cash flowing through the principality While most towns have street signs that direct visitors to tourist attractions, in Monte Carlo they come with a difference: the majority point to banks. Monaco's ability to attract capital makes itself quickly apparent to visitors. It is in evidence in the expensive hotels and restaurants, in the glamorous jewellery adorning those walking the streets, and above all in its ornate, chandeliered casinos. But there is a less pleasant aspect to some of the cash that gushes through the peaceful city state. By virtue of its location, tight banking secrecy rules and pace of economic growth, Monaco has in the past attracted more than its fair share of the 'dirty money' of drug dealers and other criminals. The strength of the financial network in the principality is clearly visible from the presence of a vast network of French and international banks - some 45 separate institutions, and many more individual branches in an area less than two kilometres square. Mr Pierre Fond, deputy head of Tracfin, the French agency created three years ago to track clandestine financial movements, says that dirty money does not often arrive directly in the form of cash deposited into banks or other deposit-taking institutions such as bureaux de change. Instead, it may be used to buy property, or fed through 'front companies' in sectors such as those in construction and tourism with high cash turnover. Equally, not all the money being laundered is drug-related. Growing trends include the emergence of subsidies or kick-backs on public works contracts, and fraud related to the European Union's agricultural programmes. Investigators point to the east when seeking the origins of much of the dirty money: just over the border along the southern coast of France lies Italy, and Mafia money. However, money is now coming from criminal activity further afield, notably in eastern Europe. Mr Jean Pastorelli, financial and economic adviser Monaco's government, denies that the principality has a money laundering problem of any great size or that the state is ignoring the issue. However, a senior banker admits that 'of course, it goes on', adding that the authorities have clamped down in recent years in an effort to preserve Monaco's reputation. Mr Fond says the principality presents no more of a problem as a conduit for dirty money than do many parts of France or nearby states. But a report last year by a French government commission examining ways to combat the advance of the mafia highlighted the role of Monaco, along with that of Switzerland and the Channel Islands, as important centres through which money could be laundered en route to France. Certainly Monaco has seen the need to follow a trend emerging among other countries, triggered by a Group of Seven group on money laundering. It introduced new legislation last year and has set up Siccfin, an agency akin to France's Tracfin designed to follow the movement of suspected dirty money. Last week, the French and Monegasque authorities also signed a co-operation agreement between Siccfin and Tracfin similar to those between France and Belgium, Australia, the US and Italy. Its precise wording is confidential, but it permits for the first time an official exchange of information, which can be used to help track criminals and form the basis for prosecutions. Mr Fond would like equivalent accords with countries such as Switzerland and Luxembourg. Bringing criminals to justice is very difficult since the law requires considerable evidence, including the need to prove the original criminal act which generated dirty money - an act which often took place in another country. While Monaco's attempts to prevent money laundering may have been improved, one aspect of the accord should also help maintain its position as an important 'offshore' centre. The agreement explicitly forbids any financial information passed between the criminal investigators to be handed on to fiscal agencies. Tax evaders will continue to enjoy a high level of banking secrecy.</p>

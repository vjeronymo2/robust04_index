			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECTS NAMED IN KILLING OF PREGNANT WOMAN IN HUNTINGTON PARK  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles teen-agers have been identified as suspects who allegedly  terrorized six members of a Huntington Park family before killing a pregnant  woman and her fetus and slashing the woman's mother with a knife, investigators  said Sunday.  </P> <P> Authorities identified Glenford Brooks, 16, and Walter Steve Scott, 18, as the  two armed men who broke into a condominium and shot Silvia Enriquez, 24,  killing the woman and her 8-month fetus, Huntington Park Police Detective Tom  Weselis said.  </P> <P> The suspects, who have been linked to similar crimes in San Gabriel and Long  Beach, are still at large and considered "armed and extremely dangerous," the  detective said.  </P> <P> He described Brooks as 5-feet-5 to 5-feet-7, weighing about 140 pounds and  having a "noticeable overbite."  </P> <P> The two are suspected of putting a family through a three-hour ordeal during a  robbery of their home Feb. 26, repeatedly threatening them before killing  Enriquez.  </P> <P> Detectives said the pair sneaked past a security gate and broke into the  condominium on Oak Street, behind Huntington Park High School.  </P> <P> There they found Jose and Guadalupe Licea; their son, Juan, 26; their pregnant  daughter, Silvia; her husband, Alfredo Enriquez, and the couple's 22-month-old  son.  </P> <P> The intruders -- one armed with a handgun, the other with a knife -- demanded  money and ransacked the home in search of valuables, investigators said. One  ordered Juan Licea to blindfold and bind the other men and tie his mother's  hands.  </P> <P> As the intruder armed with a gun tried to force the pregnant Enriquez into a  side room, the woman -- apparently believing she was about to be killed --  resisted and tried to wrest the gun away from her attacker, investigators said.  </P> <P> "The suspect then threw the pregnant woman to the ground and shot her," Weselis  said.  </P> <P> The gunman's accomplice slashed Guadalupe Licea across the face and head with a  knife when she tried to go to her daughter's rescue, detectives said.  </P> <P> Juan Licea escaped and ran to a neighbor's apartment to call for help.  </P> <P> Enriquez and her fetus were dead when paramedics arrived. Guadalupe Licea was  treated at a hospital and released.  </P> <P> In addition to the Huntington Park murder, the suspects are also believed  responsible for a robbery, rape and kidnaping in San Gabriel and three  robberies of homes in Long Beach, Weselis said.  </P> <P> The key break in the cases came when the state automated fingerprint system  identified fingerprints taken at one of the Long Beach robberies as belonging  to Scott, the detective said. Witnesses to the Huntington Park murders then  identified Scott from a photo, he said. Brooks, a known associate of Scott's,  was also later identified from a photo, Weselis said.  </P> <P> Officers from Huntington Park, San Gabriel, Long Beach and Los Angeles served  search warrants at three locations in the Southland on Sunday and recovered  property tying the suspects to the other robberies, Weselis said.  </P> <P> Several weapons were turned up in the searches, including a .22-caliber rifle  taken in the San Gabriel robbery, police said. But the .38-caliber revolver  believed used in the Huntington Park murder was not recovered.  </P> <P> Weselis said Scott and Brooks may be driving one of three cars: a gray,  four-door 1988 Volvo 240 DL with California license 2HBU492; a two-door 1977  Buick Regal with a white top and light blue body, California license 323WXF, or  a two-door, red 1980 Toyota Corolla, California license 414ZLF.  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Alert on overseas interests HOPES OF an early cut in French interest rates prompted institutional investors to seek out stocks with French exposure yesterday, inspiring some smart share price rises. Publishing group Aegis, which earns a third of its Pounds 2bn revenue in France, saw its shares climb 5 1/2 to 36 1/2 p. Kingfisher, owner of the Darty chain of electrical shops, advanced 11 to 645p. NatWest Securities and Strauss Turnbull were reported positive. Marks and Spencer added 9 at 363p. Among drinks stocks, Guinness rose 8 to 466p. The company has a 24.6 per cent cross-shareholding agreement with LVMH, the French luxury goods group, which last week issued a profits warning. A marketing agreement with Remy saw Highland Distilleries gain 6 at 328p. Elsewhere, MB-Caradon put on 6 at 299p. Conversely, stocks with German exposure generally suffered, the view being taken that rates will be slower to come down at the Bundesbank. Worst hit were the building stocks Redland and RMC, both of which saw their shares marked back. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was one house advising a 'sell' on the back of the large proportion of profits - around 67 per cent and 61 per cent respectively - each company takes out of Germany. RMC retreated 12 to 793p and Redland 10 to 505p.</p>

Speaking to the visiting ESCAP executive secretary Raffi  Ad-Din Ahmad, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the organization was  pursuing human and holy goals and therefore it was necessary for  all regional countries to strengthen their cooperation with  ESCAP in a bid to attain those goals.    Many of the goals the ESCAP is trying to attain are among  the  priorities in the economic development plan of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, he said.    The president said that connection of Iranian railway to  those of the Central Asian countries would prove effective in  boosting mutual economic and trade relations and in transiting  commodities from Central Asia to other countries via Iran.    The ESCAP chief briefed the president on some of the major  programs of the organization including upgrading economic  relations of developing countries, controlling the growth of  population and expanding communications via Iran and Pakistan  with west and west Asian countries [as received], ECO [Economic  Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN member states.

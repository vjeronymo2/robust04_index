			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / President of Oslo bourse found dead Mr Erik Jarve, president of the Oslo bourse, was found by police drowned in a fjord near his cabin south of Oslo early yesterday morning, just hours after being dismissed by the bourse executive due to alleged financial improprieties. News of Mr Jarve's death shocked Norway's financial community and securities trading was restricted for 15 minutes yesterday during a memorial service held at the Oslo bourse. Mr Jarve, 50, was abruptly dismissed by the bourse board on Monday. The bourse at the time said his dismissal was related to financial irregularities connected with his work but unrelated to securities trading. Yesterday, following the announcement of his death, the bourse said Mr Jarve had exploited his position to advance the employment prospects of a close family member, though without their knowlege. In all, the money involved was a petty sum, but Ms Elisabeth Wille, chairman of the bourse board, said it was more a question of trust being violated than of the sums involved. 'We judged the situation as being so grave that for us there was no other possibility than the dismissal. This is a very deep tragedy,' she said. On Monday, bourse officials refused to spell out clearly the reason for Mr Jarve's dismissal and said the affair was to be investigated by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. Yesterday, however, Ms Wille said that it would have to be decided whether or not to complete the probe in view of Mr Jarve's death. It is believed that he committed suicide. Yesterday, criticism mounted over the way the board handled the affair but Ms Wille said it had not yet considered resigning. It is understood that Mr Jarve was called in for questioning without warning on Monday by the board. In just over an hour, including the time he was questioned, he was gone from the bourse. It is also understood, however, that tension between Mr Jarve - who had worked at the bourse for 25 years - and the board had been building up for more than a year. The board had been critical of his expensive lifestyle. Mr Jarve had also employed a family member at the bourse and subsequently awarded a Pounds 25,000 contract to upgrade the bourse trading system to Logica, a UK software firm, which had later employed the same family member. Mr Jarve had been instrumental in modernising the bourse, its rules, regulations and technical functions. He had personified the Oslo stock exchange since 1977 when he was appointed president.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS;  </P> <P> EXHIBITION GAMES TO OPEN ON SERIOUS NOTE  </P> <P> The time for fun and games is over. Now, it's time for just games as the Angels  open a four-game exhibition series against the Padres today in Yuma, Ariz.  </P> <P> "I think everybody is well aware that time is of the essence and we need to  derive as much from the competition as possible," Angel Manager Doug Rader said  on Sunday after his team played an intrasquad game.  </P> <P> "We're not making evaluations based on intrasquad games and exercises. That's  irresponsible. The way we compete over the next 14 games is important. More  needs to be made of these games to get in the proper mind-set."  </P> <P> Mark Langston is scheduled to pitch the first three innings today, with Mike  Witt set to pitch the next three. Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and Bob McClure  will finish.  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield will rest today because of a minor hamstring pull that  has not completely healed.  </P> <P> As a precaution, Johnny Ray didn't start the intrasquad game after he was hit  in the head twice in Saturday's simulated game, but he played later and  pronounced himself fit.  </P> <P> Outfielder Dan Grunhard, who played at double-A Midland last season, and  infielder Kent Anderson each had three hits in Sunday's intrasquad game. "The  Grunhard boy did a nice job," Rader said. "It was nice to see all the kids do  well."  </P> <P> Grunhard is among six non-roster players who joined the team for the trip to  Yuma. Also taken along were former Phillie third baseman Rick Schu, outfielders  Reed Peters and Ruben Amaro, Jr., pitcher Mark Eichhorn and infielder Donnie  Hill.  </P> <P> Eichhorn, who pitched for the Atlanta Braves last season and was signed as a  free agent in December, gave up three runs in his first inning Sunday, but  Rader was not discouraged.  </P> <P> "I'm very impressed with the guy," Rader said.  </P> <P> The Angels are trying to persuade the Padres to use a designated hitter for  their series. The Angels might have more of an argument next week, when the  teams meet again for four games at the Angels' park in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> Angel pitchers haven't taken batting practice, and they're not likely to get  any.  </P> <P> "They'd take it (today) at the plate," Rader said. "It's going to be 'Go hit.'  That's it."  </P></p>

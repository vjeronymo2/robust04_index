			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Always time to deal with the trivia Sir, Adrian Furnham ('On the road to procrastination', May 4th) ought to reread his Northcote Parkinson. True, the professor observes that the time spent on any item is inversely proportional to the sum of money involved, but that does not mean that committees handle trivial matters promptly; quite the reverse in fact. Parkinson gives the example of the company finance committee members with feelings of guilty unease that they have just nodded through a multi-million pound redevelopment plan on the strength of a consultant's report which most of them did not really understand. A scheme to replace the cycle shed for a couple of hundred pounds was much easier to grasp, and they settled to a long debate on sizes, materials and numbers of bicycles; each eager to be seen to be making his or her contribution to the process. Three hours later, having shaved Pounds 23.46p off the original estimate, they retired exhausted to the executive dining room, reflecting contentedly on a good morning's worth of top-level decisions, and on the debilitating responsibilities of high office. These were not decision avoiders, about whom Furnham is writing; these were keen decision takers, restrained only by their own inadequacies. Bryn Glover, 14 Wensley View, Leeds LS7 3QL</p>

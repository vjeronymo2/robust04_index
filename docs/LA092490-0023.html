			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> B.C. OPEN IS INITIAL WIN FOR HENKE  </P> <P> Tour sophomore Nolan Henke shot a three-under-par 68 Sunday to outlast Barry  Jaeckel and hold off Mark Wiebe and earn his first PGA victory in the $700,000  B.C. Open at Endicott, N.Y.  </P> <P> Henke, who never trailed in the tournament after sharing the first-round lead  with Jim Hallet, finished 72 holes at En-Joie Golf Course in 268, 16 under par,  and three strokes better than Wiebe, who overtook Jaeckel for second when he  birdied No. 18 for a final-round 64.  </P> <P> "I just tried to stay calm," said Henke. "I knew I could screw up. I just  didn't want to screw up too bad."  </P> <P> Jaeckel, who started the day three strokes behind Henke, pulled within a stroke  of the lead on the 10th hole, but lost any chance of overtaking Henke when he  suffered bogeys on 14 and 15.  </P> <P> Tied with Jaeckel at 272 were Doug Tewell with a 67, Brian Tennyson, 66, and  Jim Benepe, 68.  </P> <P> Jim Dent, six shots off the lead when the final round began, shot a  seven-under-par 65 and won the Senior Tour event at Richmond, Va., by a stroke  over Lee Trevino.  </P> <P> Dent's 14-under-par 202 total tied the 54-hole tournament record set two years  ago by Arnold Palmer.  </P> <P> Dent's fourth victory of the year earned him $52,000 and pushed him into second  place on the earnings list with $583,377.  </P> <P> Trevino set a single-season money record with the $28,000 he earned for second  place after a final-round 67 over the 6,444-yard Hermitage Country Club course.  </P> <P> He now has won $740,212, eclipsing Bob Charles' mark of $725,157 set last year.  </P> <P> Second-round leader Gary Player was still in front at 15 under until he bogeyed  three of the last six holes for a 73 that left him in third place at 204.  </P> <P> Ian Woosnam of Wales beat Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, 4 and 2, at Virginia Water,  England, to win his second World Match Play title in four years.  </P> <P> The runner-up to England's Nick Faldo last year and a winner in 1987, Woosnam  had McNulty chasing him all day.  </P> <P> Woosnam missed a short putt on the 29th hole that would have given him a  two-hole lead. At the 30th, McNulty had to concede a Woosnam birdie and the  Welshman stood two up with six to play.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Attorney Dmitriy Shteinberg of Russia's former  Security Minister Viktor Barannikov has accused the country's  acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko of a biased  approach to Barannikov's case. In Saturday's interview with  Interfax, he said he intended to raise objections to the  appointment of Ilyushenko as legal officer monitoring the  Barannikov process.    In defiance of the State Duma's amnesty decision and its  acceptance by Barannikov, the criminal case against the man has  not been dropped. According to Shteinberg, cases have been  dropped against all the other defendants in the October case in  line with the Duma decision.    Shteinberg said that Ilyushenko had already indicated his  approach to the case was personal and negative.    If justice was not restored soon, the attorney would have to  use the media to request President Yeltsin as the chief  guarantor of the citizens's rights and to the State Duma that  they take emergency action to protect the former minister's  constitutional rights and freedoms.    And, Shteinberg intended to brief influential Russian and  international human rights organizations on the unfair treatment  of Barannikov by the Prosecutor-General's Office.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Six ways to improve the profession's image IT HAS become fashionable for shareholders to blame the auditors when a company suddenly collapses into the arms of a receiver. 'Why didn't the auditors give us any warning?' cry shareholders who have just seen their investment disappear down the tubes. In a research paper on 'company pathology' last year, County NatWest found that only two of the 45 listed, USM and third market companies that called in the receivers in 1989 and 1990 had received any qualification from the auditors in their last published report and accounts. In these two cases, one was trivial because it merely referred to an oversight by the previous auditors, and the other obvious, because the company was clearly already in deep trouble. We suggest there are six issues which deserve attention. First, the present accounting rules give companies too much scope for subjective judgment. For example, why should companies be given the choice between merger accounting and acquisition accounting, which usually produce totally different outcomes? And why should UK companies, unlike those in most of the rest of the western world, be allowed almost complete flexibility in deciding how much to provide for deferred tax? As a result of this 'provide as you please' policy and other laxities in our accounting rules, a Touche Ross survey in 1989 found the UK has the most over-stated profits in Europe: a factor of 1.28 compared with an average of 1.00, and only 0.88 in Germany. The second problem is that, despite the ritual of their annual re-appointment at the AGM, the auditor is the hired servant of the directors. If you don't agree, name one listed company where the auditors have been appointed, re-appointed or dismissed other than on the recommendation of the board. The truth is that the external auditor often helps the financial director show his results in the best possible light, taking advantage of all the loopholes. One important reason why the auditor is keen not to offend the finance director and the chief executive, apart from wanting to retain the audit, is the opportunity it gives for providing the client with management consultancy and other lucrative services. Two or three years ago some firms were boasting that only 40 per cent of their income came from auditing. A requirement to disclose any non-audit remuneration paid by audit clients will enable shareholders to see by just how much the auditor is in the directors' pocket. But the question is: should he be in their pocket at all? We believe the second way to improve the profession's image would be to preclude firms and their associates from providing any other services to their audit clients. The third problem is that the auditor only reports once a year, and an awful lot can go wrong in 12 months. A classic case was the manufacturing and entertainments group Parkfield. In January 1990 Parkfield announced interim profits of almost Pounds 10m with earnings per share of 17.7p, almost double those in the corresponding period a year earlier. Mr Roger Felber, the chairman, stated that the company was 'in a strong position to maintain over the coming years our exceptional record of growth in earnings per share'. Six months later the group collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 300m after the auditor had declined to sign his report. Had the interim results been vetted by the auditor, the situation might have been recognised early enough to stave off disaster. Another example of differences between interim and audited final results emerged in the recent Petrocon bid for Wilkes. In 1989 Wilkes reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m for the six months to 30th June, and the chairman proudly drew attention to the rise in earnings per share of some 85 per cent. A different story emerged from a circular to shareholders distributed less than three months later, which gave a profit forecast for the full year of not less than Pounds 2.3m. It showed that the Pounds 2m figure had included a profit of about Pounds 1.1m on the sale of a property (a fact not mentioned in the interim statement), for which completion was not due to take place until June the following year. Without that property profit, earnings per share would not have risen by an impressive 85 per cent; they would have fallen by about 10 per cent. To add to the problem, the property deal fell through, so the shareholders never got the benefit even in the following year. So our third point for giving shareholders more confidence in the auditors would be for interim reports to be audited, notwithstanding the extra cost, and for auditors to have a monitoring role throughout the year. But returning to Parkfield, at the meeting of shareholders to receive the report of the joint administrators and to hear a statement by the ex-directors, two matters were clear. One was that Mr Felber, the former chairman by then residing in South America, had wielded too much executive authority. The other was the open admission by the directors that the collapse had taken them by surprise. So this leads us to our fourth point, that the auditor should be required to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the financial information provided to the board. A different example of the board being caught unawares was the currency trading disaster at Allied Lyons last spring, which cost the group Pounds 147m. As Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, the chairman, reported: 'The group's auditors have now completed a full investigation into the circumstances and will be making recommendations on controls and reporting procedures within the Allied Lyons treasury.' A pity it hadn't been part of the auditor's normal duties to do so. Our fifth point is that auditors should not be the only ones to get the stick when problems are covered up by 'smart' accounting. Isn't the finance director just as much to blame? After all, he is responsible for the preparation of the accounts. And what about other qualified accountants on the board? Should they not ensure that the figures give as accurate a picture as possible? Ought they not to have the professional integrity to speak up against financial jiggery-pokery? Our sixth measure would be for any accountants who are shown to have connived in deceiving shareholders and the market to be publicly rebuked. A start has been made by the Financial Reporting Review Panel in admonishing companies which have been caught enhancing their results unduly. We would like to see the executive and non-executive accountants on the boards of those companies being named and, in flagrant cases, being reported to the disciplinary committees of their professional bodies. Finally, coming back to where we began: the lack of warning that auditors' reports give of impending disaster. Our sixth way to improve the accountant's image would be to require the auditor to draw attention in his report to items of significance buried in the notes. This could include changes to accounting policies, the capitalisation of interest and other costs, contingent liabilities of significant size (excluding those within the group), and profits taken on sales to joint ventures.

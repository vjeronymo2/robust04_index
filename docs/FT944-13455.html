			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Santander heads for peak profits Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year afterthe Pta281bn (Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain late last year. Santander yesterday reported profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn including Banesto, by far the highest result posted by a Spanish banking group for this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits stood at Pta100.5bn, 5.9 per cent up on the same period last year. The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank, raised Santander's average total assets to Pta16,827bn from Pta9,270bn, outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the next biggest domestic banking group, by more than Pta4,000bn. Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said the subsidiary bank's performance over the past two months (Banesto was consolidated in August) had 'confirmed the favourable forecasts of Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy designed to consolidate a wide and solid client base in the Spanish market'. Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent without Banesto and 19.73 per cent with Banesto's inclusion. The group's return on assets stood at 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped marginally to 0.98 per cent with it.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS DRIVER TRAINING FEE  </P> <P> Following in the footsteps of other Ventura County districts, Oxnard Union High  School District officials Wednesday recommended charging students for its  driver training program.  </P> <P> Under the recommendation, the behind-the-wheel training program would be  transferred from the regular curriculum to the school's adult school program.  </P> <P> A fee of $130 will be assessed.  </P> <P> The proposal will come before the board for a vote on Nov. 14.  </P> <P> The six-school Oxnard district, along with districts around the state and the  county, was forced to suspend driver training after Gov. George Deukmejian cut  $21.2 million for the program from the 1990-91 budget.  </P> <P> In Ventura County, boards from the Ventura Unified and Conejo Unified school  districts have already approved fees for driver training. Ventura students who  take the course will have to pay $115, while the Conejo district is offering  the course for $120.  </P> <P> In Oxnard, district officials said they are instituting the program on a pilot  basis and will evaluate it in June, 1991, Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said.  </P> <P> The classroom portion of the program, commonly referred to as driver's  education, will continue to be offered, district officials said. ADRIANNE  GOODMAN  </P></p>

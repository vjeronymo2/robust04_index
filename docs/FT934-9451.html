			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (2): Inflation still proves stubborn - The economy: recovery largely depends on Germany THE SUDDEN onset, at the end of last year, of the country's worst recession for more than a decade took most Austrians by surprise, and caused an uncharacteristic outpouring of gloomy forecasts. But while the recession was real enough, causing a 4 per cent decline in industrial output and an even sharper 8 per cent drop in manufacturing exports in the first half of 1993, its impact has been far less pronounced than for most of Austria's OECD partners. Austria's recession came later, and the country is likely to emerge from it more rapidly than its western neighbours, though recovery will largely depend on developments in Germany - Austria's most important trading partner and its main source of revenues from tourism. As hopes receded that Austria would somehow avoid the Europe-wide recession, growth estimates were hastily revised downwards. Gross domestic product was forecast to decline by around 1 per cent this year, though economists now believe the economy has bottomed out and that GDP will fall by a more modest 0.75 per cent. 'The decline stopped in the spring, and since then we've been stagnating. Industrial exports have been worse hit, but construction, tourism and private consumption have held up,' says Mr Helmut Kramer director of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (Wifo). Several factors exacerbated the downturn. After a rapid rise in exports to the former communist states, rising competition from low-cost producers in these countries began to take its toll on Austrian manufacturers, forcing the government to impose import restrictions on sensitive products such as cement and fertilisers. Exporters also suffered from the effective revaluation of the Schilling last autumn, following the devaluation of several European currencies. The consequence was a further deterioration in the trade balance, which is forecast to show a Sch109bn deficit, compared with a Sch106.4bn deficit last year. Exports will fall by 5.5 per cent and imports by 3.5 per cent, but the current account is expected to show a small surplus as income from tourism and services offsets the deficit in traded goods. Inflation is also proving more difficult to tame than anticipated. Consumer prices are set to rise by 3.5 per cent this year, after peaking at 4.1 per cent in 1992, though that included about half a percentage point caused by changes in indirect taxation. Inflation should fall to around 3 per cent next year, thanks to moderate wage rises. A resilient budget deficit adds to inflationary pressures. Lower tax revenues, caused by the recession and higher spending on social security and unemployment benefits, will increase it from Sch62bn in 1992 to about Sch80bn, representing about 3.8 per cent of GDP this year. Hoped-for relief, in the form of revenues from privatisations, have not materialised as the process has faced repeated delays. But a renewed crisis at Austrian Industries, the large state-owned industrial group, is likely to prompt the government to sell off a large part of it next year. The government remains committed to its deficit reduction strategy, albeit at a slower pace, and Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister, hopes to keep the deficit below Sch80bn next year. This may prove difficult if the recovery is delayed by external factors. 'We have to be prepared for another year of weak economic performance. The effects of recession will also be felt in 1994, but we have to put on the brakes,' he says. But there will be no shock treatment with dramatic cuts in spending. 'Lower deficits will be possible when the recovery comes,' Mr Lacina says. Social programmes to soften the recession's impact will be maintained, and the government will seek to encourage employment by accelerating planned spending on infrastructure. 'If you have a high number of unemployed at the start of an economic upturn, it's not easy to bring (the number) down.' Better to try to control unemployment before a recovery, even if that means some additional costs, he suggests. Nevertheless, unemployment is rising and is expected to be 4.7 per cent of the workforce by the end of this year, according to OECD measurements, and around 7 per cent based on the narrower Austrian definition which does not include the self-employed. The fear of job losses and competition from low-paid foreign workers, who now account for 8.5 per cent of the workforce, has encouraged wage moderation. The example of the metal workers' unions, which recently agreed to wage rises of 2.9 per cent for 1994, is expected to be followed by other unions. Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, says low wage rises, combined with greater flexibility to determine the extent of pay increases at the level of individual enterprises, will have a significant effect on small and medium-size companies which are not directly represented in the national wage negotiations. 'It gives a safety net (for workers), together with much needed deregulation (for employers),' she says. Growth is forecast to resume next year with GDP rising by only a modest 1.5 per cent, but Mrs Schaumayer sees three reasons for optimism and a 'velvet landing'. Private consumption will be encouraged by tax reforms; construction activity has recovered from its winter lull; and exports are picking up again. Austrian companies are also increasing their investment abroad, improving their competitiveness in foreign markets. 'This is an ongoing trend. Most investments seem to be profitable, and the propensity to internationalise is rising,' she says. The tax reforms that will come fully into force on January 1 are expected to stimulate business and boost consumer demand, hopefully leading to a rise in investment which is set to decline by around 3 per cent this year. The reforms eliminate several profit-based taxes, raise the main corporate tax from 30 to 34 per cent, and simplify other taxes. On average, the overall level of profit-based taxes will go down by 10 per cent. Officials believe the relatively low level of corporate taxation should encourage foreign investment. Mr Kramer says there has been a steady improvement in the competitive position of Austrian companies in the open sectors of the economy. 'The productivity of capital is two percentage points higher in Austria than in Germany,' he says. But further improvements and restructuring will be necessary to meet rising international competition and the challenge posed by low-cost producers in the former communist countries. Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy general secretary of the Federal Economic Chamber, believes the opening up of eastern Europe offers a unique opportunity. He says Austrian companies will gain competitiveness by shifting part of their production to neighbouring low labour cost economies. Already some 8,000 Austrian companies have joint ventures in the region. Among OECD countries, Austria has the highest share of its trade with the former communist countries, which account for 7 per cent of its imports and 12 per cent of its exports. Mr Farnleitner believes trade with central and eastern Europe could grow to 15-20 per cent of total Austrian trade in a few years' time. Meanwhile, the recession has encouraged businesses to intensify efforts to adapt to the new environment, and Austria's bumpy ride at the bottom of its economic cycle will be made smoother by policies emphasising consensus. 'We are gradualists. It is more sustainable,' says Mrs Schaumayer.</p>

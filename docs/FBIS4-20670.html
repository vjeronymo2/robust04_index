			<p>Current   <F P=102>   94P60156A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Dec 93 p  5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60156A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (NTT)  announced on December 6 that it has experimentally succeeded in  storing a large current in a synchrotron radiation (SR) system.  It stabilized an electron beam in orbit and achieved the world's  highest level storage ring current of 1,215 milliamperes.  Productivity can be increased when the radiation is used for  semiconductor fine processing applications because, the larger  the current value, the stronger the radiation that can be  obtained. It is expected that, when the related technologies are  made ready, processing at a higher speed than that of the  current ultra-violet exposure method can be done.    The experiment was done at a 16.8 meter-circumference  small-scale system called "Super-ALIS," installed in NTT's LSI  research facility. An electron beam accelerated to a high speed  was deflected by superconducting magnets, causing the emission  of radiation. Up until now, the current value was 500  milliamperes. This improvement was made by such measures as (1)  removing the excess electromagnetic field made by electrons that  had completed the prior orbit and (2) devising the structure of  the magnets to control the adverse effects caused by residual  gases inside the system.    As a superconducting, small-scale system, this has the  highest current value in the world, even including the  large-scale systems using ordinary conducting magnets. It is  comparable to the system at the Brookhaven National Laboratory  in the United States, which has 1,200 milliamperes.</p>

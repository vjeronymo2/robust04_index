			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOW BROKEN, PUTTER BROKEN IN;  </P> <P> GOLF: ARNOLD PALMER, WHO SAID HE WOULD NEVER USE AN UNORTHODOX CLUB, DOES SO.  BUT ZEMBRISKI STILL LEADS 54-HOLE TOURNAMENT THAT ENDS TODAY.  </P> <P> After vowing he would never use an unorthodox putting style, Arnold Palmer did  just that Friday in the second round of the GTE West senior golf tournament at  Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club.  </P> <P> However, his 40-inch putter with two separate grips lasted one round. Palmer  shot a par 70, but 38 of those strokes were putts, so the new putter is history  -- at least for the present.  </P> <P> "I did well on the practice green with the new putter," Palmer said. "It really  felt good. But when I got out there, I couldn't sink anything beyond five feet.  The experiment is over for now."  </P> <P> Palmer's switch to an unorthodox putter -- slightly longer than normal --  caused such a commotion that it overshadowed another excellent round of golf.  </P> <P> Although it was another perfect day for golf, with almost no wind, the  6,190-yard course proved a little tougher for most of the seniors.  </P> <P> The leader with 18 holes remaining today is Walt Zembriski. The former  high-rise steelworker from New Jersey threatened to run away with the  tournament before bogeying four of the last 10 holes and finishing with a  two-under-par 68. His total of 132 gave him a one-shot lead.  </P> <P> George Archer and Al Kelley, a Monday qualifier, are tied for second place at  133.  </P> <P> Archer, who had a hole-in-one on the 128-yard eighth hole, shot a 64 to tie the  course record. Five shots back after Zembriski and Homero Blancas shot 64s in  the opening round, Archer is now in a position to win his second tournament in  just four tries on the Senior PGA Tour.  </P> <P> Kelley, 54, who has never won a PGA event, shot a 66, including a 30 on the  back nine. A victory would exempt him from qualifying for one year. Otherwise,  it's back to the Monday grind against about 100 other players trying for four  tournament spots.  </P> <P> With almost every hole a potential birdie, a wild finish is expected today.  There are 15 golfers within five shots of Zembriski. Among them are Rocky  Thompson, who also shot a 64, Frank Beard and Jim Dent at 135, plus four  others, including Chi Chi Rodriguez and leading money-winner Bob Charles, at  136.  </P> <P> Palmer, at 142, is hitting the ball well but is still being embarrassed by his  putting. He rationalized switching to the unorthodox putter on the grounds that  he still uses his regular grip, except that his hands are apart -- even though  he employs the pendulum swing that has been a boon to those who have been  successful with the longer-handled putters.  </P> <P> Charles Owens pioneered the unconventional style as a matter of necessity.  Owens had to stand upright because of a fused left leg, the result of an injury  while a paratrooper. Later, Orville Moody and Harold Henning had success with  handles up to 50 inches in length.  </P> <P> Palmer had always said he would never use anything but an orthodox putter.  Technically, maybe he hasn't given in. But his club, a Slotline mallet-head  putter, is used in the same manner as unorthodox putters with even longer  handles.  </P> <P> Zembriski's orthodox putter was hot early. After seven holes of the second  round, he was five under par and leading Blancas by four shots. Blancas faded  to a 72 and is at 136. He was only two shots back until he had a double bogey  on the 11th hole and went downhill from there.  </P> <P> Zembriski's problems began with the ninth hole, a reachable par-five. He pulled  his drive into the trees, then hit a three-iron through the trees to within 100  yards of the green. But it took him four shots to get down from there. Until  then, he had not made a bogey in the tournament.  </P> <P> "I have work to do," he said. "My putting isn't smooth, and I'm too quick with  my driver. I'll be ready tomorrow, I promise you."  </P> <P> Archer said the hole-in-one was the sixth or seventh of his career.  </P> <P> "I don't know whether I'll win or not tomorrow," he said. "One thing I've  learned in 30 years is never to expect anything. I'm just happy to be playing  golf."  </P> <P> It would mean more to Kelley, who finished 13th and out in the recent  qualifying school. "I'm tired of trying to qualify," he said. "I don't think  I'll be nervous, but who knows?  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Carsberg rejects price war inquiry Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director general of fair trading, has rejected a call for an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into supermarket price wars. Sir Bryan says in a letter in today's Financial Times that he believes price competition is important to the consumer and he has no 'convincing evidence' of collusion or anti-competitive behaviour by supermarkets. He was responding to a letter in Wednesday's FT from Mr Hugh Raven, co-ordinator of the Safe Alliance, a coalition of groups promoting sustainable agriculture, and Prof Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University, warning that below-cost promotions by big supermarket groups were bankrupting the 'traditional high street butcher and specialist producer'.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal, Aluf Ben, Gay Bekhor, and news </F> agencies]    [Excerpt] Yesterday Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin put a  freeze on the accelerated timetable for the completion of the  talks with the PLO which Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on during their meetings in  Bucharest last week. In view of the prime minister's  reservations, there is doubt that the Peres-'Arafat meeting,  scheduled for 28 April in Cairo, will indeed take place as  planned. The final decision regarding the date of that meeting  has been put off until after Rabin returns from Russia on 28  April. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fairfax chief executive named MR STEPHEN Mulholland, chief executive of South African Times Media (TML), has been appointed chief executive of John Fairfax, Australia's second-largest newspaper group. Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December, when it was acquired for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.03bn) by a consortium led by the Daily Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black. Mr Mulholland's success in his new appointment will depend on the extent to which he replicates in Australia the methods he used to turn round TML. He was appointed to the company in 1986 to rescue the ailing TML, then known as South African Associated Newspapers (Saan), by Mr Gordon Waddell, then chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI), the South African mining house which controlled Saan. Mr Mulholland had been editor of the weekly Financial Mail magazine, but with no previous management experience. However, his appointment is widely seen as a success. He turned the company round from heavy losses to steadily increasing profits. Fairfax publishes the Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

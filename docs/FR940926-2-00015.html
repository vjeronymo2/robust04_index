Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.

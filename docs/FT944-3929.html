			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Surge in sales fails to lift Cott in third quarter Cott Corporation, the fast-growing, private-label soft drinks maker, failed to lift third-quarter profits, in spite of a 49 per cent jump in sales. The Canadian company's virtually unchanged earnings reflect slimmer margins as its much bigger brand-name rivals, notably Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, fight to regain market share lost to Cott products. Cott earned CDollars 9.9m (USDollars 7.2m), or 16 cents a share, in the three months to October 29, compared with CDollars 9.8m, also 16 cents, a year earlier. The surge in sales, to CDollars 261m, reflected strong growth in the US and overseas. Almost three-quarters of Cott's sales are outside Canada. But the contraction in margins, from 17.7 per cent to 15.8 per cent, was largely due to price wars in Canada, where Cott's market share is highest, and some parts of the US. While sales volumes in Canada grew by 13 per cent, revenues were up only 4 per cent. Margins were dented by higher packaging costs and a shortage of plastic bottles early in the quarter which hit sales of some high-margin products. Cott's rapid growth stems mainly from the wider profit margin which retailers can earn from their own private-label brands than from heavily-promoted national brands such as Coke and Pepsi. However, opinion is divided whether retailer-controlled brands can expand their beach-head on supermarket shelves in the face of a concerted counter-attack from brand-name manufacturers. Cott supplies about 90 retailers, up from 65 a year ago. It recently formed a joint venture with the UK's Virgin Trading to develop a range of Virgin food and beverage products. The first product, Virgin Cola, was launched last month. Other new customers include Safeway and Woolworth in the UK, and Dunnes Stores, Ireland's biggest retail chain. The third-quarter results were within the range of analysts' estimates. Cott's shares, which reached a peak of CDollars 42.38 earlier this year, edged up 25 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange to CDollars 12.38.</p>

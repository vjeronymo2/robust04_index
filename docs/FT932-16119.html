			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: City Centre shows 24% growth PIZZA gluttons piled on the pounds at City Centre Restaurants which yesterday announced a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 11.3m for the year to December 31. Mr Bruce Johnston, chairman of the company, which owns the Deep Pan Pizza and Garfunkels chains, said covers rose to 13.5m - a 9.4 per cent increase, partly because of the October 1991 introduction of cheap all-you-can-eat pizza and pasta buffets. Turnover increased by more than 12 per cent to Pounds 89.6m (Pounds 79.8m). The pre-tax figure was helped by improved interest receivable of Pounds 574,000 (Pounds 62,000). This reflected cash resources of Pounds 11m with no borrowings amassed as a result of a reduced programme of just six new outlets last year. There was also a reduced loss on property disposals of Pounds 21,000 (Pounds 190,000). A Pounds 296,000 (Pounds 60,000) extraordinary charge related to the disposal of a stake in Cullens, the up-market grocer. Cullens had been meant as an outlet for the Belhaven brewery, which the group sold in 1988. The charge will next year be deducted from the Pounds 11.3m pre-tax figure. The new FRS 3 accounting standard which virtually bans extraordinary items means this year's figures will have to be re-stated for comparison in next year's results. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 1.12p (1.01p) which makes a total for the year of 1.57p (1.46p). The dividend is payable from increased earnings per share of 4.14p against 3.79p.</p>

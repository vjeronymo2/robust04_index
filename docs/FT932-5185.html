			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Hartstone issues further warning HARTSTONE, the hosiery and leather goods group, yesterday issued its second profits warning in a week and said it had suspended a senior employee who had gained personally from corporate foreign exchange dealings. The announcement came after the stock market closed with its shares up 3p at 41p. They had crashed from 91p to 34p last Friday after the company said its pre-tax profits for the year ended March, 1993, would not be less than Pounds 9m after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs. Shareholders were also surprised last week that Mr Stephen Barker, its chairman and chief executive, was stepping down after an all-night meeting between the company and its advisers. His active acquisition strategy had turned the company into the third largest European hosiery group. Hartstone said yesterday its pre-tax profits were likely to be reduced by a further Pounds 260,000 after arrangements came to light involving payments over four years totalling Pounds 1m to employees of a subsidiary company. It declined to give further details. The company also revealed that a senior employee, now suspended, had arranged for certain funds derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract to be paid to an account for his benefit. An advance of Pounds 50,000 to that employee may also be irrecoverable, it added. The board still expects that a standstill agreement with its banks will be entered into shortly. It recently said it had breached at least one banking covenant calling for 2.5 times interest cover. Interest charges at the half-way stage had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.3m. Hartstone also explained for the first time why it had increased provisions last Friday to Pounds 12m from Pounds 8.5m flagged in a profits warning in March. An additional Pounds 2.1m related to the repositioning of the hosiery division, particularly from losses incurred in UK rationalisation, and Pounds 1.4m of abortive acquisition costs had been written off. In addition, it had paid earlier this week the remaining consideration of about Pounds 5.2m for Aznar International, the Spanish hosiery business it had acquired. Discussions continue with Charterhouse Group International on the settlement of Dollars 12.8m (Pounds 8.3m) for Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, the leathergoods groups based in the US it had bought.</p>

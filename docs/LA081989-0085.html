			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NELSON FREIRE WITH BUCKLEY, PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> Competence rather than conviction seemed to characterize the achievement of  Richard Buckley when the conductor led his second Hollywood Bowl concert  Thursday night.  </P> <P> For the 36-year-old American musician, the Los Angeles Philharmonic played  carefully but without maximum interest or energy.  </P> <P> Buckley's program, made up of Shostakovich's "Festive Overture," the second  suite from Prokofiev's ballet, "Romeo and Juliet," and Rachmaninoff's Third  Piano Concerto, might have been planned for display. In the event, it revealed  the conductor's shallowness more than the brilliance of the orchestra.  </P> <P> Returning after an absence of almost 17 1/2 years, Nelson Freire made the  D-minor Concerto an occasion of triumph. Few pianists conquer its extrovert  challenges so completely, and effortlessly, while at the same time delivering  the rich panorama of its inner musical life.  </P> <P> The Brazilian pianist, now 44, seems to command the full range of  Rachmaninovian nuance -- which is saying a lot, where the complexities of this  work are concerned -- plus the digitality and stamina to hold it all together.  Freire may well be the Jorge Bolet of his generation: a great musician  disguised as a piano virtuoso.  </P> <P> In the concerto, the Philharmonic players -- before an audience of Rachmaninoff  lovers counted at 10,179 -- responded nimbly to Freire and Buckley. To  Shostakovich's cliche-ridden, neo-Tchaikovskyan overture, they provided a crisp  and bright reading.  </P> <P> Without genuine inspiration emanating from the podium, they moved through the  "Romeo" excerpts neatly enough, leaving dramatic urgency to come after  intermission.DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

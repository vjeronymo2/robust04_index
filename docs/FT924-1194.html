			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Auditors fail to meet all standards ONLY ONE of four auditors to listed companies inspected by regulators passed all the new audit requirements without any challenge. The figure was given yesterday in the first annual report from the Joint Monitoring Unit, the self-regulatory body jointly controlled by the UK's three chartered accountancy bodies. The report showed that, in all, only 11 of the 158 auditors randomly visited in the six months to last October achieved full marks on 13 questions devised by the unit in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry. Inspections have been completed on only four auditors to listed companies. The unit concluded: 'While most firms have taken steps to comply with audit regulations, many still need to improve their systems and procedures.' Members of the audit regulation committees also stressed that the tests were highly subjective, and that it would be very rare for any audit firm to go unchallenged on all the questions. They said the tests were still being refined. Mr Colin Brown, chairman of the joint audit regulation policy co-ordinating committee, said: 'It is too early to make any final judgments. We do not have evidence to suggest the profession is falling apart at the seams. But those areas in need of remedy are being remedied.' The three institutes confirmed that audit registration fees - which have been a source of concern to some firms - will remain frozen next year.</p>

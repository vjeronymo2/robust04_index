			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES ON PRESS AND MINORITIES  </P> <P> Shaw's effort to demonstrate how the American press contributes to a climate of  fear and mistrust regarding Asian Americans and Japan ("Asian-Americans Chafe  Against Stereotype of 'Model Citizen'," Dec. 11) is laudatory, but I suggest  The Times take a critical peek at its own participation in this trend.  </P> <P> On the day before Shaw's article appeared, a front-page headline opined,  "Japan's Thirst for Hollywood Is Unquenched," conjuring an image of Japan as a  devouring, unstoppable beast preying upon unsuspecting innocents. And The Times  subscribes to the comic strip "Beetle Bailey," in which Japanese-American  Corporal Yo is portrayed as a neurotically over-achieving, greedy  perfectionist, a depiction which could fairly be construed as racist.  </P> <P> MARGARET MASON  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

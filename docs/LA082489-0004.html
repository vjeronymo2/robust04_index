			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE REPARATIONS  </P> <P> Editors at The Times have their priorities painfully confused. The editorial  merely groused about the slow payment of dollars for Japanese reparations, yet  The Times ignored the anniversary of V J Day, ending World War II, which cost  so many American lives. Why didn't The Times honor them?  </P> <P> M. JAFFE  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- The Russia's Choice  parliamentary faction has qualified the Russian president's  decree "On Urgent Measures for the Defence of the Population  From Bandits and Other Forms of Organized Crime" as the  violation of the Constitution, the criminal code and citizens'  rights.    At a news conference held in the Russian State Duma  representatives of the "Russia's Choice" called on the president  to suspend the decree. Lawmaker Viktor Pokhmelkin pointed out  that he proceeds from the necessity to carry out a resolute,  efficient and step-by-step fight against bandits, but this  should be done in strict compliance with the constitution and  should by no means infringe on constitutional guarantees of the  rights and freedoms of an individual, including in the sphere of  criminal court investigation, which have been guaranteed today.    In the opinion of the "Russia's Choice" faction, the  president's decree, and paragraph 1 in particular, contains  clauses which obviously run contrary both to the Constitution  and the Russian criminal code.    In particular, the decree allows to conduct an examination  before criminal proceedings are instituted with the results of  the examination considered as evidence. This runs contrary to  Article 109 of the Criminal Code which says that no  investigating activities can be conducted before criminal  proceedings are instituted, except for the examination of the  place where a crime was committed.    It is presumed that no sanctions shall be used against the  suspects, such as a written promise not to leave the place, the  release on bail or on security. According to Article 89 of the  Criminal Code, the settlement of all these problems is in the  competence of an investigator, a prosecutor or court only. The  decree stipulates that it is possible to detain a suspect on the  above-mentioned charges for the period of up to 30 days, while  Article 22 of the Criminal Code says that a suspect can be  detained for no more than 72 hours.    All this shows that the president has exceeded his  constitutional powers and practically made addenda and  amendments to the Criminal Code in effect today, while addenda  and amendments to the Criminal Code can be made only by law,  which shall be adopted by the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation, the lawmaker said. At the same time, the "Russia's  Choice" faction believes that provisions of the Constitution on  the right of the defendant to defence, the presumption of  innocence and compliance with the law when conducting a criminal  investigation have been violated as well, the lawmaker said.</p>

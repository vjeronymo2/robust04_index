[Amman JORDAN TIMES in English on 16 January  publishes on its front-page a 170-word AP report on 'Aziz's  arrival in Amman in which it cites "diplomats" as saying that  "Iraq is seeking Jordan's intervention with Washington to help  lift the sweeping embargo imposed on Baghdad following its  August 1990 invasion of Kuwait."

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: Secret confessions of a secretary Secretaries resent their bosses; bosses treat their secretaries as mindless typing machines. The relationship in Britain is famously poor: the latest survey by the Industrial Society showed that bosses do not like secretaries who stand up for themselves, show confidence or have a sense of humour. In defiance of this image, a leading City figure and his loyal, long-serving secretary recently took to the stage at a conference in London to prove just how perfect the relationship could be. George Mallinckrodt, executive chairman of Schroders, the merchant bank, and Janice Nowak described to a couple of hundred well-groomed top secretaries how to make the 'partnership' work. According to Mallinckrodt, the secretary's main job is to organise him. To do this she needs to be a skilful diplomat, capable of deciding which of the '900 prima donnas' within the company he has time to see. She must also play the ambassadress, speak many foreign languages, know when Ramadan is, and be able to recognise voices on the phone she has only heard once before. She must have a photographic memory, anticipate all his needs, and remind him to write thank-you letters. Nowak, an articulate graduate in languages seemed to take the job in her stride. The skills she found necessary were: Understanding. 'You must understand the aims of the person and how they work,' she warned. 'If he says 10 minutes, but you know it will take three quarters of an hour, plan for that, but don't let him know'. Communication. This is essential: 'He must tell you what is going on, where and why.' The communication must work both ways. Anticipation. If he his going on a trip, make sure he has the papers he is likely to need when he gets there. Memory. 'If you can't remember something said to you three to six months ago, you'll look silly'. Admit fallibility. 'If you have made a mistake or forgotten something, admit it at once.' The lessons seemed lost on the audience. It would appear that this vision of give and take, with a boss who loves to be organised, and a happy, fulfilled secretary is not the norm. The other secretaries attending the London conference entitled 'Successful Partnership with the Boss', organised by IIR conference group, seemed concerned by more mundane affairs. Their bosses would not surrender their diaries, they complained, and got furious every time they were double booked. Some secretaries said that word processors had given them even more work to do: bosses insisted that letters and memos be changed a dozen times before sending them out. Others who worked for two bosses found that each time they did something for one of them, the other sulked. The main complaint from the high-flyers was that they were expected to work longer and longer hours, had more tasks delegated to them, but felt forever excluded from the management team.</p>

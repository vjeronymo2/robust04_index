			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Savings study at odds with official figures MOST BRITONS say they have not been saving more in the past two years, according to a survey by Mintel, the market research company. Official statistics have shown an increase in the savings ratio, which measures savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, but 70 per cent of those interviewed by Mintel say they have not started to save more in the past year or two. Some economists believe that the end of the house-price surge will have encouraged people to build up financial assets. Previously, they were able to rely on rising house prices for increases in their wealth. However, only 10 per cent of those interviewed agree with the statement: 'The end of the house-price boom has given me the incentive to start saving again'. And 83 per cent disagree. Of those who are saving, Mintel says that 49.9 per cent of their assets are in the form of life assurance and pensions, compared with 32.6 per cent in 1979. The proportion of assets held in the form of securities and unit trusts has fallen from 14.4 per cent to 11.8 per cent over the same period. The report identifies five types of saver. The first is the 'empty-nester investor', mainly men aged 45 to 64, living in London and the south-east and earning more than Pounds 20,000 a year. They have high levels of ownership of personal equity plans, pensions and high-interest accounts. 'Nervous non-savers' are predominantly women aged over 55 and earning less than Pounds 8,000 a year. These people typically own life assurance purchased from a salesman, but find it difficult to save. 'Careful consumers and safe savers' are often women aged over 45 and earning less than Pounds 11,000. They save through building societies, but feel that shares are too risky. 'No wealth, no worries' is how Mintel describes the fourth group. These people tend to be men and single women aged under 34 who have bank or building society accounts which allow them to withdraw money through automated teller machines. But they feel they are no good at saving, and like to leave financial matters to someone else. 'Tangled savers', Mintel says, are people aged between 25 and 44 who earn more than Pounds 11,000. Although they own a wide range of investment products, they feel they are no good at saving. The Mintel analysis was based on a sample of 25,000 people studied by the British Market Research Bureau. National Savings inflow rose sharply in the nine months from March to December, according to figures released yesterday. The total inflow of savings was Pounds 1.88bn, up from Pounds 1.05bn in the same period a year earlier. Savings - Is it A British Problem?

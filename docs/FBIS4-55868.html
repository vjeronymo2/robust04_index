			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Ivan </F> Scipiades; place and date not given: "The Hungarian Democratic  Forum Did Not Fare Badly"]    [Text] [Scipiades] How will you hand over the ministry?    [Jeszenszky] In harmony with the government decision, we  have prepared a detailed report on our activity of four years  and on the current affairs. After the second round of  elections, when we know the party and officials providing the  new ministers, we will personally present all the important  issues, answer every question and, if necessary, make proposals  regarding the tasks ahead.    [Scipiades] Personally, what will you do after the  elections?    [Jeszenszky] I have a rather good place on the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] national list and most probably I will  make it into Parliament. I think that it is my moral and  political obligation to continue to deal with Hungarian foreign  policy and to participate in Hungarian public life as an MDF  politician.    [Scipiades] Do you intend to work in the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the Hungarian Parliament?    [Jeszenszky] Yes. I would be a parliamentary deputy first  of all, and naturally I want to continue my teaching career at  the university.    [Scipiades] In view of the fact that you had the possibility  of better comparing various foreign countries than your party's  leaders, in your opinion, what is the reason for your party's  defeat?    [Jeszenszky] It is not yet possible to evaluate the election  results before the second round. Although I do not think that  we can count on miracles and a complete turn in the results, the  fate of the majority of individual deputies has not yet been  decided. We hoped for a better result in the MDF; I expected a  few percent more and a more balanced proportion among the  various parties. I knew that a lot would depend on the mood of  the last days and even last minutes, and this made the results  of the first round impossible to forecast. At the same time, as  a party, the MDF did not fare badly, because it has a firm basis  and this could show in the second round too. I also believe  that we can become a well-functioning and professional party in  the coming period.    [Scipiades] Something that the MDF has not been so far.    [Jeszenszky] No, because we could not have such experiences  and we were only a few people. The party's heroic age ended  with the forming of its government. However, it was difficult  for the MDF to get used to the role of "government party" and it  was even more difficult to fulfill the tasks of such a party.    [Scipiades] Among the MDF leaders, you must have known best  the extent to which the left was assisted in its victory in last  year's Polish elections by the brutal anti-left propaganda  carried out by the Polish right. The situation is extremely  similar in Hungary. Have you drawn the attention of the MDF  leadership to the dangers of such propaganda?    [Jeszenszky] I analyzed the Polish elections in detail to  the MDF national committee, and I drew their attention to the  lessons. As a party, the MDF understood these lessons. The  phenomena you have mentioned did not characterize the central or  local MDF campaign. Perhaps there were elements in the campaign  that seemed to refute this, but these elements were definitely  not the results of a strategic decision.    [Scipiades] To what lessons did you draw the attention of  the MDF leaders?    [Jeszenszky] I drew their attention to the fact that it is  not enough to emphasize our achievements, because the former  Polish Government also achieved rather good results, just like  the Hungarian Government. Actually, our less-than-expected  results were not caused by our occasional mistakes; they were  rather caused by a trend that is characterizing every former  communist country: the people's exaggerated expectations, their  lack of readiness to face the burdens, and continued  expectations of a miracle. Thus, there is a historic trend here  which seemingly was impossible to confront. Besides, the MDF  fared better than the leading force of the Polish Government  coalition in September 1993, and I regard this as a considerable  achievement, just like the fact that the small parties that  split from the MDF put up an insignificant presence in the  elections. Thus, our stable basis of supporters understood the  Polish lesson.    [Scipiades] Certain MDF foreign political experts are trying  now to drive home the lesson that the Socialists and the  Liberals will not be able to do different things either  regarding Hungary's policy toward its neighbors and regarding  the issue of ethnic Hungarians beyond our borders.    [Jeszenszky] I regard the criticism of the Socialists and  the Liberals as only a campaign trick. In my opinion, in his  first interview, Imre Szekeres, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  deputy chairman, formulated their foreign policy program as this  government did on many occasions in the past four years. Yes, I  believe that other parties will not be able to represent other  goals either. If they thoroughly analyze the criticism  addressed to the MDF, they will find out we have done what could  be done and what had to be done. If other parties can come to  an agreement with our neighbors, an agreement that the MDF  called upon in harmony with the ethnic Hungarians beyond our  borders in 1989, I will only congratulate them. We are not to  be blamed for the failure to achieve such an agreement.    [Scipiades] Is there anything you would do differently now  with your present experience?    [Jeszenszky] Regarding the main lines and concrete steps,  there is hardly anything that I would do differently now.  Although it is possible that it would not have led to any  results, we should have made more efforts for progress until the  autumn of 1991, a time when a new age began after the big  changes of 1989. If, for example, the Balladur plan had emerged  then, it could have led to some results. Generally, our  communication with the society was our weak point and, thus, we  also failed to bring our foreign policy closer to the people.    [Scipiades] The interest was there on the part of the  journalists.    [Jeszenszky] Yes. I am not talking about the dailies.  There are still analytical commentators there, although fewer  people read these columns. However, there are many more foreign  policy programs in the foreign television programs, including  much more analysis. A lot of ministers, politicians, and  ambassadors are facing very well-trained journalists on CNN!</p>

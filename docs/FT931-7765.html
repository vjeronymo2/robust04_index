			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster MP survives legal challenge A LEGAL attempt to oust West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron failed yesterday after judges at a special election court in the city ruled that he had made inaccurate election returns but was not guilty of corrupt practice. At the general election last April, Dr Hendron captured the seat for the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party by 589 votes from Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Adams had held the seat since 1983. After the election, Dr Hendron estimated that he was helped by about 1,500 Protestants in unionist enclaves of the constituency who had voted tactically to remove Mr Adams. In the legal challenge resolved yesterday, a West Belfast constituent had alleged that Dr Hendron's campaign had overspent on the legal limit of Pounds 6,375. If the court had found that either Dr Hendron or his election agent had acted illegally or corruptly, the Speaker of the Commons would have been recommended to disqualify Dr Hendron for up to 10 years and a by-election would have been required. After the ruling, Dr Hendron said he felt as if he had 'won the election all over again', and that he and his agent had been 'totally and absolutely vindicated by the court'. But they now face a Pounds 40,000 legal bill after the judges made a special ruling ordering that the parties in the case pay their own costs. In making the order the judges also said: 'We consider that there were matters to be properly investigated in this election court and the party (who took the action) was fully justified in making this petition, and we think it proper that this should be recognised.'</p>

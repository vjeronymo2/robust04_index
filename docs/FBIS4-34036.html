			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The "de facto"  Haitian Government has demanded that hotel and boarding house  owners in the country report the identity of the foreigners  staying in their establishments to the police within a 24-hour  period.    The Interior and Defense Ministry issued a communique on  this  which was revealed today. The decision is based on Articles 60  and 62 dated 26 December 1978, which refer to immigration and  emigration and compels the owners of hotels and boarding houses  to report the presence of foreigners in that timespan. The  communique warns that if this demand is not met, they will  proceed to arrest the people responsible and suspend the  licenses and operating permits of the hotels and boarding houses  that operate in the country.    With this measure, the "de facto" government wants to gain  control over the foreigners who arrive in Haiti in case of a  possible foreign intervention in this Caribbean country.    The Interior and Defense Ministry also calls on the people  to  be vigilant and report the presence of unknown people in their  areas and to be prepared to maintain their civic duty of  defending the fatherland. Furthermore, it calls on people to  avoid moving far from their areas of residence to avoid the  risks of being killed in the face of a possible foreign invasion.    On Monday, a short while after the state of emergency was  declared throughout the entire country, the "de facto"  government reported that it guaranteed the security of foreign  citizens in Haiti. In this sense, the Information Ministry has  requested foreigners to go about their regular business and  expressed its surprise at U.S. State Department statements  regarding the security of U.S. citizens in Haiti and said the  U.S. Government's statements were "precipitous."</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Characters in search of a plot - Cinema CITY SLICKERS 2 (12) Paul Weiland ABRAHAM VALLEY (PG) Manoel De Oliveira GETTYSBURG (PG) Roland F. Maxwell FAUST (15) Jan Svankmajer The curse of movie sequels is the tyranny of plot. Part one of a cine-saga is enriched by the process of introducing characters and developing their foibles and interplay. In part two that groundwork is done - so the film-makers must throw down their spades and take up their scaffolding tools. Build that narrative adventure-playground] Make the characters Do Something] The higher the climbing-frame the better; and never mind how silly the design, so long as there are enough 'What next?' rungs to grab the attention. City Slickers was a comedy about a band of urban males surrendering to Nature on a dude cowboy holiday. No plot in particular: just a funny tale of culture shock in cactusland. CS2 has a different feel from the start. The humanist honeymoon is over; the Hollywood hokum is about to begin. We imagine the opening salvoes at the story conference. 'Guys, we gotta have a story this time round]' And then, 'Guys, we gotta bring Jack Palance back into this pic even though he died in the first one. He won us an Oscar]' Well, there are only two ways to bring a dead character back: as a ghost or a twin. Slickers 2 opts for the second. Grizzled Jack plays his fraternal double while star/screenwriter Billy Crystal re-plays Mr Menopausal of Manhattan, whom wild horses would not drag back into the wilderness but whom a Compelling Plot Device just might. 'Try buried treasure,' an excited executive must have said. So they do. Off to wildest Utah go Mitch (Crystal), Phil (Daniel Stern) and a token new character in Mitch's brother (John Lovitz). And soon Palance is pouncing off a rock at them. He is after the treasure as well, since it is his Pop's. He growls; he hisses through that gargoyle mail-slit of a mouth; he generally behaves like a great character actor required to ham it up. Not all is lost, even though Palance is squandered. Crystal can still deliver a mean one-liner, whether discussing brotherhood with Phil - 'I can't believe you two are from the same gene pool,' says Phil; 'He's from the shallow end' answers Mitch. But mostly everyone seems dazed by the piling on of plot and of irrelevant action sequences, including a silly stampede. Director Paul Weiland, out of British TV commercials by one disastrous previous feature outing (Leonard Part VI), brings little flair to the visuals and not much more to the jokes. For true comedy you should try Abraham Valley. This purports to be a film by Portuguese director Manoel De Oliveira, maker of those magisterial lost-love epics Francesca and Amor Di Perdicao. But we wonder at times if it is not a lost episode of Monty Python. To escape the life of deranged formality she has been born into - the sun-lanced salons, the starched dinners - our heroine Ema leads the life of a woman inspired, as the film and the novel it is drawn from (by Agustina Bessa-Luis) make clear, by her Flaubertian namesake. Bovaryish, she marries a medico: 'a clever doctor, expert in phlegm' says the voice-over narrator. Bovaryish, she has affairs, reads a lot and gets bored amid the lovely, yawning scenery. The press-show audience gave a sympathetic chortle when the narrator told us, after two hours of this near-catatonic three-hour tragedy/social satire/romance, 'Ema was intent on stepping up the pace of her life, in any way she could think of'. Yes indeed. If only. Instead, 60 minutes later, she steps on the rotten plank of a boat jetty and drowns in what appears to be all of three feet of water. Like any seraphically bad film, Abraham Valley has its seraphically good moments. Oliveira can place a human profile against a painterly blur of autumn colours and make it an image of searing, hieratic beauty. And he can freeze the film for moments of meditation, when a poised landscape or character-grouping define not just a moment but a milieu, even an epoch. But then the film reverts to its crazed story of passion - this woman causes cars to crash merely by standing on a terrace - and to its Loony Tunes one-liners from the narrator. 'Ema put on a boiler suit to go mad in a motor boat,' he intones at one point; and we are almost too dazed to savour the line's battiness. But how else to bombard a little life into a woman who is not so much a human being, more a carbon copy of literary heroines past: a Flaubert parrot, shall we say, mimicking the cries of a superior creation. Gettysburg is four and a half hours of the magnificent in hand-to-hand combat with the mundane. It was made for American TV, so we have no big stars: just big beards and big battles. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen sport the devouring face-fungus as Confederate Generals Longstreet and Lee and Jeff Daniels is concealed under a walrus moustache as Colonel Chamberlain. He held the yankees' flank in round one of the Civil War's bloodiest battle, leading the bayonet charge from the hill known as Little Round Top. Daniels shows how it should be done. Not impaling Southerners, we mean, but holding the high acting ground. He delivers the speeches about democracy with fearless passion; he delivers the tears as comrades die. Daniels' piercing simplicity as an actor ends up 'holding the line' for the entire film. Nothing matches him. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell spends the first half rooting for the North, the second hobnobbing in the Southern camp as Sheen, Berenger and company get ready for the suicidal assault known as Pickett's March. Hundreds of extras; serial cannons spitting smoke; and an aerial camera weaving like a conductor's baton to Randy Edelmann's remorselessly 'stirring' music. We are stirred. But should we not also have been shaken? The deaths are lost in the grim abundance of clutched stomachs, unhorsed cavalrymen and blast-catapulted bodies. We tell ourselves to be appalled. But we wait, vainly, for the one true moment of felt and intimate horror. Jan Svankmajer's Faust treads the city of Prague like a lost tourist in Kafkaland. The film begins with live action, as our clerkish, woebegone hero (Petr Cepek) threads the city's alleys and labyrinths as if they were the mazes of his own minds. Then on dance menacing puppets, the writhing clay creatures, the bald, hog-toothed Mephistopheles and the giant wooden mask that disgorges mini-marionettes like Gulliver throwing up Lilliputians. Kafka? Make that Kafka with a dash of Swift, Spitting Image and Hieronymous Bosch. Much of Faust is appallingly funny; most of it is inspirationally surreal; and some of it is a touch laborious, as we would expect when a short-film genius goes to feature length. Wit and vision, though, are rare enough in the movie world: we are not about to send them back even when they are thinly spread.</p>

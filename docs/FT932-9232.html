			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Star settlement EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced that it had settled another stage of the complex litigation stemming from disputed mortgage indemnity insurance policies. Mr Maurice Markovitz, an insurance agent, agreed to pay Eagle Star Pounds 4.08m in respect of counter indemnities which he had given to the company over the sale of mortgage indemnity policies to Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Arab Bank. In January, Eagle Star agreed to pay a maximum of Pounds 87.5m to settle the dispute with BBL, which lodged an insurance claim on policies covering commercial property loans after borrowers, including Land Property Trust, defaulted during 1990. Last month Eagle Star and BBL reached a separate agreement with the valuer, Lewis &amp; Tucker, whose valuations of some of the properties involved were alleged to be negligent. The valuer agreed to pay Pounds 25m, with half of these proceeds directed to Eagle Star. A separate action by both Eagle Star and BBL against a second valuer, John D Wood Commercial, continues. Mr Markovitz also agreed to withdraw all claims against Eagle Star including claims arising out of the Anton Piller Order which the insurer obtained against him in 1990.</p>

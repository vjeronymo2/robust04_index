			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Radical agenda set for reform of constitution THE QUEEN would no longer have the power to appoint the prime minister under a programme for radical constitutional change approved by the conference yesterday. Delegates voted overwhelmingly for a wide-ranging motion stipulating that the prime minister should be elected by an overall majority of the House of Commons. It also called for the abolition of the royal prerogative which enables the Queen, acting on the advice of her ministers, to declare war or sign treaties with foreign governments without the prior approval of parliament. While postponing to next year a debate on whether the monarchy should be abolished, the conference voted to change the law governing the right of succession to the throne. The Liberal Democrats want to allow the eldest child of the reigning monarch - whether male or female - to succeed to the throne. Another change approved by the conference would permit a Roman Catholic to assume the throne. Calls for the introduction of referendums which would be binding on parliament were defeated, but delegates agreed that there should be advisory referendums. Newly created regional assemblies, local councils and, as at present, parliament would be able to stage referendums on controversial issues. Provision was also made for citizens' referendums to be held when called for by a stipulated number of voters. Other fundamental changes included in the programme for were: A new bill of rights entrenched with a written constitution and upheld by a Supreme Court. Home rule for Scotland and Wales, and regional assemblies in England. An elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords representing Britain's regions and nations. The reformed chamber to include a minority of unelected non-voting members chosen to reflect wider expertise and experience. The introduction of the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for all elections.</p>

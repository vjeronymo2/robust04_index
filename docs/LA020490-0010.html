			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> GOLDEN GATE MAY GET WIND STRESS TEST  </P> <P> The Golden Gate Bridge may soon undergo modern wind stress tests, partially to  determine how the 52-year-old span would withstand blustery weather if a second  deck is added for a rail transit system. A recommendation by chief bridge  engineer Dan Mohn to study how much wind it would take to damage the suspension  bridge, which in 1982 withstood 70-m.p.h. winds, was endorsed unanimously  Friday by a committee of bridge directors.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, wind tests costing $39,863 would be conducted in  conjunction with a $423,640 three-dimensional computer study of how a possible  rail transit system on a lower deck would affect the bridge. The latter study  is due to be released March 25 by T.Y. Lin International of San Francisco.  </P></p>

An algorithm for determining the aerodynamic characteristics  based on a vortical model is proposed, and an approximate method  of analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics (ADKh) of frame  grid wings and the frame fin assembly as a whole is developed. A  comparison of analytical data to the experimental results makes  it possible to speculate that the procedure proposed for  analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of frame grid fin  assemblies, rectangular slip plates, and slender wings is  adequate for practical applications and may be recommended for  implementation in aircraft, ship, and vessel computer-aided  design systems (SAPR).

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins names Frenchman to replace its chief executive ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, did little to allay the fears of British institutions about the strength of its French minority shareholders yesterday. The group named a Frenchman to replace the group's sacked British chief executive, Mr Stephen Walls. Mr Alain Soulas, presently chief executive of the paper division of Saint-Gobain, the French industrial company, will take over at the beginning of October. The group said Saint-Gobain has no relationship with Worms et Cie, the French financial company, which indirectly owns 39 per cent of Arjo Wiggins Appleton (AWA). At a meeting with analysts yesterday, Mr Soulas said his most immediate priority would be to continue to push through synergies following the merger of the French and British groups. In particular, there were synergy benefits in rationalising production and purchasing which had not yet been achieved. Mr Soulas told analysts he did not want to increase geartinue to make small acquisitions as they became available. There would be no significant management shake-ups within the company. He added that he would move to the UK where the company's small headquarters would remain domiciled. The group's dividend policy would not change. Mr Tim Rothwell, paper analyst at BZW, said Mr Soulas had a good track record in the industry. However, he said poor trading conditions meant he was downgrading his profits forecast for this year from Pounds 212m to Pounds 205m, and for next year from Pounds 240m to Pounds 235m. AWA's shares, which have underperformed the market since Mr Walls was sacked, closed last night 5p up at 218p. Mr Soulas's move, while not unexpected, was nevertheless a significant promotion, said Mr Jonathan Helliwell, paper analyst at James Capel. He pointed out that Saint-Gobain's paper division had a turnover of about Pounds 900m against AWA's sales last year of Pounds 2.48bn. Meanwhile, the company expects to announce more board appointments to replace a non-executive director - Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, who resigned, and Mr Ian Kennedy, the chief executive of the fine papers and forestry and pulp division, who retired this year. The replacements are likely to be American and British. See Observer</p>

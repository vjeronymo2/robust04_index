			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOAN FEES -- NOW YOU SEE THEM, NOW YOU DON'T  </P> <P> Thomas M. Berry needed big money in a bad way.  </P> <P> An official of a railway workers union in Chicago, Berry watched in 1987 and  1988 as the Chicago &amp; North Western railroad sold off rail lines and tried  to eliminate hundreds of union jobs.  </P> <P> Last summer, he and some fellow union members decided to try to buy part of the  railroad to protect the jobs and run the line themselves. But no conventional  bank would provide the financing.  </P> <P> So, Berry said, an investment banker put him in touch with Otis Cheerful Canupp  of Tucson, Ariz., chief executive of Regal Bank of Montserrat, a tiny Caribbean  island.  </P> <P> Regal's financial statements showed assets of $2 billion. The bank's license  application in Montserrat listed assets of $51 billion, according to court  papers.  </P> <P> And Berry said Canupp was very accommodating, promising to lend the union the  money it needed. But Berry said Canupp told him that the bank needed an advance  fee of $55,000.  </P> <P> Federal labor law prohibited using union money for the fee. So Berry withdrew  his life savings and borrowed some more to come up with the money. Last Nov. 3,  he sent a cashier's check for $55,000 to Canupp. He has been waiting for his  loan ever since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paid Personal Expenses  </P> <P> "We're against the wall now, but I still haven't given up," Berry said in a  telephone interview last week.  </P> <P> A federal law enforcement official said at least seven other people paid  $55,000 each to Regal Bank in recent months for loans they have yet to receive.  </P> <P> An affidavit prepared by FBI agent Robert M. Keefe for a search of Canupp's  Tucson office last month said Berry's money was used to pay personal expenses  for Canupp and some associates, including department store charge accounts. The  affidavit said Canupp admitted to Keefe in February that the bank's entire  assets consisted of stock in a defunct mining company.  </P> <P> Regal Bank, which was not chartered by WFI Corp., is one of the Montserrat  banks now under investigation by Scotland Yard, according to the island's  attorney general.  </P> <P> The FBI is also investigating the bank, according to Keefe's affidavit. Along  with the alleged advance-fee schemes, the Keefe affidavit said Otis Canupp told  undercover federal agents that he could launder drug money and help them  acquire illegal weapons, all through his bank.  </P> <P> Canupp and his mother, Alberta, were jailed briefly in Montserrat last month on  charges of conspiring to defraud the island government. Free on bail, they are  restricted to the island and awaiting a hearing in June.  </P> <P> Alberta Canupp said in a telephone interview that she and her son are innocent  of any wrongdoing. She said they were unfair victims of the problems created by  a few offshore banks and she said the loans had not been fulfilled because of  "interference" by banking authorities.  </P> <P> "Everybody is being lumped into one pot and everybody is being penalized," she  said.

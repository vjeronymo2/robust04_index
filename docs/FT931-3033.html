			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Cash flow benefit of up to Pounds 2bn sought - Taxation of dividends This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. FIVE linked changes are proposed in the taxation of dividends. The Treasury said the intention was to provide an overall cash flow benefit of nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95 to all UK companies paying dividends, to reduce the amount of new surplus advance corporation tax arising in 1993-94 and subsequent years by some Pounds 300m and to raise revenue of about Pounds 1,000m a year from 1995-96 onwards. The main changes are: to reduce the value of the tax credit on dividends paid by UK companies from 25 per cent to 20 per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1993; to reduce correspondingly the present income tax charge on dividends from the basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent; to reduce correspondingly the rate at which a UK company has to account for advance corporation tax (ACT) when it pays a dividend from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, but with a transitional rate for 1993-94 only of 22.5 per cent; to reduce the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts in line with these changes; to introduce transitional payments to charities with dividend income from UK companies. The general rules are: Tax credits on dividends: Tax credits accompany dividends paid by UK companies. They can be set against a UK resident shareholder's liability to tax on the dividend. A shareholder who is exempt from tax on dividends (such as a pension fund or a charity), who is not liable to income tax because any income is covered by allowances, or whose income falls within the lower rate band of income tax, can claim payment of all or part of the credit. Tax credits are also payable to certain non-resident shareholders, such as Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Republic of Ireland. Partial tax credits are payable to some other non-resident shareholders under the terms of some of the UK's double taxation agreements. The value of the tax credit is currently 25 per cent of the dividend plus the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, is Pounds 25 (25 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds 25). This exactly matches liability at the basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit. From 1993-94, the value of the tax credit falls to 20 per cent of the dividend plus the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, thus becomes Pounds 18.75 (20 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds 18.75). This will exactly match the new income tax charge at the lower rate on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit. Tax liability on dividends: Shareholders who are exempt from tax on dividends, or not liable to tax, will be paid the tax credit on dividends paid after 5 April 1993 at the lower rate of 20 per cent. This will also apply to tax credits paid to holders of Personal Equity Plans. Individual shareholders whose income falls within the lower rate band of income tax charged at 20 per cent can, at present, claim payment of that part of the credit which exceeds their liability. After 5 April 1993, they will not be entitled to any tax credit payment as the tax credit will no longer exceed the liability. For shareholders who are currently liable at the basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent, the present tax credit matches the liability on dividends and there is no further tax to pay. After 5 April 1993, the tax credit will continue to match the liability exactly, but at 20 per cent. Individual shareholders who are liable at the higher rate of income tax of 40 per cent currently pay extra tax on dividends at the difference between the higher rate and the value of the credit. Such a shareholder who at present receives a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, is taxable at 40 per cent on income of Pounds 100 (including the tax credit of Pounds 25), and can set the tax credit of Pounds 25 against the liability of Pounds 40 leaving a further Pounds 15 to pay. For dividends paid after 5 April 1993, this further payment will be greater. A shareholder receiving a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, will be taxable at 40 per cent on income of Pounds 93.75 (dividend of Pounds 75 plus tax credit, at the new rate, of Pounds 18,75) and, after setting off the tax credit of Pounds 18.75 against the liability of Pounds 37.50, there will be a further Pounds 18.75 to pay. Dividends and other income and allowances: Dividends will be treated as the top slice of income. A shareholder with income other than dividends will have the full amount of the lower rate band of 20 per cent available to set against that other income. A shareholder liable at the higher rate will pay an additional 20 per cent tax on dividends to the extent that those dividends fall above the threshold for the higher rate (basic rate limit). Personal allowances and other reliefs which are set against the total income of an individual will continue to be given in the way which produces the greatest reduction in the individual's liability to tax. Rate of Act: A company which pays a dividend has to pay ACT. The rate at which ACT is paid is currently 25 per cent of the sum of the dividend and the ACT payable on it. A company pays ACT of Pounds 25 for each Pounds 75 of the dividend. After 5 April 1994, the ACT rate will be reduced to 20 per cent. A company will pay ACT of Pounds 18.75 for each Pounds 75 of the dividend. For dividends paid after 5 April 1993 and before 6 April 1994, the ACT rate will be set between the present and the new rate. It will be 22.5 per cent of the sum of the dividend and the ACT payable on it. A company will pay ACT of just over Pounds 21.77 for each Pounds 75 of the dividend. Other ACT points: The rules for setting ACT against corporation tax liability will be unchanged. The maximum amount which a company is able to set against the liability for any accounting period is the amount of ACT which would have been payable on a distribution of an amount which, together with the ACT that would have been payable on it, would have been equal to the profits of the accounting period. That limit, which at present is Pounds 25 for every Pounds 100 of taxable profits, will be Pounds 20 for every Pounds 100 of taxable profits except for the transitional year of 1993-94 when it will be Pounds 22.50. There are special rules about the ACT payable when a company receives dividends as a shareholder in another company which it then pays on as dividends to its own shareholders. Broadly speaking, a company pays ACT only on the excess of the dividends it pays over the dividends it receives in any accounting period. Under the proposals, this principle will continue to apply. For 1993 and 1994, as for any year in which the ACT rate changes, a company's accounting period which starts before 6 April and finishes on or after that date will be treated as two separate accounting periods for the purpose of these rules. Charities receiving dividends from UK companies are normally entitled to claim payment of the accompanying tax credit by virtue of their exemption from tax on this income. For a transitional period of four years from 1993-94, charities will also be able to claim additional payments.</p>

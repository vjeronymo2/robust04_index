			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): More vital than ever - Satellite technology / By the turn of the century, satellite technology may well have plugged the last gap in providing a truly global mobile telecommunications system SATELLITES already play a crucial role in fixed and mobile telecommunications. They provide voice, data and video links across continents and oceans, maritime and aeronautical communications where land-based systems are not an option and global positioning and tracking services for military and other customers. Increasingly, they are being used in the US and elsewhere to provide two-way Vsat (Very small aperture terminal) satellite telecommunications services to businesses - a market which in the UK alone is expected to grow to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m within the next five years. They are also used to provide telecommunications facilities to geologists, journalists and others in remote or inhospitable regions of the world using briefcase-size portable satellite terminals, such as those supplied by Inmarsat, the London-based 69-member International Maritime Satellite Organisation. Inmarsat, which uses four operational satellites, already has 25,000 customers, most of them in its traditional market of ship-to-shore communications. These services are mostly based on geo-stationary satellites (Geos) which orbit the earth at a height of between 12,000 and 25,000 miles. But soon, if plans go to schedule, a new type of satellite system based on low earth orbit (Leo) satellites will help deliver the first truly global handheld mobile telephone service capable of providing voice and data telecommunications literally 'any where on earth.' Among the handful of Leo-based telecommunications system proposals which have been unveiled in the last few years by international consortia, the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project, conceived by Motorola, the US-based electronics group, is probably the most ambitious and advanced. The Iridium project will be based on a 66 Leo satellites ringing the earth at a height of just under 500 miles with each satellite in sight of several others at all times. Thus a message to or from a handheld mobile telephone operating on the Iridium network could be transferred between satellites before being beamed down to its destination anywhere on earth. Two months ago Motorola announced that after several years of funding all the research itself, it had raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium, including Bell Canada, Raytheon, Sprint, Sony and Mitsubishi as the first stage towards financing the Iridium project. As prime contractor for the project, Motorola will be responsible for designing and building the entire Iridium network and has a Dollars 2.8bn contract to maintain and operate the system for five years after it is launched in 1998. By that stage, Motorola's stake in the project will have fallen from 34 per cent to 15 per cent as new investors join. The financing agreement gives Iridium a clear lead in the race to build a satellite-based mobile telephone system based on Leo technology. Leos are designed to orbit at between 450 to 6,000 miles; and because they are closer to earth than geo-stationary satellites, telecommunications systems built around Leos should suffer less from the characteristic echo heard on some satellite voice links. They will also work with much less powerful - and therefore smaller,lighter and cheaper - telecommunications equipment including pocket-sized handsets. But there are disadvantages. Like Geos, they are solar powered but because they orbit lower they will spend more time in shadow and therefore have a shorter life span, perhaps five years instead of 10 or more for conventional satellites. However, their biggest - and costliest - disadvantage is that to provide reliable global coverage many more Leos are needed than would be the case with their higher-flying counterparts. This also means a large number of launches, and an extended roll-out time. For example, Iridium plans to place its 'constellation' of satellites in orbit over two years starting in 1996 and will use a combination of McDonnell Douglas Delta rockets from the US, the Proton rocket from Russia and China's Long March launch vehicle. Another five consortia, mainly comprising US and European space and telecommunications companies, have proposed similar schemes although none are quite so ambitious as Iridium and most of them still have to win solid financial backing. Most of the groups plan to start commercial operations between 1996 and the end of the decade. Several other groups have plans for Leo systems which would provide data rather than voice services. MOTOROLA'S success in securing financial backing for Iridium is likely to trigger a race between the other Leo contenders, not only because there are limits to the world's satellite launching capacity, but also because most analysts believe the market can probably support only two competitors. To supplement revenues from voice traffic Leo systems will also carry fax messages, paging, facsimile, computer data and provide radio-determination satellite services - services which locate radio transmitters by latitude and longitude. They could also provide voice and data links for the next generation of personal digital assistants which will begin appearing later this decade. Iridium hopes to have 2m customers four years after the network becomes operational. Each customer will have to buy either an Iridium handset or a dual purpose handset which will work with both Iridium and the buyer's own local mobile telephone network. Calls will cost about Dollars 3 a minute and the handsets are likely to cost about Dollars 1,700. Some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a mass market voice telecom delivery system in competition with much cheaper terrestrial-based networks, especially since it seems probable that there will be an oversupply of satellite system networks. Aside from the other Leo satellite consortia, Inmarsat also has plans to build its own satellite-based global hand-held mobile telephone service designated Project 21 which has been viewed by many as the main rival for Motorola's Iridium project. Originally, Inmarsat had planned to base Project 21 on a Dollars 2bn Leo network. However, in a surprise decision at the end of July, the Leo plan was abandoned in favour of a network using fewer satellites placed in higher geostationary or intermediate orbits. The decision to opt for a conventional system was taken after Inmarsat commissioned reports on the options and should enable the organisation to reduce its investment to about Dollars 1bn. Whether or not the decision will benefit Iridium and the other Leo groups is debatable. On the one hand, it means Inmarsat has given up the advantages of Leo systems and could have implications for the type of service that it can offer and this could make it easier for Iridium and others to secure investor support for their Leo systems. On the other hand, it highlights the technical complexities of Leo systems and may enable Inmarsat to provide a cheaper service. For Iridium these issues are likely to come to the fore when the initial funding runs out and it seeks another tranche of almost equal size within two years. The remaining 60 per cent of the project cost is expected to come from the debt market. International investors will also want to be reassured that a number of other difficult issues have been resolved. Among these is the issue of frequency allocation. The World Administrative Radio Conference agreed in principle last year on which frequencies to allocate to Leos, but since then, the various consortia have been unable to agree how this allocation should be divided up. The dispute has arisen because Iridium, unlike all its other rivals, plans to use time division multiple access (TDMA) technology - which does not permit frequency sharing. In contrast, all the other proposed systems would use code division multiple access or spread spectrum technology which can share a block of frequencies. The dispute has already delayed the timetable for licensing global mobile satellite systems in the US and will probably require a US Federal Communications Commission ruling on the issue. The other main unresolved problem is about who should regulate global mobile satellite system operators - an issue which is exercising the European Commission and other would-be regulators.</p>

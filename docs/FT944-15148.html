			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (11): Tomorrow's locations - New trends shaping site selection In considering a business location, it is important to weigh up the fact that communities are constantly changing, and so are the needs of industry. What looks like an excellent site today may seem a bad choice 10 years down the road, and vice versa. So what do locational experts see as important new trends shaping company site selection over the next decade or so? One of the most important is that North American businesses will become increasingly reliant on well-educated employees - so-called knowledge workers - such as computer technicians, accountants, and engineers, who can give their companies the critical value added they need to compete against increasingly fierce global competition. Factory floor employees will also need to be better trained to perform their jobs well - for example, in keeping track of the computers which run the production process. Companies which prosper are therefore likely to be attracted to areas which can lure knowledge workers to live in them; which have good secondary and higher education systems; and which are willing to offer generous aid in training workers. Somewhat paradoxically, these criteria throw up as favourable centres an extremely broad range of communities - from some old eastern cities to relatively new urban clusters in the desert south-west and rural communities. For knowledge workers are attracted both to large urban centres of intellectual excellence and to the quality of life available in more rural surroundings, away from the crime, pollution and congestion of the metropolis. Some of the most favoured business locations in North America manage to combine intellectual excellence with a high quality of life. Perhaps the most outstanding example is the Raleigh/Durham area of North Carolina, which has at its heart the 7,000-acre Research Triangle Park, a vast campus for high-technology whose resident companies include Du Pont, Glaxo and Ciba-Geigy. It is broadly in the middle of a triangle between the region's three big universities - Duke, University of North Carolina and Carolina State. The area is leafy, the climate mild, the cost of living relatively low, and skiing mountains and the Atlantic ocean only a few hours' drive away. Some analysts see so-called 'second tier' cities, somewhat akin to the Raleigh/Durham model, becoming increasingly attractive as locations. These are smaller centres, with lower business costs, which have modernised themselves over the past decade or more and offer up-to-date facilities, but a relaxed quality of life. To fare best, however, they need good transport links and a good university or two. Examples (all with populations of under 1m) include Albany, the still rather sleepy capital of New York state; Birmingham, Alabama, a city which has transformed itself from a dusty steel town into a centre of medical excellence; Austin, the capital of Texas, which has become a significant computer industry centre and is home to the main campus of the University of Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah, emerging as a significant high-technology centre; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which has become a substantial back office and distribution centre and has an excellent vocational education system. However, some of America's largest cities are also expected to remain extremely attractive business locations - despite their relatively high costs - because of the sheer concentration of knowledge workers found there. New York ,for example, will remain a crucial centre for finance, the media, the professions and international trade. Other big cities which appear to have a particularly bright future include Boston, thanks to computers, medicine, finance and its universities; Chicago, with an extremely diverse industrial base and excellent universities; San Francisco/San Jose, with Silicon Valley retaining its pre-eminent position as an information technology centre; and Houston, which has diversified from oil and gas into a broad range of high-technology and engineering industries and is home to several excellent universities. Atlanta, Georgia, the capital of the booming south-east, is also extremely well placed, as is Seattle, with its cluster of high-technology industries, beautiful setting and close links with Asia. Companies, however, should not rule out of their calculations rust-belt cities which have suffered in the past from a poor image. Take, for example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which in the 1980s was a byword for industrial depression as its surrounding steel mills closed. It has diversified its economic base and the city centre, with its dramatic riverside setting, now has a thriving, confident air.</p>

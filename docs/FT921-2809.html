			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Call for new bank to boost Nafta A DEVELOPMENT bank should be set up to ensure potential benefits are realised from the proposed North American Free Trade Area between the US, Canada and Mexico, a group of academics say. Led by Prof Albert Fishlow of the University of California (Berkeley), they suggest the bank would soften the impact in those areas of the US and Canada hit by job losses. While overall, jobs would be created, jobs would be lost and a need to facilitate new skills arise, Prof Fishlow says in Developing Country Investment Review, published by the London-based Chartered WestLB. The bank would also help meet the need for physical infrastructure, to finance environmental improvement projects and support expansion of social infrastructure, such as education and health care in Mexico. Mexico should benefit most from the resources of the bank, which would be similar in concept to the European Regional Development Fund. The bank should be funded through an issue to member governments of partly-paid shares, such as those issued by the World Bank.</p>

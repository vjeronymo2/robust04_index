			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Lords allow home income plan appeal The House of Lords yesterday granted the Investors Compensation Scheme leave to appeal in a case involving home income plans. The ICS, a scheme for clients of authorised investment firms which have collapsed, has sought a House of Lords hearing since June when the Court of Appeal extended the grounds for compensation to home income plan investors. The judgment ruled that the scheme did not have discretion to decide levels of compensation according to what it considered fair. The ICS wants clarification on a number of issues affecting the implementation of the judgment.</p>

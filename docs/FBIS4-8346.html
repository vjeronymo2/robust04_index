			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] In a plenary session this morning, the  People's Assembly approved a draft statement presented by the  Permanent Parliamentary Commissions of Foreign Policy, Defense,  Public Order, and ShIK [National Information Service] regarding  the criminal act of 10 April by Greek terrorists against  Albania's integrity and sovereignty.    [Begin recording of unidentified speaker at the People's  Assembly] As you have been informed, an incident occurred on  the Albanian-Greek border on 10 April 1994 that ended in a  tragic event -- two Albanian officers lost their lives, three  others were wounded, and many others' lives were endangered.    To honor the memory of the martyrs, these two youths who  lost  their lives in their prime, I invite you to stand up and honor  their memory with a minute's silence. May their memory not be  forgotten.    The Foreign Affairs and Defense Commissions met yesterday to  analyze this incident. They presented a draft statement to the  People's Assembly, which, after being discussed in the  presidency with the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, was  later discussed in the parliamentary groups as well. I will now  read this draft statement:    The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania is deeply  indignant over the unprecedented criminal act of 10 April that  was committed by Greek terrorists against Albania's integrity  and sovereignty.    According to the official confirmation, at approximately  0230  a Greek terrorist unit of seven armed people dressed in Greek  military uniforms entered Albanian territory near the Peshkepi  village in the Gjirokaster district. Penetrating approximately  4 km, at a recruits training center two of them surprised and  killed with an automatic weapon Arsen Llazar Gjini, an  18-year-old soldier from the village of Seman in the Fier  district. After this act, four others entered the officers'  dormitory while the officers were sleeping and opened fire on  them. The 33-year-old head of training, Captain First Class  Fatmir Sali Shehu, born in Tepelene and resident of Gjirokaster,  was shot dead in this barbarous act. Three soldiers were  wounded and many others' lives were endangered. While these  inhuman acts were being committed, one of the terrorists shouted  in Greek: This is for Vorio-Epir, do not think we have  forgotten.    After this act, the unit -- pursued by Albanian border  guards  -- left and crossed the Greek border. The direction of the  pursuit proved that the unit came from the direction of the  Greek post of Argjirohor.    This was a premeditated act carried out by a criminal group,  for which the Greek Government bears full responsibility. Such  events on our border have been recurrent, despite the protests  and careful stance maintained by our government. Under the  present extremely tense situation in the Balkans, an escalation  of such events endangers the progress of relations that exist  between our two countries. Albania is a democratic country that  respects all principles and known international norms in  relations between states and is devoting every effort tries to  creating a climate of understanding, peace, and equilibrium in  the Balkans. However, such events run contrary to international  and EC efforts for peace and stability.    The People's Assembly of Albania asks the parliament of the  Republic of Greece to see to it that the Greek Government bear  responsibility for this act and condemn those responsible, as  well as take serious measures to prevent a repetition of such  events, which can cause unforeseen developments to the detriment  of our bilateral relations and peace in the Balkans.    We urge all international organizations to exert all their  influence on the Greek parliament and Government for a rapid  solution to this tense situation created by the Greek side.    Deeply feeling the pain of the victims' families as a common  Albanian pain, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania,  the legitimate representative of the Albanian people, extends  its deepest sympathy to them.    By unanimously condemning and denouncing such a criminal  act,  the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania asks that all  Albanian citizens remain calm and mature in keeping with our  people and the determination for the country's defense and the  preservation of peace and good neighborliness.    The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania. [applause]    Deputies, I invite you to approve this draft statement  through a consensus. The statement, as I can see, is  unanimously approved. [end recording]    [Announcer] The People's Assembly will devote a whole  plenary session to the discussion of this grave event at 1000 on  15 April, when Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and Public Order  Minister Agron Musaraj will address the deputies.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington setback A sharp decline in preliminary profits, a swingeing cut in the dividend total and another reminder of the impact of the recession in Germany triggered a steep slide in Pilkington shares. The rest of the building materials area also dipped as worries about Germany continued to ripple across the stock market. The Pilkington news came hard on the heels of the warning made by Meyer International on Tuesday about the depth of the recession in Germany and across the rest of continental Europe. Pilkington shares dropped to a day's low point of 125p before steadying and ending a difficult session a net 6 lower at 130p. Turnover of 10m Pilkington shares was the highest in a single trading session since April 1, when the company issued Pounds 80m worth of convertible bonds. Worries about the trading outlook in Germany overshadowed Redland and RMC, among Europe's biggest building materials providers and both heavily involved in that country. The latter, a new entrant in the FT-SE 100 Index as from June 21, lost 6 to 769p and the former eased 3 more to 475p. George Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue, at a deeply discounted 148p a share, drew an initially enthusiastic reception from the market, where Wimpey stock pushed up to 193p. A more detailed appraisal of the issue and of the reasons behind it took the gloss off the shares, however, which retreated in orderly fashion to close a net 3 easier at 184p. Turnover in Wimpey was a hefty 7.6m shares, easily the highest since the Grove Charity sold a 29 per cent stake in Wimpey at 131p a share in March. 'The issue smacks of opportunism, but could well have been shrewdly timed,' said one analyst of the building sector. Other housebuilders moved up as the market searched for companies likely to grasp the opportunity to raise capital at a time when the opportunities in the sector are emerging. Costain attracted keen support, with the stock running up 5 to 45 1/2 p on much heavier than usual turnover of 3.5m shares. There were numerous big trades in the oil sector, notably a line of 4m Shell Transport traded at 614p, well below the ruling market price. Shell closed the day a net 5 down at 622p. British Petroleum, on the other hand, rose 4 1/2 to 314 1/2 p following renewed and aggressive buying said to have been carried out by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. A block of 2m Monument Oil &amp; Gas shares was sold into the market at 46p. In a series of big individual trades late in the session, a block of 5.8m BT was dealt in at 406p, 5.9m Hanson at 225p, 1.4m Lloyds at 560p and 6.5m Marks and Spencer at 343p. Family reasons and accountants' advice were cited as being behind a large placement of shares in Betterware, the door-to-door sales operation, by its chief executive and a non-executive director. The placement represented 13.1 per cent of the company. Mr Andrew Cohen and Mr Stanley Cohen placed a total of 13.4m Betterware shares with institutions and other investors at a price of 230p through BZW and Albert E. Sharpe. The shares gave up 8 to finish at 240p in a volume of 18m. Great Universal Stores 'A' bucked the generally downward trend of the market yesterday, rising 20 to 1670p. One persistant buyer was said to be behind the move, which was in thin volume, while analysts pointed to GUS's property benefits. With its results due next month, investors are thought to be optimistic. Quayle Munro, the Scottish merchant bank, made a successful debut. Placed at 118p by broker Williams de Broe, the shares moved up from an opening level of 123p to end at 130p. Shares in Ladbroke, the entertainments group, firmed 2 to 192p after NatWest securities added the stock to its ''Best ideas outperform list'. The addition of Ladbroke to the NatWest list was at the expense of Hickson International, whose shares gave up 15 to 217p on the news. Property shares declined moderately in line with the slipping tide of the market. After this week's well received cash call, Great Portland Estates has watched its popularity fade. The stock lost 4 to 196p as BZW issued a sell note calling the company 'unexciting at best'. Compass moved 13 ahead to 504p following the successful placing of the rump of the rights issue. The recent profits downgrades in MB-Caradon continued to dampen investment enthusiasm for the stock, which lost a further 8 to 269p.</p>

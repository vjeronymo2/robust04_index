			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL CALLS FOR HEALTH WARNINGS IN ALCOHOL ADS  </P> <P> Spuds McKenzie, the black-and-white dog that peddles a brand of beer, could be  headed for the endangered species list if industry fears about a measure now  before Congress come true.  </P> <P> Legislation by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., would require that all print,  radio and television advertisements and promotional displays for alcoholic  beverages include prominent health and safety warning messages detailing  specific risks related to drinking.  </P> <P> "As a society, we seem to be unwilling to even give the basic warnings,"  Kennedy said. "We'll let tens and tens of thousands of ads be shown on  television to our children to have them think if they want to win that race, if  they want to get the good car, find the prettiest girl, they have to drink.  </P> <P> "Let's take advantage of the brains that God gave us and recognize that if  there's some problem with a particular product, we probably ought to use it  moderately or avoid it under certain circumstances," Kennedy said.  </P> <P> But groups representing the alcohol, broadcasting and advertising industries  have massed in opposition to the plan. They say it would effectively lead to a  ban on virtually all forms of advertising for beer, wine and liquor.  </P> <P> Saying alcohol is a factor in half of the nation's motor vehicle deaths and  homicides, Kennedy said his legislation is designed to combat alcohol abuse by  giving the public the ability to make a "balanced and informed choice."  </P> <P> James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, called the legislation  "prohibitionist." The trade association represents firms that produce and sell  about 90% of the nation's beer, including industry giants Anheuser-Busch,  Miller, Stroh's and Coors.  </P> <P> "If they can tax it enough, if they can eliminate advertising, if they can mix  it in with the drug war, then they will have achieved a prohibition without  passing a prohibition amendment," Sanders said. "They feel that alcohol is the  problem, not the people who drink it."  </P> <P> The legislation calls for a rotation of five warnings in ads:  </P> <P> * "Drinking during pregnancy may cause mental retardation and other birth  defects."  </P> <P> * "Alcohol impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery."  </P> <P> * "Alcohol may be hazardous if you are using any other drugs such as  over-the-counter, prescription or illicit drugs."  </P> <P> * "Drinking alcohol may become addictive."  </P> <P> * "It's against the law to purchase alcohol for persons under age 21."  </P> <P> In print advertisements, the warnings would include a toll-free telephone  number operated by the Federal Trade Commission to give information about  alcohol abuse. In broadcast advertisements, the warnings would have to be read  "in an audible and deliberate manner and in a length of time that allows for a  clear understanding."  </P> <P> Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., is pending in the  Senate.  </P> <P> Consumer groups and substance abuse experts have given strong support for the  measure. The American Civil Liberties Union, however, has expressed its doubts  about the constitutionality of the legislation.  </P> <P> Health warnings have been required on alcohol product labels since last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Not a cloudless sky for Irish Permanent - Alison Smith charts the society's road to conversion The Irish Permanent Building Society, Ireland's largest mortgage lender with about 27 per cent of the Pounds 7.3bn Irish mortgage market, is not living up to its name. It is still Irish, but its status as a building society is increasingly impermanent, as it is well on the way to becoming a publicly quoted company floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges. The process is set to move a further step forward today as the pathfinder prospectus is due to be published when the society announces its interim results. The society's road to conversion illustrates some of the differences between the processes and regulatory regimes in Ireland and in the UK - highlighted also by the agreed cash bid of Pounds 1.8bn by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. For example, Irish Permanent appears to have benefited from some flexibility in enabling its customers to benefit from free shares. After savers and borrowers qualified to vote had approved a single resolution to convert from mutual status in March, savers were able to vote to make borrowers no longer members of the society: as members no longer, they became eligible for free shares. No disgruntled borrower has yet suggested that changing C&amp;G's rules to make borrowers no longer members, might enable them to qualify for the cash handout from which the law currently bars them. But even if the idea were mooted, it is by no means certain that the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, would approve. The reasons for Irish Permanent's decision to convert are also different from what they might be for a UK society. Alongside the 80m-plus free shares to about 227,000 members, the flotation aims to raise up to IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.25m) in new capital through the issue of more than 30m shares. Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, has made it clear that it was not regulatory constraints that inclined the society to become a public company  -in Ireland unlike the UK the central bank regulates both banks and building societies - but the desire to be able to raise equity capital, in order to compete more effectively with banks. He has emphasised that Irish Permanent will not actively be seeking acquisitions after conversion, however. Instead it will be looking for a period of consolidation. Alongside the plans for flotation, it has recently bought Prudential Life of Ireland from Prudential Corporation - the UK's largest life insurer - for just over IPounds 30m cash, and acquired Guinness &amp; Mahon, where the main activity is private banking, for IPounds 6.7m. Irish Permanent has a strong position in the Irish mortgage market, but the picture is not entirely cloudless. For example, its cost/income ratio, though declining, is still the highest in the industry in Ireland at just over 60 per cent. And though it benefits from the fact that it is quite hard to win access to the Irish mortgage market, there are signs that growth in this area is expected to be steady, rather than spectacular in the next few years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Guo Jia (6753 0857), and XINHUA </F> reporter Zheng Guolian (6774 0948 5114) and correspondent Zhang  Zhimeng (1728 2535 3718)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou  Military Region held a ceremonial gathering this afternoon to  mark the 30th anniversary of the Defense Ministry's naming of  the "Steel Eighth Company in the South Sea Outpost."    Inscriptions for the steel eighth company from Jiang Zemin,  Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen were read at the meeting.    Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] General Political Department, presented a copper  horizontal board engraved with the words "Steel Bastion in the  South Sea Outpost" to the company on behalf of the three General  Departments.    A general order of the military region party committee  conferring a first-class merit citation on the company was also  read at the meeting.    In his speech, Chi Haotian, Central Military Commission  [CMC]  member, state councillor, and defense minister, first extended  warm congratulations from the CMC and three General Departments  to the company. He said: The steel eighth company has grown to  maturity under the kind concern and assiduous training of the  party Central Committee, the CMC, and older-generation  proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao met cordially with  the company's representatives to National Day celebrations on  six occasions. CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin, during his inspection  of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone on 24 June 1990, wrote an  inscription for the company. Recently, CMC Vice Chairmen Liu  Huaqing and Zhang Zhen also penned inscriptions for the company.  In the past three decades, the company has lived up to the  expectations of the party Central Committee and CMC, always  preserving and developing the army's fine traditions and  constantly strengthening its construction in an all- around  manner. It has stood erect at the outpost in the South Sea with  a healthy image of mighty and civilized troops and made  important contributions to safeguarding and building the special  economic zone.    Chi Haotian said: Currently China is at a crucial historical  juncture. We must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain stability, wherein lies  the overall interests of the work of the whole party and whole  country. The PLA, as the pillar of the people's democratic  dictatorship, must serve and be subordinate to these overall  interests by carrying out the sacred mission of safeguarding  national security and ensuring safe milieus for reform, opening  up, and modernization. In the face of the heavy responsibility  entrusted upon us by the times, all army officers and men should  foster a steel conviction and will toward the cause of the party  and army. The steel eighth company's spirit reflects precisely  and vividly such conviction and will. Energetically displaying  the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit put forth by  chairman Jiang Zemin, the company has always acted like a steel  knife whose blade cannot be turned both during the years of war  and socialist construction -- invincible when assaulting or  defending against fully armed enemy forces; determined and never  wavering in the great cause of reform and opening; and rejecting  corrosive influence and never tainted by offensives of decadent  ideas and sugarcoated bullets. So long as we develop the eighth  company's spirit, we will be able to adhere to the party's basic  line for 100 years and steadfastly advance reform, opening up,  and the socialist modernization drive; and will be able to carry  out difficult and rigorous training for crack troops and  continually improve their fighting capability to meet combat  requirements. We must learn from the steel eighth company's  advanced experience and develop its noble spirit, and must  strive to turn the PLA into a stronger and more modernized  revolutionary regular army.    In his speech, Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong provincial  committee, lauded the eighth company as heroic troops with a  glorious tradition. He said: The steel eighth company  epitomizes the PLA's feature in our times, demonstrating that  the people's army is an invincible and civilized army. The  company's footprints symbolize the army's exploits, showing that  the people's army not only had an illustrious yesterday but has  continued to and will create a brilliant today and tomorrow. He  urged local governments to emulate the company in further  promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization and  the development of reform, opening up, and modernization.    In his speech, Shi Yuxiao, Guangzhou Military Region  political commissar, called on all commanders and fighters of  the military region to learn from the eighth company; to arm  their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics; to inherit and carry  forward the army's fine tradition of hard struggle; to always  bear in mind the army's fundamental duties; to train hard for  tough military skills; to strive to strengthen the construction  of party branches; and to mold a "fighting bastion."    Leaders of Guangdong Province, the Guangzhou Military  Region,  and Guangzhou and Zhuhai cities attended the meeting.</p>

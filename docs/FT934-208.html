			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: In defence of conglomerates Sir, Your comments on Williams Holdings ('The first fruits of a strategy change', and Lex column, December 22) display a lack of understanding of diversified companies. Why does Lex refer to Williams' 'sprawling empire' when BTR, recently voted Britain's best managed company, has more than 1,000 businesses across a broader range of industries? Why does Lex say that because Fairey, Williams' bridges business, 'generates erratic profit' it 'needs a large parent'? Does this mean all companies with volatile earnings should have large parents? Why is it implied Williams is doing the right thing 'with its transition from a conglomerate to a more focused group of businesses'? These comments misunderstand how Williams has grown from nothing to a market capitalisation of nearly Pounds 2bn in less than 10 years. It has been a specialist in turning round and upgrading businesses through expert parenting of manufacturing and operations. Similar to BTR, but with a more hands-on approach, Williams has exploited situations where existing managers are under-performing. Why then is Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, changing strategy? Is it because there are few under-performing opportunities, or because there are more opportunities in 'building products and fire and safety'? Moreover, why does Rudd say the businesses he is selling 'are better owned by other people'? It is the answers to these question that will help us understand whether or not Rudd is doing the right thing. We need to know what William's parenting skills are and why Rudd believes he will have an advantage in building products rather than in engineering or electronics.

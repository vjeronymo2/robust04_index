			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of South  Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification (Hantongnyon)  made public a statement on March 3 as regards the demand of the  U.S. authorities for the repeal of the "National Security Law"  (NSL) in South Korea.    The statement branded the "NSL" as an anti-democratic,  anti-reunification evil law defining the North and the  anti-"government" forces in the South and overseas as "enemies"  and totally blocking human rights, democracy and national  reunification and as an evil law infringing upon basic rights of  the people including conscience and the freedom of ideology and  the freedom of speech, the press and association.    The attempts to keep the "NSL" only reveal the anti-national  nature of the present "regime" which is turning a deaf ear to  the demands of the people and scheming to perpetuate the  division, the statement said. It repeatedly and strongly urged  the Kim Yong-sam puppet authorities to abrogate the law.</p>

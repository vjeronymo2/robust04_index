			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / BAe confident in spite of Pounds 1.2bn pre-tax loss: Chief executive confirms no plans to dispose of Rover car business which reduced its loss to Pounds 49m BRITISH AEROSPACE entered the record books yesterday with the biggest annual loss in UK corporate history. The loss of Pounds 1.2bn before tax included exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn, as forecast last year. However, BAe also lost Pounds 75m at the operating level, compared with a Pounds 212m profit the year before. Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, said that while the position was 'clearly unsatisfactory', he was much more confident about the outlook than six months ago. 'We have delivered on our objectives for 1992,' he said. These were to secure the future of the European Fighter Aircraft, to establish a joint venture in regional aircraft with Taiwan Aerospace, and to push forward the Al Yamamah defence contract with Saudi Arabia. The Rover car business reduced its loss from Pounds 52m to Pounds 49m, in spite of a 10 per cent fall in output to 421,000 units. Rover had reduced its break-even production level to 440,000 units a year. This year's target for break-even was 400,000; however, that was proving difficult to achieve. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'We cannot hope for help from any immediate recovery in the UK economy.' He confirmed there were no plans to dispose of Rover when its five-year agreement with the UK government expires in August. Mr Cahill said BAe was not worried about the threat of takeover. 'We might look very attractive in terms of price, but you don't know what you're getting,' he said. 'That's our poison pill'. Mr Evans said relations with Lord Weinstock of GEC, rumoured as a predator, were amicable: 'Arnold (Weinstock) is an honourable guy. He tells us that unless we take any actions harmful to him, he has no intentions of moving against us.' Mr Evans dismissed President Clinton's attacks on European subsidies for Airbus, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake. The company confirmed that Airbus was in talks with American Airlines about the possible cancellation of an order. 'If these aircraft come back to us, we will re-market them,' Mr Evans said. 'At present, we're playing a game of brinkmanship.' Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director, said the group was comfortably within its banking covenants. 'There could well be a constraint on the pace at which we move in managing our portfolio of businesses. But as managers, we're used to operating within constraints anyway.' The final dividend was 4p per share, making 7p for the year (25p). BAe's shares rose 13p to 265p. Lex, Page 24; Details, Page 26</p>

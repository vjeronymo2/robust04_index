			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Excerpt] Early this morning, the criminal Mladic brought  to the Bihac front units from (?Glamoc) which, supported by  tanks, attacked our positions on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau,  Hasin Vrh, and the Bihac part of the front.    In addition to fierce tank and infantry attacks, the  chetniks  for the first time used helicopters on the Grmusko-Srbljanski  plateau. Our soldiers are repelling all attacks, at the same  time inflicting losses in manpower on the chetniks and letting  them know that they will never subdue these areas.    While the members of the 5th Corps bleed for the ninth  consecutive day as they struggle against the combined enemy of  the Muslim people -- the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor -- the  members of the paramilitary forces of the so-called autonomous  province of western Bosnia have attacked -- in a cowardly and  devious manner -- the members of the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army  in the region of (?Dodig) [words indistinct]. One of our  soldiers was wounded, while three were tied up and taken to  Velika Kladusa. This act has elicited more bitterness among the  members of the 5th Corps and the local population, who say that  they would all rather die than allow the implementation of the  autonomists' or the chetniks' plans.

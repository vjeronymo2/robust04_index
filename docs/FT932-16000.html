			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Share prices bubble again HECTIC TRADING and bristling confidence in recent weeks on the Tokyo stock exchange have brought back memories of the 'bubble' days of the late 1980s. The Nikkei average, which measures Tokyo stock prices, touched 20,000 yesterday for the first time since March last year, prompting Mr Kazuo Tamayama, an investment strategist, to describe the unexpected rise as 'a mini-bubble'. The Nikkei closed at 19,829.23 yesterday, up 342.43 on the day and 38 per cent above its low in August. Interest rates are low, and there is even talk of support for land prices. The economic backdrop is, however, reminiscent of the earlier 1980s, when exporting companies were hit with a higher yen, interest rates were at historical lows, and the government introduced a Y6,000bn (Pounds 35bn) emergency economic package. The official discount rate was cut to 2.5 per cent in February, and the government will announce yet another emergency package next week. A report released this week by the Ministry of Finance, defines a 'bubble' as a sharp dissociation between the theoretical and actual values of assets. The report reflects the reasons for the surge in asset values in the 1980s, although it is unclear if the ministry would define the recent highs reached on the Tokyo market as 'actual' or 'theoretical'. Even though corporate profits are falling while price/earnings ratios have reached levels unseen since the bubble years, brokers insist the market rise is completely rational. Mr Chisato Haganuma, strategist at Nomura Securities, says: 'The stock market is discounting the future recovery in corporate earnings,' although he adds that profits at companies may not see a full fledged rise for three to four years. Such reasoning does not make much difference to investors in search of investments offering high returns. Money market interest rates have fallen sharply, while the bond market has peaked, losing 40 per cent in the last two weeks. Politicians are playing a role in talking up stock prices, and are even encouraging a rise in land prices, another bubble feature. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's team working on the economic package, wants public funds to be pumped into the property sector for advance purchase of land for public works projects. He also suggested that the package should include assistance for ailing banks through supporting property prices. Meanwhile, Japanese newspapers are cheering on stock prices, and highlighting every 'green shoot' of economic recovery. But capital spending is still falling, job opportunities are contracting, and consumer demand is still very weak. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday expressed concern at the rapid rise of share prices, saying the stock market should reflect corporate earnings. But some suspect that the Finance Ministry has developed a fondness for bubbles, believing that a surge in asset prices is the only prescription for the economy, wobbling under the heavy burdens inherited from the collapse of the last bubble.</p>

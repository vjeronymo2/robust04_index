			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Colour of money Colour of money: Royal Mail is breaking new ground with next month's issue of four stamps ranging from Pounds 1 to Pounds 5. The Queen's head in the corner of the stamps will change colour from gold to green depending on how the light hits it. The effect is similar to the changing image on credit and cheque guarantee card holograms, but is created by the first use on stamps of a special ink which leaves a microscopically three-dimensional surface. The ink has previously been used only when printing special documents and foreign banknotes with a value of about Pounds 1,000. The aim, says Royal Mail, is to deter would-be forgers, although there have been no signs yet of such attempts. The stamps will be on sale from March 24.</p>

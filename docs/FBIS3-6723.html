			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session on  the morning of 20 March with officials from the Ministry of  Energy and the management committee of the 500-kilovolt [kv]  north-south powerline to discuss the tasks remaining before the  powerline can start operation at the end of April or in early  May.    Attending the meeting were the comrade ministers and deputy  ministers of science, technology, and environment; finance; and  construction as well as representatives of the National Defense  Ministry.    By 20 March, units working on the 500-kv powerline had  completed the construction of 3,436 bases and pylons and put up  a total of 1,487 km of electrical and anti-rust wire. All of  the transformer and switching stations are up to 90 percent of  their capacity.    Comrade Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne assured Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet that all construction work on the project will be  completed by 30 March, and operations will begin on an  experimental basis on 10 April.    The prime minister expressed his concern regarding measures  to deal with the remaining work at the last transformer station  in Phu Lam. He ordered the Ministry of Energy to concentrate on  completing the remaining work to ensure the timely operation and  technological requirements of the project. The prime minister  said that because the planned deadline to complete the project  has not yet expired, we need to work with a sense of urgency,  but not in haste or on the precondition that the project must be  officially commissioned on a national holiday. Rushing could  produce regrettable results.    The prime minister reminded the Ministry of Energy that  while  attempting to complete the project, we must also prepare for the  production phase, especially the task of training cadres,  technical staff, and workers. We also have to study the  experiences of foreign specialists in management and operation.</p>

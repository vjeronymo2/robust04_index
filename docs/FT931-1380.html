			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Fiat group executive faces probe ANOTHER senior member of the Fiat group has been caught up in the corruption investigations of Milan magistrates. Yesterday the magistrates revealed that two days ago a cautionary warrant alleging corruption had been issued against Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, the chief executive of New Holland, the agricultural machinery and earth moving venture owned 80 per cent by Fiat and 20 per cent by Ford. Mr Ruggeri, based at New Holland's headquarters in London, is understood to have been named by Mr Luigi Caprotti, a former concessionary in Lombardy of Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles group, who had already been questioned by Milan magistrates. Mr Ruggeri was formerly managing director of Iveco. Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio Mosconi, head of Toro, the Turin group's insurance arm, are being held in a Milan jail.</p>

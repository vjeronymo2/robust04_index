			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho with the collaboration of </F> Peter Moon -- all names as published]    [Text] Scientists do not have a fatherland, and science  belongs to humanity. These two rules are strictly observed by  the more than 40 Russian professors and researchers who have  settled in Brazil in the past two years. Their contracts were  financed by funds established by the National Research Council  (CNPQ). It took them a short time to adapt to the daily routine  of Brazilian universities, and to leave behind the fear that the  job was more than a short experiment by half a dozen spotted  cats. They are feeling better, and it seems they have forgotten  the meaning of the word goska -- the feeling of missing  something or someone -- when they talk about the possibility of  returning to Russia. They want to stay in the country as long  as they can work here.    The distance separating Brazil from a country where  professors are paid with dignity is as big as the distance  separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. In any case, you cannot  possibly miss the routines you left behind when salaries were  $80 per month. Physicist Grigoriy Surdutovich, 56, was one of  the first to come to Brazil. He arrived in January 1992, pushed  by the political instability and the drastic budget cuts for  scientific activities in Russia. The decline forced salaries  down drastically there. Despite the shortcomings, he believes in  improving Brazilian research efforts. "The climate in Brazilian  scientific circles today is similar to the one in my country 35  years ago," Surdutovich says. The scientist is studying the  pressure of light on atoms at the Sao Paulo University (USP) in  San Carlos. Artur Elfimov, 50, is the leader of a group of five  Russian experts in plasma physics at the Rio de Janeiro State  University (UERJ). He says: "If administrators really support  the effort, the country could recover the time lost in various  areas of knowledge."    The education of the researchers is varied. Galina  Pugatcheva and Anatoliy Gusev, of the State University of  Campinas (Unicamp), are studying the anomalies of the Brazilian  magnetic field. The phenomenon creates 50 percent more  lightings in our atmosphere than in any other part of the  planet. Another five Russian scientists, contracted to work at  the State University of Northern Fluminense (UENF), which was  inaugurated on 28 March in Campos, are interested in producing  synthetic diamonds. According to UENF patron Senator Darcy  Ribeiro (PDT-RJ) [Democratic Labor Party -- Rio de Janeiro], 15  researchers from the former Soviet Union will join the team in  the near future.    For many the "import" of Russian scientists means savings in  time and money. "You need at least eight years of heavy  investment to form a professional of this level, and the cost is  never less than $200,000," Carlos Augusto Azevedo, head of the  UERJ Quantum Electronics Department, says. "Besides, the  results of their work do not take long to appear," Azevedo adds.  "This immigration has already yielded optimum results," Oscar  Hipolito, USP Physics and Chemistry Institute director, says.    All this enthusiasm crashes against one obstacle, however:  The law that forbids contracting foreigners as public  officials. Rejected by the international community, this  limitation has forced the Russian scientists to remain as  visiting professors with salaries of $1,000 to $2,000 per month  for periods of one to two years. Rectors and professors hide  behind the constitutional principle of university autonomy to  attack the ban. Their arguments worked in the recruitment of  physicist Dmitriy Gitma by the USP in 1992, after he won a  public competition.    Gitma is, however, an exception. All other Russian  researchers depend on a fund, and many of them accept an  additional difficulty of teaching in Brazil: inflation.  Physicist Irina Potapenko, of the UERJ, left Russia two years  ago. Her salary is adjusted by the dollar exchange rate every  three months, despite the disagreement of state public servants.  "I live in a university apartment. Just the same, inflation  makes salaries barely enough for a condominium and survival."  Despite the fact that her salary is corroded by price  increases, she admits to being satisfied with the work, and does  not contemplate leaving the country. When the legal and  economic difficulties are pointed out to her, she answers with  the smile of a person who has already begun to know the  Brazilian soul: "Take it easy; Brazil is ours," she says.</p>

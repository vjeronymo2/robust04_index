			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Political Notebook: View from the terraces RETREAT on Wednesday. Defeat on Thursday. Thus his opponents were celebrating last night Mr John Major's climbdown on the Maastricht treaty and the forecast Conservative defeat in today's Newbury by-election. Only 10 days ago Mr Major was leading his ministers from their Whitehall bunkers in a rival set of celebrations. The economic green shoots were firmly established, the political tide had turned. The prime minister was back in charge. But yesterday he was forced to acknowledge that the courts rather than his government would have the final say on Maastricht. The cheers this time came from the curious, not-to-say unholy, alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory Euro-sceptic MPs on the social chapter. No one should be surprised by the change. Britain's politicians are more susceptible than most to manic swings in mood. The flavour of the football terrace is nurtured daily by their ritualised clashes in the Commons chamber. But the odds are that just as the euphoria which greeted the 'official' end to the recession was overdone so too will be the gloom which will follow the Maastricht retreat and the expected loss of Newbury. That loss, of course, must not be taken for granted. The lesson from last year's general election is that the consensus can be wrong. No one trusts opinion polls any longer. But holding Newbury after the cataclysms of the past year would be an extraordinary achievement for the prime minister. The 9.2 per cent swing required by the Liberal Democrats is well within the range of their by-election victories during the last parliament. The government is as unpopular as it has ever been. Newbury is a prosperous constituency but it has been as badly hit as any by the recession. Against that background a decision by the voters that it was too risky even in a by-election to turn out the Conservatives would carry a chilling message for the opposition parties. If the government can escape even a serious protest now it can do what it likes before the next general election. The temptation for political commentators would be to pack up and go home in the certain knowledge that permanent Conservative government had indeed arrived. So the assumption at Westminster is that by Friday Mr Major's already fragile parliamentary majority will be reduced to 19 and that the Conservatives will lose control of perhaps half-a-dozen or more counties in the local elections. Nor could the natural eloquence of Mr Douglas Hurd's speech in the Commons hide the fact that the government had been forced into an damaging retreat on the social chapter. Few at Westminster doubt that Maastricht will in the end be ratified. But the courts will now decide when and how. So the fragile confidence of the Tory backbenches has taken another knock. There will be the usual demands at the weekend for inquests, for the government to get a grip. The Liberal Democrats, likely to be the biggest gainers in the local elections, will celebrate their return to the political limelight after a year in the shadows. But what of Mr John Smith's Labour party? It can revel for a day or two in the government's discomfort over Maastricht. Lady Thatcher's planned appearance today to renew her call for a referendum should add to its cheer. Labour, consigned to oblivion in Newbury, might do better than expected in the county elections. But a year after its fourth election defeat it is displaying neither the energy nor the innovation needed to transform its longer-term political fortunes. Lest that judgment is deemed partisan, it was offered by a prominent member of the shadow cabinet. This weekend the party's newly-created policy forum will consider three documents designed to shape their policies on the economy, Europe and the constitution. If there is a single theme it is that the opposition must frame its instinctive trust in the state in terms of its role in liberating the individual. The idea is developed most convincingly by Mr Tony Blair in his introduction to the paper on the constitution. Mr Gordon Brown meanwhile has discarded more of the economic baggage which the party carried during the 1980s. But overall, the documents leave little sense that the opposition is making a decisive break with the past. Nor do they dispel the impression that each attempt by Mr Blair to define its future as a modern social democratic party is being confounded by back-room plotting among trades union barons to preserve their empires. Mr Smith's supporters may have less to cheer than Mr Major's.</p>

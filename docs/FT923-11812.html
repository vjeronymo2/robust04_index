			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / BA's global dream ready for take-off: UK airline's stake in USAir will give it unrivalled access to the biggest air travel market Lord King's 11-year dream of creating the world's first global airline took a step closer to reality yesterday with BA's acquisition of a stake of up to 44 per cent in the sixth biggest US carrier, USAir. The deal follows years of frustration for BA as it tried in vain to establish a bridgehead in North America. A tie-up with United Airlines of the US collapsed in 1989. Another with KLM, the Dutch flag carrier which has a stake in US carrier Northwest, was abandoned early this year. Now BA has done it, and with the largest ever transatlantic stake among big airlines. The deal, it believes, gives it a unique position to take advantage of deregulating markets in Europe and across the Atlantic. And compared with other European airlines, it will now have unrivalled access to the US east coast. On many measures, the price is high. In a complex deal, BA is injecting Dollars 750m (Pounds 395m) into USAir in return for convertible preference shares that, if converted in five years, could give it up to 44 per cent of the equity capital of the airline. USAir has other holders of convertible shares and if they converted too, BA's stake would be diluted to 32 per cent. BA has the right to maintain its 44 per cent by paying up to another Dollars 600m. A possible total outlay of Dollars 1.35bn over several years compares with the Dollars 600m of ordinary shares and Dollars 600m of preferred shares USAir has outstanding. Furthermore, BA cannot buy 44 per cent of shareholder voting rights. US regulations limit foreign control of domestic airlines to 25 per cent. As foreigners currently hold about 4 per cent, BA's voting power will initially be about 21 per cent. In return, BA will earn a return of 7 per cent on the convertibles. BA says this will cover the costs of the investment which will come from its own resources. It will also appoint four of USAir's board of 16 directors as well as another two non-executive directors who will sit on the boards of both companies. Perhaps more importantly, the tie-up gives BA access to the US air travel market, which accounts for some 40 per cent of global air traffic. This will help BA stave off challenges from smaller low-cost operators such as Virgin which fly to only a handful of US cities. A combined BA and USAir will be able to sell through tickets to 204 US cities, compared with BA's current 19. BA also plans to exploit economies of scale in areas such as marketing, maintenance and purchasing. This will help it challenge the position of the world's biggest airlines, United and American, which last year took over some of the transatlantic routes of the now defunct Pan Am and TWA. The size, and the financial and marketing strength of United and American have given each 15 per cent of the north Atlantic market, a figure which is rising steadily. The combined USAir and BA will carry more passengers than any other airline, but it will still be smaller than American and United on the more usual measure of airline size - revenue passenger kilometres - which take into account the distance travelled by each passenger. For USAir, the deal is even more important. The carrier has been suffering from severe problems integrating Piedmont Aviation which it bought for Dollars 1.56bn in 1987. With domestic recession and then the Gulf war, USAir's problems escalated. Domestic traffic growth ground to a halt, and cash-strapped carriers initiated costly fare wars. At the operating level, USAir made Dollars 21.5m profit in 1989, but turned this into a Dollars 501.1m loss in 1990, and a Dollars 173.5m deficit in 1991. With the hefty interest charges added in, the net loss for the same three years was Dollars 63.2m, Dollars 454.4m, and Dollars 305.3m respectively. Long-term debt remained in excess of Dollars 2bn, and in late-1990, USAir suspended dividends on its ordinary shares. USAir said yesterday that the money would initially go towards paying down bank debt, reducing its total debt to equity ratio, on a pro-forma basis, from around 58 per cent to 38 per cent. So why should BA be prepared to pay Dollars 750m for a 32 per cent stake in such a loss-maker? 'We looked at the projected profitability and calculated a fair value,' said Mr Derek Stevens, BA's chief financial officer. He points to USAir's drastic cost cutting: the company has shed more than 7,000 jobs in the past two years, and cut salaries and services. 'The opportunity is for traffic,' said Lord King. 'I don't think it's a gamble. It's an opportunity to reach out and take the airline global.' USAir ranks sixth among US carriers in terms of revenue passenger kilometres flown; it ferried more than 55m passengers last year and employs 45,281 people. It operates 439 jet aircraft, almost twice the size of BA's fleet. A large part of its route network is still to the heavily travelled East Coast. This was augmented last winter, when USAir agreed to operate the former Trump Shuttle which flies between Washington DC-New York-Boston. So the airlines respective routes fit fairly neatly together. USAir is largely a US domestic carrier while BA is strongest on international routes. Both have large Boeing fleets, so shared maintenance and purchasing should be easy to implement. The immediate obstacles could come from the phalanx of regulatory and legal hurdles the deal must overcome before it is finalised. In the US, the airlines may have to convince the departments of Transportation and Justice, over anti-trust rules. In Brussels, the European Commission will cast its eye over the proposed transaction. On an operational level, the combined managements face the issue of New York. British Airways has invested heavily in its base at the city's biggest airport, JFK. USAir, however, is committed to the second airport at La Guardia. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and in sole operational command of the airline since last week's annual meeting, would not forecast potential cost savings. But UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's broker, said the 'combined annual cost savings and extra revenue of Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a year is not an unreasonable target'. Sir Colin conceded that gains were unlikely to outweigh the costs of reorganisation for two years. But then BA has a further three years before it is likely to have to convert its investment into ordinary shares and consolidate USAir's profits or losses into its own. By that time BA will hope the synergy benefits and an economic recovery will have brought USAir back into profit. If this comes true then BA's shareholders will have avoided diluting their earnings and Lord King will receive their thanks. If it does not, he will be safe from their wrath in the semi-retirement of BA's honorary presidency.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] The total exclusion zone of heavy weapons around  Sarajevo should be replicated in the other safe areas, the  British United Nations commander in Bosnia said today.    Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose said he had no intention  of asking the peacekeeping troops to fight a war from  white-painted vehicles but air power could have a use for  protecting UN safe areas.    "I believe the imposition of the total exclusion zone for  heavy weapons around Sarajevo is something that could well be  replicated elsewhere in the safe areas," he said.    Asked if he thought the first UN convoy would get into the  stricken city of Gorazde today in the wake of the new ceasefire  agreement signed at Pale, he replied: "I hope the words of the  Bosnian Serb authorities will now be matched by action."    Gen Rose added: "We have 141 troops who are going to go in  there, including medical staff. And we have got humanitarian  aid convoys as well."    Asked whether he wanted more troops, he said: "Of course we  would have done. We feel that the town is very destroyed.  There will be many people who will need help and sustenance.  There is still some sporadic fighting going on. We shall  certainly need more troops in the future there, but at least we  have made a start."    The accord reached in Pale was important, he said on the BBC  Radio 4 Today programme.    "It does bring about a ceasefire. It allows us to run these  convoys there. It is described as a first step towards some  better arrangement. It is a first step insofar as it is  temporary. It depends upon the willingness of the two parties  not to resume the conflict. I hope it will turn in due course  into a cessation of hostilities which is more permanent."    Gen. Rose said there were now enormous pressures on the  Bosnian Serbs.    "They may have made a tactical gain by capturing most of the  right bank of the River Drena in Gorazde, but their strategic  assessment has been nothing short of disastrous."    He said Gorazde was at the mercy of the Serbs. "There is  nothing we can do to sustain the defences of Gorazde. We did  our best to bring about peace as a peacekeeping force. I am  delighted to say we have at least a signed document with this  ceasefire arrangement well supported by the various measures we  are taking."    Questioned about air strikes, Gen. Rose said: "You have got  to be terribly careful. We are here as a peacekeeping force. I  have got a responsibility for 15,500 young men and women who are  here as peacekeepers. I have no intention of asking them to  fight a war from white-painted vehicles. Their countries did  not send them for that."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Zhu Yunlong, Liu Shun] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The first  group of Palestinian policemen numbering some 150 arrived in the  Gaza Strip at about 03:00 (12:00 GMT) this morning, formally  starting Palestinian self-rule in the strip.    The entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza was in  accordance with an agreement signed between the Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel on implementing  Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's  Jericho area.    The first group of Palestinian police had been scheduled to  come on May 8. But the arrival was delayed because of some  technical problems and lack of adequate coordination between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides.    Before the arrival of the group, Major General Naser Yousef,  commander of the Palestinian National Security Forces, and  Brigadier Yom-Tov Samia, head of the Israeli side of the  coordination committee between the Palestinians and Israelis on  the transfer of authorities in Gaza, met Tuesday [10 May]  afternoon with local and foreign reporters at the Rafah Border  Check Point, the scheduled entrance for the Palestinian  policemen to Gaza from Egypt.    Yousef said, "this is a historic day, the first day on the  road of independence and freedom of the Palestinian people. It  is also the starting of the implementation of the May 4 Cairo  Agreement" between the Palestinians and the Israelis.    He said he believed "we will be capable of building our  relations with our brothers and neighbors with very good spirit.  Good neighborliness will prevail in this area."    Samia, who is also former commander of the Israeli forces in  the Gaza Strip, said he hoped "security people on both sides  will work together to ensure smooth transfer of area camps and  responsibility," adding he believed both sides are ready to make  it as smooth as possible.    In this way, he said, both sides can continue their  missions,  a common mission, to make sure that the people on both sides in  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area will feel safety and "we can  start a new era of prosperity for all the area."    Over the past few days, local Palestinian people expressed  their joy and excitement by turning out to the streets and  gathering at the main road near the Rafah Border Check Point,  some 50 kilometers southwest of Gaza City, to greet the arrival  of the police.    Thousands of people waited for three consecutive days, some  holding flags of the PLO, some singing and dancing, and others  chanting slogans.    A total of some 9,000 Palestinian policemen will be deployed  in Gaza and Jericho.    The PLO and Israel signed a peace accord in Washington on  last September 13, which provides for Palestinian self-rule in  the two areas as a step toward a final resolution of the  Palestinian problem.</p>

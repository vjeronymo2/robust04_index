			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Akhtar Majeed, director of the Centre for </F> Strategic Studies at Aligarh, entitled: "A Nuclear Brahmacharya"]    [Text] The joint US-Russian declaration on nuclear issues,  signed last month in Moscow, is the continuation of the old  Western policy advocating the indefinite and unconditional  extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the present  form. The US and Russia have called upon India and Pakistan to  join a multilateral forum for arms control.    It was obvious at the time of the signing of the NPT that  the  spread of nuclear weapons would ultimately facilitate it for the  sponsors to claim a tremendous success and advocate its  extension. Flaws were pointed out by India then. It is a proof  of the abject failure of the conduct of Indian diplomacy that  while almost all the Indian proposals for nuclear disarmament  have been subsequently accepted by the world community, the  latter has now pleaded with India to accept those proposals!  In South Asia, there is a situation of nuclear asymmetry, with  an advanced nuclear capable China on one side and acquisition of  nuclear weapon capability by Pakistan, on the other. This  asymmetry is not conducive to regional stability. If strategic  deterrence is to be achieved, in view of the on-going missile  proliferation around India, then again, acquisition of nuclear  weapon capability seems the only viable option. There is an  essential universality of nuclear deterrence logic and it is as  true for India and Pakistan as it was for the USA and USSR. If  nuclear deterrence sustained peace in the developed world, even  during the Cold War, it would sustain peace and stability in  South Asia after the Cold War. The objective of the nuclear  policy followed by India and Pakistan is to make certain that  there is no direct nuclear threat without them being able to  retaliate. During the Cold War, each had the strategic support  of a superpower. Now in the absence of earlier assurances there  is a need that can only be fulfilled by an overt nuclear  stability in the region. Since wars in South Asia have mostly  been caused by misconceptions about relative strength, there  would be greater stability once such misconceptions are removed,  generating the logic of deterrence peculiar to nuclear weapons.    It should be obvious to the Government of India that if it  did not change its policy of nuclear abstinence, it would face a  highly inimical asymmetrical predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan. In  fact, our nuclear disarmament effort is a convenient and  self-defeating myth. The continued nuclear brahmacharya  [celibacy] of India is bound to force the rest of South Asia,  China and the USA to re-evaluate their attitude towards India,  and that re-evaluation would not be in our favour. If calculated  meaningful ambiguity is taken for bluff then the force of  deterrence is lost. The tact that the ambiguity was an  emasculated one was evident from the lack of any sufficient  technology effort to use any mythical "bombs in the basement" in  the event of any nuclear attack by, say, Pakistan.    The very talk of `minimum deterrence' highlights our  confused  perception of the dimensions of the nuclear war. Security  involves the capability to absorb the full intensity of a  nuclear attack and the retaliatory ability to inflict  unacceptable damage on the enemy. That is true deterrence and it  is credible only if the enemy understands, not the bland  assurances that we will be able to "retaliate at short notice  when the need arises." Once the nuclear status of India and  Pakistan is understood and acknowledged mutual deterrence would  make it possible for confidence building measures to evolve on a  mutually agreed basis. After possessing a minimum deterrent  capability and survivable delivery system, it would not be  necessary, at least for India, to enter into a nuclear arms  race. Since deterrence would be the objective, and not the  accumulation of a large arsenal, a South Asian nuclear arm race  would not be needed. The proposal of nuclear free South Asia is  not in conformity with the prevailing realities, and what we can  do is to attempt to create a nuclear weapons-safe South Asia.  Mutual arms reductions and confidence building can be attempted  once nuclear stability is reached in South Asia.    There is a deliberate Western policy to project an  exaggerated over-nuclearised scenario in South Asia where  tactical nuclear weapons are integrated even in routine military  exercises. Therefore, a need to maintain `nuclear restraint'  while trying to save the situation through regional arms control  measures [sentence as published]. The Seymor Hersh article, in  the NEW YORKER, was one such plant about events in 1990 that  supposedly almost led to a nuclear war between the two  countries. But this policy has to be viewed in the light of what  happened with the much-publicised Indo-Russian cryogenic engine  deal. More than the concerns about non-proliferation, and  potential uses of the rocket, it was a message to India that it  would be impossible to operate independently of the USA as far  as proliferation is concerned; and it would not be possible for  the Russians to rescue India, like in the past. One flaw in this  approach is the continuing and wishful habit of treating India  and Pakistan at par. Any parity, if it has to be calculated at  all, can only be between India and China. With the prevalence of  the India-Pakistan one, formulations of the Cold War era are  again dominating South Asia.    Closed-door `clubs' and `regimes' intending to impose  unilateral sanctions and restrictions on technology in a  discriminatory manner cannot prevent proliferation. Neither is  this possible only through the arms-reduction approach. The  Missile Technology Control Regime has not been as effective a  deterrent as it is claimed. Pakistan's missile programme has not  suffered, for example. As China pointed out in October 1993,  "conditional moratorium designed to maintain nuclear superiority  while refusing to renounce nuclear deterrence and commit  ourselves to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of  nuclear weapons is of no significance."    There has been talk that while India may not sign the NPT,  it  will unilaterally give an assurance to abide by its provisions.  Obviously, such proposals have not taken into consideration the  ineffectiveness of the International Atomic Energy Agency  verifications as far as clandestine diversions are concerned. We  know too well about Israel, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan and  North Korea.    Since the objective of our nuclear policy is no longer  valid,  continuation with ambivalence would serve no purpose. Merely  reiterating that India would hot be the first one to introduce  nuclear weapons in the region cannot take the place of a  definite policy option. That is possible if steps are taken to  trade off costly conventional forces for nuclear capability  while simultaneously pursuing regional confidence building  measures. This would not only lower the risk factors but reduce  the danger of the use of nuclear weapons, by design or accident.</p>

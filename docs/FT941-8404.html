			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: A case of statutory sex discrimination My wife and I are both in the 65-74 age bracket, but, while I have an income above the limit below which I could claim some or all of the age-related married couple's allowance, my wife has a much lower income and could claim all of it. If we elected to transfer the allowance from me to her, could she then claim the age-related married allowance in addition to the basic married allowance? The tax office says she cannot but, for the life of me, I can't see why not. The tax office is right; parliament has forbidden the transfer of anything more than the basic Pounds 1,720. This is explained briefly in the free pamphlet IR121 (Income tax and pensioners). If you object to this piece of statutory sex discrimination, you might like to write to your MP at the House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

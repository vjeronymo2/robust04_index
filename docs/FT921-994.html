			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Year-end buying lifts Nikkei above 20,000 WINDOW dressing ahead of the March fiscal year-end book closing pushed share prices higher, helping the Nikkei average to recover the 20,000 support level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 335.21 to 20,226.78. Selling by companies and investment trusts was noted, as yesterday was the last trading day for contracts to be settled this fiscal year ending March 31. The index fell in the morning to the day's low of 19,813.81. Arbitrage-related buying and bargain hunting by foreign investors subsequently lifted it to the session's high of 20,230.18. Volume grew to 350m shares from 300m, as activity rose on cross-trades by companies wishing to realise profits on shareholdings. Advances outscored declines by 622 to 394, with 140 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rallied 9.23 to 1,448.78, although in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended only 0.85 up at 1,135.62. Traders said steady buying by foreigners and employee share ownership associations offset selling by investment trusts. Market participants also found comfort in buying by arbitrageurs, as concern that futures and arbitrage trading would fall due to the rise in futures commissions, implemented on Monday, had previously prevailed in the market. Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the recent arbitrage buying was prompted by the widening price spread between the futures and cash markets. 'Fears that doubling commissions would depress activity were false,' he added. In spite of the rise in the index, however, brokers said that sentiment remained bearish. Rumours that a leading Japanese broker could announce losses due to tobashi, or window dressing clients' accounts by shifting loss-making investments, circulated in the market. A total of 107 issues set new lows. Financials fell on selling by companies liquidating holdings. Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y40 to Y2,320 and Mitsubishi Bank Y90 to Y2,090. Large-capital issues and high-technology blue chips were higher on bargain hunting by foreign investors. Nippon Steel gained Y10 to Y322 and Hitachi added Y14 at Y786. Matsushita Electric Industrial, however, lost Y20 to Y1,300. Investors were discouraged by reports that the company will post extraordinary losses due to financial problems at its leasing subsidiary. Potential beneficiaries of public works spending were popular. Penta Ocean Construction forged ahead Y39 to Y989 and Nippon Road advanced Y50 to Y1,420. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 111.48 to 21,541.10 in volume of 26.3m shares. Roundup FEATURING weakly in another rather mixed day for Pacific Rim markets were New Zealand, which closed at its lowest level since last December, and Seoul. NEW ZEALAND fell sharply and the NZSE-40 index closed 27.18, or 1.9 per cent, down at 1,411.00 in turnover of NZDollars 16.2m, up from NZDollars 11.5m. Analysts said investors were taking money out of the market to fund new issues which are due in the coming week. Telecom shed 2 cents to NZDollars 2.24, its lowest since being floated last July. Carter Holt Harvey, which went ex-rights, lost 17 cents at NZDollars 2.23. SEOUL dropped following the defeat of the ruling party of President Roh Tae-woo in the general election. The composite index closed 16.30 off at 607.83 in Won361.9bn turnover. HONG KONG was mixed in the absence of corporate news. The Hang Seng index eased just 0.09 to 5,052.23 in turnover of HKDollars 2.28bn (HKDollars 2.47bn). Jardine Matheson's results were released after the close, while Cheung Kong, Hutchison Whampoa and Swire Pacific are all expected to announce results today. HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, dipped 50 cents more to HKDollars 40.75 after last week's announcement that it plans to merge with Midland Bank. TAIWAN saw profit-taking. The weighted index fell 68.85, or 1.4 per cent, to 4,721.25 in turnover of TDollars 17bn (TDollars 20.6bn). SINGAPORE was lifted by selective buying of blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 9.88 to 1,449.66 in volume of 37m shares. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index eased 2.50 to 607.40 on profit-taking in turnover of MDollars 116m. Pacific Chemical climbed MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 20.50 on rumours that a major shareholder was negotiating to sell its stake. BOMBAY rose for the second consecutive day, leaving the BSE index 132.59, or 3.6 per cent, ahead at 3,802.17. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index declined 1.4 to 1,582.0 amid light turnover of ADollars 188m.</p>

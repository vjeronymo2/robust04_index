[Gembicky] Minister Kanis, did any specific opportunities  for the development of bilateral relations between the Slovak  Army and the Israeli Army arise from your talks?    [Kanis] I exchanged information with Prime Minister and  Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin about the international political  position of our countries, the nature of our military doctrines,  and our present security policies. We familiarized ourselves  with the structures of the Israeli security system and the  potential of their arms industry and exchanged views on the  possibilities of cooperation. Minister of Foreign Affairs  Shim'on Peres briefed us about Israeli-Palestinian talks and  Israel's relations with Syria. The visit, which followed up on  the January visit to Israel by Jozef Moravcik, then chief of our  diplomacy, has enabled closer contacts between our ministries of  defense. Given the fact that Jozef Moravcik is now prime  minister, one can speak about a certain continuity.    [Gembicky] The Israeli defense system and the Israeli  defense industry are among the best in the world. Your  entourage included experts from the military industry. In what  areas can we effectively cooperate with the Israeli military and  strategic branches?    [Kanis] We apply two criteria in building the Army of the  Slovak Republic: cost-efficiency, which must be commensurate  with our economic potential, and our Army's adequate military  and strategic effectiveness, which must correspond to the  principles of defense sufficiency and the need for rational  deterrence. While visiting several arms firms, our military  experts had an opportunity to assess the standard of the  production of arms and arms systems in Israel. We exchanged  ideas and offers regarding cooperation and possible trade and  will decide on further steps in coordination with military  experts and entrepreneurs. The possibility of cooperation in  and the purchase of the technology of electronic systems for the  Air Force looks promising.    [Gembicky] Minister Kanis, were the possibilities of  exporting Slovak weapons to Israel discussed as well?    [Kanis] Even this possibility is opening up in specific  offers [sentence as published].    [Gembicky] How would you assess the results of your  three-day visit?    [Kanis] I was honored to be able to bestow Milan Rastislav  Stefanik medals, first grade, upon several Israeli citizens of  Slovak origin for their participation in antifascist resistance  and in the Slovak National Uprising. I communicated to leading  Israeli politicians an invitation to the 50th anniversary of the  Slovak National Uprising, to which our president has also  invited U.S. President Bill Clinton.    [Gembicky] The Hebron massacre has led to the suspension by  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] of  Israeli-Palestinian talks on the creation of Palestinian  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. How did your partners assess the  chances of a speedy resumption of these talks?    [Kanis] Minister Shim'on Peres told me yesterday morning  that it would take a month or a month and a half before the  treaty with the PLO is signed.</p>

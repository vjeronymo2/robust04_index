			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Turkmenistan has embarked on the road of  independence and intends in no way to deviate from it, said  President Saparmurad Niyazov, 54, speaking with a group of  Moscow journalists.    We are building a democratic state which, however, takes  into  account specific national features, he said. The main task of  the country's leadership, he said, is formulated in the slogan  "A Decade of Stability," which began in 1992.    Niyazov said that the economic reforms carried out in  Turkmenistan, do not infringe upon the interests of the majority  of the population--the country's citizens use free running  water, gas, electric energy. In addition, each citizen of the  country has the right for 146 kilos of free flour a year.    The president assured journalists that Turkmenistan enjoys  freedom of speech and human rights are observed. However, he  said, this should not run counter to the moral norms of the  nation and centuries-old traditions. Niyazov voiced complaints  to some news media in Russia, for example, to television, where  on show is mainly pornography and sex.    Answering the question of what he thinks about worshipping  of  his personality in Turkmenistan, he said that in the country  there is no such notion as personality cult. I do not consider  myself a special person. I am a human being like all others.    Niyazov claims that since 1985 when he came to power, there  was not a single case of prosecuting dissidents. We have no  political prisoners, he said.    He said that the country needs a leader who, together will  like minded people, may take up courage to solve historic tasks.  We are going through a very difficult period in our history,  said Niyazov.    He admitted that he was not satisfied with the admiring  attitude to his personality. He said that he asked parliament  not to celebrate his birthday for the period of his presidency  at least.    Honestly, this is a burden for me. I believe we shall come  to think about this again. Nevertheless, if there is no  imposition, I do not see reasons for a ban for such treatment to  the state leader, said Niyazov.    According to the Turkmen leader, he is tolerant to criticism  if it refers to his activities. I do not like biassed personal  criticism, said the president.</p>

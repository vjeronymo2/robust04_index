			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt After today's unification holiday, the market will increasingly be influenced by opinion polls ahead of the federal election on October 16. UBS expects a continuation of the volatility in the stock market to be combined with a sideways trend in the run up to the polls. On the corporate front, Allianz holds its annual meeting on Wednesday while Thursday and Friday bring the annual meeting of the chemical association. UBS says that volume in the domestic chemical sector was up 4 per cent in the first half of this year. Given that the usual seasonal downturn in the third quarter did not happen this year, positive indications might be given for the last quarter of 1994. August industrial production and manufacturing order figures are due on Thursday. James Capel expects a 0.6 per cent rise in industrial production, noting that recent rises in industrial orders point to continuing strength in production. It forecasts a 0.5 per cent increase in overall manufacturing orders, noting that, encouragingly for the sustainability of the recovery, the improvement in orders was increasingly spreading to the domestic side.</p>

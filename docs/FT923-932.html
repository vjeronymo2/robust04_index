			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Dublin, Lisbon tighten currency curbs IRELAND and Portugal yesterday introduced new foreign exchange controls to protect their fragile currencies, although signs emerged that some of the recent pressures in the European exchange rate mechanism were petering out. While the punt and the escudo both gained ground during the day against the D-Mark, the battle to prop up the French franc appeared to be shifting in favour of the combined forces of the Bank of France and the German Bundesbank. This was signalled by the franc gaining about 1 centime on the day against the D-Mark, to close comfortably above its ERM floor, partly in response to recent heavy action by the two central banks in buying francs for D-Marks. But the peseta was a notable weak performer, closing last night in London near its ERM floor after a large fall on the Madrid stock market sparked by Wednesday's introduction of exchange controls. That move, even though it promised some respite for the beleaguered Spanish currency, was viewed as negative for the Spanish economy by many investors. The Irish Central Bank yesterday tightened its foreign exchange controls to reduce pressure on the punt, which has weakened along with several other currencies as investors switched funds into the D-Mark. This move led to Irish money market rates moving up by 7.25 percentage points against the base rate, while Portugal also introduced currency controls in an effort to stop selling of the escudo. In the past 10 days, the pressures in the ERM have forced the suspension from the mechanism of the pound and the lira, while the peseta has been devalued by 5 per cent against the other eight currencies in the grid. After slipping recently against the D-Mark the franc closed last night in London at FFr3.4010, above its floor of FFr3.4305. But the peseta finished at Pta70 to the D-Mark, perilously near its floor of Pta72.62. In Madrid, the stockmarket fell to its lowest level in more than five years yesterday and bond yields rose to historic highs as investors sold domestic equities and debt following Wednesday's introduction of exchange controls by the Bank of Spain. 'There is a clear sentiment, lead by foreigners, to get out of Spain. A lot of confidence has been killed,' said Mr Alvaro Villacieros, chief of trading at Iberagentes, the Madrid securities arm of Credit Lyonnais. The Spanish authorities say the exchange control measures are aimed solely at currency speculators and that they are purely temporary and will be lifted as soon as the current exchange rate turmoil subsides. In Washington, the recent moves in Europe to impose currency controls were sharply criticised by Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He urged their removal as soon as possible. 'Controls are a palliative of temporary effect only. Any step back to real controls is a regressive step,' Mr Camdessus said.</p>

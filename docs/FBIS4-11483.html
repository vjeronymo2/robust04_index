			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia and  Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos stated that  the agreements reached during the GATT Uruguay Round represent a  significant step toward the consolidation of the multilateral  open trade system.    In a joint declaration issued in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, they asserted that the implementation of the free  trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico  opens the possibility of a tighter relationship between the  North, Central, and South American and Caribbean countries.    They also noted that the regional integration programs'  achievements of the past four years give a new dynamic to the  processes that link the economies of our region. A similar  dynamic has generated a series of bilateral agreements between  the Latin American countries, among which is that signed by the  governments of Chile and Colombia in late 1993.    The declaration later states that the Chilean and Colombian  Governments have expressed their resolute political will to make  every possible effort to use this opportunity to materialize the  desire for Latin American integration and that it spread to the  rest of the hemisphere.    In the Chilean and Colombian economy ministers' opinion,  free  access to the markets will promote competition and, hence, the  efficient development of their respective economies.    Finally, the two ministers urged the ECLA [Economic  Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean] to decidedly  support the integration efforts with its technical and  analytical expertise.</p>

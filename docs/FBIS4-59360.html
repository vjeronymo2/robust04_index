			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 May (MENA)--Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah left Cairo this evening for Amman after  a two-day visit to Cairo during which he met President Husni  Mubarak. In a predeparture statement he said he conveyed to  President Mubarak a verbal message from Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih in which he explained the ongoing events in  Yemen. He said that what is happening in Yemen is a  confrontation of the remnants of renegades and secessionists, a  confrontation with the participation of all the people, led by  their armed forces, which are loyal to constitutional  legitimacy. He noted that the new Yemeni defense minister who  took the constitutional oath yesterday hails from the southern  governorates as does the new naval forces commander.    Basindwah said he believed that the situation in Yemen has  been decided and that what is going on will last no more than a  day or two at most. He noted that during his meeting with  President Mubarak he sensed considerable understanding, noting  that the Yemeni people appreciate President Mubarak's great  concern for Yemen's security and safety. He noted that he is  going to Amman to convey a message to King Husayn of Jordan.  His Jordan trip is part of a tour of Arab countries to convey  verbal messages from President Salih to Arab leaders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] Maglaj is today again the target of the aggressor's  artillery weapons. The criminals continue to employ their  surprise tactic of sudden shelling, usually at times when the  population is most relaxed. Their sole objective is to kill as  many innocent people as possible. A general alarm signal was  sounded at 1300 [1200 GMT] because some 10 120-mm mortar shells  were launched at the town center in a relatively short period.  The shelling of civilian targets is still in progress. We do  not have any information on the killed and wounded, but we do  know for certain that there are casualties.</p>

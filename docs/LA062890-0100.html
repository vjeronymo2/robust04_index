			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT IN NUCLEAR WASTE REGULATION PLANNED  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission Wednesday unveiled plans for systematically  exempting very low-level radioactive materials from regulatory control, opening  the possibility of recycling such waste, disposing of it in landfills or  reusing nuclear sites with some residual contamination.  </P> <P> Commission Chairman Kenneth M. Carr outlined the proposed policy with a promise  that every exemption would receive sharp scrutiny, but it was greeted by an  angry reaction from anti-nuclear activists, including a call for Congress to  seek the removal of all five members of the commission.  </P> <P> Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) announced that his Interior and Insular Affairs  subcommittee on energy and the environment would call commission members to  testify at a hearing on the proposal July 27.  </P> <P> By some estimates, the low-level waste generated by nuclear power plants,  research institutions and medical facilities accounts for 30% of the material  regulated by the NRC. It includes such things as cleaning rags and clothing  discarded by workers at nuclear power plants, tracers used in diagnostic tests  in medical centers and bedding from animal cages in research laboratories.  </P> <P> The heart of the new policy is a proposal to consider declaring materials  "below regulatory interest" when they expose small numbers of people to a  radiation dose of less than 10 millirem per year, or mass exposure of one-tenth  of a millirem per year.  </P> <P> By comparison, NRC officials pointed out, the average American receives a  natural exposure of about 300 millirem per year -- 30 millirem from cosmic  radiation, 40 millirem from food and drink, 30 millirem from soils and building  materials and 200 millirem from the air, which contains radioactive radon.  </P> <P> Until now, the NRC has considered applications for exemptions on a case-by-case  basis, and Carr said that the new policy is intended not only to allow  authorities to concentrate on regulating materials posing a more significant  hazard but to assure more consistent protection of health and safety.  </P> <P> The proposal will soon be scheduled for public hearings at NRC regional offices  in California, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas.  </P> <P> Robert M. Bernero, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and  Safeguards, said that within the professional staff designing the proposal  "there has been disagreement, even heated disagreement, and there is to this  day."  </P> <P> But he said the debate has centered not on the wisdom of adopting a "below  regulatory interest" policy but upon the exposure limits.  </P> <P> Hypothetically, the NRC estimated, lifetime exposure at the limits set in the  proposal would be expected to cause five annual cancer deaths per 100,000  people.  </P> <P> Bernero said he had presented the proposal to officials of the Environmental  Protection Agency Tuesday, but the agency offered no reaction.  </P> <P> Carr noted that there are already a number of consumer products, such as  watches with tritium-illuminated dials, on the market.  </P> <P> "We must each realize," he said, "that when we buy our smoke detectors or  choose to take a cross-country flight, we are already making decisions about  radiation that are like 'below regulatory concern.' There is no human endeavor  that involves a zero level of risk, and radiation is no exception. But the  levels of radiation we are talking about here, while not zero, are exceedingly  small."  </P> <P> Opponents of the proposal criticized it as an invitation to unacceptable health  risks and as a sop to the nuclear industry.  </P></p>

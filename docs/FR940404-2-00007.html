			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Significant cultural resources identified during implementation will be avoided or otherwise preserved in place to the fullest practical extent. If significant cultural resources cannot be avoided or preserved, pertinent information will be recovered before construction. If there is a significant cultural resources discovery during construction appropriate notice will be made by SCS to the State Historic Preservation Officer and the National Park Service. Consultation and coordination have been, and will continue to be, used to ensure the provisions of section 106 of Public Law 89&hyph;665 have been met and to include provisions of Public Law 89&hyph;523, as amended by Public Law 93&hyph;291. The SCS will take action as prescribed in SCS General Manual, section 420, part 401, to protect or recover any significant cultural resources discovered during construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No threatened or endangered species in the watershed will be affected by the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the primary objectives of the project is to improve water quality. Sediment input to Little Paint Creek will be decreased by 16,070 tons or 72 percent. Land treatment practices will reduce loss of soil attached nutrients to the stream system, thereby reducing stream enrichment and conserving nutrients for plant production. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fish and wildlife habitats may be temporarily disturbed in some part of the 880 acres of cropland, grassland, and forestland during installation of land treatment practices, but they will be restored to at least their previous value within one growing season. The Little Paint Creek stream system will be more suitable for species sensitive to sediment concentrations. More suitable cover will be provided for upland wildlife by land treatment measures, such as pasture planting, tree planting, terraces, conservation tillage and timber stand improvement. The value of woodland habitat will increase with installation of project measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No wilderness areas are in the watershed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scenic values will be complemented with the diversity added to the dairy farm landscape by conservation land treatment measures. During installation of the proposed measures, scenic values will be temporarily decreased at specific locations in the watershed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installations except for minor inconveniences to local residents during construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The planned action is the most practical means of improving water quality for the stream, protecting the watershed, stabilizing the eroding lands, and controlling animal waste. Because no significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of the measures, no other alternatives, other than the no project one, were considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consultation_Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for Federal Assistance in February 1989. The Governor and Iowa Division of Soil Conservation were also notified of the application for Federal assistance. Agencies were again notified when planning was authorized in August, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scoping meetings were held in January 1989, March 1992, and March 1993, and interdisciplinary consultations were used in all cases. Three Federal agencies (SCS, Forest Service, and Fish &amp; Wildlife Service) two State agencies (Department of Natural Resources and Division of soil Conservation), two county agencies, and several local groups were involved in part or all of the scoping and plannning processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific consultation was conducted with the State Historic Preservation Officer concerning cultural resources in the watershed. Comments from the State Historic Preservation Officer were used in the development of this plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental assessment was transmitted to all participating and interested agencies, groups, and individuals for review and comment in December 1993. Public meetings were held throughout the planning process to keep all interested parties informed of the study progress and to obtain public input to the plan and environmental evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency consultation and public participation to date have shown no unresolved conflicts with the implementation of the selected plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. Therefore, based on the above findings, I have determined that an environmental impact statement for the Little Paint Creek Watershed Plan is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Leroy Brown, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting State Conservationist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7978 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;16&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

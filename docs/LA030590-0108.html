			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA, COSTA MESA, BREA GIRLS OPEN AT HOME  </P> <P> Kevin Kiernan, La Quinta High School girls' basketball coach, had some advice  for Rancho Alamitos assistant Eric Hamamoto as they stood outside the Southern  Section office Sunday examining the Southern California Regional basketball  pairings.  </P> <P> "Go to the Sizzler.  </P> <P> It's worked for us twice," said Kiernan, whose La Quinta team won its first  Southern Section title Friday night.  </P> <P> It's that time of year when coaches try to wear the same shirt that got them  through the Southern Section tournament. Superstition is in the air.  </P> <P> The Aztecs went to the restaurant before their victory on the road against Palm  Desert in the semifinals and before defeating West Torrance in the 4-A final at  Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> For the time being, La Quinta doesn't have to worry about playing on the road  again. The Aztecs (27-2) will be at home for Tuesday night's opening-round  Division II game against Sanger (22-11), as will Costa Mesa and Brea-Olinda in  the Division III playoffs.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos, runner-up to Costa Mesa in 3-A, travels to LeMoore (20-7) for  its first game.  </P> <P> The Mustangs have the task of playing in the same division as the state's No. 1  team, Brea-Olinda. Brea (30-0) will play host to San Diego Lincoln (14-7).  </P> <P> Costa Mesa is in the lower half of the draw away from top-seeded Brea-Olinda.  However, if the Mustangs get past Selma (14-10) in the first round, they most  likely would face Palos Verdes, the 3-AA runner-up.  </P> <P> "Obviously I would like to have had Palos Verdes, Rancho Alamitos and Brea all  in the above bracket, but this is the way I thought it would be," Costa Mesa  Coach Jim Weeks said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAND REMEMBRANCES  </P> <P> I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed reading about Jersey and how  much I enjoyed the aesthetics of the page itself. I particularly liked the  personal touch Payne gave to his story. How nice it is to begin to get to know  people as well as the places. With his parting message of good deeds coming  back many years hence, a tear actually came to my eye.  </P> <P> PAT LESAVOY  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "wk": "Kolodko Visits Bankers"] </F>   [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko has  ambitious plans, and he is counting on banks to be his allies in  the implementation of those plans. He spoke about what he wants  to achieve while addressing bankers yesterday at the end of a  conference devoted to developing the system of banking law in  Central and East Europe.    "There will be no replacement of personnel in banks, and the  government has no intentions of exerting such pressures,"  Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko assured bankers yesterday. A  few days earlier, there were press reports that the government  would replace governing boards in banks so as to make them  support the government's economic policies more vigorously.    "I would like banks to be our allies in mobilizing the  people  to save more money," Kolodko said yesterday. The minister also  denied rumors about plans to introduce taxes on savings and  securities.    Kolodko repeated once again that, over the past five years,  "one could have achieved more in the economy, and at a lower  cost." He did not hear a farewell speech by Ian Hume, a World  Bank representative in Poland since 1990, who said: "You can be  proud of your achievements." Hume, who is ending his mission to  Poland, now plans to trumpet our economic successes around the  world.    The new finance minister presented his plans to the bankers.  He believes he will bring down inflation (to less than 10  percent in 1997) and the budget deficit (from 4.1 percent of the  GDP to 2 percent), as well as the unemployment level. In  Kolodko's view, the government's economic policies will be "more  socially sensitive."    Kolodko also announced that, through privatization, he will  settle the issue of Poland's foreign debts: Investors will be  able to buy Polish debts and then exchange them for shares of  companies subject to privatization.    "We have a very good privatization program, but we also need  to take care of higher budget revenues," Kolodko said. In his  view, revenue from privatization was not too high over the past  four years--that is, in the range of about 0.37 percent of the  GDP. According to his calculations, the budget lost three times  as much.    The minister promised that, in the immediate future, he will  present detailed proposals and instruments with which he intends  to achieve these ambitious plans.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Harland and Wolff cuts loss but disappointed with result Losses at Harland and Wolff Holdings, the Belfast shipbuilding company, were cut from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.65m pre-tax for the year to end-December. Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipowner who is Harland's main shareholder and company chairman, described the results as 'disappointing'. The company, which was completely reorganised into self-contained business divisions after privatisation in 1989, said the 1993 deficit included a charge of Pounds 4.1m for foreseeable losses on contracts which were in hand at the year end. With the exception of the holding company, Harland and Wolff Technical Services and the wholly-owned Trassey Shipping, operations in all companies resulted in losses. Harland executives said they were scouring the world for new business as the order book dwindled. Mr Per Neilsen, chief executive, said that during 1993 more than 80 per cent of all operating time in the main shipbuilding company was spent on work on two ships being built to a new Harland and Wolff design, and all development costs were charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. He added: 'Furthermore several new processes were implemented, some of which need further refining in 1994 having failed as yet to meet expectations. 'As a result, total productivity did not improve to the extent expected, which has increased pressure on the company to reduce costs more speedily in order to counter-measure the fall in intervention aid and the declining prices for ships since 1991.' With short term demand weak and little scope for optimism this year Mr Neilsen warned of the need to improve productivity rapidly.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Active arbitrage trading was the main feature in stock index futures in a session which saw the near month contract attempt to break through the 3,200 level, writes Joel Kibazo. After opening at 3,192, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 advanced to 3,198 on active buying from independents (locals) in the first hour of trading. A setback in the bond markets brought sellers to the fore and September went into decline, falling to below its fair value premium to cash in the late morning. Dealers took the opportunity of weakness in the contract to arbitrage with the cash market, with many of the deals taking the form of cheap buying of the contract to sell stock. This in turn led the cash market lower. September fell to a low of 3,157 after lunch before steadying with the tentative start to trading on Wall Street. It closed at 3,174, down 11 points on its previous close and at parity with its fair value premium to cash of about 10 points. Volume at 11,366 was a significant improvement on Monday's level. There was little change in turnover in the traded options, where 26,169 lots were dealt, just shy of Monday's closing total. Some 11,126 lots were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and Hanson led the way among the stock options with closing volume of 2,717 contracts.</p>

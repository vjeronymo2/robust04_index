			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (9): France Telecom enters the real world - The unchaining of a State monopoly ONLY a few years ago, France Telecom was a cosily protected monopoly telecommunications operator which never had to worry about international competition. Today, 18 months after being turned from a government department into a semi-autonomous state-owned establishment, France Telecom is on the offensive, breaking with its old image as one of the few leading telecommunications operators with only limited international interests. France Telecom is now in the forefront of a trend by the west's telecommunication monopolies to seek international partnerships, to compete against each other in foreign markets and to provide services outside their home bases. The world's fifth largest telecommunications operator has in the past year made more foreign alliances than ever before since its creation in the early 19th century to run a telegraph service for Louis Philippe. It struck a landmark accord in March with Deutsche Telekom to form a joint venture, Eunetcom, to provide worldwide telecommunications services for international companies. It is a serious competitor to Syncordia, a similar group being set up by British Telecom. Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, described it as an important contribution to defeating British Telecom's ambitions to be 'the only European operator that counts on the world scene at the end of the decade'. The Franco-German group will be open to other partners, including British Telecom, though the original partners would always be central, he said. France Telecom has not been afraid, meanwhile, to challenge British Telecom on the UK operator's home turf. The French group created a stir early last year when it launched Transpac Network Services in the UK to operate private telecommunications networks - like Eunetcom - for large companies. It was the first time that a national telecommunications operator from one European country had decided to compete in the fixed networks of another. In a smaller UK deal, France Telecom teamed up with the Swedish national telecommunications operator to take a 25 per cent stake in Ram Mobile Data, a British company which offers data transmission by mobile telephone. France Telecom says this is an exploratory investment, to give it a ringside seat at the early development of what may be an important market, similar to the 10 per cent stake it took in Phonepoint, the UK operator of pocket telephones. Across the Atlantic, France Telecom has formed a joint venture with US West, one of the seven regional Bell telephone companies, to sell mass market electronic information services. This will be similar to France Telecom's Minitel videotext system, the world's largest, whereby subscribers use a small computer box, plugged into a telephone line, to read information, send messages and shop. Further afield, it has over the past year taken stakes in Telmex, the privatised Mexican telecommunications operator, and participated in a takeover of Argentina's northern networks, to gain an entree into what will be fast-developing markets, ripe for modernisation. A similar strategy was behind its first two deals in eastern Europe, to open a mobile phone network in Poland, with Ameritech, one the US regional operators, and to help set up a paging system in Czechoslovakia. If France Telecom has been busy abroad, it has also continued to be active at home, where it is continuing to enlarge its networks, to develop new services and to work on the few areas where it lags behind international competition, such as mobile phones and cable television. Turnover rose by 7 per cent to FFr115bn last year, on which France Telecom made a pre-tax profit of FFr16bn. However, that dropped to a mere FFr1.6bn net after the FFr14.5bn annual levy which the state charges France Telecom. The levy has for long been a bone of contention between the operator and the government and will disappear at the end of next year, when the group will start to pay normal corporate tax. This would have added an estimated FFr6bn to net profits last year. As in previous years, last year's sales expansion was led by a strong growth in business traffic. Facsimile machine use rose by 50 per cent, while computer data transmission was up by 12 per cent. The number of lines rose last year from 28m to just over 29.1m, of which 80 per cent are now connected to digital exchanges, giving France one of the highest levels of digitalisation. This modernisation of what was 20 years ago one of Europe's worst telecommunications services has permitted a steady improvement in quality. On average, a private subscriber can now expect a fault once every 11 years, while the likelihood of finding a call box out of order is seven in 1,000. Digitalisation has also permitted a fast expansion over the past year in the number of subscribers to Numeris, the integrated services digital network which allows voice, data and pictures to be piped down the same line. Numeris had 150,000 subscribers nationwide by the end of last year, six times more than in 1990. Minitel, meanwhile, has continued its relentless growth, with a 7 per cent rise in the number of terminals to 6m. French citizens spent a combined total of more than 105m hours last year tapping away at their Minitel keyboards, making use of more than 15,000 services. By far the most popular of these is the electronic telephone directory, with the others ranging from databases, to weather and traffic reports and home banking. The project, launched 11 years ago, in part owes its fast growth to France Telecom's controversial policy of giving away the most basic of its terminals. This has been criticised by the Cour des Comptes, the government's financial watchdog, as a waste of money. A recent audit by Coopers and Lybrand for France Telecom disagrees, pointing out that Minitel will have made a FFr4.3bn profit in the 16 years to 2000, if the extra traffic it generates is included. Minitel has had to face one small blot on its reputation over the past year, the continued popularity of erotic message services. Some of these have become so pornographic that the government has imposed a 50 per cent turnover tax to penalise the worst offenders and France Telecom even closed one service. One of the operator's weak areas continues to be portable telephones, the use of which is still proportionately one quarter of that in Britain. Here France Telecom is staking everything on the future generation of Groupe System Mobile (GSM) digital mobile phones, to enter service in Paris and Lyon from July 1 and a complementary network of mass-market pocket phones, nattily named Bi-Bop, now on trial in Strasbourg. The two existing analogue mobile networks, France Telecom's Radiocom 2000 and SFR, its private sector competitor, have 375,000 subscribers between them, only 25,000 short of total capacity. Cable television is the other weak area, where subscriptions are running way below break-even, in spite of a huge investment by France Telecom. By the end of March, there were a mere 857,000 cable subscribers out of the nearly 4m households equipped with cable points. Part of the problem, competition between cabled and conventional television stations, is out of France Telecom's control. Nevertheless, it is helping revive the cable system by increasing its share in the financially squeezed cable operators, part of a government plan unveiled in May.</p>

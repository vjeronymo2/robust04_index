			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW GNB BATTERY HAS ITS OWN SPARE  </P> <P> People who habitually leave the headlights on and the jumper cables at home are  target customers for a new battery from GNB Inc. that has a built-in spare.  </P> <P> The Champion Switch combines a conventional 12-volt main battery and a reserve  into a package that will fit about 70% of the cars on the road, GNB said.  </P> <P> If the main battery dies because the lights were left on, the driver can flip a  switch on the battery and start the car using the reserve power, which is good  for 20 engine starts.  </P> <P> The suggested retail price is $109.99, roughly twice the price of conventional  batteries, although some retailer discounting is likely.  </P> <P> The battery goes on sale in Southeastern states in October and elsewhere in in  1990.  </P></p>

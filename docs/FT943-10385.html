			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology: Aids under review The market for HIV and Aids treatments in the six largest developed countries should increase more than five-fold over the next 10 years. The markets in the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK are presently worth Dollars 264m (Pounds 176m) and could rise to over Dollars 1.4bn by 2003, claims a report* by Pharma Strategy Group, a division of IMS Global Services. These markets represent about 75 per cent of the global market for systemic anti-viral drugs for HIV and Aids. Sales would be highest in the US with 43 per cent of the market, followed by Italy (19 per cent) and France (17 per cent). The fastest-growing market would be Japan, up 1,700 per cent, while the slowest would be the UK, up 131 per cent. Market growth would be driven by an increase in duration of treatment which could rise from about three years in 1993 to six years by 2003. In addition, the proportion of HIV-positive individuals without symptoms taking treatment should rise from about 20 per cent to 60 per cent. The report argues that the market, presently dominated by Wellcome's AZT, or Retrovir, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Videx should fragment. This would partly be due to resistance and partly through the introduction of new products, such as protease inhibitors, new reverse transcriptase inhibitors and anti-sense products. In addition, treatment with a single drug would be replaced by combinations of new and existing therapies. It was predicted the rate of growth in the incidence of the disease in the developed world would decline, except in Japan. The market for anti-virals could collapse if vaccines for HIV become a reality, but the report argued this was a remote possibility over the next decade. *Pharmacast Aids/HIV, Pharma Strategy Group, Tel. 071 393 5226.

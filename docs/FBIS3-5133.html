			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Demand for Abolition of the National </F> Security Law"]    [Text] The old issue of repealing the National Security  Law has emerged again to be a matter of great concern, according  to remarks by a senior U.S. Government official. Tom Hubbard,  U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and the  Pacific affairs, said in a speech delivered at a university:  "The ROK has successfully established democracy, and the human  rights situation has considerably improved. The U.S.  Government, however, still hopes the ROK Government will repeal  the National Security Law."    Answering a question regarding this at the National  Assembly,  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the ROK has never been  informed of the U.S. Government's official position in  connection with the demand for abolition of the National  Security Law. I think, however, Mr. Hubbard's remarks reflect  the U.S. Government's intent, in view of the U.S. State  Department's criticism in its annual "Human Rights Report"  released on 31 January pointing out "the National Security Law  is still used to repress the freedom of expression, gathering,  and travel."    The U.S. view elicits our agreement as we have repeatedly  urged the abolition of the National Security Law. Nevertheless,  it is unpleasant that such insistence basically equals  intervention in domestic affairs [naejong kansopsong chujang].  If the government's inflexible negative [pujongjok] position on  repealing this law is still steadfast, I would like to ask the  government if it is willing to officially protest to U.S.  Government. In order to undergo [sohwa] the affront [moyok] to  us by the United States, who we have considered a friendly  nation, our government should review several things coolly.    The government should review, above all, whether the  situation of human rights in the ROK has sufficiently improved  befitting a civilian government. The guarantee of human rights  at the level in Western countries must become our ultimate and  this is what the United States desires. The human rights  situation in our country still lags behind the level we have  tried to restore since the military dictatorial regime. Many  conscientious prisoners are still suffering hardships behind  bars, and the government does not have a deep interest in their  release. This is one of the factors that prove the above. How  can the government explain the inconsistency that it is pushing  ahead with the South-North dialogue and summit talks while  considering North Korea an antistate body [pan kukka tanche]?    The government also needs to closely examine if this  incident  [satae] is a sign of delicate changes [mimyohan pyonhwa] in the  U.S. Government's policy on North Korea. It does not have to  pay attention to the fact that Mr. Hubbard has been the chief  delegate to North Korean-U.S. contacts in New York, or to his  expected role in the forthcoming third round of North  Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The government must remind itself  of the fact that it is the first time a U.S. high-ranking  official has openly mentioned the abolition of the National  Security Law, although the United States has recognized that  this law is being used to repress people's human rights, as  revealed in the annual "Human Rights Report." We now need to  have enough keen insight to understand that the United States  cannot help but make some changes in its policy toward North  Korea to improve relations and to predict what those changes  will be.    It is needless for us to explain again why the National  Security Law -- which, backed by anticommunist ideology, has  been abused as a means of infringing upon human rights -- must  be abolished. I would like to stress again, however, that  various issues can be resolved at the same time upon the  abolition of this law.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Private View: Post-mortem on a bloody century Wise old owl or vengeful vulture? From his perch at the top of the tree, Eric Hobsbawm, the eminent historian and life-long communist, has looked down on the dying carcass of our century and given his verdict. He has broken a self-imposed rule in order to write the history of an era - his own - which started and ended symbolically at Sarajevo. In doing so, he is inviting not only the critical judgment of his peers but the derision of his political opponents. Professor Hobsbawm may be a bird of ill omen but his book Age of Extremes, to be published in three weeks, cannot fail to make an impact at this anxious end of the millennium. It is a panoptic post-mortem of the 'short' 20th century from the outbreak of the first world war to the death of communism, and a sequel to his trilogy covering the 'long' 19th century from the French Revolution to 1914. Hobsbawm himself was born a few months before Lenin's October Revolution. The son of a British father and Austrian mother, he grew up in Vienna and Berlin before moving to England. His name ('it is more systematically mis-spelt than any other') seems to be a corruption of 'Obstbaum' or 'fruit tree'. His political creed is the product of his (non-religious) Jewish descent and of a day in 1933 when, walking home from school in Berlin with his sister, he learned that Hitler had come to power. Age of Extremes is elegantly written, a synthesis stuffed with supporting fact, a dazzling survey taking in everything from particle physics to post-modernist art, from collective farms to supermarket check-outs. It sees the century as a triptych. The first panel depicts a 32-year-long barbaric war punctuated by a slump. The second shows a Golden Age, a 30-year world economic boom engineered out of the preceding catastrophe and guaranteed by nuclear stalemate, a period when human society was utterly transformed. In the third, all is confusion - a landslide of technological advance accompanied by social decay, and the emergence of global forces (financial, demographic, environmental) which democratic governments seem powerless to manage or control. Hobsbawm is an historian of international repute, translated and read widely outside his own land. At home, he is better known for his 'semi-professional' work as a political analyst and his status as guru to the British left wing. His views hindered his promotion at Cambridge, where he was a fellow of King's, and he had his first book turned down on grounds of bias. I met the gaunt intellectual in his study at Hampstead, north London, a room betraying the eclectic mind of a man who collects Moghul miniatures and is also a jazz critic (writing under the name Francis Newton). He discoursed eloquently on the uses of history in our dangerously forgetful age, and the abuses of history by the separatists and nationalists who proliferate in the new world disorder. But now that the academic historian and veteran Marxist have fused, as it were, the first question readers will ask is why they should trust his perspective on the century. 'I stuck to the 19th century for a long time,' Hobsbawm said, 'because for a Marxist - and certainly for a communist - writing anything to do with the Soviet Union after 1917 could not conceivably be done without saying things you knew weren't true. At least, I could have done so as a communist but I would have got into a lot more trouble. So I would say, keep your nose out.' He laughed, lugubriously. Why do you say you would have had to write things which weren't true? 'Well, the official line, as it were, on the Russian revolution was either that Trotsky didn't exist or that he was a member of the British secret service from 1918. There's no way you can do any history that way.' How could you belong to a party which promulgated untruths when you knew them to be untruths? 'Well,' he sighed, with the air of one confronting the inevitable. 'Do you think you choose your parties purely by the official statements made by your leaders? These official statements shouldn't actually be binding on other people. But . . .' You mean you choose your party as you might choose your church? 'You choose a package deal. Bits of the package aren't what you would have chosen.' Was being a communist for you a rational, or an emotional thing? 'Oh, no. I mean from the start it was obviously an emotional and profoundly felt conviction. You felt that the world was going to hell and you felt that world revolution would be the only way of saving it. And you may understand that if you were a teenager in Berlin during the rise of Hitler. 'It wasn't a rational decision to begin with. But it gave me an initial interest in history. One of my schoolmasters said: 'You call yourself a communist, but evidently you don't know anything about it. Kindly go to the school library and read up the communist manifesto and one or two other things and see what you come back with.' 'From that stage, it became much more rational. But the commitment wasn't rational. The commitment was . . . I would almost say religious.' I said: A man will ignore things he knows to be lies for the sake of loyalty . . . 'For the sake of loyalty, or for the sake of, if you like, a larger good. But I mean everyone does this to some extent if they choose a cause or have a cause chosen for them. All my friends working in Bletchley (the code-breaking station in England in the second world war) kept silent for 30 years, even though they knew stuff was being said that was not so.' Did you feel - do you feel - a conflict between your professional life and your political adherence, which involved swallowing a certain amount of rubbish? 'I certainly felt there was a conflict, yes. I did my level best never to actually write stuff myself which I didn't believe in and which spoke lies. There was a conflict, but it didn't affect the things that I wrote about. 'Incidentally, if I may say so, none of this fooled the Russians. Not a single one of my books was ever published in Russia in the Soviet period. Not a single one . . . huh?' He gave an interrogatory grunt. 'In Hungary, yes. In Slovenia, yes. You were supposed to write a straightforward line, and whatever I said did not fit in.' What do you call yourself today, politically? 'I'm on the left and I continue to be profoundly sceptical of capitalism as a system for solving the problems of the world.' I asked what it meant to be a 'Marxist historian'. Hobsbawm said he believed the best way to tackle history was still to study the way human beings collectively earn their living, to understand the social structures and institutions they develop. 'Indeed, far more people today, historians of any kind, use this method without being aware of it than did when I was a student.' It doesn't imply a bias that will infect your writing of history? 'It needn't particularly. In the past, a lot of Marxists were also committed to particular, demanding political organisations. I don't think it's an essential part of the exercise. It would be theoretically possible to make a Marxist analysis and not even be socialist.' Are all historians to be found somewhere on the political spectrum? 'Yes. All serious ones. Unless you are simply a chronicler or compiler of dictionaries.' So the truth will always be to some extent a function of feelings? 'It would be affected by this, yes. And, to this extent, it is impossible to say that what we are coming up with is The Truth. 'It's perfectly possible, for instance, that a historian in 50 years' time will look back and see that the dichotomy under which we have all been operating - a capitalist or a socialist type of economy - is simply a function of the war of religion waged in the 20th century and that it would make at least as much sense to distinguish four, five or six different types.' Truths and facts are not the same thing? 'Truths and facts are not the same thing. I think it is absolutely essential that historians should not go against what can be proved or disproved by evidence. The point is, there are limits to evidence. Either Elvis Presley is dead or he is not . . . what? 'Our own concepts and the way of putting them together don't have the same validity as the facts themselves, the verifiable or falsifiable data. It depend on the questions we ask. Nonetheless - and there is today an enormous consensus among professional historians - one must be against the kind of post-modernist relativism that is going around various parts of the literary and social sciences. 'If there is fiction in history, it is a fiction which is based on fact. It is, if you like, art made up of objets trouves, but the objets have got to be real objects and not inventions.' Hobsbawm has said that most of his conscious life has been devoted to a hope which, plainly, has been disappointed and to a cause which, plainly, has failed. Talking about his book in a lecture at the University of London, where he is emeritus professor of economic and social history, he said: 'There is nothing which can sharpen the historian's mind like defeat.' He went on: 'As the century ends, the world is fuller of defeated thinkers wearing a very wide variety of ideological badges than of triumphant ones. Especially among those old enough to have long memories.' Hobsbawm has the memories, all right. He has certainly suffered the defeats. But if his foresight was poor - and whose was any better? - his hindsight, it must be said, is terrific.</p>

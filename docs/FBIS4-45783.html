			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abram Ioyrysh, doctor of juridical sciences, and </F> Yuriy Rogozhin, candidate of technical sciences, under the  rubric "Ecology": "Russia's Nature Protection Legislation Far  From Perfect: A Problem Which Must Not Be Put Off"]    [Text] Judging crimes guided not by the law but by one's  own concepts of law and justice is a characteristic Russian  feature. But juridical VUZes [higher educational institutions]  do not teach one to judge "by conscience," since this is a  direct path to arbitrary action.    But it is precisely this path which Russian law enforcement  is forced to take when investigating nature protection offenses.  There are several reasons for this. In the former USSR,  essentially there is not a single nature protection law. In 1986  the unlucky managers of the Chernobyl AES were tried not because  an enormous amount of territory was contaminated and removed  from economic use as a result of the accident at the  installation entrusted to them. The directors of the power plant  and the main engineer were convicted of negligence in performing  official duties. With such a definition of their actions, they  could count on amnesty, and that in fact occurred several years  later.    Only in late 1991 was a strictly ecological Law "On  Protecting the Natural Environment" adopted for the first time  in Russia, which by now was free. This law devotes a great deal  of space to altogether new provisions on ecological monitoring,  the ecological expert study, and an economic mechanism for  protecting the environment.    The law moved environment protection from the departmental  level to the level of a global, national, and state-wide problem  with priority status. But the direct effect of the law was  complicated by the vagueness and lack of specificity of some of  its language, which gave room for departmental enactments and  interpretations.    Many of the law's provisions even now need refinement. The  structure of power and government and regional policy have  changed and the very approach to defining ecological safety and  ecological damage has changed. Obviously, certain provisions of  the law, especially the parts dealing with the rights of the  subjects of the Federation, the economic mechanism, and  accountability, should be expanded.    Articles on the ecological expert study are virtually  infeasible in practice because the question of whether experts  who prepare the finding are officials and on some level bear  responsibility for the expert study's results has not been  decided. The articles devoted to the right of citizens to a good  environment are also poorly worded, and as a result judges  cannot apply these articles in practice.    Disputes on the amount of damages caused by military actions  and interterritorial disputes may become unique. The law should  designate a rigid Russian position regarding foreign violators  of the law's articles.    The question arises of what is worse, a bad law or the  complete lack of one. We have already written that for many  years the USSR was the only state in the world which used atomic  energy extensively for both peaceful and military purposes  without legal foundations for doing so. That is precisely how  the lack of even one law regulating the use of atomic energy in  the country can be described. (It is precisely for that reason  that the legislative organs of the former USSR must bear a share  of the blame for the Chernobyl disaster.)    No matter how paradoxical it may seem, the situation with  the  lack of atomic legislation has in fact not changed today. True,  in 1993 the Supreme Soviet adopted three "atomic" laws in the  first reading: "On the Use of Atomic Energy," "On State Policy  on the Handling of Radioactive Waste," and "On the Status of  Territories Contaminated as a Result of Radiation Disasters."  The October events in Moscow and the breakup of the Supreme  Soviet prevented the final adoption of these laws. And the new  Federal Assembly, it seems, is not yet interested in atomic  legislation.    So, legal support of protection of the natural environment  is  clearly unsatisfactory in Russia. What should the law  enforcement organs do in this situation and how should  law-abiding citizens behave?    The simplest thing is to ignore the issue, alluding to the  need to resolve more important problems first. Indeed, we must  not forget about the worsening economy, growing crime, and many  other misfortunes which have befallen poor Russia. That is all  true, but we must not resolve the problems listed one at a time.  They are closely related to one another and they can be resolved  only as a set.    But, on the other hand, we should not step up work on  economic problems on the basis of the old technology. For  following the unfortunate tradition, departments may formulate  laws "to suit themselves," restricting themselves to empty  declarations and not taking the interests of all citizens into  account. For these reasons the State Duma must not transfer the  power of legislative initiative in resolving ecological problems  to executive organs.    But until the paternal lawmakers give us adequate ecology  law, nature protection organs and individual citizens are  permitted to live and act according to their consciences. If it  works out...</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Following more than two weeks of fierce fighting  between the forces of north and south Yemen, the secretary  general of Yemen Socialist Party, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, announced  the formation of an independent state in South Yemen today, May  21.    In the wake of the announcement, al-Bid said: The new  country  will be one according to the present constitution in the north.  He added: Elections will be held in the country within a period  of one year. The news related to the establishment of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen has been published at a time when  the Yemeni Government in Sanaa called for the implementation of  a three-day cease-fire in the civil war in that country late  Friday [20 May].    Meanwhile incoming reports say that the southern forces have  withdrawn from the strategic al-Anad base which has fallen to  the northern forces. Though according to informed sources the  forces of the north are advancing toward Aden, the capital of  the south, but the resistance being put up by the southern  forces will not make it so easy for the northern forces to  capture Aden, the main headquarters of the Socialist Party.    At any rate, Yemen's present situation and its redivision  speak of the fact that with the passage of four years since the  unification of the two northern and southern sectors, in May  1990, the trend adopted by the Yemeni leaders had neither been  logical nor in line with the basic principle of unity. The  Socialist Party's concern over its limited role in running the  country's affairs and the resulting dissension over the division  of power, which surfaced openly after the parliamentary  elections in April last year, laid the foundation for the  present deep differences. This is so because, despite the  reunification of the northern and southern sectors, as the  Congress Party and the Socialist Party were considered opponents  in the past due to their different ideologies, the tension  between them deepened following the weakening of the Socialist  Party after the parliamentary elections -- so much so that  al-Bid stopped taking part in political activities 10 months  ago. In this connection he offered an 18-point plan for running  the country on the basis of a federal system calling for a far  more serious role for the Socialist Party. However considering  it as being a threat against the unity, the Yemeni president  rejected the plan. This led to the deepening of differences and  the fear that the Yemeni crisis may assume regional proportions.  So certain regional countries mediated in the matter and a  reconciliation accord was signed in Amman, but these efforts did  not yield any result. According to political analysts, the two  rival parties had assumed that with the failure of political  efforts military means could have proved effective in reducing  the tension or that it would at least secure the interests of  one of the two sides. But it is war, bloodshed, and the loss of  natural and financial resources that Yemen is currently  witnessing. Further, in view of the fact that unity had been  the goal of the nation and even the state officials, the outcome  of the independence announced by the southerners as the final  solution to the deep ongoing crisis will not encompass the  national will and may plunge Yemen in yet deeper turmoil.</p>

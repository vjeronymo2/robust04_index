			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Expansion for Ben Priest division Copal Casting, part of Benjamin Priest, the engineering group, has acquired Wrexham-based Malpas Machine Tool, which designs and builds special purpose machines and also does machining subcontracting. The price was not disclosed. Mr Mike Barber, Copal's managing director, said it was planned to double Malpas' turnover to about Pounds 1.5m in the next three years through investing in new manufacturing technology. Employment at Malpas will be expanded from 18 to 54 people within three years, helped by a grant from the Welsh Office. Priest was taken over 15 months ago by International Marine, which is part-owned by Ferruzzi of Italy.</p>

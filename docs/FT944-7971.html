			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: David Smith sets sights on Pounds 12m Italian deal David S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office supplies group, has entered an agreement which could see it buy an Italian corrugated board company for an estimated L30bn (Pounds 12m). Smith said it had obtained an option to buy Toscana Ondulati, the family-owned corrugating company which is based near Lucca in Tuscany. Mr James Fraser, Smith's communications manager, said: 'We have always said that we are looking to improve our coverage across Europe on the corrugating front. However, we are not necessarily saying we have to be pan-European in every market.' Toscana Ondulati reported turnover of L27.9bn in 1993 and net assets of L3.3bn.</p>

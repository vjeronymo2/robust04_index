			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Russian Orthodox Church to start bank THE ORTHODOX Church of Russia is setting up a bank in Moscow, with backing from Greek and Cypriot investors. The bank, to be called Orthodox Bank, will be managed by Egnatia Bank, a private Greek concern, under an agreement with the Church's education and training department. It is due to start operating this autumn. The bank's start-up capital will amount to Dollars 10m, to be covered by Greek businessmen based in Greece, the US and Cyprus, rising to Dollars 30m within five years. The church will not contribute to the bank's equity but will provide premises for its offices in Moscow and later in other Russian cities. The Orthodox Church is gradually regaining control of assets which were confiscated under communism. Mr Andreas Boumis, chairman of Egnatia Bank, said the new bank would initially offer wholesale services, catering for the increasing number of Greek companies setting up joint ventures in Russia. 'But we would want to get into retail banking in the rouble market once the currency situation becomes more stable,' he added. Egnatia Bank, established two years ago by a group of northern Greek businessmen, has undertaken to set up a computer system for the new bank and to train its staff.</p>

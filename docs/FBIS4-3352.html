			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday [12 April], Jia Qinglin, secretary of the  provincial party committee and governor, separately attended the  discussion sessions of the Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningde  delegations to listen to their opinions on the government work  report.    At the Xiamen delegation's discussion session, after hearing  the deputies' speeches, Governor Jia Qinglin said: As a Xiamen  deputy, I am pleased with Xiamen's economic achievements, which  have attracted world attention. The party Central Committee,  the State Council, and the provincial party committee, and  government now have attached importance to Xiamen's development.  The Xiamen Special Economic Zone is not just Xiamen's special  zone; it is also the special zone of the whole province and  nation. The governor put forward four suggestions for the  construction of the Xiamen special zone:    1. We should redevelop the special zone's strong points.  The Xiamen special zone should play a "dragon head" role in the  province.    2. We should make flexible use of the free port policy and  should promote the development of undertakings in various fields  of endeavor.    3. We should build the Haicang investment zone on a larger  scale.    4. We should pay attention to the construction of key  development projects, such as airports and highways; run Xiamen  and Jimei Universities well; turn the Overseas Chinese Affairs  Museum into a window for attracting overseas Chinese capital;  and build Gulangyu into an urban district with a high cultural  level and one of Xiamen's major scenic spots, so as to attract  more overseas investment.    The governor also urged Xiamen to make full use of the  legislative power entrusted to it by the state, manage the  special zone according to law, and build itself better.    At the Fuzhou delegation's discussion session, after  listening to the deputies' opinions, the governor said: This  year, stability is of overriding importance. Only when  stability is maintained can our reforms in all fields forge  ahead. Leaders at all levels must concern themselves with the  weal and woe of the masses of people, and must alleviate  contradictions among the people. This year, the provincial  party committee and government are determined to carry out more  investigation and study; adopt realistic measures to solve, in a  down-to-earth manner, some hot-point and difficult problems in  society, economics, and daily life; bring the enthusiasm of  people from all sides concerned into full play; and cherish,  protect, and direct their enthusiasm toward reform, development,  and stability; so as to push foward the cause of reform.</p>

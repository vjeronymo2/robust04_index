			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Archer says share order 'grave error': Labour calls for second opinion on DTI report into Anglia deals Lord Archer, the bestselling author and former Conservative Party deputy chairman, last night said it was a 'grave error' to have placed the orders to buy shares in Anglia Television, which have been the focus of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider dealing. In a statement, his solicitor Lord Mishcon, speaking on his behalf, said: 'It was a grave error when his wife was a director of Anglia to have allowed his name to be associated with the purchase and sale of shares in that company on behalf of a third party.' The statement continued: 'His deepest regret is the embarrassment needlessly caused to Lady Archer in this matter.' Last week the Financial Times disclosed that Lord Archer's orders to buy Anglia shares were the subject of the five-month DTI investigation. Since then, he has refused to make any statements on the record about the affair until last night. Lady Archer said last night from her home that she was standing by her husband: 'I'm still here and I'm staying here,' she said. In response to a a question about whether she intended to resign from the Anglia board, Lady Archer said: 'I'm still on the board.' Anglia, now a subsidiary of MAI, said yesterday that its directors were 'happy to accept that she did not pass on inside information'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided at the end of July not to launch any prosecutions after the completion of the inquiry and after receiving independent legal advice. Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said last night that Lord Archer's statement 'makes it all the more important that we get a second opinion on the DTI report'. Earlier this week, Mr Cook urged Mr Heseltine to pass the DTI report to the Crown Prosecution Service, to ascertain whether the CPS concurred with the DTI's decision to take no further action against Lord Archer. Lord Archer said last night that the facts about the transactions which have been disclosed in the press over the past week had been known to the DTI inspectors. In January, Lord Archer gave stockbrokers Charles Stanley detailed instructions for the purchase of two parcels of Anglia Television shares fewer than four working days before MAI announced a Pounds 292m takeover bid for the television company. He also instructed the brokers to sell the shares on the day the takeover was launched, netting a profit of Pounds 80,000 on the deal. Although the broker had at first assumed that Lord Archer was buying the shares for himself when the first order to buy 25,000 shares was placed on January 13, the novelist gave instructions that they should be registered in the name of his acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib. The following day, Lord Archer bought a second parcel of 25,000 shares for Mr Saib. However, the address given to the broker for all correspondence with Mr Saib was that of Lord Archer's London penthouse overlooking the Thames. When the shares were sold, the Pounds 80,000 cheque for Mr Saib was sent to that address. Lord Archer said last night the DTI must 'be taken to have concluded that this transaction was not carried out with the benefit of any inside information'. The DTI said yesterday it had nothing to add to its statement of July 28, when it said that it was taking 'no further action against any of the parties concerned in the investigation'. New insider trading legislation came into effect as part of the Criminal Justice Act in April. However, because the Anglia transactions were in January, the DTI inspectors examined possible offences under the previous legislation. The legislation was changed after criticism that it was badly worded.</p>

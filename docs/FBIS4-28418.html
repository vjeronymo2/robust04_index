			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting was  held today upon the lapse of 68 years since the June 10  anti-Japanese independence movement.    The movement in 1926 powerfully demonstrated worldwide the  indomitable will and patriotic spirit of the Korean people not  to allow the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and  colonial rule. It dealt a heavy blow at the colonial rule of  the aggressors.    Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central  Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the  Fatherland, said in his report: "Though half a century has  passed since Korea was liberated from the Japanese imperialist  colonial rule, the dignity and sovereignty of the nation is  still ruthlessly trampled upon and the people are denied even  the elementary democratic rights and vital rights in South Korea  under the occupation of the U.S. forces."    Noting that the U.S. imperialists are intentionally  rendering  the situation of the Korean peninsula strained, threatening the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea by inventing "the  suspicion of nuclear arms development by North Korea," the  reporter said:    "The United Nations Security Council issued an unjustifiable  `presidential statement' and is threatening `sanctions.' This  clearly shows what brigandish method the U.S.-bossed imperialist  allied forces are resorting to in an attempt to isolate and  stifle the DPRK."    The reporter charged that the Japanese authorities, far from  apologizing and compensating for the shocking crimes committed  by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the  past, are trying to take economic sanctions against the DPRK and  put military pressure on it.    "The Japanese authorities are accelerating their own nuclear  arms development and nuclear armament, while raising a hue and  cry over our `nuclear issue,' and worse still, perpetrating  vicious acts against our Republic and the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)," he said.    He said that the United States must withdraw its troops of  aggression and nuclear weapons from South Korea and immediately  respond to the proposal of the DPRK for a new peace arrangement.  And he demanded that the Japanese reactionaries refrain from  joining the U.S. imperialists in their plot of a nuclear war  against the Korean people, promptly stop suppression of  Chongnyon, apologize for it and renounce their hostile policy  against the DPRK.    The reporter called on all the Koreans in the North, South  and overseas to rise up as one in the nationwide struggle to  reunify the country through confederacy with the great unity of  the whole nation under the banner of "10-Point Programme of the  Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the  Country", irrespective of ideology, religious belief, political  grouping, class, stratum and property status, thus opening a new  phase of national reunification this year.</p>

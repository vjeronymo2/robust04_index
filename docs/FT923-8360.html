			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BA climbs to Pounds 91m and meets City expectations HEAVY COST cutting helped British Airways achieve a first-quarter recovery in pre-tax profits to Pounds 91m. The comparable figure of Pounds 9m was depressed by the aftermath of the Gulf war. Profits for the opening quarter, to end-June, were in line with analysts' expectations with further growth held back by poor sales of first and business class seats. BA shares fell 8p to 253p. Lord King, chairman, said bookings for the second quarter 'indicated continued strength in demand, though passenger yields would continue to reflect pressures associated with the strength of sterling and depressed premium demand, with the economies of several major markets remaining difficult. 'The airline is on track to achieve its planned Pounds 150m in cost savings in this, the second phase of its three-year gap closure programme.' Last year the programme saved Pounds 265m. Turnover in the first quarter rose to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.26bn), helped by a 15.5 per cent rise in passenger numbers. Most of this recovery was accounted for by growth in economy ticket sales. The passenger load factor - a closely examined industry measure of how full aircraft are - rose from 69.1 per cent to 71.6 per cent. However, the revenue per passenger fell 6.5 per cent, reflecting poor sales of higher priced tickets and increased competition in fares, especially across the North Atlantic. BA generated Pounds 93m in cash after covering financing charges and spending on fixed assets and investments. This helped cut debt to Pounds 991m - down Pounds 181m on the March year-end - and left gearing five percentage points lower at 37 per cent. The interest charge fell from Pounds 35m to Pounds 8m, helped by lower interest rates, the weakening dollar and off-balance sheet financing of aircraft purchases. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were 8.4p, against 1.4p a year earlier. Cargo traffic suffered from the economic recession and excess capacity in the market, said the company. BA increased its cargo capacity by 11.5 per cent over 1991, but the weight of cargo carried fell and revenues were unchanged at Pounds 98m. By contrast, the company increased passenger capacity by 13.1 per cent and saw revenues from scheduled passenger services rise to Pounds 1.13bn from Pounds 1.03bn. See Lex</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Bank Hapoalim set back by farm debt legislation CONTROVERSIAL legislation enforcing the forgiveness of agricultural debt hit another of Israel's banks yesterday when Bank Hapoalim - the country's largest in terms of asset value - reported a 26 per cent fall in 1991 net profits, down to Shk135.7m (Dollars 56.3m) from Shk183m the previous year. The legislation, which requires banks to write off big chunks of the outstanding Shk2bn debt of the Moshavim collective farms, was passed by the Knesset earlier this month. The Bank of Israel has advised commercial banks to make the resulting provisions in their 1991 accounts. Bank Hapoalim, the last of the five leading banks to report, had to double its planned provisions for the agricultural sector to Shk492m, pushing overall provisions up 47 per cent to Shk991m. Although it managed to stay in the black - unlike its chief rival, Bank Leumi - Bank Hapoalim saw a potential significant advance turned into a decline. Return on capital fell to 4.7 per cent from 6.2 per cent the previous year. The bank, controlled by the Histadrut trade union federation but majority-owned by the government, said that in other respects it had improved performance. Financing income, at Shk2.1 bn, was up almost 8 per cent, an improvement attributed to loan portfolio restructuring and improved margins. Non-financing income rose by 11.5 per cent to Shk935m as the bank increased its activities in areas such as brokerage and underwriting. The contribution from subsidiaries and affiliates increased to Shk54m from Shk25m. Total assets were down 2 per cent at Shk84.7bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sa Kaeo -- Six Thais who crossed into the Cambodian  town of Poipet, apparently unaware that the border was  temporarily closed, were arrested by Cambodian soldiers  yesterday. One of the six, who is a soldier, Pvt Damnoen  Kaeodoeng, was freed by his captors and told to fetch 10,000  baht in exchange for the release of the other five.    The five were named as Phaibun Sawatdi, Sanit Hoibunloet,  Sak  Soemphun, Wanyen Phokhamon and Kiat (surname unknown). All work  in Bangkok and had gone home to Sa Kaeo province for Songkran  holidays.    Pvt Damnoen told police the group went to Poipet at 9 a.m.  by  walking across Mahod creek which had dried up. On their way  back to Thailand, they were arrested by Cambodian forces.    Following the incident, Governor Kasem Chaisit ordered  officials to warn Thais not to get close to or cross into  Cambodia because of the safety problem in the wake of increased  fighting inside Cambodia.    In another incident, one Thai villager was robbed by  Cambodian bandits in Tambon Tha Kham of Aranyaprathet early  yesterday. The police said at least three bandits pulled a rope  across the Aranyaprathet-Khlong Namsai border road to trap  passing motorcyclists. Sawant Boonto rode a motorbike past the  site without seeing the rope and was flung off-balance. The  bandits hit him on the head with a rifle butt and stole his bike  and gold necklace.</p>

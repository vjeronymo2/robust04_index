			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Former Defense Minister  Kwon Yong-hae and Former Defense Security Commander Kim To-yun  have been cleared of suspicion in the 6.7 million-U.S.-dollar  arms scam on the basis of their statements, the joint  military-prosecution investigative team said Wednesday.    The team found no evidence of a cover-up or connivance at  the  fraud in its questioning of the two former defense officials  Tuesday night, a team spokesman said.    Kwon told investigators that he first received a report on  the scam from his law officer on July 28, and then from the  defense logistics agency director on Aug. 6, which agreed with  statements given by others, the spokesman said.    Kim said that he did not forward a July 23 report on the  scam  from his man attached to the Defense Ministry to Minister Kwon  because Kwon was supposed to receive the report from his law  officer and the Defense Logistics Agency director, which the  team spokesman said cleared him of the suspicion that he had  hidden the fraud from the defense minister.    There is no evidence that the Defense Ministry leadership  tried to cover up the case, he said, the swindle involved only  French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and his Korean agent, Chu  Kwang-yong.    Not cleared, however, is Yang Kyu-sok, 45, operations  officer  of United Shipping Co., who was arrested on charges of issuing a  phoney bill of lading to Chu in return for a 5 million-won bribe.    Yang is charged with forging a bill of lading issued by  Dutch  shipping firm shipcraft for shipment of 40,000 rounds of 90mm  recoilless rifle ammunition worth 1.3 billion won. On the  strength of this forged shipping document, Chu and fuan withdrew  payment for the non-existent ammunition from the Korea Exchange  Bank's Paris Branch in April 1991.</p>

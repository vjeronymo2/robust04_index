			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / US adviser supported Banesto's president The Bank of Spain dismissed the board of Banco Espanol de Credito less than a day after receiving a letter from its corporate finance adviser, the US bank JP Morgan, expressing confidence in Banesto's president, Mr Mario Conde. A Bank of Spain executive yesterday confirmed that the central bank had received a letter on Monday night, supporting Banesto's management and saying a Dollars 400m (Pounds 271m) convertible bond issue which had been stalled could take place in the new year if market conditions permitted. The letter to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, was signed by Mr Roberto Mendoza, the Morgan vice-chairman who was among Banesto's corporate finance advisers. Mr Mendoza also sat on the board of Banesto, dismissed on Tuesday by the Bank of Spain. The letter hints at strong differences of opinion between Morgan and the central bank over the state of Banesto's finances. Mr Rojo accused Banesto before a parliamentary committee on Thursday of inadequate management controls. Mr Rojo referred to 'deficiencies of information, organisation and control' at Banesto which had led the bank to expand its loan book too rapidly between 1988 and 1991. This contributed, he said, to a Pta500bn (Pounds 2.4bn) overvaluation of the bank's Dollars 61bn (Pounds 41.2bn) assets.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Society defends insolvency practice The leading insolvency trade body yesterday defended the practice by which bankers can appoint as receivers the same firm of accountants they initially hired to investigate a troubled company. Critics - including a company director, two accountancy firms and the Royal Bank of Scotland - have said that there may be a potential conflict of interest in the arrangement and have called for an independent inquiry. The Society of Practitioners of Insolvency (SPI) said a consultation exercise it carried out with the accountancy profession's joint ethics committee two years ago concluded that the 'overwhelming majority' of those asked supported the existing position. However, details from the survey which were submitted to the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year show that 30 per cent believed there was a conflict. The remaining 70 per cent agreed with a carefully-phrased statement in which they were asked whether they agreed that the conflict for investigating accountants was 'perceived rather an actual'. It is believed that one respondent from outside the profession and at least one accountancy firm called for a ban although there was no question soliciting this response. The exercise led to a few minor changes in ethical guidance on insolvency, including a requirement that investigating accountants made it clear who they were acting for.</p>

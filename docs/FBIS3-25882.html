			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Governor Christopher Patten by Sonny Lim, </F> producer of Singapore International Television's "Inside Asia"  program, at Hong Kong Government House; date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Lim] I guess what is significant perhaps of your  decision is that it seems to me to be a unilateral action on  your part to go ahead with the reforms. I know you said you  wanted to do it, but you took action on an independent basis and  went ahead and said, OK let's go. Let's give it a go.    [Patten] That is, broadly speaking, right. The Chinese knew  perfectly well that we had to start taking some decisions in  early December. I don't think they were under any illusions  about that; we have responsibilities. We have responsibilities  to legislate to the electoral arrangement and to administer the  elections. And we have to discharge these responsibilities,  though I would much prefer to do so after agreement with the  Chinese side.    [Lim] But by your taking unilateral action, doesn't that  give the Chinese an excuse to do the same? Doesn't it invite  them to do the same, really?    [Patten] I don't think so because the Chinese recognize,  after all, it is explicit in the joint declaration that we are  sovereign until 1997 and that means we have certain  responsibilities and of course what the joint declaration is  supposed to do is to ensure that China cooperates with us while  we discharge those responsibilities until 1997. Cooperation has  not been perhaps as extensive as we would have liked.  Cooperation is of course a two-way street.    [Lim] Throughout the negotiations, though, it has been very  public. You have been quite accessible to the press and I would  say the Chinese have become more accessible. But if you look  back at it now and given the fact that there was a report  recently that you had tried to establish a secret channel of  communications before you came out here, would you not prefer  the negotiations to be less public?    [Patten] Well, I would have preferred to have gotten an  agreement whether through a secret or in public, but I don't  think that you could have had negotiations going on for the best  part of a year or even longer in secret. I think it would have  been impossible.    [Lim] Why do you say that?    [Patten] I think that you will know that what we sought in  the first place was a rather better channel of communications  with the Chinese side and we sought that very sincerely.  Unfortunately, they did not seem to have the interest at the  time, which was shortly after I had come to Hong Kong. I think  that is perhaps an indication of what the Chinese sometimes call  sincerity.    [Lim] Alright. Let's talk about the Chinese reaction for a  bit. They have said that no matter what you do, governor, we  are going to eliminate Legco, Legislative Council. We are going  to eliminate the legislature anyway. Does that worry you at all?    [Patten] Well, I don't find a Chinese threat to do something  which would be very much against Hong Kong interests in 1997 a  persuasive argument for us to do things which are against Hong  Kong interests in 1994.    [Lim] So you think they are bluffing?    [Patten] I didn't say that. I very much hope that they will  not throw out the window institutional arrangements which work  and which are acceptable to people in Hong Kong and which in no  way represent a threat to the rest of China after 1997. I don't  actually think that as their first act of sovereignty that China  will simply overturn the arrangements that they find here in  Hong Kong. But that said, I repeat the point I was making  earlier. If China says we will do something which does not make  any sense at all in three or four years time, it does not mean  that we would be sensible to do something which is not in Hong  Kong's interests today.    [Lim] But if you are not quite sure that they are bluffing  and I think you have indicated this, aren't you sort of  jeopardizing people who have to stay here after 1997?    [Patten] I think we will be jeopardizing them far more if we  connived at putting in place arrangements before 1997 which  weren't fair, if we gave a veneer of respectability to  arrangements which would in the end prove corrosive to the rule  of law and to Hong Kong's free institutions. I think if we were  to do that, we would be very unwise and I think we would be  condemned in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong.    [Lim] Outside Hong Kong, Beijing has already also set up the  Preliminary Working Committee, the PWC. Do you feel threatened  by this at all?    [Patten] Well, I don't think so. They describe themselves  increasingly in strange and interesting ways under a certain  amount of criticism. They have now said we are not an organ of  power, but just a talking shop. There was a poll over the  weekend. One should not take every poll seriously, but I think  it sort of reflected people's views which suggested that 70  percent of people in Hong Kong did not trust them, or certainly  did not trust them very much. And they do have credibility  problems, but I very much hope that they will begin to represent  some of Hong Kong's interests to China. The more channels of  communications there are, the better. But no threats to the  governments authority or credibility. The threat to our  authority would have come if we had been prepared to do a rotten  deal with the Chinese officials. That would have been a real  threat to our authority.    [Lim] If the PWC is not a threat, is not seen as a threat,  why did you recently then say, look, local legislators don't  accept the invitations to be in the PWC? Why did you not think  it is a good idea when you do not see it as a threat?    [Patten] What we have received is a request to send civil  servants to Beijing to brief the PWC and we don't think it is a  very good idea.    [Lim] Why not?    [Patten] For a number of reasons, let me tell you. First of  all, their existing arrangement under the joint declaration for  improving relations between Britain, China, and Hong Kong for  dealing with transitional matters and, for example, the Joint  Liaison Group through which we would like to be doing a great  deal more business than we are actually managing to achieve at  present because China tends to drag her feet in the Joint  Liaison Group.    [Lim] You mentioned Legco just now. You have gazetted the  reforms, watered down they may be. But, let's say for some  reason or another, the legislators say, well, I am not sure so  sure I would like to pass this and it does not pass. Would you  feel at that point disappointment as well as some relief,  perhaps?    [Patten] I'd feel acute disappointment.    [Lim, interrupting] No relief?    [Patten] No relief whatsoever because we are responsible for  good government in Hong Kong. We are responsible for the  electoral arrangements and we have to have electoral  arrangements in place. Whatever arrangements, whatever proposals  we put to the Legislative Council, we will argue for as  vigorously as possible. I certainly don't intend to put  proposals to the Legislative Council which I would like the  Legislative Council to water down or change in some way. That  is not political leadership.    [Lim] I asked if you would feel any relief because if the  reforms do not pass, in a sense, the whole issue sort of blows  over and you would have been seen to have tried, to have fought  tooth and nail to get through this, but Legco says sorry, we  don't think it is a good idea.    [Patten] In what is becoming an increasingly balding and  grey-headed political career, I have always believed myself that  I am trying to be too clever by half, though a very very bad way  of trying to conduct public business. I think that clarity is  important. I think you set out what you want to try to do and  then you try to do it. And I don't know any better way of  giving a political lead and I don't know of any better way of  trying to mobilize consent so we will do what we believe is in  Hong Kong's interests. It is a true point that I have made many  times. It is true that I can't go further than Hong Kong is  prepared to go, but nor in my judgment can I go less far than  Hong Kong is prepared to go.    [Lim] I find it a bit ironic, though, because in a speech in  October, you said that the community's legislature, you are  responsible for setting the limits to this government's ability  to strengthen democracy, but you are asking the legislature to  take responsibility for negotiations that have been held outside  of their vision, outside of their involvement, but when push  comes to shove, it is still their responsibility.    [Patten] What we are doing is recognizing the constitutional  role of the Legislative Council, which is to pass, to agree, to  amend legislation and electoral matters. That is the position  under the present constitutional arrangements in Hong Kong and,  I whisper the words in case Chinese officials are listening,  that will be the position and under the constitutional  arrangements after 1997. What we are doing is attempting to  shape Hong Kong's political institutions in consultation with  the Legislative Council; it is a process of political dialogue  which I think one should find not only acceptable, but immensely  practical in an open society like this.    [Lim] And lastly, in the past 10 months, has this job gotten  any easier for you?    [Patten] No, I don't think anybody would regard this as one  of the easier jobs in the world.    [Lim] Less difficult, lets just say.    [Patten] It remains challenging and fascinating and I hope  learning that in order to do it, I need to be rather fitter and  keep my wits about me and I hope that I'm also learning to do it  without being provoked by the noises off that we sometimes hear  from the mainland.    [Lim] Thank you for your time, governor.    [Patten] Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, who is  responsible for the implementation of the Reconstruction and  Development Program [RDP], today declined to comment on recent  estimates of its cost. Speaking in Pretoria, he said President  Mandela would address the RDP issue in his state-of-the-nation  speech in Parliament next Tuesday.    [Begin recording] [Naidoo] The costing of the RDP is still  being quantified by a team that has been working for several  months on the quantification exercise. But we are confident  that we have a plan to start the RDP in this financial year, and  to also maintain the macroeconomic balance that is necessary,  the fiscal discipline that is necessary, and to be able to  deliver the goods and services to our people. That plan will be  enunciated in the state president's address on Tuesday.    [Unidentified reporter] You also indicated that the RDP is  not purely an ANC policy, but that it is the result of  across-the-board discussions.    [Naidoo] Yes, the RDP program now has been accepted as the  vehicle by all political parties. We obviously have to now work  on detailing more policy directions that are needed to implement  the program, and there are on-going discussions that are taking  place, but ultimately the new government of national unity will  operate within the framework of the RDP.

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Philippines in credit agreement with IMF The Philippines has negotiated a new credit facility of SDR475m (Pounds 436.5m) with the International Monetary Fund to support the Philippines' growth-oriented economic programme for the three years to 1997. The agreement was concluded yesterday by a visiting technical team from the Fund and a panel of government officials led by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of Bangko Sentral, the central bank. The IMF has closely supervised the drafting of Manila's economic policies since the early 1960s. Mr Singson expressed his belief that the new IMF credit programme will help 'lay a firm basis for faster and sustainable (economic) growth.' The Philippines, which has been without an IMF economic programme since March 1993, has managed to sustain economic growth as well as to control inflation and monetary expansion. The credit will come from the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, the institution's window for medium-term financing. Previous programmes for the country had been standby agreements, which were for shorter periods and carried tough conditions. The new programme should enable the Philippine government to attain this year's growth target of 4.5 per cent, after last year's 2.5 per cent. Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, said: 'This is it. We can now proceed with our plans to move our economy forward and achieve our aspiration to join the club of newly industrialising countries by the turn of the century.' The programme, which is subject to further review by the IMF technical team before formal board approval around April, targets economic growth to rise to 6.5 per cent next year and about 8 per cent by 1997. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, is expected to visit Manila in February. That will be followed by a visit by Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, in March or April. Mr Ramos yesterday appointed Mr Roberto de Ocampo, currently chairman of the state-run Development Bank of the Philippines, as new finance secretary from February 1. He will replace Mr Ernest Leung, who has been acting finance secretary since the middle of last year, when Mr Ramos's initial nominee for the post, Mr Ramon del Rosario, was rejected by the congressional Commission on Appointments.</p>

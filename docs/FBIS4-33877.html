			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ramiro de  Leon Carpio government today reported a plan to destabilize  Guatemala through violent means, indicating that the plan seeks  to delay the peace process, sow terror, and prevent the renewal  of the National Parliament.    The Guatemalan president said that, if necessary, he will  order the mobilization of Army troops to various areas of the  country to contain "planned" disturbances and an alleged wave of  violence that aims to undermine the country's institutions. On  Friday, gang members attacked pedestrians, destroyed about 100  vehicles and robbed various commercial establishments, without  immediate reaction from the police.    "We will impose order with the law in our hand to guarantee  security for the people," the president said after deploring the  violent actions by vandals who took over the center of the  capital.    Government Minister Danilo Parinello said the disturbances  were financed by "a sector" to sow chaos and terror so as to  prevent the country's pacification. Nevertheless, he did not  name the sector to which he referred. Parinello said the  violence unleashed in the city has the objective of preventing  the replacement of 116 deputies, whose term ends in 1996,  through legislative elections in August. "The wave of violence  is manageable," the chief of Guatemalan security said.    Prosecutor General Ramses Cuestas urged Parinello to present  a report on the disturbances and on those who sponsored them so  the appropriate penalties can be applied.    National Police spokesman Gonzalo Figueroa Castellanos said  he has information about a destabilization plan, but he declined  to name those responsible for it. In this regard, the police  spokesman confirmed that several dynamite charges were placed at  an electricity pylon located on kilometer marker 18.5 of the  highway between Guatemala City and San Pedro Ayampuc  Municipality to the west. He said the explosive damaged the  infrastructure, causing nearly $75,000 in damage.    Meanwhile, General Efrain Rios Montt, former de facto  president (1982-1983), suggested to the De Leon Carpio  government that "it apply a hard hand to rebuild the country,  because it is pitiful to see the way it is today." Rios Montt,  who is a candidate for deputy for the Guatemalan Republican  Front, said the country "has been knocked about since the  beginning of the decade when the law was undermined, but now  strong measures must be taken to rescue the nation."</p>

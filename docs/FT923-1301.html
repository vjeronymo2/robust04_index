			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: BIL rises 19% to NZDollars 251m in year BRIERLEY Investments (BIL) today reported an 18.6 per cent increase in after-tax profits to NZDollars 251.1m (USDollars 135.7m) for the year to June 30, against NZDollars 211.7 last year. Directors said this was largely due to a substantial lift in operating earnings in New Zealand and through much lower interest and overhead costs. In the UK hotel group Mount Charlotte recorded a NZDollars 6m loss compared with a profit of NZDollars 78m last year. Total UK contributions were NZDollars 321.1m against NZDollars 452.5m. This included the sale of the motor group TKM to Inchcape for NZDollars 1,373m resulting in a profit of NZDollars 160m. During the year the company wrote off a total of NZDollars 156m - including NZDollars 72m on its investment in Magnum Corporation, NZDollars 44m for Ariadne Australia and NZDollars 20m on New Zealand properties which are to be sold. The operating profit before tax and minorities was NZDollars 354.8m against NZDollars 303.7m, an increase of 17 per cent. Tax was NZDollars 55.3m against last year's figure of NZDollars 50m. Equity earnings showed a loss of NZDollars 36.6m compared with a profit of NZDollars 21.1m last year. Directors said the good results from Air New Zealand and Carter Holt Harvey were offset by losses in Ariadne Australia and Magnum. Sales revenue fell 24 per cent to NZDollars 4.31bn against NZDollars 5.71bn, due to the sale of TKM during the year. An unchanged final dividend of 5 cents, making 9 cents for the year, is recommended.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Brown to call for workers right to education leave Mr Gordon Brown will today call for all workers to be given a guaranteed right to take leave of absence in order to study, as part of a 'permanent education revolution' to tackle chronic unemployment. The shadow chancellor will use a speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research, the left-of-centre think-tank, to put education reform at the centre of the party's fight to achieve full employment. Claiming that 'trickle-down economics' has failed, Mr Brown will argue that the missing element in the battle against unemployment is a programme providing opportunities for everyone to raise their skills. Mr Brown will say that in seeking to develop such a programme Labour should not flinch from facing difficult questions about potential new sources of finance for investment in education and 'the way in which the growing private education system affects educational opportunities'. Among other measures Mr Brown will call for more nursery education for under-fives; education for those aged 16 to 19 which provides 'parity of esteem' for academic and vocational study and high-quality training for school-leavers; and tax incentives for people who undertake their own training.</p>

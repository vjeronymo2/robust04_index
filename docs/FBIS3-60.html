			<p>Europe     Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 13, 24  March 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Latin America Group featuring brief summaries of foreign  media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most recent  sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications. The EER is published in two  editions, one for Western Europe (also including media coverage of  Canada and Turkey), and the other for Eastern Europe.  Drawing  primarily from domestic media sources of these countries but also  using other foreign media where appropriate, the EER focuses on  national and regional economic issues, such as economic  competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic reforms and  other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade and  investment.       FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S  Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

In fact, according to a 29 January SVENSKA  DAGBLADET survey of Swedish economic activity in China, the Far East  is well on its way to becoming a more important market for Swedish  firms than North America.  Swedish exports to China increased from  1.6 to 3.5 billion kronor between 1991 and 1993, and more Swedish  firms are establishing joint ventures in China as well.  The  commercial section at the Swedish embassy in Beijing described 1993  as a "real record year."       Despite the export boom, Sweden's trade picture with China is  not all rosy.  According to the 29 January SVENSKA DAGBLADET, Sweden  continues to maintain a trade deficit with China because imports  from that country--especially textiles--have increased dramatically.  In recent years, China has replaced Portugal as the leading supplier  of textiles to Sweden.  The business weekly VECKANS AFFARER also  reported on 21 February that Sweden's share of Chinese imports has  decreased from 1.35 percent in 1987 to under 1 percent in 1993.  This is attributed to Eurocentric attitudes on the part of many  Swedish firms.       Ericsson: The Shining Star       The Ericsson electronics company accounts for the lion's share--  60 percent--of Sweden's exports to China, which is well on its way  to becoming Ericsson's largest market, according to an article in  DAGENS NYHETER on 29 January.  Ericsson has been most successful in  exporting mobile phones to China, where it holds a 70-percent market  share.  The article cites Hans Ekstrom, the company's head of  operations in China, as saying that "the sale of mobile telephones  in China has been a real cash cow for us."  Ericsson's sales of  these phones--a popular status symbol in China--doubled in 1992 and  1993 and are expected to further increase when China installs a  standardized digital system.  Ericsson already has an advantage in  the vast Chinese market because of its ability to build large-scale  systems.  According to the article, the firm sees its most important  competitors in establishing a mobile phone system in China as  Motorola and the Finnish firm Nokia.  The article also notes that a  large part of the export credits for Ericsson's sales is expected to  come from foreign institutions because of the low risk tolerance of  Swedish banks.       Ericsson, which last year moved its southern China office from  Hong Kong to Guangzhou to be closer to its customers, has been  particularly active in Guangdong--a province of 66 million  inhabitants whose capital is Guangzhou.  According to the 31 January  SVENSKA DAGBLADET, Ericsson has 40 percent of the overall public  telecommunications market in Guangdong, second only to Japan's  NEC, and 80 percent of the market for mobile telephones.  In  addition, the company has received 80 percent of all new  telecommunications orders in the province in the last three years.  Last year it got a 2.5-billion-kronor order from Guangdong Post &amp;  Telecom to expand the regular telephone system to 2 million new  subscribers; the order will be 15 percent financed by state-  backed Swedish export credits.  Ericsson is also one of five  companies invited to bid on building a digital GSM mobile phone  system in the province;  according to an article in DAGENS NYHETER  on 29 January, Ericsson has an advantage in the competition because  it built Guangdong's GSM test system.  SVENSKA DAGBLADET also  reported on 1 March that Ericsson got a 1.7-billion- kronor order  from the province, which the deputy head of Ericsson Radio Systems  in China called "one of our largest orders ever," to build an  analogue system for mobile phones, called the Total Access  Communication System.  It will also deliver mobile phone exchanges,  radio base stations, a system for maintenance and monitoring, and  subscriber databases, all of which will be produced in Sweden.       Other Players       Other Swedish firms are hoping to take advantage of the  development of the Chinese infrastructure, especially the railroad  industry.  Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), a Swedish-Swiss electrical  engineering giant, is perhaps the second most active Swedish company  in China.  An article in the 29 January SVENSKA DAGBLADET explains  how ABB, whose sales in China totalled 1.5 billion kronor in 1992,  has capitalized on China's energy and transportation needs to  carve out a niche for itself in the Chinese market.  While the  company had only 50 employees in Hong Kong and China five years ago,  that total has now risen to 1,500.  China is its single largest  market for power generators, power transmitters, and trains.  ABB  hopes for large sales of its X2000 high speed train as well.  According to a SVENSKA DAGBLADET report from 27 October, the  railroad is also among Atlas Copco's biggest Chinese customers.  The mining engineering firm, which has built dams and tunnels in  China, is hoping for a contract to construct tunnels for the high-  speed train route between Beijing and Hong Kong.  Last year SKF, a  ball bearings manufacturer, also got what the report calls a  "breakthrough" order from the railroad.  SKF had previously  concentrated on supplying ball bearings and components for  textile machines in China.  The Swedish trade counselor in Beijing  told SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 27 October that Swedish exporters can be  as successful in the railroad industry in China as Ericsson has been  in the telecommunications sector, providing they can secure  financing.  However, the Swedish development aid organization, which  has established strict regulations on deals in China, has not been  forthcoming.      Looking at the success of Swedish industry in China, an article  in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 29 January notes that the country is also an  important market for Hagglunds, which produces heavy machinery.  China makes up 30-40 percent of Hagglunds' market worldwide for  hydraulic motors.  The company also sells cranes, many of which are  made in a joint venture in Nanjing, to China's growing shipbuilding  business.  Its vehicles are also being used in oil exploration on  the coast and the Yellow River delta.       Automaker Volvo has been making inroads into the Chinese market  through local representation and joint ventures, another article in  SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 29 January claims.  Although sales slacked off  last year due to tight Chinese economic policies, the company is  expecting sales to increase this year.  It has 10 retail and service  locations in China and earlier this year opened an office in  Beijing.  Last Fall Volvo concluded a joint venture agreement with  Xian Aircraft Company for the production and marketing of buses.  The factory will start by producing 1,000 buses a year and then  increase to 3,000; it will employ 1,100 workers.  An article in  DAGENS NYHETER on 29 January notes that the company is hoping to  open another production facility.  (WS)       EU       RAPID CONCLUSION OF LEUNA DISPUTE SOUGHT--At a meeting in Bonn  to discuss economic convergence between the two countries, French  and German parliamentarians pointed out the symbolic character of  the proposed Leuna oil refinery, which France's Elf oil company  agreed to build in eastern Germany.  The refinery project, they  claim, could solidify industrial links between France and Germany.  To do so, however, the parliamentarians state that there needs to be  a quick resolution of the dispute which has arisen between Elf  and Germany's Trust Agency over Elf's desire to reduce its  investment commitment to the project.  Noting that this investment  was "vital for overcoming the difficulties of eastern Germany's  chemical industry," the parliamentarians added that besides the  purely political considerations, necessary market considerations  must not be neglected.  However, any arrangement should proceed  "with the general principle of law which says that contracts  concluded should be respected in their spirit."       Because of the impasse in the negotiations between the Trust  Agency and Elf, the economy minister of Saxe-Anhalt, where Leuna is  located, intends to talk directly to Elf.  Additionally, officials  at Germany's Thyssen, Elf's partner and coinvestor in the refinery,  declared they were convinced the issue would be resolved soon and  that the question of Elf's ownership share could be resolved  internally between Thyssen and Elf. (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS  in French 10 Mar 94 p 10)       EBRD DOUBLES INVESTMENT IN EAST EUROPE--The European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved 91 projects in East  Europe in 1993, which represented a financial investment of 2.28  billion ECU's or two times more than the preceding year, according  to an EBRD report published on 9 March.  In 1992, the bank approved  51 projects representing 1.09 billion ECU's.  The report indicates  that in 1993, EBRD loans made possible East European projects worth  11.3 billion ECU's compared to 7 billion ECU's in 1992 and 1.5  billion ECU's during the first nine months of the banks existence in  1991.  According to the report, EBRD wants to maintain the same  level of investment this year as in 1993.       However, as in 1992, EBRD only disbursed a small fraction of the  approved sums: Out of the 2.28 billion ECU's approved, only 435  million ECU's were actually made available to projects, according to  an article in LES ECHOS.  This "enormous" difference between  approved and disbursed funds, although caused by projects structured  for completion over several years, may rekindle the debate on EBRD's  ability to lend.  The article questions whether this might thwart  EBRD's attempt to highlight the good conditions of its accounts  after the past year when the bank was criticized for former director  Jacques Attali's management.  In any case, EBRD can point to  progress in containing bank operating expenses, which at 137.3  million ECU's are 8 percent less than forecast, according to the  report. (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 10 Mar 94 p 7)       FINLAND       COMMENTARY VIEWS REICH'S JOBS SOLUTIONS--In the lead editorial  for Helsinki HUFVUDSTADSBLADET on 16 March, editor-in-chief Bo  Stenstrom commented on U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich's message  at the G-7 Jobs Summit that infrastructure investment is a major  factor in creating employment.  While admitting that Finland, with  its over 20-percent unemployment rate, has not been as successful as  the United States in putting people to work, Stenstrom criticizes  those who have taken Reich's ideas as a "job creation recipe in  itself."  Stenstrom argues that investing in infrastructure will not  automatically lead to better jobs and better wages.  He cites  assertions that while the United States has indeed a better record  as far as raw unemployment figures, that many of these jobs are low-  paid service sector positions.  Stenstrom suggests that both Reich's  and the G-7's White Papers are too eager to diminish the role of the  public sector, which Stenstrom sees as vital for "providing  training" to improve workers' skills to make them more competitive  with those in developing countries.       Stenstrom also points to another problem particular to Finland's  virtually flat population growth, a problem he believes  infrastructure investing alone cannot solve: overproduction as  industry and workers become more efficient.  He reasons that growth  in industrial production leads toinvestment in technology, which  will improve productivity but cut jobs.  The lack of population  growth, with its attendant reduction in consumption, makes  Finland unable to absorb more production or create more employment,  Stenstrom maintains.  He questions whether Finland or Europe are  going to provide the ever higher-paying and higher-skilled jobs  demanded by its more educated work force.  As an example of how  European governments are running out of solutions, he mentions such  practices as Denmark's sabbatical leave program, which--used as a  substitute for paying unemployment compensation--is "a big  minus" for the economy.  "We are resorting to such methods in a  situation which we cannot in the long run afford." (RB)  (Helsinki  HUFVUDSTADSBLADET in Finnish 16 Mar 94 p 2)       FRANCE       EDITORIAL DISCUSSES G-7 JOB SUMMIT--Deputy editor-in-chief for  macroeconomics Francoise Crouigneau writes in the Paris financial  daily LES ECHOS that the G-7 job summit in Detroit is strongly  symbolic despite the fact that the United States has transformed  "this think-tank seminar" into a "media happening" and that each of  the G-7 countries is "showing off" its own solutions for  unemployment.  The meeting, Crouigneau contends, is an  acknowledgment of "worry and of powerlessness" when faced with  safeguarding the competitiveness of the companies of industrial  countries and their ability to employ workers.  The world's work  force seems to have a choice between being poorly paid and unskilled  overseas or being skilled but unemployed in Europe.       Crouigneau argues that if the future world job market depends on  the highly skilled, then Europe, despite its unemployment problems,  is further along than the United States, which has essentially  created low-skilled jobs.  However, creating jobs in the future is  all the more troublesome since the solution is no longer the  budgetary and monetary management of governments.  The emergence of  newly industrialized countries creates an unknown factor in the  rules of the game for foreign trade.  These rules, Crouigneau points  out, are all the more important now since  economic guerilla  warfare" has replaced past relationships built on politics and the  Cold War.  Today, the most advanced nations are condemned to adapt  and innovate to survive.  To do so, they must recognize that two  conditions are needed.  They must agree to at least a minimum of  coordination so that growth in the G-7 countries can resume, and  they must reform their economies to address unemployment caused  by high labor costs.  Crouigneau acknowledges that no one has the  secret for accomplishing the latter. (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in  French 14 Mar 94 p 4)      COMMENTARY ADVOCATES SOCIAL WELFARE COMMITMENT--According to  Pascal Riche writing in the 15 March Paris daily LIBERATION, U.S.  Labor Secretary Robert Reich's comments that countries do not have  to choose between good jobs or a decent life is an attempt to  achieve a convergence between Europe's need to create unskilled jobs  and the U.S. need for skilled employment.  However, while this  approach seems logical, it may not be the right one, Riche argues.  The United States is just beginning to try creating skilled jobs and  no conclusion can be drawn from the U.S. experience at this time.  As for Europe, it tried "various schemes" during the "laissez-faire"  1980's to do the same and failed to produce results, which has led  to the French Government now proposing to modify minimum wage  requirements for young people.  For Europeans to seek a third way  between the two models would probably result in a system that would  only "preserve the disadvantages of the two systems," Riche  contends.  Instead, he advocates that European governments "deepen"  their commitment to social welfare.  These governments, Roche notes,  failed in the fight against unemployment because they did not  deal with unemployment in a timely manner.  While he adds that some  blame budgetary difficulties for this neglect, he also points out  that successive governments allowed social costs to escalate and did  not recognize the importance of job training.  At the same time,  working Europeans fought to preserve salary raises in disregard of  labor market conditions.  However, Riche concludes that if there had  been more commitment to maintaining social welfare during the  1980's, the government might have formulated policies to  stimulate economic growth to alleviate unemployment rather than  trying its various ineffective job creation schemes.  Instead, it  allowed unemployment to "swallow up" working people "as if a l0-  percent unemployment rate were considered 'normal'."  (RM)  (Paris  LIBERATION in French 15 Mar 94 p 3)       JOB SUMMIT IGNORES WORLD UNEMPLOYMENT--Gerard Dupuy, commenting  on the G-7 Job Summit in the 15 March Paris daily LIBERATION, cites  a recent report noting that unemployment rates in the rest of the  world are "hugely" higher than the rate in rich countries.  According to Dupuy, these "hundreds of millions of unemployed will  be ignored in Detroit."  Given the breadth of the challenge, it is  easy to see why summit participants have warned that "no decisions  should be expected."  While unemployment problems in less-developed  countries will make a "timid" appearance at the summit, Dupuy is  skeptical about any impact it might have since he sees in it "less  compassion about the miseries of the present" and more concern about  the threat that such a  problem entails. (RM)  (Paris LIBERATION in  French 15 Mar 94 p 3)       COMMENTARY ON G-7 JOB SUMMIT--Delphine Girard, commenting in the  Paris business daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on the G-7 Job Summit,  stated that President Bill Clinton's message on unemployment caught  Europe "on the wrong foot."  Europeans have for months been trying  to explain to distraught workers, especially in France, that they  must choose between wages and employment.  Clinton could have used  the summit to provide a "final blow" to "old [European] complaints"  about social welfare and unemployment, Girard claimed.  Instead,  Clinton stressed that it is not by underpaying wages and  multiplying small jobs that industrialized countries will improve  unemployment.  To create employment, he said, they must instead  raise living standards by increasing salaries, favoring higher  education to foster technological progress, developing productivity  in industries of the future, and reinforcing social protection.  (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 17 Mar 94 p 3)       U.S. SEEN SPEAKING 'DOUBLE TALK' ON AUDIOVISUAL-- According to  Emmanuel Schwartzenberg writing the economic supplement to LE  FIGARO, Le Fig-Eco,  the United States is speaking "double talk"  when it comes to audiovisual policy since U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor says one thing while President of the Motion Picture  Association of America (MPAA) Jack Valenti says another.  While  Kantor has again threatened to use U.S. trade laws to force Europe  to open its audiovisual market, Valenti has been very conciliatory  toward Europeans declaring, "The government position and that of U.S  producers and distributors is not identical.  Cinema is outside the  political field and it is I who guards the keys to the house.  Kantor has never consulted me on the question of trade sanctions."       Schwartzenberg contends that Valenti, since the GATT agreement,  considers that the "too intransigent position" of the U.S.  Government reinforces European cohesion and may prod the EU to  establish a "super" trade regulation prejudicial to U.S. interests.  Persuaded that "new technologies, which allow each television viewer  to create his own program, will render legislation obsolete,"  Valenti considers that "France, as can the other European countries,  can legislate all it wants."  (DiI)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco  supplement in French 10 Mar 94 p XII)       SAPIN DISCUSSES MONETARY POLICY--In an interview with a panel of  journalists from LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Bank of France Monetary  Policy Council (MPC) member and former Socialist Economy and Finance  Minister Michel Sapin claimed that the Bank of France has "without  question" become independent.  Nonetheless, Sapin stated he would  continue the policy followed by the current French Government and  its predecessors of monetary coordination with the Bundesbank.  He  also refuted the idea that this policy increases unemployment,  warned the government about increasing deficits, and said there  was no "lasting" relationship between U.S. interest rates and those  of Europe.       Although he contended that the Bank of France was "certainly"  independent, Sapin noted that questions were often asked about the  counterpart of independence, that is, collegiality."  "There is no  independence without collegiality," Sapin argued, "because it is  rarely the case that the correct monetary decision is clearcut."  Decisions are made within the context of a network of constraints  and contradictions.  To appreciate these contradictory elements and  this complexity, it is better to put several people together having  different agendas, experiences, and languages so that monetary  decisions can be made.  Besides, he added, when monetary decisions  were a government responsibility, they too were made after a  collegial debate.       Sapin, pointing out that the MPC was obliged to be accountable  to the public and to be responsible in what it said since financial  markets "watch its every word," stated that it was more necessary  than ever to coordinate French monetary policy with the Bundesbank.  The problem with France's relationship with the Bundesbank is not a  question of independence.  It is a question of either thinking of  monetary policy in a French or a European sense.  In Sapin's view,  the need to establish a European single currency must not be  influenced by economic or market conditions.  The objective is to  quickly establish a single currency to be able then to have more  decisive margins of maneuver in relation to the United States and  Asia.  To arrive at that stage, "we must go through some  turbulence," he said.       Regarding unemployment, Sapin said that it cannot be reduced  without economic growth but that growth is not enough.  In France,  structural unemployment existed before the recession and it will  remain after the recovery if something is not done about it.  Sapin  argues that current monetary policy does not aggravate unemployment,  since its emphasis on stability has given the economy a sound base.  Nonetheless, Sapin stated that unemployment was one of his main  preoccupations.       Budget deficits are another.  Sapin said it did not bother him  if deficits were used in recessions to help fuel the economy.  However, when recovery starts the government must change its  spending policy or consumers and companies either will not have  access to money or the money will cost too much.  "We are at this  point today," he said, and the government must now make reducing the  deficit a priority to meet the very strict budgetary requirements  for French-German convergence.       Sapin was also asked how he explained what happened in financial  markets when the United States raised its interest rates.  He  replied that the U.S. interest rate hike affected Europe for "no  rational reason," indicating that European financial agents did not  understand that increased rates in the United States are not  contradictory with pursuing lower rates in Europe.  There is no  lasting connection between the United States and Europe because  the economic situations are very different, Sapin declared. (Dil)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 11 Mar 94 p 25)       EDITORIAL ON OECD VIEWS ON FRENCH INTEREST RATES--In an  editorial in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, editor-in-chief Philippe Labarde  claims that the recent report by the OECD, which advocated  unilateral French interest rate reductions as the only way to  sustain demand in France if German rates did not decline, was  "priceless" as a means to resuscitate the debate on French  monetary policy.  Despite the hard line taken by the Bank of France  and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in support of continuing its  close monetary coordination with Germany, Labarde notes that the  critics of such a policy are increasing.  Numerous economists and  heads of companies are adding their voices to that of the OECD.  Labarde argues that the OECD, as a bastion of free market orthodoxy,  gives credence to these "partisans of a French offensive monetary  policy."  Before the OECD report, these critics were considered at  best as "sorcerers apprentices or dreamers," at worst as secret  devaluationists, notorious anti-Europeanists, or shameful  protectionists."       The OECD statement, however, may not lead to monetary  authorities changing their policy, Labarde cautions.  The government  has already missed two occasions which would have allowed it freedom  from the Bundesbank: the first was when it was elected and the  second during last August's monetary crisis.  Labarde concludes that  while it is never too late to change monetary direction and that  economic recovery would be helped by a significant lowering of  discount rates, he acknowledges that current political and monetary  conditions make it difficult to do so. (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES in French 10 Mar 94 p 32)       EDITORIAL ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES--Deputy editor-in-chief  Francois Roche, writing in the Paris business daily LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES, observes that government subsidies for public companies  are expensive for France but that the "real" problem of France's  public companies, especially the computer company Bull and Air  France, is that they have been mismanaged for a long time.  Roche  notes that some would find it "scandalous" that Bull is receiving 7-  8 billion francs (Fr) and Air France Fr20 billion from the French  Government.  He characterizes such government assistance as "at the  limit of decency" in the opinion of many, coming at a time when  private companies are taking risks to find their own financial  resources in the market place.  He claims the distortion it causes  in competition is "too flagrant" not to "set right."       However, Roche states that the cause for Bull's and Air France's  financial problems lies with long-term government mismanagement.  These two companies have never been managed as they have should have  been, that is to say, as part of a competitive free market.  Their  directors have never been able to cut themselves off, even when they  wanted to, from larger political issues.  Moreover, the government,  when it harbored "great ambitions" in data processing or air  transport, never furnished these two companies with the financial  means to fulfill these "grandiose" projects.  Roche concludes that  Bull and Air France, which have been sheltered from the realities of  the world in an attempt to make them the "guarantors of national  independence," are now at the "end of their rope."  Roche adds that  while it is understandable that the new directors of these companies  do not want to deal with the consequences of past mismanagement,  waiting for them to come to grips with their problems wastes money,  energy, and demoralizes employees.

"The survival of the  group is linked to three factors," he said, "The Rafale program,  innovative future projects, and civilian and military aircraft  exports."  The Rafale program was last delayed for six months at the  end of 1993 and resulted in the loss of 1,000 jobs, half of them in  the Dassault group.  Serge Dassault pointed out that under present  conditions, the Ministry of Defense foresees that "very few" Rafale  aircraft will be delivered before the end of the decade.  (RM)  (Paris LE MONDE in French 4 Mar 94 p 10)       ROOTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT VIEWED--In the Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS, Economist Michel Drancourt notes that there is a "French  cultural exception" with regard to the causes of unemployment.  As  early as the 1970's, the Europeans, and notably the French, chose to  increase the salaries and social benefits of workers, despite  periodic economic crises, and to finance growing unemployment by  steadily increasing workers wages and thus employer social  contributions.  Drancourt remarks that such a "revenues policy" must  be revised in favor of an "employment policy."  He suggests the  French could learn from the U.S. system, which he notes is "more  efficient," with job creation increasing because productivity  increases faster than do wages.      Drancourt does not recommend "systematically reducing" salaries  but proposes that they should be linked to productivity.  The high  cost of salaries, he argues, has limited companies chances to  increase productivity.  In playing the role of provider, the state  caused a systematic reduction in employment in both large and small  companies.  The growth in unemployment, however, did not result in  lower salaries.  Drancourt lays the blame on social benefit costs,  which are rising faster than direct salaries because they pay for  redistribution of capital which does not promote job creation.  "Rigidity should be dismantled," Drancourt contends, and real  salaries should be adjusted according to productivity.  This entails  an adjustment in social benefit costs and their financing--a  difficult but necessary solution, Drancourt concludes.  (RM)  (Paris  LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in French 3 Mar 94 p  4)       U.S. 'PRESSURE' DIVIDES EU ON NAVAL CONSTRUCTION--A debate is  beginning in Brussels on the position it should adopt in the last  round of OECD negotiations on naval construction subsidies.  EU  shipbuilders fear that the EU Commission will only adopt a  "minimalist" position in the face of U.S. retaliatory threats,  according to an article in the Paris business daily LES  ECHOS.  The naval shipbuilders union (CSCN) claimed that EU  negotiators want an agreement at any cost even if it is an  inequitable one and shipbuilders fear they will lose the little  protection they now have.  However, the terms of the agreement which  EU negotiators were prepared to accept could be modified under  French Government pressure, the article contends, because  France is "sharply opposed" to the EU "minimalist" position.       The EU position, which was also criticized by Spain, Belgium,  and Italy, would abolish as of 1 January 1995 aide to naval  construction and aid to shipowners linked to naval construction.  Japanese subsidies to its shipbuilding industry, however, would be  examined to find out if it distort the market, but the results from  such an examination would not be ready for several years.  No  safeguards have been provided in case of "monetary dumping."  The  United States could continue, at least for a while, numerous  protectionist measures, especially those contained in the Jones Act,  which stipulates ships must be built in the United States and keeps  foreign builders from participating in a $1.5-billion market,  according to a CSCN study.  In addition to the United States  protecting its shipbuilders in the civilian market at a time when  military orders have decreased, the United States is also providing  $2 billion a year for shipyards to convert to civilian work.  The  article concludes that the United States has entered the  final round of OECD negotiations by brandishing the threat of  retaliation if an agreement is not reached because they are "certain  of their right, or at least their power, [to do so]."

Writing in the 16 March SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Peter De Thier  complained that the meeting was "rich in symbols and poor in  content" and that it served "no concrete purpose," except as a  "glittering self-portrait of the resurgent U.S. economy."  Other  commentators agreed that the meeting yielded few tangible results  but noted that it was not expected or intended to.  Gerd  Brueggemann, for example, pointed dut in DIE WELT of 16  March that "quick successes were not to be expected," and Josef  Joffe declared in the same day's SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that meager  results were "predictable, because summits rarely produce anything  that was not put on paper beforehand."       Some commentators, however, thought the conference was important  despite this dearth of concrete achievements.  Carola Kaps, for  example, argued in the 16 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that "it  would probably be wrong" to call the summit a "failure," since its  only objective was to allow the G-7 countries to "learn from one  another through an intensive exchange of opinions" and "to take home  new ideas or motivations."  Judged by this standard, she argued, the  meeting enjoyed at least one "success," since the United States  seemed to have come away with more understanding and acceptance  of Germany's reluctance to stimulate its economy.  Kaps, along with  Joffe, also saw the conference as evidence that the West had changed  its international economic priorities.  The meeting, both writers  noted, marked the first time Western leaders had met to discuss  unemployment, which was previously viewed as too prosaic for their  attention.  For her part, Kaps believed this change would "send a  signal" to average citizens that their leaders "are aware of  people's fears" and of the socially "dangerous" effects  of a high rate of joblessness.  Joffe, meanwhile, saw the meeting's  attention to the jobs issue as important "because it enhances the  shift in awareness" toward the unemployment issue, and because it  showed that the G-7 recognized the "globalization" of economic  problems and solutions.

Speaking at the Leipzig Spring  Fair, Toepfer presented the following data:       --In 1991 (the latest year for which statistics are available)  Germany captured a 20-percent share of the world environmental  technology export market, with exports of goods and services  amounting to 37 billion German marks (DM) or 6 percent of the  nation's total industrial exports.       --Currently, 680,000 German workers are employed in the  environmental technology industry, a number which could grow to 1  million by the year 2000.       Toepfer interprets the data as evidence that "German  environmental standards are not the reason for our economic  problems" but rather a stimulus for growth, given an environmental  technology market that is "nearly limitless."  Citing an OECD study  which estimates the volume of potential environmental sales in East  Europe alone at $15 billion, Toepfer expressed his hope that German  industry "will make use of its lead in exporting and will not gamble  away its environmental know-how."  To this end, he intends to  champion the establishment in Leipzig of an environmental technology  center with a "special" orientation toward Central and East Europe.  (JS) (Berlin DIE WELT in German 10 Mar 94 p 14)       GOVERNMENTS PUSH SMALL BUSINESS FUNDING--The laender governments  in eastern Germany are trying to encourage the growth of small- and  medium-sized businesses through a variety of aid programs.  Thuringia, for example, is providing funds to new businesses to help  preserve and create jobs and to assist with sales, trade fairs,  consulting work, travel, credit guarantees, and direct investments.  The German Bank of Settlements has extended aid to  35,000 businessmen in Thuringia, using its roughly DM6 billion in  seed funds to generate DM9 billion in private investment.  This  program has preserved or created about 250,000 jobs since 1990,  notably in the trade and craft sector.       Meanwhile, in heavily industrialized Saxony-Anhalt, the land  government is attempting to stimulate banks to fund small firms'  needs through credit guarantees and manufacturing subsidies for  particular products.  The land of Brandenburg claims to have funded  48,000 small entrepreneurs with DM15.1 billion since 1991 and to  have more than offset the loss in manufacturing jobs by the increase  in trade and craft positions.  Finally, the government of  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has instituted two new funding mechanisms for  small businesses, the "capital support program," which provides  supplemental capital funding, and the "consolidation program," a  one-time advance to establish liquidity or to refinance loans.

A new  DM17-million plant developed by Synergy Semiconductor Corporation, a  U.S. firm which owns 49 percent of SMI, has just been opened.  SMI  expects sales of DM33 million in 1994 and estimates selling 50  percent more in 1995, largely because of sales of the new  semiconductor, which is based on a Toshiba license.  SMI believes  the new device will soon account for nearly 50 percent of the its  output.  Once profitability is reached and investors are found for  the Trust Agency's remaining stake, Synergy plans to increase its  share in SMI to 51 percent and foresees a total investment of DM40  million to develop the German company.

Barely one-half of the complex's  GDR-era companies have been privatized and some 40 percent of its  production facilities are shut down and being dismantled.  Akzo Nobel, a Dutch firm, has just purchased part of a phosphorus  production company in Bitterfeld from the Trust Agency and plans to  invest DM50 million by 1996 to establish production lines for fire-  retardant chemicals.       The Eschborn-based Ausimont Deutschland company, a subsidiary of  Italy's Montedison group, is building a DM140 million hydrogen  peroxide plant at Bitterfeld and expects to produce 40,000 tons of  the chemical per year, yielding revenues in the "high double-digit  millions."  Chemiepark Bitterfeld's manufacturing branch reports  that the complex's inorganic chemicals and dyestuffs facilities are  still not privatized but that negotiations for sale of the pesticide  production facilities are progressing.

For a population of 10  million, that is one civil servant for every 14 inhabitants.  Total  figures have steadily risen: 53,914 in 1972, 100,955 in 1980, and  589,386 in 1988.  Salary and pension costs have risen from 1,858.3  billion drachmas in 1992 to 2,040 billion drachmas in 1993 and are  projected to reach 2,272.6 billion in 1994.

Between January and October 1993, Greek exports  to Romania dropped to $73.9 million from the 1992 mark of $97.8  million.  A simultaneous drop was reported in Romanian exports to  Greece, which declined from $46.7 million in a 10-month  period in 1992 to $43 million in the same period in 1993.

The study claims' the burden of such a tax  on Greece is "significant," and will:       *  Increase the inflation rate by 1 percent a year.      *  Decrease private investment by 2.5 percent a year.      *  Decrease GDP by 0.5 percent.      *  Decrease employment by 0.5 percent.      *  Increase cost of electricity.

The paper, which identified most of the 2.5 million  unemployed as women, youths with little education, and southerners,  also said that the 2.5 million unemployed is paralleled by the  "totally Italian anomaly" of black market labor involving 2.4  million people.  According to Giugni this figure was derived by  studying the following factors: Italy's extremely high propensity  for saving, the unusual ratio of the self-employed to employed  workers, the low participation of women in the "official" job  market, and "an otherwise unexplainable general ability for the  public to continue purchasing government bonds."  The white paper  concludes that the extent of the underground economy will make it  very difficult for Italy's next government to bring the "value" of  Italian labor up to that of the rest of Europe by increasing the  number of the "officially employed," thereby guaranteeing  increased tax revenues and social welfare benefits.       The white paper also details the government's program to create  1 million new jobs by the year 2000 by raising GDP at least 3  percent yearly, raising the mandatory school age to 16 and later to  18, increasing flexible forms of employment, legalizing many of  those forms to bring many of the "underground" jobs into the system,  and encouraging part-time work to make it a truly competitive form  of labor. (AB)  (Milan IL SOLE-24 ORE in Italian 11 Mar 94  pp 1, 13)       RECENT LABOR ACCORDS SEEN AS STOPGAP MEASURES--The recently  concluded labor agreements between the labor unions and Fiat,  Olivetti, and Italtel, which were concluded thanks to Labor Minister  Gino Giugni's intervention, are considered to be mere stopgap  measures that will cost the government billions of lire and will not  solve the long-term problem of unemployment.  Originally, the three  companies had asked to be allowed to lay off 11,150 workers.  Fearing social unrest, the government came up with a plan that  would allow most of those workers to be retained under "solidarity  contracts."  These contracts stipulate that the employees would work  reduced hours and the government would make up 75 percent of the  lost pay.       However, while these measures are designed to preserve the  workers' jobs and salaries, they are temporary measures that will  have to be renegotiated soon unless the economy rapidly improves.  Former union leader and current director of personnel at Italtel  Luciano Scalia said that unemployment is structural in nature and  unless the work force is reduced, the problem will return as early  as December 1995.  At present, it is impossible to assess precisely  the cost to the government because to do so requires detailed  information is needed about the age, salary, and seniority of each  employee--something which is not readily available.  General  estimates, however, place the total cost to the government at 2.1  trillion lire.

Bernabe explained that the changes taking place within  ENI are intended to correct the overly ambitious expansion plans of  its former management--involved in corruption and kickback scandals-  -which led ENI into "tremendous" debt.  The current plans are to  sell off at least 80 of ENI's subsidiaries, keeping ENI's energy and  chemical companies.  In the meantime, ENI is planning to go from an  international conglomerate operating primarily in the Middle East  and western Africa, to a multinational entity focusing primarily on  the energy field that will expand as far east as Siberia and China.  Bernabe said ENI will not decrease its presence in the Middle East  and western Africa, as 80 percent of Italy's oil reserves are  located there.       Bernabe said that Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Caspian Sea hold  tremendous mineral reserves, and ENI is involved in large-scale  projects in those areas either alone or in joint ventures.  In  China, ENI will not only pursue mineral exploration there but hopes  to participate in refining crude oil and its distribution.  (AB)  (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 7 Mar p 19)      NORWAY       RECORD EXPORT YEAR REPORTED--While Norwegian imports increased  in 1993 by 5.6 percent, exports had a record year, according to a  report published by the Norwegian Export Council in late January  1994.  Total exports increased in value by 4.6 percent to 316.8  billion Norwegian kroner.  The greatest increase was in oil and  natural gas (6.8 percent), while traditional exports from the  mainland increased by 3.8 percent in value.  Fish exports increased  by 8 percent in 1993, making that industry Norway's third largest.       The rise in exports is due to greater Norwegian competitiveness  and strong growth in foreign markets, the report stated.  Germany  replaced the Nordic countries as Norway's most important export  market in 1993 with the UK as the second most important.  Exports to  the UK increased by 20 percent in 1993.  The export of construction  materials to the UK quintupled from 1992 to 1993.  Additionally,  exports to Japan, China, and the Far East grew strongly in 1993.

The  Fund's operating costs, which are only a minute fraction of its  income, are covered by only one day's income, according to General  Manager Tore Lindholt.  The rest is profit, he added.  In 1993, the  Fund had profits of almost 14.9 billion kroner, or more than 1  billion kroner for each member of the Fund's 13-person staff,  prompting AFTENPOSTEN to call the Fund "Norway's most profitable  business."       The Fund increasingly acts as lender to the Norwegian state and  has become one of the leading actors on the Oslo Stock Exchange,  having placed 8.5 percent of its capital in stocks there.  The Fund  is also seeking permission from the government to invest 10 percent  of its capital abroad.

The economies of Sweden and Finland are also  expected to grow, following the worst recession in those countries  since the depression of the 1930's.  As a whole, the Nordic region  is expected to lead in growth in Europe.       The strong growth predicted for Denmark and Norway is attributed  to increased domestic demand and, in Denmark's case, to several  years of austere fiscal policies and a surplus in foreign trade.  Norway's GDP is expected to rise by 3 percent in 1994 and 3.5  percent in 1995 according to the Handelsbanken report. (TF)  (Oslo  AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 17 Feb 94 p 26)      1993 PROFITABLE FOR MOST BUSINESSES--The annual reports of  Norway's major industrial, shipping, and banking firms indicate  moderate to fast growth in profits for 1993.  According to an  article in the Oslo daily AFTENPOSTEN, the total growth in profits  after taxes for these firms was 70 percent.  The growth trend of  these companies--Den norske Bank (DnB), Statoil, metals  exporter Elkem, food manufacturer Rieber, pharmacological products  exporter Hafslund Nycomed, shipping giant Bergesen--are viewed by  chief analyst Sigmund Ellingsen of DnB Funds as typical of the  entire commercial sector.  He feels the growth will only continue.  To a considerable extent this growth is attributed to the cut in  costs which has made Norwegian industry more competitive  internationally.  However, while this increased competitiveness  boosted exports in 1993, it also increased unemployment.

The ministry will allow a maximum of six drillings off the  Nordland coast and four drillings in the Skagerrak.  Responding to  criticism from environmental organizations and fishermen, Industry  and Energy Minister Jens Stoltenberg noted that if oil is found, any  development of the wells would not start until the year 2010 and  that in any case, the country's best fishing areas are not in the  area proposed for exploration.  He added that Norway has "30  years' experience in guarding the coexistence of the oil and  fisheries industries." (TF)  (Oslo AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 25 Feb  94 p 21)       COMPETITIVENESS OF NORWEGIAN SHELF ASSESSED--A report  commissioned by the Ministry of Industry and Energy on the future  competitiveness of the Norwegian Shelf states that costs in the oil  industry will have to be cut in half in the future.  It also  concludes that the oil industry's taxes and fees must be made more  predictable for the industry to compete.  The report says that  controlling costs is the industry's most important task, suggesting  that projects currently planned should cut costs by 25-30 percent.       The report states that the North Sea and the Norwegian Shelf are  no longer the most attractive areas for oil companies to explore.  This is in large measure because new, more competitive oil fields  have emerged in Asia, Africa, and the former Soviet Union, according  to the report, which was written by representatives of the Norwegian  Government, the oil companies, and the delivery industry.

The total sum for 1995 is expected to be 18.3 billion  but from this is deducted 5 billion in agricultural and regional  support and an additional 4.4 billion in rebates.  For 1996, these  figures will be 19.1 billion total, 3.5 in subsidies, and 3.9  billion in rebates.  Sweden will receive an additional 7.6 billion  kronor per year in agricultural support that will not be counted in  the state budget.  It can also receive a maximum of 1.8 billion in  environmental support, if it spends the same amount domestically.

The leaders of the  two countries signed a package of documents necessary for the  creation of a single economic space between Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan. [video shows nazarbayev arriving at airport]    [Begin Nazarbayev recording] I think we will open the  borders for trade, we will remove the customs barriers, we will  remove licensing and quotas; when we are in different monetary  systems and national currencies this can only be beneficial.  [end recording]    The heads of the Central Asian states are to discuss another  global problem, the problem of the Aral, which they will visit  tomorrow. [video shows President Karimov at airport]    [Begin Karimov recording] If today we do not take this  initiative then it will be impossible to solve this problem, and  its consequences will be felt not only in the lives of people  but -- this is most terrible -- on the genetic pool of people,  and one cannot look at the future of this region as a whole, and  not just this region, without a solution to the problem of the  Aral, the Aral problem.

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Average family faces Pounds 10 per month rise in premiums THE PROBLEMS of the Lloyd's market will have an impact on the cost of motor and household insurance. But those buying insurance will be more affected by the heavy losses of the conventional insurance companies - such as Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance - highlighted this week by new figures from the Association of British Insurers. The ABI, which represents insurers on the company market, warned this week that the 'average' UK family would pay an extra Pounds 10 a month for their home and motor insurance as a result of recent premium rises. The ABI's figures showed that insurance woes are not confined to Lloyd's. After suffering their worst results for generations in 1990, UK insurance companies reported record trading losses of Pounds 3.3bn last year last year, with motor insurers hit by underwriting losses of Pounds 1.2bn. However, the companies' main problems stemmed from mortgage indemnity policies, which insure building societies against losses they suffer on the sale of repossessed properties. With the number of repossessions rising and house prices falling, claims multiplied last year and losses of Pounds 1.2bn dwarfed premiums. Losses from subsidence damage to domestic properties rose to Pounds 540m. Ian Rushton, chairman of the ABI, warned that the Pounds 10 a month figure is very much an average. 'Where the industry is making and foresees exceptional losses, the increases may be significantly greater. Some rates have almost doubled already and these reflect the dramatic losses.' Ian Rushton said: 'In the UK, for every Pounds 1 of premium collected, insurance companies paid Pounds 1.30 in claims and expenses.' By contrast, most of the recent losses at Lloyd's have affected syndicates specialising in commercial insurances such as marine and liability policies for large companies, and catastrophe reinsurance. Lloyd's is the leading insurer of private motorists, with a market share of 14 per cent. But its results in this sector have been good. The 28 syndicates insuring private cars recorded a profit in 1989. Syndicates have been affected by the upsurge in claims in 1990 and 1991 and George Johnston, chairman of the Lloyd's Motor Underwriters Association, is expecting a small loss in 1990. Johnston cites the big rise in crime and recession-related claims as the main reason. Rates at Lloyd's have increased. Ralph Sharp, managing director of Castle Holdings, which manages one of the Lloyd's market's biggest motor insurers, says premium rates have risen by 50 per cent over the last 18 months, although this takes into account an increase for July. Paul Scott, partner of Lloyd's brokers Roger Lark and Sedgwick, believes that the increases charged by Lloyd's syndicates lag behind those pushed through by the companies. Meanwhile, the ABI said some of the increase in claims was due to bogus and inflated claims, which cost it an estimated Pounds 400m last year. The Association is launching an advertising campaign next month in a bid to deter fraudsters. Mike Jones, chief executive, said: 'We aim to identify, spotlight and prosecute the fraudsters. They must not be allowed to get away with dodgy claims.'</p>

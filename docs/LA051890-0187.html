			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHURCH COUNCIL CONDEMNS COLUMBUS, CITES INDIANS  </P> <P> The National Council of Churches has approved a resolution condemning  Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492 because of its impact on  Indians.  </P> <P> The resolution was introduced Thursday night to the ecumenical Christian group  by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian who called Columbus' arrival an  "invasion" that brought about the slavery and genocide of native Americans.  </P> <P> "American people have so digested the myth on American history that they have  lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the  continent," Tinker said.  </P> <P> A competing resolution introduced by the Right Rev. David Reed, an Episcopal  bishop from Kentucky, sought to soften the language of Tinker's offering.  </P> <P> His resolution acknowledged the injustice and pain suffered by Indians after  the arrival of Columbus and other European explorers, but sought to retain the  "passion and words" of Tinker's resolution while adding positive aspects of the  last 500 years.  </P> <P> After a heated debate, Reed's resolution effectively was killed.  </P> <P> Reed said he did not believe that anyone will take Tinker's resolution  seriously because of its strong wording.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Louis Lemarchand: "UDF and RPR Demonstrate </F> Their Faith in Europe"]    [Text] The show given at the CDS [Social Democratic Center]  congress this weekend would have delighted Jean Lecanuet, its  founding father. In his "good city" of Rouen, on the same  platform, the most eminent leaders of the majority --  neo-Gaullists, Liberals, and Social Democrats -- vied with each  other in enthusiastically professing their faith in Europe.    With 50 days to go before the European election, the RPR  [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [French Democratic Union]  clearly defined their course of action. It boils down to one  word: unity. The bitterness aroused in the RPR and PR  [Republican Party] by the defeat of Jean-Francois Deniau as head  of the majority's single list has been forgotten. All energies  are mobilized in the leaderships to enable Dominique Baudis to  achieve the best possible vote on 12 June. "Dominique," PR  President [and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet said, "we did  not campaign for you, but we will mobilize in support of your  list without bitterness or ulterior motives." The same  enthusiasm was expressed by Alain Juppe [foreign minister and  RPR secretary general]: The RPR is committed "with sincerity,  good faith, and dynamism."    Inspired by a desire for effectiveness, the two majority  partners chose to say nothing during the campaign about their  real disagreements on Europe: a Europe of nations defended by  the RPR, a federal Europe with a president desired by the CDS.  Between now and 12 June, the RPR and UDF leaders will therefore  strive, especially during their planned big rallies (Toulouse,  Strasbourg, and Paris), to "reconcile the French people with  Europe." Europe? "A great opportunity for France," in Gerard  Longuet's view. And Alain Juppe replied: "France needs a  strong Europe."    In this context, [Justice Minister] Pierre Mehaignerie also  wanted the majority "not to be unaware of those who voted  against Maastricht" and called for "intelligent safeguards" at  the gates of the European Union. This is a way of holding out a  hand to the RPR and UDF voters tempted by Philippe de Villiers'  list. In the same sphere, Dominique Baudis said that Europe  should be able to protect its jobs, for instance in the  aeronautics industry, by resisting the Americans in the coming  10 months of "very tough" negotiations.    But a defensive attitude is not enough. European  construction, Centrist Jacques Barrot exclaimed, must serve as a  lever to build "an upright, influential, and masterful France."  And its main objective must be employment, Valery Giscard  d'Estaing strongly emphasized, hinting that the European  institutions "would have done better to devote more energy to  employment and less to expansion."    Now that the message of unity and hope has been launched,  the  majority party leaderships will resume their detailed diplomatic  work to draw up the list of 87 candidates to be submitted to the  voters on 12 June.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT TO OIL CONJURES UP SPECTER OF '70S STAGFLATION  </P> <P> Iraq's seizure of Kuwait's oil facilities has revived an economic specter that  vanished with the gas lines of the 1970s: stagflation, a U.S. economy squeezed  between rising consumer prices and sinking business activity.  </P> <P> As was the case with the 1973-74 Middle East oil crisis, oil prices now  threaten to push up inflation at a time of growing unemployment and economic  sluggishness. Indeed, the word stagflation -- forgotten during the boom years  of the 1980s -- is creeping back into the economic vocabulary.  </P> <P> "There's no question that stagflation is back," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief  economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York.  </P> <P> Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting  center, agreed. Stagflation, he said, "is as good as any word you could use for  this period."  </P> <P> The Middle East conflict adds a note of confusion to a period in which the U.S.  economy tilts precariously close to a recession.  </P> <P> In the latest indicator of the economy's weakness, the Labor Department  reported Friday that unemployment rose to 5.5% in July from 5.2% in June, the  highest level in two years. The economy's rickety shape already had been  underscored by gauges of consumer spending, construction and factory orders in  recent months.  </P> <P> A sharp boost in oil prices -- by drawing away consumer spending and raising  the cost of business -- could throw the economy into a recession, analysts  said. "With the economy already sluggish, that could be enough to make the  difference" and spur a full-blown recession, Ratajczak said.  </P> <P> Rising oil prices and a sluggish economy also pose a dilemma for policy-makers:  If they cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, they could aggravate  inflation even more. But failing to act could lead to a recession. In effect,  stagflation is the worst of both worlds; normally, when economic growth slows,  inflation is not a major threat.  </P> <P> At the same time, analysts are quick to point out important differences between  today and the 1970s, differences that make acute stagflation -- featuring  rampant price hikes -- unlikely.  </P> <P> The U.S. economic machine is less dependent on oil than it used to be, and  inflation remains a much weaker force than in the past. "I don't like to use  the term 'stagflation' because it implies permanence, that we're stuck with  inflation and slow growth," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Fidelity  Bank in Philadelphia. "I don't think we're stuck with it."  </P> <P> A rough rule of thumb holds that a $1-a-barrel hike in the price of oil  translates to a onetime 0.1% rise in consumer prices. Futures prices for West  Texas Intermediate crude oil -- the benchmark U.S. grade -- have shot up $10 a  barrel since June, about half of that in this week alone. Thus some experts  expect the higher oil prices to add as much as 1 percentage point to the  consumer price index, which shows inflation now rising at about a 5% annual  rate.  </P> <P> Compared to the past, such a rise may seem tame. Still, since the invasion by  Iraq, investors have behaved as if the clock were turned back to 1973-74 -- the  period of the first oil shock. On Thursday and Friday, nerve-wracked investors  sent stocks and bonds plummeting.  </P> <P> "Look at what's going on in the markets right now -- they're saying: 'What  happened in 1973?' Let's act accordingly," observed Ratajczak.  </P> <P> Since 1973, however, the world -- and U.S. industry -- have changed. That year,  oil represented 46.9% of total U.S. energy usage, according to the Department  of Energy. By last year, oil's role had slipped to 42.1%. It now takes 28% less  energy to produce $1 worth of goods than it did in 1973, according to Ronald J.  Planting, a senior analyst with the American Petroleum Institute in Washington.  </P> <P> Moreover, today's economic climate is less friendly to inflation than was the  case two decades ago. Wage settlements often fail to keep up with price rises  these days, according to economists -- in marked contrast to an earlier era  when wages and prices seemed to soar in an endless spiral.  </P> <P> The U.S. economy is so listless that even higher prices for gasoline and  heating oil are not expected to set off anything like the double-digit price  hikes of the past. Large regions, including New England and New York, are  already suffering recessions. California and the West have more buoyant  economies, but cutbacks in defense and a poor housing market are taking a toll  on growth.  </P> <P> Because of the varied weaknesses, higher oil prices "are not going to bring  inflation roaring back," maintains Christopher N. Caton, director of  forecasting at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> But some of those concerned about stagflation see the potential for inflation  in a very different light.  </P> <P> Kellner, for example, points out that inflation in various services has risen  substantially over the last year. In the last 12 months, costs for medical care  and public transportation have risen 9.2%. Tuition and other school fees are up  8.1%, he said, in contrast to a 3.8% inflation rate for goods during the same  period.  </P> <P> Others wonder if the inflationary effect of a flurry of statewide tax increases  has been fully recognized. At least a dozen states have raised taxes or fees  for the 1991 fiscal year to get needed income, according to the National Assn.  of State Budget Officers in Washington. California, for example, just  implemented a new 5-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline.  </P> <P> And "a nickel more a gallon is a price increase," said Robert T. Falconer, an  economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a securities firm in New York.  </P> <P> Clearly, a U.S. economy that simultaneously is threatened by inflation and slow  growth becomes a more troublesome creature for U.S. policy-makers than the more  simple, sluggish version before the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, when inflation seemed less of a problem, many analysts  expected the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates to stimulate the  economy. Now -- even though the economy remains dangerously sluggish -- the new  wild card of oil-driven price rises makes lower interest rates a far trickier  matter.  </P> <P> If the Fed pushes interest rates up to fight inflation, "it will create  recession," warns Ratajczak. "If the Fed fights recession, it certifies  inflation -- it makes it happen."  </P> <P> In any case, Fed officials may have some time to ponder the altered state of  affairs. "Oil prices are going to be under pressure for quite some time," said  economist Falconer.  </P> <P> The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in July. D1  </P></p>

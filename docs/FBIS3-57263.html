			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 53 deputies of the Estonian 101-member parliament  on Monday presented the Riigikogu [parliament] a draft statement  on asking parliaments of UN members states to acknowledge that  the Baltic countries were in 1940 occupied and later annexed by  the Soviet Union.    The draft statement also asks the parliaments of the  countries to put pressure on Russia so that the legal successor  of the defunct Soviet Union would condemn the 1940 annexation  and the following genocide against the people of the countries.    Estonian parliamentary foreign relations commission has  discussed the draft twice and a consensus has been achieved  between different parties, Vardo Rumessen from the Estonian  National Independence Party said upon handing over the draft.    Estonia wants international community to understand that the  large number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union is a  direct result of the annexation, following genocide and  Russification.</p>

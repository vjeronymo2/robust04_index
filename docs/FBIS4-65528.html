			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paolo Franchi: "Words and Deeds"] </F>   [Text] A glance at initial opposition reaction to [Prime  Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's investiture speech yields  something for all -- from the charge that the prime minister is  merely a new kind of Doroteo [former conservative Christian  Democratic Party faction] to the criticism of his slight  vagueness with regard to policies, and invectives against the  videocrat who confuses a policy platform with a television  commercial. Of course, in all of these reactions there may be a  grain of truth and justification, and perhaps something more.  But altogether they confirm the following pessimistic  observation: If the winners are still a long way from providing  all the reassurances demanded of them, the losers are even  further away from correctly identifying the nature of their  adversaries and of what kind of opposition they intend to carry  out.    Berlusconi faced three problems. The first was how to make  apparent the characteristics -- liberal in politics and  derestrictive in economics -- of the change of course that his  government intends to impart to the country; and on the whole he  has succeeded brilliantly in this, at least in principle. As  for the specific feasibility of the objectives indicated and the  paths proposed for attaining them, we can only agree with what  the prime minister has asked, namely, that the government be  judged on the basis of its deeds, not on the basis of  preconceptions. This, even though -- and this really is no  minor consideration -- we still refuse to regard as a prejudice  or, worse, as a restriction of the political rights of a citizen  and businessman, the demand, -- with regard to which Berlusconi  still remained rather vague, to say the least -- for guarantees  that will immediately dispel even the suspicion of confusion  between the public interest and private interests.    Berlusconi's second, and more difficult, problem was how to  provide the Italian and international public with strong  reassurances of the democratic reliability of a majority and a  government of which Northern League and especially postfascist  ministers are authoritative members. With regard to the League  members, what benefited Berlusconi even more than his remarks  about the unity and indivisibility of the Italy of the 100  cities and the "respect and interest" to be granted to the  "debate on federalism" was [League ideologue] Miglio's sudden  divorce -- by no means by mutual consent -- from [League  Secretary] Bossi who, according to the League's octogenarian  enfant terrible, is guilty of having sold the federalist  revolution for a mess of pottage.    The problem of the National Alliance is of a different and  thornier kind. Especially the day after the shameful and  intolerable skinhead demonstration in Vicenza, it was truly  justifiable to expect some clearer and more incisive remarks  from the prime minister on the subject of fascism and  antifascism. This, partly and, we are inclined to say, above  all, in order to grant the proper prominence to the most  convincing aspect of Berlusconi's argument, that concerning the  necessity and advisability of proceeding along the path of the  complete "constitutionalization of extremes" if we really do  intend to create a proper two-party system in Italy too.    This in fact leads onto the third problem that Berlusconi  had  to tackle: how to demand from the opposition forces full  legitimization to govern for himself, his majority, and his  government. Though "the difference of historical assessments of  the past" with regard to fascism is not exactly a matter of  academic debate, and even though the League remains an unruly  ally, to say the least, on the whole Berlusconi found the right  words to achieve this. It will not be easy for the Left --  assuming that it aspires to win the next contest to govern the  country -- to maintain the ambiguity of, on the one hand,  promising combative democratic opposition while, on the other  hand, portraying itself as the champion of freedom in jeopardy.  It will be even less easy for the Center opposition, assuming  that it does not intend to form an appendage of the Left, to  ignore the issue with which Berlusconi is directly confronting  it, namely, that of permitting this government, which lacks a  majority in the Senate, to be put to the test. This, without  granting it any political blank checks or jeopardizing its own  votes.    Far be it from us to suggest any particular tactic to the  various forces. But the prospect of a government that governs  and of opposition forces that engage in opposition seems to us  the most realistic and desirable. Certainly much more realistic  and much more desirable -- for everyone -- than the risky  prospect of another election or of messy pseudo-institutional  muddles that would follow the Senate's failure to approve the  government. At least as far as it was in his power to do so,  despite all the shortcomings of his speech, Berlusconi does not  seem to have made such a prospect any more remote. Certainly,  Berlusconi's show of flexibility would have been more convincing  if the majority had not recently attempted such rash moves as  that in connection with the chairmanship of the Senate committee  on authorizations to initiate legal proceedings. It is to be  hoped that words are matched by deeds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Colonel Dainis Turlais, Defense Forces </F> Commander, by Guntis Stamers: "A Running Officer Provokes  Laughter in Peacetime"]    [Text]    [Stamers] Speaking at the Foreign Policy Institute of Latvia  you said that potential threats to our country are currently  greater than the capablity to meet them. The Cabinet of  Ministers at the last moment changed the draft budget, proposing  an increase in resources for the defense forces. Please specify  what steps are anticipated to improve the condition of the  defense forces.    [Turlais] Unfortunately I cannot say anything, because  Latvia  is ruled by a unique situation: the Commander of the Army does  not participate either in assesssing the needs of the defense  forces, nor in dviding up the budget, that is, deciding who  needs the most. In truth the government disinforms the  taxpayers: The sum alloted for defense also includes financing  for various state institutions unrelated to defense. People  conclude that the Army is alloted large sums of money, but I  cannot tell exactly how much. No one has provided an overview of  how much has gone to the army in the previous two years, nor do  I know how much there will be.    It seems to me that the main problem is that the Finance  Ministry has a rather murky idea of what the defense budget  should look like, what it should include, and what its  organizational structure is. The Finance Ministry ought to have  a department, or at least a section, which works with the  military budget. There is no way that a "Soviet" accountant can  develop a state defense budget!    The second problem is that the defense budget, by virtue of  its very size, becomes political; ideology, rather than  practical needs, becomes the determining factor.    [Stamers] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Saeima  Foreign Affairs Commission, has expressed the opinion that as  Latvia's first priority it is essential to secure real control  over our territory, and he has suggested that defense be offered  the means to obtain an anti-aircraft defense system:  Ground-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons. Do you believe  that that is a priority?    [Turlais] Yes. We have discussed these questions with Mr.  Kirsteins. You must understand that a country's borders include  not only the dry land and the sea, but also air space is  included in a coutry's territory. That does not mean that we  must shoot everything down to the ground, but we must know, must  control who finds their way into this airspace--with or without  our permission--and we must implement also security operations.  In turn, about land forces armaments, if there are no anti-tank  devices, we cannot talk seriously about our defense forces, the  Home Guard. We will not challenge tanks with clubs, sticks and  Molotov cocktails alone.    [Stamers] Estonia has decided to buy weapons, this same  kind,  from Israel. When Latvia decides, will it also be Israel?    [Turlais] That's not of primary importance. The question is  a  different one: "Why is Latvia doing nothing?" We both started at  the same time, but now the Estonians have both anti-tank and  anti-aircraft systems and armored transport. The Estonian Army  has the technology; they have mobilized battalions that are able  to function. The Lithuanians are also armed; they have ships,  airplanes with missiles. They are capable of doing something.  Why are we implementing almost nothing? Why have there been no  final decisions on my initiatives to manufacture cartridges, to  purchase weapons?    [Stamers] Do you know the answer to this question?    [Turlais] I think that everyone knows how many shrill  politicians we have who are able to philosophize and talk about  anything, but really do nothing, only create a situation in  which the government does not take practical steps. That is to  an extent the weakness of the government, that everything is  done looking backwards: What will be the reaction? Who will  criticize us? But the country's security interests cannot be  based only on popularity. The election campaign must be  forgotten. We must remember that now there is a government and  it must take responsibilty. It can only be taken by doing. To do  nothing would be irresponsible.    [Stamers] In your opinion are the chief culprits the  indecisive ministers who prepare the budget?    [Turlais] Without a doubt! No one else has state authority  to  supply the army, to purchase weapons. We could go down a  different path, trying to reach an agreement with "Pardaugava,"  to find out if that concern needs an army. If the government  decides to attach the army to some firm, then this firm could be  given the authority to buy weapons, to supply the army. Only one  must ask whether the army would defend the state's interests in  such a case?    [Stamers] Let's discuss the defense forces themselves.  Everybody remembers that there was a review carried out to  clarify their readiness for battle. What has been done since  that time to decrease the length of time necessary for the army  to be ready for battle after a declaration of emergency or war?    [Turlais] I do not know who decided that the length of time  was too long and who wants to set the criteria. To review combat  readiness one must know at least the basics of what that means.  If combat readiness is evaluated based on how quickly and and in  what direction a soldier runs when someone whistles, then the  saying comes to mind: "A running officer in peacetime provokes  laughter, but in wartime he provokes panic."    [Stamers] So then, what are the criteria for combat  readiness?    [Turlais] First of all, the extent to which the army's  material-technical needs are ensured, to execute its  assignments. Secondly, the human factor, or how high is the  level of training for any soldier, from army commander to  infantryman; how well do they understand their assignments, how  prepared are they to carry them out. Thirdly, the effectiveness  of the leadership system. There three factors also establish  battle readiness. If one of them is zero or at only a low level,  then the level of battle readiness, regardless of how high the  other indicators are, will not exceed the level of the lowest  factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, then the rest of  the conditions for battle readiness will not save them. And  similarly, if there is no leadership, then an armed army also  cannot do anything.    To perceive battle readiness in such an illiterate way as  was  done is shameful and unseemly. It does not reflect on the level  of the army, but rather on the level of the Saeima commission,  to examine in such a way and not to draw any conclusions  regarding what the legislators must do to change the situation.    [Stamers] Do you assert that neither the Saeima, nor the  government is taking into account that battle readiness must be  resolved with a complex approach?    [Turlais] I think that they are practically not working in  that way.    [Stamers] A question related to the 10 Jaunuary [1994]  incident. The proposed national security policy, which was  developed by the Defense Ministry, stated that one possible  security threat to Latvia is the conflicting lines of authority  of the Latvian armed services. As was exemplified by the  aforementioned incident, the fact that the municipal police were  given an order by a municipal leader could have led to a  military conflict. What would you suggest and what is being done  to change the situation?    [Turlais] Currently, according to U.N. data, it seems that  there are 186 countries in the world and Latvia, I think, is the  only country in which the Armed Forces are not led by the  Defense Ministry, the government. There are no alternative  solutions: All armed forces must be under the control of the  Defense Ministry. Then at least there will be a specific  responsible official. If a conflict arises, then the Defense  Minister alone will be able to resolve the problem, that would  be his responsibility. But right now, for example, to  disentangle a conflict, first, one must find the Home Guard,  persuade their chief that they have not acted properly and then  the chief tries to recall or influence the Home Guards. Or also  one must seek out the municipal police chief and try to persuade  him that the municipality alone does not make policy, but that  the government, too, has a word. After that there appears a  third power: The municipality chairman, who has established his  own guards and armed them himself.    [Stamers] But in accordance with the Constitution the  President is formally the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.    [Turlais] It is up to him, no doubt, to achieve that in  reality, as well as formally.    [Stamers] Your Ministry is developing the state defense  policy. When will deputies and the press be able to see it?    [Turlais] The mass media also does everything possible to  disinform people and to preclude that to which we aspire. We  have rejected the former Soviet armed forces and security model.  We have turned toward Western Europe, to the democratic states  model, but our consciousness is still hobbling along on both  legs; we think like Communists. You, speaking to me as the  Commander of the Army, are always asking me, "What is the  Defense Ministry doing?" I do not know! The Defense Ministry is  a government institution, which is above the defense forces as  civilian political control. It is concerned with planning  defense policy, with planning and implementing budgets, with  control of the Army. The Army is not a component part of the  ministry. It is time to forget the Soviet model! We have only  the Home Guard under the "Marshall principle," in which there is  nothing above the "Marshall." That is not right. Above all  military forces must be under civilian political control. The  Armed Forces themselves may not establish policy, influence  goverment decrees and dictate conditions.    [Stamers] Good. I will give the previous question to  Minister  Pavlovskis.    [Turlais] Of course, defense policy interests me, too. And  as  a professional I want to say that it should not be exaggerated  with an ominous analysis. I say, if we do not have that, then we  can do almost nothing. In the world everything changes; both our  domestic and our foreign policies are dynamic. What would happen  to ominous analyses? In the time it takes to draft them, print  them, while it goes through the bureaucratic apparatus and comes  to examination to adopt it a month has gone by and the situation  is completely different. In place of that we must try to look at  the future strategically.    There must be people responsible for the country's security:  The Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Saeima, which must pass  laws so that the government, the Prime Minister and the armed  forces can operate. But it cannot be that each deputy dictates  to me to do what he views as the best. Deputies have the right  to use their votes to develop laws, but not to dictate a stance  or their fancies. I would like to find another among the 186  countries in which a deputy arrived at headquarters and sounded  an alarm.</p>

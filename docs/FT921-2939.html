			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Ashdown says poll reform is first aim THE 'first aim' of the Liberal Democrats would be to break free from Britain's outdated electoral system, Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday as he unveiled his party's election manifesto. The 50-page manifesto proposes a system of proportional representation and combines a two-year, job-creating investment programme with measures to stimulate private enterprise. In the event of a hung parliament, the manifesto pledges to 'neither support nor participate' in a government which 'turns its back' on constitutional reform. It backs a single transferable vote system for local, national and European elections, with multi-member constituencies for Westminster MPs. Mr Ashdown dismissed Mr John Major's refusal to embrace proportional representation, saying little attention should be paid to a 'political leader with his back to the wall'. The Liberal Democrats are proposing an increase of 1p on the basic rate of income tax to fund an extra Pounds 2bn in education spending. The party would also abolish the new 20p lower income tax band and increase borrowing by Pounds 2bn to fund Pounds 4bn in extra public investment in the first year to create 400,000 jobs.</p>

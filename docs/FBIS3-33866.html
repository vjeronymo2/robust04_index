[Unidentified correspondent] In the second session of the  Majles, which was held at 1400 hours today, proposals by Majles  committees and deputies regarding the revenues section of the  Budget Bill for next year were debated, and a number of  proposals were approved.    Under the approvals of the session, the average postal  charge  for any package is set at 100 rials, including 25 rials tax.  Also, local and trunk telephone calls will be charged according  to 1372 [1993-4] tariffs. As an incentive to subscribers, the  Communications Company is to adopt special international tariffs  during [off-peak] hours when the company receives international  discounts.    Also, any increase is forbidden in 1373 in prices, taxes,  subscription charges, connection and application charges, and  any other charges relating to electricity, telephone, post and  subscription charge for agricultural water, except for cases  mentioned in the clause. [passage omitted]    Under another approval the equivalent of 50 percent of the  price of properties -- up to 5 trillion rials -- which the  Intelligence Ministry obtains in the course of its legal  activities, which is calculated as the country's general  revenues, is to be placed at the disposal of the ministry.    The Intelligence Ministry is also to pay into the Treasury,  toward the country's general revenues, the domestic and foreign  currency earned in the course of its legal activities, from  financial misappropriations, bribes, and sale of intelligence.    Under another approval the country's overall commercial and  foreign currency policies in 1373 should be such that the total  of the country's foreign currency commitments are 1.6 billion  dollars less at the end of 1373 than they are at the beginning  of 1373.    The Central Bank is also to convert into rials -- 85 percent  at the floating exchange rate and 15 percent at the official  exchange rate at the end of Esfand 1371 [February-March 1992] --  the foreign currency obtained from the sale of every oil  consignment or oil by-products on receipt of the foreign  currency, and pay the sums obtained into the country's general  revenues' account. [passage omitted on headquarters for  reconstruction of war-damaged zones and fisheries to sell some  of their assets and pay the sums into the Treasury; taxes on  various sectors including hotels, tourism, printing, tobacco,  sports, and unspecified airport tax]    In the second session today, a debate on proposals about the  revenues section of the Budget Bill was completed. Approving  and announcing the ceiling of revenues in the Budget Bill for  next year were postponed until tomorrow's session.</p>

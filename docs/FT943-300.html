			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Russia reform plans spark row The Russian government is planning a radical legislative programme for the new session of parliament, starting next week. The emphasis will be on overhauling the state apparatus, developing the legal system to protect rights of the individual, and introducing more effective competition in the economy. But how much of this programme can be pushed through parliament is unclear as the political tension rises with the economy under renewed strain. In an extraordinary interview, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, confirmed that fierce political in-fighting had been taking place behind the scenes and hinted that Mr Yeltsin may be tempted to lurch towards a more authoritarian position. Outlining the government plans, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, the presidential representative in the federal assembly, said there would be also be a series of proposals for reforming the electoral process at both presidential and duma level. But he strongly opposed suggestions that there should be an early presidential election before 1996. 'In the constitution there are fixed terms and they must be respected,' he said. Mr Yakovlev said legislation would focus on the relations between the centre and the regions  -a traditional source of tension throughout Russian history.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: A fair day's work for a fair day's pay is a textbook concept 30 years old Sir, An article by Adrian Furnham ('Moving tale of a fair day's work', March 24) has been brought to my attention. As a follow-up to his interesting article about equity in the world of work, you and he may be interested to know that a theory of equity in employment studies was first published by Elliott Jaques more than 30 years ago. I quote from Equitable Payment (1961): 'There exist shared social norms of what constitutes a fair or equitable payment for any given level of work, these norms being intuitively known by each individual. The totality of these norms constitutes a pattern of equitable differential payment for differentials in level of work carried.' Jaques' research led him to the same view as Professor Furnham that 'people at work need to feel fairly, equitably rewarded . . . and not everybody in a state of inequity feels it because they are underbenefited, some . . . feel it because they are over benefited.' Jaques' approach to equity went beyond reward to what he called 'the work-reward-capacity nexus.' His research - and my own during the last 18 years - has shown that in addition to their intuitive sense of equity in reward, people have a similar sense of equity in the level of responsibility of their work and the level they feel capable of carrying. Further research into and application of the work-reward-capacity nexus has continued at the Brunel Institute for Organisation and Social Studies for the 25 years. It has led to the development of 'career path appreciation' - a procedure for evaluating the current and potential capacity to make those decisions at work that do not make themselves. The need arises when the facts cannot be known, because they are not available, or because there is no time to search for them. In a social and business environment of mounting uncertainty, this quality - commonly described as 'judgment' - is of the essence. Career path appreciation transcends gender, race, education and is widely used throughout the world to realise equity in the work-reward-capacity nexus.

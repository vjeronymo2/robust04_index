			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / People: Hutchinson's visa for new job Four months after leaving Nationwide Building Society when his job disappeared, John Hutchinson has stepped into a new post at Visa International. Nationwide's former corporate strategy director is to become Visa's UK managing director. Hutchinson was employed by Nationwide to develop strat-egies for diversifications such as moves into selling insurance in branches, but lost his post in December when the society decided to concentrate on its core business. The intervening months gave him time to think. 'It is never an easy time when you are casting around trying to sort out the future. But it gave me some time to think about what I enjoyed, and what suited me,' he says. He came to the conclusion that he would like a strategy job connected with credit cards, having headed Lloyds bank's Visa card operations earlier in his career. 'I have been very close to credit cards for a long time,' he says. It also suited Visa to take him on for a new post with responsibility for UK operations within Visa's Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. Hutchinson envisages eventually heading a policy staff of no more than 20 people. Hutchinson will report to Jean-Jacques Desbons, chief executive of Visa International for the region. He will also report to the Visa UK board representing the 43 banks and building societies which wanted a director for Britain.</p>

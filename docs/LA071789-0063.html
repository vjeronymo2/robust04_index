			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BUSH WINS BOFFO REVIEWS; MODEST AGENDA, TACT CITED  </P> <P> At the economic summit that ended here Sunday, as in his visit to Poland and  Hungary that immediately preceded it, President Bush remarked pointedly several  times that he was speaking from the heart, not from note cards.  </P> <P> The contrast with his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, who routinely read from cards  during his highly scripted presidency, was obvious. In his first meeting with  the heads of the six other leading industrial democracies, Bush clearly  established himself as the vigorous and forceful President of the largest  democracy of all.  </P> <P> The reviews were boffo. French President Francois Mitterrand praised Bush as "a  man of great openness and great courtesy in personal relations." Mitterrand,  who attended eight summits with Reagan, said Bush "showed a desire to achieve  good understanding" of issues.  </P> <P> Milan's conservative daily Il Giornale declared: "Bush earned his stripes as  the leader of the Free World." Tokyo's mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun noted  that Bush had made the summit focus on Eastern Europe. In Paris, French TV-1  called the proposal on Eastern Europe "an unprecedented initiative."  </P> <P> As Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark noted, however, Bush's success hinged in  part on the fact that his wish list for the 1989 summit was so modest.  </P> <P> The President displayed the same instinct for conciliation and compromise that  has marked the first six months of his tenure on domestic issues. But just as  in Washington, he has purchased consensus by trimming back some of his goals.  </P> <P> At several earlier summits, the United States went to the table with major  demands -- and usually won them. In 1978, Jimmy Carter pressured reluctant West  Germany and Japan into stimulating their economies to boost their purchases of  U.S. exports. And in 1986, Reagan won the summit's strong condemnation of  Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi and a joint commitment to work harder against  state-sponsored terrorism.  </P> <P> This time, Bush had a more limited agenda, and he stopped short of pressing for  everything on it. On Eastern Europe, his most heartfelt issue, he sought a  clear commitment from West Germany and Japan to increase their aid to Poland  and Hungary -- but when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed to restrict  the action to a call for a meeting of experts, Bush quickly agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Praise From Diplomats  </P> <P> Modest as his agenda may have been, Bush's performance was generally praised by  other diplomats.  </P> <P> Several said they were impressed by Bush's knowledge of foreign affairs and his  low-key and relaxed style of dealing with other leaders. They implied that they  found Bush a welcome contrast to Reagan, who during eight summits was never  regarded as especially knowledgeable in foreign affairs and was considered  formal and rather aggressive in pushing his own agenda.  </P> <P> After watching Bush in action here, a French diplomat turned to a senior State  Department official and said, "It's nice to have a summit where all the leaders  can read and write."  </P> <P> Reagan came into office with virtually no experience in foreign affairs, while  Bush has had years of experience in a variety of top federal posts involving  international issues.  </P> <P> Also, Reagan showed little interest in discussing foreign affairs with other  leaders. By contrast, diplomats found Bush to be a good listener who was  willing to engage in in-depth discussions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enjoys Give and Take  </P> <P> Unlike Reagan, who pretty much stuck to the script written by his aides for  formal discussions, Bush enjoys the give and take of less structured settings  at sessions such as the economic summit.  </P> <P> Referring to himself in his Sunday press conference as "the new boy, the new  kid in school," Bush said that what he found most interesting at the summit was  "the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other leaders, tell  them what you think, listen carefully to what they think."  </P> <P> Demonstrating the kind of self-assuredness that impressed diplomats here, he  said he would like to see more emphasis placed on "that kind of interaction" in  the future. Next year's summit is scheduled to be held in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Ties Help  </P> <P> Personal ties to many members of diplomatic delegations here who are longtime  friends or acquaintances of Bush -- dating back to his days as U.N. ambassador,  envoy to China, CIA director and vice president -- also have played a crucial  role in his diplomacy.  </P> <P> At a reception here, Michele Legendre, wife of French Premier Michel Rocard,  rushed up to Walter J. P. Curley, the U.S. ambassador to France and himself a  friend of Bush's for many years, and asked where she would be able to see the  President; "He's a friend of mine," she said.  </P> <P> "They feel very comfortable with him," said Curley. "He has a penchant for  making friends."  </P> <P> Another Bush acquaintance, Canada's Clark, said: "President Bush performed to  great effect. This is his first summit, but it was far from being his first  exposure to foreign affairs. He comes as close to (being) an expert as you can  get."  </P> <P> Bush's relaxed style apparently contributed to a lack of the tension that has  marred some previous summits.  </P> <P> For the first time, the summit issued a major statement on the need for  international cooperation in protecting the environment, a subject that  apparently held little interest for Reagan.  </P> <P> For Bush, by contrast, the environment has long been a subject of major  interest. Said Clark: "It's clear that Mr. Bush is more inclined to cooperate  with the other leaders on the environmental question."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Rone Tempest and Doyle McManus contributed to this story.  </P></p>

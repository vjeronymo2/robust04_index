In an interview with ROMPRES,  Paslaru added that the PDSR considered the statements made by  Snegur [president of the Republic of Moldova] and Motpan  [president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova] to be  inciting, offending the Romanians everywhere, an attempt at the  country's national integrity, an obvious disconsideration of  public opinion of the Romanian majority in the present Republic  of Moldova. "We however hope these statements are just a  temporary element in the political climate of the Republic of  Moldova. These statements should better not turn into ruling  theses and the optimistic tone of our relations of so far should  be resumed," the PDSR spokesman also said.    The Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] Vice-President  Cornel Brahas assesses as a mistake the fact that the Romanian  authorities recognized officially "this shadow state in  Romania's historical territory. It is an open attempt at our  integrity and a tragical betrayal of the Romanian nation. No  matter what eastern or western chancellories encouraged Snegur  to assume this terrible burden, we must not give in to  defeatism," Cornel Brahas said.    "I have not been taken by surprise by this statement made by  Mr. Mircea Snegur, a good Romanian speaker but not an equally  good Romanian. It was prepared by other political actions which  we ignored when we did not encourage," said Professor Ion Coja,  an outstanding member of the Agrarian Democratic Party of  Romania (PDAR). "What's even worse is that, in a concerted  manner, some sort of declaration of annexation of Romania's  territory to the former USSR is also launched. It is high time  that the president of Romania, the parliament and government  took at long last a stand that should not be criticized by the  future generations of Romanians on either bank of the Prut,"  Professor Ion Coja said.    "The National Council of Reintegration and the National  Party  of Reintegration have decided to `back' Mircea Snegur,  organizing the participation in the referendum of the more than  one million refugees or their descendants, either Romanians,  Jews, Germans, Poles," said Mircea Druc, former prime minister  of the Republic of Moldova, now president of the National Party  of Reintegration. "A referendum of all those who were forced to  leave their native land following the Soviet invasion. In a  near future, we will convene also a world congress of all  refugees because we too, want to be a part of `Snegur's people'  summoned to the referendum," Mircea Druc said.    "Mircea Snegur has proved he has remained a cent [as  received] percent communist and no longer thinks, even for a  moment, that he is Romanian," said Ion Diaconescu,  vice-president of the Christian Democratic National Peasant  Party.    "For him, the notion of Romanian is completely subordinated  to the political creed for which he has campaigned for a  lifetime. His theses are communist, they were Stalin's as well  and he keeps them because he grew up with them.    "Nobody imposes Romania's union with Bessarabia by force,  but  to go as far as declaring that Romanians and Moldovans are  different peoples is a nonsense launched by communists which  Mircea Snegur, as a truthful disciple, has adopted."</p>

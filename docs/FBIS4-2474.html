			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou, capital  of southern China's fast-booming Guangdong Province, has made an  environmental protection blueprint, aiming to turn the city into  a clean and tidy international metropolis in 15 years.    Its industrial structure and regional distribution of  industries will be readjusted. Enterprises in the urban areas  that cause environmental pollution and bother local residents  will be relocated to the south-east of the city.    New development zones and new industrial projects can not be  started unless approved in accordance to the environmental  appraisal system.    The 15-year blueprint also rules that new and advanced  technology and equipment should be used to avoid air pollution.  Industrial sectors with high economic returns and lower  pollution will be granted priority.    A group of infrastructure facilities to treat existing  pollution in water, air, refuse and noise will be constructed,  according to the plan, which was recently adopted by the  municipal government.    Some 12 large ventures that bring severe water pollution  will  be renovated and a series of sewage water treatment plants will  be constructed. Smog and other forms of air pollution will be  put under control. Solid garbage treatment plants and  garbage-burning electric power plants will be built.    By 2005, air and water pollution will be effectively curbed  and the recycling rate of solid waste will reach 80 percent.  Green-coverage will top 45 percent by then. Noise pollution in  urban areas will be reduced, according to the plan.    A major city in the Pearl River Delta, with urban population  topping 3.73 million, Guangzhou has witnessed a rapid growth in  its economy in the past few years. Last year, the city achieved  a total industrial output value of 92.679 billion yuan, up 30.44  percent compared with the previous year.    However, environmental problems have also become  increasingly  serious. Air pollution due to the burning of coal and exhaust  emissions worsened. River water is widely contaminated with  organic substances, and solid waste has increased rapidly, local  officials said.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Tajikistan power upheaval as Nabiyev resigns MR Rakhmon Nabiyev resigned yesterday as president of Tajikistan in the first power upheaval in the central Asian republics since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Looking strained and speaking in a shaking voice, he said in a televised statement that he was resigning to stabilise the political situation and halt 'fratricide' between rival clans in the south of the republic. He was then shown signing a resignation statement. Diplomats and journalists said it appeared that he had resigned under duress. A Reuter correspondent at Dushanbe airport saw him being driven away, escorted by troops of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Tajik interior ministry. His whereabouts last night were not known. Mr Nabiyev was taken away after holding several hours of talks at the airport with government and parliamentary leaders who declared no confidence in him last week and demanded that he quit. Three tanks and seven armoured personnel carriers surrounded the airport to protect Mr Nabiyev after opposition members with guns and grenades seized part of the complex and several shots were fired. He had gone to the airport to travel to the north for talks with local leaders. The talks took place in a VIP lounge guarded by paratroopers and crack soldiers, while the tanks took up position in front of the terminal with their guns pointing directly at it. Earlier yesterday Mr Nabiyev, communist leader from 1982 to 1985, who was elected president last November, had reappeared for the first time since armed opponents stormed the presidential palace a week ago to demand his resignation. Mr Nabiyev's removal leaves four political groups vying for power, of which two are Islamic, well organised and apparently popular.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA SAYS HE WANTS TO GO TO MOSCOW TO REASSURE SOVIETS  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday that he wants to visit Moscow to  reassure the Soviet Union about historic reforms that reinstate his banned  union and allow Poland's first free elections since World War II.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go there to agitate or irritate but to seek understanding for  the Polish reforms . . . in a way that will not be suggestive or stir things  up," Walesa told a news conference.  </P> <P> The reform package signed Wednesday by Walesa and Minister of Internal Affairs  Czeslaw Kiszczak will make Solidarity legal again, permit independent political  clubs and bring the opposition into Parliament.  </P> <P> It will also create a democratically elected Senate with a limited veto right  over legislation -- the first free legislature in Eastern Europe since the  Communist takeover after World War II.  </P> <P> A senior Walesa aide said the Solidarity leader will probably visit Moscow but  that Soviet officials have asked for assurances that he will not cause problems  before extending an invitation.  </P> <P> Walesa told the news conference he wants to assure Moscow that the  Solidarity-led opposition in Poland does not want to cause a disturbance in  Eastern Europe or upset the perestroika (reform) process of Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "We would like to resolve our problems and not disturb anyone, . . . above all,  don't disturb," he said.  </P> <P> This amounts to a pledge that a reborn Solidarity will not repeat the turbulent  challenge to Communist rule that it mounted in 1980-81, alarming the Kremlin  and bringing about the imposition of martial law.  </P></p>

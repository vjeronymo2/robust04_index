			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / MPs urge more economic debate Senior Tories are adding their weight to Labour calls for the government to earmark more time for debating economic issues as part of a package of parliamentary reforms. Sir Terence Higgins, MP for Worthing and chairman of the liaison committee of select-committee chairmen, is worried that the move to a unified Budget has resulted in fewer appearances before MPs by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Sir Terence, a highly respected senior backbencher, used a recent Commons debate to say that he could not remember an occasion in the last 30 years when a chancellor had gone as long as seven months without addressing the Commons. He described the move to a unified Budget as 'pretty disastrous' in procedural terms. 'As a result of that change, opportunities to debate the most important area of policy - economic policy - have been seriously eroded,' Sir Terence said. His comments come as talks between the two main parties aimed at coming up with a package of procedural reforms are said to be making headway. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, told MPs before the summer recess that 'good progress' on identifying a package of reforms had been made - although 'a good deal of detailed work remains to be done'. His feelings were echoed by Mr Nick Brown, his Labour shadow, who said he hoped proposals could soon be put to MPs 'that may well apply in the next session'. The number of late-night sittings and the format of prime minister's questions are understood to be among the subjects the two sides are discussing. The reform initiative followed a call by Mr John Major, the prime minister, last month for some of parliament's antiquated procedures to be overhauled. The government is hoping to introduce a controversial bill increasing Britain's contribution to the European Union budget early in the next parliamentary session, starting in November, having been prevented from legislating in the last session by a dispute in the EU council of ministers. The bill - giving force to changes in the EU's funding system in line with the agreement at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 - is almost certain to be opposed by Tory Euro-sceptics.</p>

To meet the needs of markets, farmers in the coastal  province  last year expanded areas under vegetables to 635,000 ha, turning  out 24 million tons of vegetables in the same period.    The paper noted that the province has paid attention to  forming a package of services.    The provincial government has set up 470 vegetable wholesale  markets, and concluded contracts on vegetable production and  marketing with 230 cities last year.    While training farmers in new agricultural technology, the  provincial government has encouraged scientific workers to go to  the rural areas to spread scientific farming techniques.    It also helps farmers to import more than 100 varieties of  vegetables.    Moreover, 15 farmers have been sent to grow vegetables in  Russia.</p>

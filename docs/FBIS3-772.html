			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel's declaration of  52 magisterial districts as unrest areas -- which was also  lifted at midnight -- has been a selective implementation of his  powers, because he did not include districts where there has  been current violence. By doing so he is indeed giving the ANC  [African National Congress] an opportunity in these areas to  continue its revolution unhindered.</p>

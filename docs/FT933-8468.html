			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Canada hails victory on Nafta talks CANADA'S Progressive Conservative government is congratulating itself on a big political victory in persuading the US to give Canada special treatment under the new environmental and labour side-accords to the North American free trade agreement. With prime minister Kim Campbell expected to call a general election within the next few weeks, the deals have given her another opportunity to distance herself from the unpopular, pro-Washington record of her predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. Under a last-minute compromise, Canada won the right to refer environmental and labour disputes to its domestic courts as a last resort, rather than face a suspension of Nafta trade benefits. At the end of last week, Mr Tom Hockin, Canada's trade minister, said: 'I could not tolerate that option for Canada because we negotiated Nafta to knock down trade barriers.' As a result of a compromise reached at close to midnight on Thursday, any dispute involving a Canadian company will be referred in the last resort to the Canadian courts. Mr Hockin said all three governments envisaged that trade sanctions and referral of disputes to the courts 'will hardly ever happen'. Canadian trade officials however, have played down the importance of the dispute-settlement mechanism in the side-deals. They said the strength of the deals lay more in the machinery for co-operation and consultation than in their punitive measures. The dispute settlement mechanism can be invoked only in cases where it appears that one of the three governments is consistently failing to enforce the labour or environmental standards set down in domestic law. Although companies and individuals will be able to submit complaints, only the three governments will be able to invoke the complex dispute settlement mechanism. Action against individual polluters falls outside the scope of the side-agreements and remains the responsibility of the host government. The Canadian parliament has already passed legislation implementing Nafta. It will not be proclaimed law however, until the agreement has been ratified by the US and Mexico. The side-deals will require only a minor amendment to an existing law. However, Canada's provinces, which have jurisdiction over large areas of labour and environmental policy, will not be bound by the agreements until they sign on. The opposition Liberal party said the side-agreements failed to satisfy its objections to Nafta. A spokesman said a Liberal government would seek to renegotiate the agreement to give Canada a better deal on such issues as energy, subsidies and dispute settlement.</p>

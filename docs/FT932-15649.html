			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Germany yearns for realpolitik - James Morgan detects envy for Britain's policy of self interest THIS IS the time of year when we look to new beginnings, prospects seem brighter. The Easter message of 'cheer up' makes tentative inroads on today's all-enveloping gloom. But even so, the bleakness of the European situation renders it hard to sustain even a seasonally adjusted upsurge of optimism. Fortunately the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is there to show us that many mountains may be no more than molehills. And its readers help out in this endeavour. Thus a Herr Klaus P Lucke wrote to the paper the other day about the situation in the former Yugoslavia. He had noted that the attempts of the German army to intervene in the local crisis of 1941 had often been portrayed in an unfavourable light. The Germans had, it was generally alleged, bitten off more than they could chew. But, wrote Herr Lucke, 'The Yugoslav campaign did not last even two weeks. On the German side there were only 151 losses to complain about. The French historian, Raymond Cartier wrote in his standard work, The Second World War, that this campaign occasioned 'fewer losses than a single weekend on the roads of Europe at peace'.' The lesson is clear and I expect you are feeling better already. But in the German press anything that cheers is counterbalanced by a searing attack on what the naive might have supposed to be a promising development. Thus the agreement of last weekend between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin occasioned some incoherent reflections from an embittered Hamburger Abendblatt: 'The DM2.56bn approved by President Clinton is in fact nothing more than the famous drop in the ocean when set against the 80bn Bonn has shovelled into the East. But then the Americans did not lose the second world war . . . Secondly in the USA there are no CIS soldiers for whose removal Bonn would pay any price (sic). And third Washington is four times as far from Moscow as is Bonn and is not so afraid of the collapse of the democracy movement as is Germany.' These long extracts highlight a problem facing western Europe today - what is Germany for? The old West Germany had a clear role: a milch cow, an Aunt Sally to be knocked down by references to its unsavoury predecessor and a good friend in time of need. A mammoth Switzerland in human form. Now that the time has come for a bit of self-assertion, the traditions of more than 40 years forbid it. Geopolitical ambition degenerated into farce in a constitutional court case which was supposed to resolve the question, 'should Germans fly over Bosnia?' Always a tricky question, and the future of the government could hang on it. But this kind of strife is a bit odd in a country which would like to be a permanent member of the Security Council where macho self-assurance used to be a necessary if not sufficient condition of membership. So it was that the FAZ had another good ruminate about German power. It quoted the British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd enviously: 'British foreign policy has the task of protecting and promoting British interests. In spite of the changes in the world nothing has changed this basic truth. The question of what are British interests must be answered anew by each generation.' The FAZ noted that this was a classic 'national-state declaration' and added: 'It is hard to imagine such a policy statement coming from the mouth of a German Chancellor.' I tested this view on a number of Germans, handing them the German text and putting deutsche in place of britische. The consensus was that the statement had been either a sober assessment of reality on the part of Bismarck or a drunk one from the lips of the present foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel. All agreed that no German politician could speak of the country's national interests without the addition of some rambling Euro-rhetoric, but that Germany was gradually moving towards a position where a Bismarckian statement could be made, and never mind foreign wincing. The Frankfurter Allgemeine added its bit of Euro-rhetoric, emphasising that Germany's prosperity depended on the Community's markets. But what Germany suffers is by no means unique. In spite of the bold clarity of Douglas Hurd's statement of principle, there is no clear view in any large country about the definition of its 'national interest.' In the old days, if it was only natural for Germany to attack Serbs, it was also right for the French to help the Serbs. The British would check to see whose victory appeared the less desirable and come down on the other side. The US would see profitable opportunities in keeping out of trouble while the Russians reckoned on consolidating their hold on anything they could grab. Those old certainties may have been flawed, leading to world wars and suchlike, but at least we knew where we were. Today's generation, in Britain especially, would be no better off than the Germans in agreeing on a clarion call to mobilise the nation. I propose, 'Half a treaty is better than a strong pound.'

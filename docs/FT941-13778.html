			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Premium fuss Sir, I recently travelled from Gatwick to London Victoria on a premium-priced Gatwick Express Capital Card ticket. As I was later in the London Bridge area it made sense to return from there, I thought. The ticket collector on the train, however, said I had no right to do so. My ticket was not valid on the ordinary (cheaper) train. After much fuss - and no doubt observing my advanced age and strong protest - he said he would let me off this time. Is this, in fact, the privatisation of BR in advance? Is it a taste of confusion and battles to come? Bill McMillan, 36 Hill House Close, Turners Hill, West Sussex</p>

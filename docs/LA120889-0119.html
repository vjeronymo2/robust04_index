			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HANFORD;  </P> <P> MIGRATORY BIRD ACT VIOLATIONS ALLEGED  </P> <P> F &amp; F Fisheries of Hanford and its manager, Dennis Faria, have been charged  with killing migratory birds, a violation of federal law, authorities said. F  &amp; F Fisheries, a commercial catfish farm, and Faria were accused of four  counts of violating the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal  investigators said the carcasses of 41 identifiable waterfowl protected under  the federal law were found on the F &amp; F Fisheries property during a search  last February. Investigators said they believe that the birds were killed to  prevent them from eating the catfish raised at the fishery. Court officials  said that, if convicted, Faria and the fishery could be fined up to $20,000 for  each of the four counts, and Faria could face a jail term.  </P></p>

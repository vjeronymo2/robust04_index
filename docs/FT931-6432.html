			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Beijing quashes HK voting role HONG KONG was yesterday given a glimpse of its future ruler's intentions when a senior Chinese official ruled out publicly a role for Hong Kong in determining arrangements for its 1994 and 1995 elections. In so saying, Mr Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (cabinet), made it plain that China's key concern with Governor Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy was not only with their substance but the thought that the Legislative Council, the colony's lawmaking body, might have a part in determining them. In an impromptu but carefully scripted meeting with Hong Kong's media in Beijing, Mr Lu said Britain would have to guarantee that Hong Kong's Legislative Council go along with any Sino-British deal. 'If not, then you don't need to talk. What use is it?' he said. Mr Lu, who by most accounts is well informed on Hong Kong matters, must know that such a precondition to talks is one the British government and Mr Patten could not agree to and is, indeed, impossible to guarantee. As Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said in an interview published in Sunday's South China Morning Post: 'The constitutional position is clear: the Legislative Council is responsible for enacting the legislation for the 1994 and 1995 elections. We will stand by LegCo's decision.' Mr Lu must also have known that Mr Hurd's position was firmly based in reality. In late 1991, LegCo threw out a deal that Britain and China had made on the Court of Final Appeal - the court which will become Hong Kong's highest appellate court after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. This issue still sits in limbo awaiting either renegotiation with China or a change of heart in LegCo. Hong Kong has been in thrall to daily reports of 'talks about talks'. They have dominated local newspapers ever since Chinese officials leaked the news that the two sides were discussing the possibility of dialogue three weeks ago. The stock market has taken heart ever since. Yesterday the blue-chip Hang Seng index ended 46.83 points, or 0.74 per cent, higher at 6,398.82 - a whisker short of its all-time high of 6,447 in November. But as the 'talks about talks' drag on, China appears more and more to be manoeuvring. A month ago Mr Patten's Executive Council, his highest advisory body, signed off his proposed legislation without amendment. Only then did China hint that it might be prepared to accept Mr Patten's offer of talks made as far back as last October. The past three weeks have been difficult for Mr Patten and his government and have cast him on the horns of a dilemma. There is widespread support in the community for Sino-British dialogue and Mr Patten does not want to be seen as the party who scuppered talks before they had a chance of starting. But the longer he delays the greater the risk he faces of losing the momentum that has built up behind his proposals and the support he has in the legislature and the community. Last week, after his third delay in introducing the legislation into LegCo, an adviser said Mr Patten had to go 'an extra mile' to show Britain's sincerity in offering talks. But after Mr Lu's demarche yesterday, he may be advised that it was 'a mile too far'.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM steady on M3 growth news NEWS of higher than expected German monetary growth led to early strength in the D-Mark and a slightly weaker dollar yesterday, writes Peter John. However, currencies were trading within a very narrow range and were principally controlled by technical factors. The market had been hoping that Germany's M3, the measure of money that includes cash savings and long-term deposits of up to four years, would show an annualised growth of around 8.5 per cent. Yesterday's strong May figure of 9 per cent, compared with April's 8.9 per cent, meant growth remained well above the Bundesbank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent 1992 target and dashed hopes of an imminent interest rate cut. Nevertheless, Mr Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank, remained broadly optimistic. 'Money supply is not the only thing the Bundesbank looks at,' he said. 'They are also keeping an eye on the level of unemployment and the relatively slow industrial production growth and it seems likely that there will be a cut, just later than anticipated.' The D-Mark rose against most key currencies in early trading on a flurry of buying. Then, a number of dealers found themselves unnecessarily long by the afternoon and began to adjust their books. The German unit closed unchanged against the dollar at DM1.566 and marginally softer against the pound at DM2.917. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.5662. The US currency was propped up by what one dealer called 'the increasingly discounted drip feed of optimism from the Federal Reserve'. It closed steady against the pound at Dollars 1.863 The market also concentrated on stronger signs from Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party of an impending boost in fiscal expansion, either through increased spending on public works or via tax cuts. As a result the yen was steady against the pound at Y237 and practically unchanged against the dollar. Dealers said sterling moved very much in line with the dollar and was likely to edge lower in line with the US currency in the absence of fresh domestic factors. The lira, which had regained ground after a week-long battering on international markets, gave the Bank of Italy enough room to let short-term rates ease, but further falls depended on the political outlook, analysts said. At yesterday morning's repurchase tender, the minimum accepted rate fell to 14.15 per cent, down 65 basis points from the highs it touched last week as fears of a devaluation swept the market. However, an Italian economist commented: 'Do not expect repurchase rates to go far under 14 per cent for the moment.'</p>

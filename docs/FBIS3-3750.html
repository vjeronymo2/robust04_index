			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Wang </F> Haizheng (3769 3189 1767)]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] ended in Beijing  today.    During the 13-day session, deputies from various parts of  the  country spoke freely in discussing state affairs, they offered  advice and made suggestions on reform, and they exercised their  sacred rights. When the deputies left the Great Hall of the  People, what were they thinking about? These reporters  interviewed more than 10 deputies at the hall's eastern exit.  <H3>  "Realism Is the Biggest Characteristic of This Session; We  Will Take the Realistic Spirit to Our Work" </H3>   Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju told these reporters: This NPC  session was a success, and deputies fully expressed their views  while discussing state affairs. Their abilities in  participating in and discussing government affairs were greatly  improved. I feel the biggest characteristic of this session was  realism. When we return to our posts, we will take this  realistic spirit to our work. Shanghai is small in area. We  must take a conscientious and realistic approach and try in  every possible way to improve our efficiency. Pudong should  complete its basic development tasks two years ahead of schedule  and then continue to accelerate its development in a  down-to-earth manner. We should build more new- and  high-technology projects in Pudong.    What will Guangdong, as the country's comprehensive  experimental area in reform and opening up, do next? Deputy Zhu  Senlin, governor of Guangdong Province, said: We are fully  confident of the future. At the same time, we also clearly see  contradictions and problems ahead, and we should keep a clear  head and foster a sense of being prepared for hardships. Upon  return to Guangdong, we will carefully organize people to  implement reform measures on the one hand and vigorously arouse  and encourage the masses to undertake construction with one  heart and one mind on the other. We will work hard in a  down-to-earth way and strive to basically build the framework of  the socialist market economic structure in five years.  <H3>  "Opportunity Shows No Favoritism to Anyone, and the Key Is  To Seize It" </H3>   Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng said: Liaoning is the oldest  industrial base built by the state during the planned economy  period, and it is also the last to get off the orbit of planned  economy. Reforms are being carried out across the country in an  all-round way this year, and market forces are playing an  increasingly important role. This has created a golden  opportunity for Liaoning. Liaoning people should firmly seize  this opportunity and vigorously start undertakings. We should  adapt ourselves as soon as possible to the needs of the  socialist market economy in concept, management, and operation.  While reforming or transforming large and medium state-owned  enterprises, we should accelerate the development of new- and  high-technology industries; village and town enterprises;  individual and private enterprises; neighborhood collective  enterprises; tertiary industries; and high-yield, high-  efficiency, and high-quality agriculture and strive to  revitalize Liaoning as an industrial base.    Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping from the vast northwest of  the country said: This NPC session paid close attention to  economic development in the central west of the country. This  year, the state will implement a plan for helping people free  themselves from poverty. Society is concerned about and  supports our less developed areas. More importantly, the market  economy has provided us with favorable conditions for  "exploiting our natural resources, freeing ourselves from  poverty, and becoming prosperous." It can be said that we in  the central west of the country have even a greater opportunity  for development. The key to seizing this opportunity lies in  our acting according to reality, deepening reform, and working  hard to start enterprises, in addition to assistance from the  state.  <H3>  "Good Policies and Measures Should Be Implemented to the  Letter" </H3>   Deputy Li Yuxiang, of the Yi nationality from Sichuan, said:  Before liberation, I begged for food when I was seven years old.  I have been excited by attending the NPC session in Beijing as  a deputy. Both the general secretary and premier stressed  agriculture. This is very good for us farmers. I hope that the  state will substantially increase investment in agriculture.  After I return to Sichuan, I will mobilize people to carry out  capital construction on farmland. Our village will build three  ponds to store water this year. Meanwhile, we will plant trees  in a big way for the purpose of water and soil conservation. As  a NPC deputy, I must accomplish something.    Deputy Feng Jie, Zhangjiapu village committee director of  Wangjiadian Township in Huangzhou city, Hubei Province, said: I  felt warmed while attending the 13-day NPC session. The central  authorities said every possible effort would be made to increase  farmers' incomes this year, which really warmed our hearts. The  price scissors between industrial and agricultural products have  become bigger and bigger these years. If this goes on, who  still wants to do farming. Then, how can rice sacks be filled?  This time, the state decided to readjust the prices of grain,  chemical fertilizers, diesel oil for agricultural use, and  pesticides, which is good news to us. I just hope that the  government will implement its agricultural policy to the letter.</p>

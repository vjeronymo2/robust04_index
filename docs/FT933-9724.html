			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Fashion: Dressed to thrill THE best thing about having a husband who arrives home with an armful of expensive carrier bags whose swathes of tissue paper whisper glamour is - the husband. But this page is concerned with fashion, rather than romance or virtue, so I will confine my observations to the clothes. The second best thing about having clothes chosen by your spouse is that you are obliged to try colours and designs that are normally outlawed by your own prejudices, often for no sound reason. Thus my first Betty Jackson ensemble, in a shade of green I would never even have fingered, was one of my most admired during its first outing nearly a decade ago, and has just (sorry, Betty) been reconditioned for re-use in the economical 1990s. And my most useful garment last summer was the red Hong Kong dress which had bare shoulders and long, tight sleeves, a combination, I would have thought - quite wrongly as it turned out - which would have made it unsuitable both when it was too hot or too cold. In fact the stretchiness of the fabric means you can pull the whole thing up around the neckline if necessary. I have always been thrilled by these surprises, but sometimes appalled by the extravagance. The brace in dramatic red velvet has been particularly difficult to amortise sufficiently to appease the conscience of one brought up to believe in the virtues of parsimony. I wonder where that vendeuse is now? The price tag that made me most uncomfortable was that spent on Jean Muir (and this was from her cheaper, Studio range.) The fishy jacket is wonderful and will doubtless be worn for many years, but the simple black top and skirt were ludicrously overpriced and a duplicate of what most women have already. Perhaps I should have saved a few hundred pounds by quietly taking them back. But exchange seems a brutal response to a gift. All I would say to men who buy clothes for women is this: size matters. Snoop for clues on labels of tops and bottoms already in her wardrobe. Most British women are somewhere in the 10 to 16 range. It is as humiliating to be bought something too big (implying that he sees you as an elephant) as it is to model something for him with a gaping zip. Try to choose things where fit is not so crucial. Rigid waistbands and figure-hugging tailoring are much riskier than looser jackets. Knitwear, scarves, shawls and wraps, anything stretchy and accessories (other than shoes) all make better bets.</p>

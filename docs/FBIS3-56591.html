The statement advises the Saeima to abstain from interstate  agreements with Russia if they grant Russia rights to keep any  military bases or other property in Latvia.    Lawmakers should check whether the Cabinet and lower  administrative structures take into account the viewpoint of  local governments when carrying out municipal reforms.    The local deputies reproached the government for its  reluctance to help them take over Russian military property. The  government also does not reprimand the local governments that do  not perform their duty of property takeover.    The government has not adopted any normative acts to  regulate  the actions by takeover commissions in situations when Russian  military persons exert non-violent or armed resistance, or  threaten with armed resistance, the local council said.    The government has not done anything to prevent plunder and  unlawful sale of former military property, the group added.    The local deputies are also displeased with the government's  reform policies. The reforms primarily target the expansion of  Cabinet's powers, thus, nearing Latvia to an authoritarian model  of state administration, they said.    As reported, the Vidzeme District Council endorsed the Jan.  10 actions by its former Chairman Andrejs Rucs. Rucs acted  "correctly and reasonably," when detaining the two Russian  generals, it said.</p>

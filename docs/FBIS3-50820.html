			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Grecco] </F>   [Excerpts] The long-standing friendship between Vice  Admiral Juan Carlos Anchezar, retired, and the Anzorregui family  [Hugo Anzorregui is SIDE's secretary], and his excellent  personal relationship with Eduardo Bauza [secretary general of  the presidency], were instrumental in catapulting him into the  Secretariat for State Intelligence (SIDE) as Anzorregui's  second-in- command.    The incumbent Interior Ministry under secretary for  intelligence is Police Superintendent Jose Roberto Scopa,  retired, who will leave on 1 February. [passage omitted]    "Well what do you think of that, Jorge?" was what Vice Adm.  Anchezar said to the brother of SIDE's secretary, Jorge  Anzorregui, when he was offered Scopa's post.    Jorge Anzorregui, a criminal lawyer who goes about the  corridors of the courthouse invariably greeting whomsoever he  comes across, has been a friend of Vice Adm. Anchezar for some  years now. Anzorregui advised him to accept his bother's offer.    SIDE's secretary met with the vice admiral in Punta del Este  on 3 January. There, after coming to an agreement, the admiral  accepted the offer.    The road traveled by the members of Argentina's intelligence  service community is well known to Vice Adm. Anchezar, a Navy  pilot who failed by an inch to be appointed chief of the Joint  General Staff when Italo Luder was defense minister at the  beginning of the Menem administration. Having been  outmaneuvered by Admiral Emilio Osses in this endeavor, Vice  Adm. Anchezar retired. In any case, he was awarded a  consolation prize -- he was nominated director of State  Shipyards and Naval Factories (AFNE).    Vice Adm. Anchezar had for several years held the post of  deputy chief of the Navy Intelligence Department, located on the  fifth floor of the Libertad building -- the Navy General Staff  headquarters.</p>

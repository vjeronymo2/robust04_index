			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "German Fiscal Policy Is on the Right </F> Track"]    [Text] Dusseldorf, 16 Jun -- In its monthly report for  June 1994, the Bundesbank indicates that fiscal policy is on the  right track. Significant progress has been achieved in the  consolidation of public funds. Yet, this progress has mainly  resulted from an increase in taxes and rates, which is quite  problematic, considering that the burden is already extremely  high by international standards.    A strict expenditure regime is absolutely necessary to  reduce  the public share in the national product and the tax and rate  burden. The growth rate of public expenditure should come to  remain below the normal rate of increase of the GNP.    The Bundesbank expects the 1995 expenditure ratio to be some  45 percent of the GNP, compared with 42.5 percent in 1989, and  40.5 percent in 1990, the year of the tax reform. The framework  conditions for economic growth require that the tax and rate  burden be gradually reduced again in the future. Taxation of  companies will be of particular importance in this process, the  Bundesbank report says.    In the view of the Bundesbank, the 1994 deficits of local  authorities will be roughly the same as in 1993 (some 135  billion German marks [DM]). Although the economic trough is  expected to be overcome soon, the tax yield will remain modest  at an expected increase of 5 percent. Without the increase in  petroleum tax, which will finance the railroad reform, the  growth in tax revenues would be just under 4 percent. This  forecast is based on the assumption that in 1994 the German GNP  will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms, and by 4 percent in  nominal terms.    The 1994 deficit of the local authorities will also include  the expected DM6 billion deficit of the newly established  federal railroad structure, but it does not include the Trust  Agency deficit, which will reach DM44 billion. The local  authorities' net credit requirement for 1994, including that of  the Trust Agency, will be some DM175 billion, which is 5.5  percent of the GNP.    The 1995 tax revenue estimation is based on the assumption  that the German GNP will grow by 4.5 percent in real, and 2.5  percent in nominal terms. Compared with a previous estimate of  May 1993, which had expected 6-percent and 3-percent growth  rates, the 1995 tax estimate has had to be lowered by DM21  billion.    The Bundesbank says: "Since the new projection mainly  adjusts costs downwards, and not so much expectations of real  growth, this does not have such a big impact on the state's  fiscal situation as might be suspected at a first glance at the  new tax estimation."    As the Trust Agency in its present form will cease to exist  at the end of 1994, the enormous Trust Agency deficits will no  longer be included. "In this comprehensive view, the coming  year might see a considerable step towards consolidation," with  all its consequences, including those of slowing down the growth  of money supply.    The national pension insurance is expected to achieve a  DM4-billion deficit in 1994, which would be only half the 1993  figure. For funding, the pension insurance can fall back on its  fluctuation reserves, which will have reduced to DM31 billion by  the end of 1994. A west-east transfer of some DM13 billion is  expected within the pension insurance in 1994.    The financial situation of the Federal Employment Office is  slowly beginning to improve, although there is still a high  deficit. In 1994 the Federal Employment Office will face a gap  of some DM18 billion, which will have to be filled by government  funds. In terms of the federal budget, this means that the  burden will ease by DM6.5 billion compared with last year.  West-east transfer in this field is DM15 billion.</p>

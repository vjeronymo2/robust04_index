			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (8): A cherished ambition - Richard Bauer assesses Bolivia's role as an energy exporter Bolivians are sloughing off their century-old dismay at being landlocked. Suddenly, the condition is perceived as a positive asset. 'We aim to become the natural gas distribution hub for the southern cone of Latin America,' says Mr Mauricio Gonzalez, president of the state-owned petroleum company YPFB. Mr Claude Besse, adviser to the government on the capitalisation of state power company Ende, is in equally optimistic and expansionist mood. 'We want to use our geographical position to satisfy growing demand for electric energy in surrounding countries which have poor supply and high prices,' he says. The idea of serving both as an energy 'bridge' and exporting gas and electricity to its neighbours has become a Bolivian leitmotiv. 'Macro-economic stability and the possibilities of sustained growth depend in large measure on the health of the hydrocarbons sector,' says Mr Herbert Muller, the former Bolivian energy minister who helped engineer the ground-breaking February 1993 gas export agreement with Brazil. 'The projected gas pipeline will be the engine for Bolivia's economic growth.' Bolivia's proven natural gas reserves of 6-7 trillion cubic feet are enough to meet south-west Brazil's energy needs for the next decade, says Mr Fred Drew of the Santa Cruz office of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian gas exploration and production specialists. Bolivian gas output has been steady at about 500m cu ft a day for the past 12 years. Hydro-electric generation, meanwhile, has scarcely been touched. Presently, only 2 per cent of an estimated 18,000MW potential is exploited. Possibilities for cheap hydro projects abound, according to Mr Julio Leon Prado, founder and president of ICE, Bolivia's largest construction company. He believes local construction costs will be substantially lower than in neighbouring countries. For 22 years past, Bolivia has exported 200m cu ft a day of natural gas to Argentina via a 600km, 24-inch pipeline originally co-financed by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF). The contract expired in 1992 but delivery continues uninterrupted at Dollars 1 per 1mBtu despite recent Argentine deregulation and competition from the local hydrocarbons industry. But Bolivia's cherished ambition is to break into the huge Brazilian market. For years, it has been thwarted by internal squabbles within Bolivian governing elites on the one side and protectionist, oil-burning Brazilian state industry on the other. Now, the two state hydrocarbons companies, YPFB and Petrobras, have reached a 20-year sales purchase agreement. Initially, YPFB will supply 280m cu ft a day rising to 560m cu ft within seven years. But Brazilian demand for natural gas could well increase to 1,500 cu ft a day by the year 2000 and 2,300 cu ft by 2005, says Mr Gonzalez. He predicts: 'There will be Bolivian gas in Sao Paolo by the end of 1997'. The projected 32-inch 1,800km pipeline will run from Bolivia's Rio Grande to Campinhas, 90km west of Sao Paulo. In a second stage, a 420km, 22-inch line would serve the town of Curitiba. And Petrobras plans another 570km line running south from Curitiba to Puerto Alegre. Brazilian-Bolivian negotiating tensions were relaxed by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's personal intervention in August. Now Petrobras will have only a 15 per cent stake in the 560km Bolivian section and 80 per cent in the Brazilian stretch of the pipeline. YPFB will have 85 per cent of its home stretch and 20 per cent of the Brazilian end. Bolivia's partner on both sides of the border will be Texas-based Enron, which has a 40 per cent stake in the YPFB participation. Petrobras, meanwhile, has gone into association with the 'BTB' Group, which holds 25 per cent of the holding for the Brazilian side. 'BTB' comprises BHP, US natural gas company Tenneco and the experienced distributors British Gas. Biggest nuts still to crack are finalising finance for the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.6bn project, the largest of its kind ever in Latin America, and fixing the gas price. The World Bank, meanwhile, still appears reluctant to commit itself to a venture where Petrobras, a state-owned company, holds the majority stake. Industry sources, however, say the pipeline will easily secure private sector financing provided there are adequate guarantees against political risk - particularly against a possible Petrobras pull-out. Analysts say Bolivia could deliver gas to Sao Paulo at a highly competitive rate of les than Dollars 2 per 1mBtu, half the ceiling price it would cost to ship Venezuelan or Nigerian liquefied gas to the region. Bolivia's negotiating position as a purveyor of clean natural gas has been strengthened since the 1992 Rio 'earth summit' boosted ecological awareness in badly-polluted Sao Paulo, according to Mr Muller. A Bolivian government adviser points out another crucial factor: 'The Brazilians have realised that, without Bolivian gas, they'll be suffering energy brown-outs in two or three years.' A similar project for exporting gas to northern Chile is in an advanced stage of planning. The 1,100km Villa Montes-to-Antofagasta pipeline could start delivering to one of Chile's main mining regions by early 1997. A 20-year agreement in principle has been signed between YPFB and Enap, Chile's state oil company. YPFB has entered a joint venture with BHP. The two will split equally a 90 per cent stake in constructing and operating the pipeline, while Enap will take the remaining 10 per cent. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has been selected as financial adviser. While gas exports to Argentina are already two decades old, and new ventures with Brazil and Chile are presently top priority, exporting electrical energy from Bolivia would be a complete innovation. The idea apparently sprang up only recently when state power company Ende was being offered to foreign investors. 'We were told our tiny, 750MW internal market is not attractive enough for overseas bidders,' says Mr Gonzalo Chavez of the energy ministry. 'Investors are seeking opportunities to convert Bolivia into a major electrical energy distributor for the southern cone.' Mr Fernando Campero, a former industry minister and now chief executive officer of Saxxon Capital, a Bolivian stockbrokerage, is more sceptical about this late-in-the-day brainwave. 'They invented the scheme of electrical energy exports to speed up Ende's capitalisation but without proper feasibility studies,' he says. Other experts fear that electricity exports may directly compete with natural gas in little-developed markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Bauer, chairman of the Committee To </F> Organize the Work of the State Duma, by Yevgeniy Skukin: "New  Premises To Bring No Joy"]    [Text] [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, can one  congratulate the Duma on another move?    [Bauer] Hold your horses. Neither the Economy Ministry, nor  the State Committee for Construction, nor the Moscow trade  unions are in a hurry to leave the premises that are being  transferred to us, thereby showing their contempt for the  president's edicts and the government's decrees. In the end  they even organized pickets.    [Skukin] Maybe there is simply nowhere for them to go?    [Bauer] All these organizations have been given sufficient  space. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to personally  supervise their move.    [Skukin] But when they finally go, will the deputies have  all they need for their work, what they were so badly lacking in  the former CEMA building?    [Bauer] Of course, we will not achieve the conditions the  old parliament had in the White House. The State Planning  Committee building is a purely ministerial building; what you  don't have here, for example, is the facilities to receive  visitors and for deputies to relax properly. But it will be  more comfortable than it was! When we get the full 28,000  square meters of space each deputy plus assistant will have a  separate room measuring 17-18 square metrrs, with a telephone  and internal communications. In short, working conditions are  perfectly suitable for the transitional period.    [Skukin] There are many and various rumors about the  extraordinarily high cost of the upcoming refurbishment of the  building. Would it not be cheaper to put up a new building?    [Bauer] We are very well aware that the construction of a  new parliamentary center would be a very expensive luxury. So  we are moving here without any refurbishment, and the Duma  adopted a special decision on this, for the express purpose of  avoiding any misapprehension. We only had to sort out the  conference hall: Install the electronics and all that is needed  for work.    [Skukin] But what did it cost?    [Bauer] The total cost was set at $8 million. The planned  cost of a new parliamentary center was around $500 million. I  believe both the president and parliament will return to this  question in time, because the country, of course, needs a  proper, modern parliamentary center. At the moment we simply  cannot afford one.    [Skukin] The State Duma is accused of adopting too few of  the laws everyone wants.    [Bauer] More than 50 laws are waiting in the wings. They  have already been scrutinized at committee level, and all the  necessary consultations have been conducted. But need we be  hasty in such crucial work? Anyway, the task is impossible: To  adopt 200 laws in two years. It is unrealistic. Nonetheless, I  believe the Duma has the potential to fulfill the hopes pinned  on it by the voters. The main thing is that the documents we  adopt should not be divorced from life and should be fully  functional.    [Skukin] But the Duma law on the procedure for media  coverage of the activities of the organs of authority was seen  by many journalists as a blatant assault on their right to  comment freely on the power structures' activities.    [Bauer] I am opposed to regulation of press activities.  Anyway, you have the courts, which are supposed to be the real  regulators of interrelationships. But that is something we are  not used to at the moment. As a result, the press's financial  dependence on the organs of power, without any law, has already  made them totally subject to the executive authority. Most  provincial papers are becoming toothless. I fear that the same  fate lies in store for the central press. Attempts to criticize  the administration are blocked by the editorial collectives  themselves, worried about their survival. But I believe there  must be criticism of state authority; not abusive, though.  Abroad, for example, there is a very high level of criticism of  parliamentarians, but there is also a high level of media  responsibility. Here, social consciousness acts in one sphere  only -- ferreting out the deputies' shortcomings and revealing  their inadequacies. In so doing I believe journalists are  demeaning themselves: The deputies were elected by the Russian  people with the help of those very same Russian media.    But I hope that now, with the move to what is for us a new  building, we will see a new stage in the State Duma's work. And  the media will not only record this in their pages but will do  their utmost to promote it.    [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, the president's letter  commenting on the law on the status of deputies talked of  certain privileges that would be unlikely to meet with the  approval of voters and taxpayers. At a recent Duma session,  Georgiy Satarov, the president's assistant, listed a number of  privileges current deputies have which former deputies did not  have.    [Bauer] The president's letter was commenting on the law on  the status of deputies adopted by the State Duma and, I stress,  approved by the Federation Council. It is a bicameral decision,  so we have a common view of all the law's provisions.  Accordingly, all these norms relate to the deputies of both  chambers. But the general tenor of the comment suggests that  the privileges are excessive, and the criticism is directed  mainly at the State Duma deputies.    [Skukin] OK, but let us deal with the facts cited by the  president's assistant. The status of the former deputies did  not stipulate, for example, that parliamentarians should be paid  for the entire term of election in the event of the dissolution  of the legislative body.    [Bauer] True, that norm was not in the standing orders of  the former Congress of People's Deputies. But our former  mentality did not even contemplate the possibility of the  enforced dissolution of parliament. The makers of this law were  merely reacting to the changed situation. Incidentally, we did  not exceed by much the normatives for state employees dismissed  in line with staff cuts or as a result of reorganization. It is  a morally justified norm. A deputy was elected for two years  and this became part of his life plan -- on giving up what was  in many cases an important post.    [Skukin] In the old law there was nothing about  government-level medical services....    [Bauer] But the old deputies certainly had use of them.  Anyway, why shouldn't a deputy, elected by hundreds of thousands  of people, ask for the same medical services as a government  official?    [Skukin] According to G. Satarov, the payment of expenses  for travel to Moscow is a new privilege, and if a deputy is not  provided with an apartment he gets a loan in order to be able to  acquire and own accommodations.    [Bauer] I can definitely say that most deputies elected to  represent the provinces are living in conditions that are  demeaning for a parliamentarian. Knowing the practice in some  foreign countries in this matter, I can say that nowhere are  out-of-town deputies treated in this way. Despite the norms of  the law -- the granting of official housing for a three-month  period, without privatization rights -- out-of-town deputies  have practically no prospect of living in normal conditions. It  will soon be six months since we were elected. You get family  men with children living in hotels. And anyone who has lived in  a hotel will know full well that there are no conditions there  for relaxation, for preparing food, for the children to do their  homework. Finding ourselves in a difficult situation, we were  forced to seek a solution. In my view, if a deputy were to be  allocated compensation within the bounds of what is spent on a  hotel and the state were to be spared the worry of housing him,  it would benefit both the state and the deputy.    [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, how do you see the increase  in the number of deputies' assistants?    [Bauer] Yes, the number has increased. But it should not be  forgotten that the electoral district is three or four times  bigger. There used to be seven or eight districts per million  inhabitants, but now there are only two. Some deputies  represent around 20 rural rayons and others were elected to  represent cities with populations of 500,000 and more. Without  assistants it is simply impossible to keep in touch with the  people while doing a professional job in the Duma. The  umbilical cord, figuratively speaking, will be cut. And that's  that, the deputy is finished.    Incidentally, we clearly pointed out in the law that up to  five assistants were permitted, but with only one working in the  State Duma and the rest in the provinces. This is not a  privilege at all, in fact it is now much easier for voters to  contact a deputy.    [Skukin] How are events developing at the moment?    [Bauer] I am impressed by the fact that the president found  a mutually acceptable procedure, signed the law, but asked the  State Duma to take a sympathetic view of his comments. The  conciliation commission, on which both chambers and the  president are represented, is now functioning. I am head of its  Duma part. If we fail to persuade the president's side that the  particular norms are adequate, we will incorporate the  president's comments in the law as amendments. Incidentally, so  far there have been no complaints about unrealistic privileges  from the State Legal Administration under the president.  Comments have been made mainly in connection with certain  changes in constitutional norms.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reporting on the survey made by international  economic institutions and himself, in the capacity as economic  consultant to the Lao Government, Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun,  secretary general of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association, told  PRACHACHAT THURAKIT that Laos is rich in natural resources of  all types that are spread throughout the country. Northern Laos  is rich in lignite -- the first deposit found has a lignite  reserve of the same amount found at Thailand's Mae Mo mine in  Lampang Province. Yet, there are still many more lignite  deposits in Laos believed to be larger than what has been found  in Thailand. The assessment was made by a subsidiary of the  Ngan Thawi Group in Hongsa of Laos whose lignite mine can  generate power for over 60 years. Also based on the old French  maps, Laos has iron ore deposits in Luang Nam Tha; zinc and  copper mines in Xieng Khouang; and gems, especially a large  amount of blue sapphires, in Bokeo. The central part of the  country is covered with forests and water sources suitable for  building hydroelectric dams. The Nam Ngum hydroelectric dam is  now providing electricity for Thailand. In southern Laos, there  are oil deposits and forests and water sources, good for the  construction of a hydroelectric dam. There are already two dams  there -- Nam Theun 1 and Nam Theun 2. There is a vast area still  untapped, and it is possible that there are abundant resources  in the area.    Dr. Wiraphong noted that, from assessments, the potential of  Laos' energy production could turn the country into one of  richest in terms of economic potential since that means the 4  million inhabitants of Laos can export 20,000 megawatts of power  annually, in other words, a highest per capita income. The  country would become "a second Brunei." That is why Laos is  focussing on investment in energy development. The program is  incorporated in the fourth national economic and social  development plan, which will begin on 1 January 1995. Based on  the assessment, the best way to earn an income for the country  and to attain an economic stability is through exports of  energy. Meanwhile, Thailand would be a major customer of Laos,  because Thailand can no longer expand production of energy,  while demand is always increasing. Thailand therefore needs a  power supply from Laos.    Anyway, Dr. Wiraphong said he prefers to see Thailand buying  power from Laos for direct consumption instead of buying bunker  oil from Saudi Arabia for power production. By importing power  from Laos, Thailand is helping a brother country. The money  spent will remain circulated within the region and could one day  return to Thailand.    In conclusion, he said: "Whether Laos would be successful in  economic development and become a second Brunei also depends on  Thailand, since Thailand will be the sole country to buy  electricity and power from Laos. Vietnam is self-sufficient in  this area and can rely on local production; the same is true for  China. The customer of Laos is Thailand."</p>

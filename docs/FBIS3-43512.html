The minister of  petroleum and mineral resources, Chief Don Etiebet, said in  Lagos that government was determined to refurbish all the  refineries in the country to enable them to produce at their  full capacity level. He expressed concern over the current  low-level of petroleum products being produced by the Kaduna and  Warri Refineries. The minister directed the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, to terminate all contracts for the  lifting of crude oil by customers. New contracts for the  lifting of the oil will take effect on 1 March this year.</p>

			<p>931030 FT  30 OCT 93 / Malaga council seeks debt help THE CITY council of Malaga, the principal town on Spain's Costa del Sol, is believed to be seeking government assistance to avoid defaulting on its debts. Malaga authorities were yesterday reported to be negotiating a refinancing package with the central government to avert defaulting on principal of Pta3.5bn (Pounds 17.5m), which is underwritten by Spain's leading corporate lender, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The city's problems highlight dangerously high borrowing levels of other city councils in Spain, but do not appear to have had any effect on Spain's public debt market, where Spanish long-term bonds yesterday outperformed Italy's. Seven major city councils, including Madrid and Barcelona but not Malaga, held a meeting earlier this week to lobby the central government for tax rebates to help meet their deficits. Barcelona, which staged the 1992 Olympic games, has the largest debt with a total of Pta241bn. Spain's city councils owe a total of Pta2,200bn. Deficits have risen steeply in all levels of government, but they have risen most of all among local councils, many of which have borrowed heavily on the capital markets. 'This is a big problem for the councils and it is not going to be easy for them to place paper from now on - but it is not a problem for Spain's main bond and equity market,' said Mr Robert Maxwell, a senior partner at Madrid securities house Maxwell and Espinosa.</p>

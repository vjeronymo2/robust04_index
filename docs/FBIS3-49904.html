			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ma.S.: "Looking for Resources for the </F> 'Partnership'"]    [Text] The Council of Ministers has proposed an amendment  to the deputies' bill on amending the Small Constitution. In  line with this version, the government would present the "Report  on the Condition of the State" on 30 June and not toward the end  of March. The ministers decided that in the first quarter of the  year the tax-free wage increase would be 1.5 percent. The  Ministry of National Defense [MON] and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs have set up a working group which is tasked with  analyzing the "Partnership for Peace" initiative.    No decisions have been made with regard to this issue. At  the government session on Tuesday [18 January], members  discussed the results of the summit meeting in Prague. In the  near future, deputy ministers of national defense and foreign  affairs are supposed to "prepare conclusions for decisions"  concerning the "Partnership for Peace." Council of Ministers  Secretary Maciej Graniecki estimated that this would take from  three to four weeks.    In a radio interview, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  explained that the "Partnership" formula would be fixed by the  partners during negotiations. Thus, the government cannot  decide to participate in the program; it can merely decide  whether to take part in work on it.    Just before the session, head of MON Piotr Kolodziejczyk  told journalists that our Army needs 500 billion zlotys to  participate in the "Partnership." "Poland can afford it."  However, in line with information we obtained, the prime  minister does not want the expenditures on the program to be an  additional burden on this year's budget. This would mean that  the amount of money that has been earmarked for these ministries  in this year's budget bill would have to be smaller, or that the  additional money would have to be found "outside" (in various  funds, for instance).    Ministers suggest that the "Report on the Condition of the  State," which they are obliged to draw up by the bill on  amending the Constitution, be presented by the government toward  the end of June and not on 31 March. Discussion on the "report"  would then coincide with debate on the vote of acceptance of  accounts for the previous year. It will be easier to prepare  the "report" at that time because the Central Office of  Statistics will have submitted all its data by that time.    In line with the Tuesday resolution of the Pawlak Cabinet,  the prime minister's Legislative Council is supposed to comprise  fewer members: 35 instead of 60. The resolution also envisions  departing from permanent working groups of the council. They  are supposed to be replaced by ad hoc groups of experts. The  council's members will receive fixed amounts of money. So far  they have not been receiving any remuneration.    If the Sejm accepts the government's proposal, the National  Atomic Energy Agency will be financed directly from the state  budget. So far it has been receiving money exclusively from the  coffers of the Atomic Energy Research Committee.    For the last time, the government set a monthly index of  wage  increase that is tax-free. In line with the decision of the  Sejm, after the first quarter the popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] will be abolished.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nobuyuki Tanaka; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Jun Evening </F> Edition]    [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun -- With economic sanctions against  the DPRK (North Korea) looking more possible as a result of  phone conversation between top leaders of the United States and  South Korea [ROK], Russia is watching U.S. moves, but will soon  reiterate its call for an eight-party international conference  proposed by President Yeltsin. The eight parties referred to  are South and North Korea, Japan, the United States, China,  Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    Russia, which appears to be treading an idependent  diplomatic  course by drawing a line with the Western camp since early this  year, is concerned lest the DPRK question be resolved under U.S.  leadership. Even though it basically has no intention of  objecting to economic sanctions, it has not withdrawn from its  position of calling for a meeting of the eight parties before  taking that action.    According to a Russian Foreign Ministry source, even within  the ministry there are voices of self-reproach saying: "We have  pushed the DPRK too far into a corner by approaching the ROK  promptly following the collapse of the Soviet Union." Given the  situation, there is no choice but for the country to be cautious  about economic sanctions at this stage.    It is also true that this issue draws little concern in  parliament and among the public as compared to the Bosnian  issue, wherein the problem of Slavic Serbs is involved.  Besides, with economic ties with the ROK only growing, what  Russia most likely wants to do most is to stay away from making  decisive confrontations with the United States and the ROK over  the DPRK nuclear issue.</p>

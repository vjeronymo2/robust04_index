			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] "Yeltsin Spills the Beans on Lech  Walesa" is the title given by the weekly NIE to an article on  Boris Yeltsin's recent book: Notes by the President. The  Russian leader writes that during last year's visit to Warsaw,  he handed to the Polish side a file containing the entire  Solidarity dossier. I asked our Moscow correspondent Andrzej  Siezieniewski if he knew Yeltsin's book.    [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Yes, I have read through  it. The excerpt you want to ask me about is indeed in the book,  on page 180, in the chapter: Russia and the world, sub-heading:  Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. It reads as follows: It is  well-known that the KGB tried to oversee the destruction of the  Solidarity trade union. I brought Lech Walesa--Boris Yeltsin  writes--a copy of the documents of the Suslov Commission, the  shadow leader of the Brezhnev Politburo. It was a whole dossier  on Solidarity. Polish and Soviet KGB men analyzed in detail the  whole truth about the leaders of the workers' movement.  Sometimes it was terrible to read these documents, Boris  Yeltsin says, because the KGB x-ray was so ruthless. I slapped  the file with my hand and said: It is all here, take it. Walesa  turned slightly pale--Boris Yeltsin recalls the moment he handed  the Polish president the documents he had brought with him on  his visit to Warsaw last August.    [Announcer] Have the Russia media given any information at  all about what was in the documents President Yeltsin brought to  Warsaw?    [Siezieniewski] No, there was nothing known about that. In  any case, Boris Yeltsin did not give details about what was in  the diplomatic luggage he took to Warsaw. It is certainly  well-known that Boris Yeltsin had access to the KGB archives,  and if he says that what he took with him and what he handed  over to the Polish side contained, among other things, the  dossier on Solidarity, then we can most probably believe  him--although Boris Yeltsin is a politician, and one does not  always play fair here, what is said does not always correspond  100 percent to the truth. [end recording]    [Announcer] I also telephoned Boris Yeltsin's adviser, Yuriy  Leonov.    [Begin Leonov recording] Some sort of documents were handed  over to President Walesa, but I do not know their exact content.  In my opinion, insofar as they were handed over to the Polish  side, only the Polish side can make the decision to publish the  documents. [end recording]    [Announcer] I asked Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski of President  Lech Walesa's Chancellery.    [Begin Zakrzewski recording] I have never entered into  polemics with the NIE weekly and I will not do so, because I am  one of those people who regard Jerzy Urban's weekly as  journalistic folklore, although again I am not one of those  people who underestimate that weekly's influence. However,  regarding the substance of what you asked about, I know nothing  of the file mentioned by your Moscow correspondent. I have  Yeltsin's memoirs, I received them yesterday, but I have not  read them yet--and the competent people, the only people who  could give binding information, are abroad for the next four  days, for they are in Switzerland. I have not the faintest idea  about any file from the most secret Kremlin safe concerning the  KGB's detailed study of the Solidarity leaders. I have not set  eyes on it, and I doubt whether... [pauses] Well, maybe it does  exist, but in any case I know nothing about it. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

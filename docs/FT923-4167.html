			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Coal equipment given to museum VICTORIAN steam-driven pumps and other equipment salvaged from one of British Coal's recently closed collieries are to be donated to Beamish, the North of England Open Air Museum in County Durham. The equipment, some of which dates back to the 1840s, became redundant when electricity was introduced in the 1930s but it remained underground at Murton colliery, Co. Durham, sunk in 1838.</p>

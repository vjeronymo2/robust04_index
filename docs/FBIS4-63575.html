			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Manvelov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- The Group of Seven  industrialized nations is interested in Russia's joining its  activities, in the creation of the G-8 group, said visiting  British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd at a meeting with  journalists at an international press center today.    The British foreign minister, currently on an official visit  to Russia, pointed out the importance of his talks with his  Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, which were held in Murmansk.    In reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude  to Russia's economic partnership with Western Europe, Hurd said  that concluding an agreement on cooperation between Russia and  EC will be an important step in Russia's joining the common  market. He believes this might become a reality until the end  of June. Hurd stressed that it is possible to say even now that  signing this document will boost business contacts and give them  an important impetus.    Commenting on the idea of Russia's joining the NATO  Partnership for Peace programme, the British foreign minister  said that this concept provides for an individual approach to  every country. Hurd expressed the hope that Russia will be able  to find its place in the Partnership for Peace programme.    Touching upon the situation in the Crimea, Hurd declared  that  London considers the Crimea to be an inalienable part of  Ukraine. At the same time Hurd pointed out that Kiev should  flexibly react to the opinion of Crimean residents and take  Russia's position into account. The British foreign minister  pointed out that Russia has a full right to carry out  peace-keeping operations in countries of the former Soviet  Union, provided these operations are conducted at the request of  their governments and in the spirit of U.N. and CSCE documents.    On Tuesday, the British foreign minister will meet with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during the meeting the Russian  president will be handed in a letter from the British Queen  Elizabeth II, in which she confirms her intention to pay a state  visit to Russia before the end of this year.</p>

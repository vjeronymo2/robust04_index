The Egyptian media did not mention the executions or the  trial of the two Islamic militants.    AL-HAYAT is edited in London and distributed in Cairo and  other Arab capitals.    Last year the authorities criticised the newspaper several  times, notably in connection with its publication of an  interview with Shaykh Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, whom the Islamic  militants regard as their spiritual leader.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> OUR SAINTED FREE MARKET RAN AMOK;  </P> <P> S &amp; LS: PUBLIC DEBATE IS NEEDED ON WHERE TO LET BLIND FORCES HAVE PLAY AND  WHERE NOT.  </P> <P> Free-enterprisers here at home gloat over the failures of socialism in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union, and President Bush has just offered the services  of American experts to help the Soviet Union create a free-market economy.  Included in the offer is technical advice on how to set up a private banking  system. As if ours were not in a state of crisis.  </P> <P> The savings-and-loan crisis will cost the American taxpayer at least $200  billion in the next 10 years. This corporate welfare program was brought to us  by the conservative philosophy that many Americans want to export: An  individual should have the freedom to maximize profits unfettered by state  regulation. The free-marketeers' argument, in the early '80s, was: Gut the  regulatory system, because that will energize the free market and fatten the  Treasury without cost to the taxpayer.  </P> <P> It didn't work that way, and now the hunt is on for the culprits -- government  officials, members of Congress, bank directors and investors -- including the  President's son. Hardly anyone is asking the key question: When are market  principles bad for the economy and bad for democracy?  </P> <P> A memo from Charles Keating's American Continental, the parent corporation of  Lincoln S&amp;L, advised its bond salesmen: "Remember, the weak, meek and  ignorant are always good targets." Two-hundred million dollars of now-worthless  bonds were sold investors, most of them elderly, many of whom put their life  savings into Keating's hands assuming the bonds were insured.  </P> <P> This violates common notions of decency and justice -- but what market  principles did Keating violate? Suppose the memo had been rephrased: "Let's  target our advertising to those over 65 in the lower-middle income tax brackets  with a high school education or less." That might just sound like good  business.  </P> <P> Granted: Keating used S&amp;L funds for high-risk ventures in hotels, real  estate, junk bonds, stocks and a casino -- investments that lost millions.  Maybe that sounds like bad business, but bad business is part of the "free"  market, too.  </P> <P> Or take the case of Neil Bush. As a director of Silverado Bank, he voted to  approve loans to two close business associates. What is so bad about that?  Maybe they weren't good risks, but that's his call as a director. Maybe the  bank made a bad choice in making him director, but the officers knew about his  business partners, and they took his advice anyway.  </P> <P> Why not just chalk up the S&amp;L debacle to the market freedom that  individuals have to risk their money and make a profit -- or take a loss?  </P> <P> Simple. Banking is not purely a business. Allowing free reign of the market  could destroy the banking system and more. The regulations that insure deposits  were instituted after the Crash of 1929 because the banking system -- and thus  the whole economy -- could not work if people did not have the confidence to  put their savings in banks. Other regulations require that bank directors  disqualify themselves from votes about loans to their associates and prohibit  loans exceeding 5% of the bank's assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation has watchdog examiners that are supposed to to prevent unsound  business practices that might require a bailout.  </P> <P> Such regulations make sense. We can't allow market principles to rule in  situations that are destructive.  </P> <P> But just what does destructive mean -- damaging to the banking system,  prejudicial to the stock market, injurious to the environment, harmful to the  poor?  </P> <P> In a democracy, it's the citizens and not the market that should make these  political decisions and enforce them.  </P> <P> This is exactly where our political system has failed. For one thing, the  free-market rhetoric of the Reagan years made both Democrats and Republicans  reluctant to back "regulation." Existing regulations were hamstrung by members  of Congress in both parties that took contributions from S&amp;Ls and defended  their interests.  </P> <P> The problem goes deeper. Taking money from PACs, special interests and the  wealthy corrodes the democratic principle of one person, one vote. Yet such  practices have become the norm in American politics; some say that they're  essential in the era of expensive TV-oriented campaigns.  </P> <P> We may have much to teach the former communist nations about capitalist  democracy, but we've got some big changes to make if we want to give them  something to emulate. A good start would be to reform campaign financing to  keep the market out of democracy.  </P> <P> Maybe the best advice we can offer other countries is this: Encourage public  debate and democratic decisions about where to permit the free market and where  to limit it. And then give them a hand, whether we like what they choose or  not.  </P></p>

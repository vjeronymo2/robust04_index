			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Kodak earnings decline by 11% EASTMAN KODAK, the world's biggest producer of photographic products, yesterday unveiled disappointing first-quarter earnings in spite of improved sales. Net earnings fell 11 per cent to Dollars 178m, or 55 cents a share, from Dollars 199m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 8 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 4.4bn from Dollars 4.1bn. Kodak said its 1991 figures include an additional two months of sales from its Sterling Drug units outside the US. The 1990 results include revenues from discontinued operations. Wall Street registered its disappointment with the results by marking Kodak's shares Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 40 1/2 by the close in a market that was generally higher. Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said there some highlights in the latest quarter including better-than-expected results from Kodak's chemical business and strong international demand for Kodacolor film and Ektacolor paper. Looking ahead for the rest of the year, Kodak expects continued gains in sales and margin recovery later in the year, assuming the economy improves.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Hosokawa plan has pleased few and made many unhappy After months of intense public haggling over how to finance a substantial income tax cut, Premier Morihiro Hosokawa has put together a plan that has pleased few and made many unhappy. What relief or joy over the cut in direct taxation there may have been was strongly overshadowed by widespread discontent over the increase in consumption tax to 7 per cent from 3 per cent and its likely impact on consumer sentiment. Business leaders, on the whole, hoped the lighter tax burden would lift consumer demand and help kick-start the sagging economy. Among the most optimistic was Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business federation, who hailed the prime minister's tax reforms as a bold measure bound to have a favourable impact on the economy. Mr Hiraiwa said Mr Hosokawa could be given high marks for his reforms to lower both income and corporate taxes. Most businessmen were, however, more guarded, while some were concerned that raising the consumption tax to more than double its present level could lead consumers to save their extra money rather than spend it, even though the increase will not come for three years. Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was critical. 'Since an increase to 7 per cent could have a negative impact on the economic recovery, I cannot support the plan right away,' he said. 'People will save the money,' said Mr Naokazu Takeuchi, councillor at the Consumers' Union of Japan. 'The Japanese people are not stupid. With the economic outlook still bleak, they won't spend.' Pessimists argue that with rising employment and pressure from a high yen and excess manufacturing capacity unabated, reducing the income burden slightly is not going to trigger a consumption-led recovery. 'It is no longer an age in which we can consume our way out of recession,' Mr Takeuchi said. 'It will not be effective in stimulating the economy,' agreed an official at Rengo, the trade union confederation. 'Postal savings are at a peak, which shows that people are not spending even though they have the money.' But the fiercest criticism was reserved for what was seen as the backhanded way in which the increase in the consumption tax was decided and then presented to the public as a fait accompli. 'A tax increase is a serious matter, and must be fully debated to win public approval,' said a union official. 'Remember, the introduction of the consumption tax nearly brought down the government' under the then-ruling Liberal Democratic party, he added. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, reflected widespread unhappiness with the forceful way in which the increase was determined. 'The government should do all it can to cut costs first, to win the approval of the public,' he said. For Mr Hosokawa, one of the most welcome receptions to his plan came from the US. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, greeted the tax package as 'a step in the right direction,' although he reserved final judgment until details became available.</p>

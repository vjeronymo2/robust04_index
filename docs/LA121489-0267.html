			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A., WATER AGENCY FIGHT OVER SANTA CLARITA PARCEL  </P> <P> A Los Angels official warned the Castaic Lake Water Agency Wednesday night that  the city will fight any attempt by the agency to condemn 520 acres of  city-owned land in Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> C. William Mercer, chief administrative analyst with the city, leveled the  warning as the water agency's board of directors considered a proposal to begin  eminent domain proceedings to take possession of the defunct Saugus  Rehabilitation Center.  </P> <P> The water agency hopes to use about 60 to 80 acres of the old alcoholic  rehabilitation center for a drinking water treatment plant. The agency's sole  plant near Castaic Lake is nearing capacity, and the agency will need a second  plant to serve the growing Santa Clarita Valley in two years, water officials  say.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council also wants parts of the Saugus property for a  park, civic center and possibly an arts complex.  </P> <P> Mercer said Los Angeles would not sell the entire property to the water agency,  but would be willing to negotiate over the acreage needed just for the water  filtration plant. Until September, he said, city officials assumed the water  district was interested only in a small portion of the property.  </P> <P> Mercer said Los Angeles wants to hold on to most of the site for its value as a  bargaining chip in negotiations over opening a garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon  just east of Santa Clarita. Under a tentative agreement involving the city and  country of Los Angeles, the city would give a portion of the Saugus site to  Santa Clarita if that city agrees not to oppose the landfill.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council has not yet opposed or endorsed the landfill or  the city-county pact.  </P> <P> In September, the water agency and the Santa Clarita Council agreed they would  jointly try to acquire the rehabilitation center, with the water agency leading  the purchase. The agency offered Los Angeles $15.8 million for the property,  but Los Angeles officials said the bid was too low.  </P> <P> The agency's board did not respond to Mercer's comments because its  condemnation plans have been stymied, at least momentarily, by objections  raised by the city of Santa Clarita and a civic group. Santa Clarita officials  and the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment said the water  agency should prepare a full environmental impact report before proceeding with  the project.  </P> <P> Robert C. Sagehorn, the water agency's general manager, said the agency could  not proceed with the condemnation proceedings until it resolves the issue of  the environmental impact report. The agency staff should have a response to the  request for such a report in the next few days, he said.  </P></p>

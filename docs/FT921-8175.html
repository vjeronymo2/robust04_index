			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The rewards of failure FEW THINGS better illustrate the weakness of managerial accountability in the Anglo-Saxon economies than the haphazard way in which top executive pay is determined. Disclosure is minimal; pay levels are usually set by other top executives with a vested interest in high settlements; and there appears to be little obvious relationship between risk and reward. Small wonder that there is widespread suspicion on both sides of the Atlantic that top executives have been feathering their own nests. Nor is it purely a matter of envy. There is no correlation, internationally, between high executive rewards and corporate success. Indeed, there may be a negative correlation. Such evidence as there is suggests that German and Japanese executives require less bunce to deliver economic miracles. In the United States, where pay packages constitute a more important part of society's scoring system, managerial rewards are sky-high by international standards. Yet the country is suffering from a long-term crisis of productivity, of which the troubles of the motor industry in Detroit are just one symptom. In Britain, meantime, the relationship between high incentives and performance is also perverse. Several of the entrepreneurial high flyers of the 1980s found themselves in the headlines first as the recipients of spectacularly high executive pay, then as victims of the sack or of receivership. There is something odd, too, about the way in which British directors' pay has outstripped average earnings by a wide margin since 1979 when top marginal rates of tax plunged from 98 per cent to 40 per cent. Simplistic view That does not sound like any discernible approximation to a market system of pay determination. Nor does it reflect a very subtle view of human motivation in the firm. The more eye-catching pay packages in Britain and the US point to a one-dimensional view of managerial capitalism in which the top executive is a mighty superman in charge of a bloodless machine; because he alone is perceived to hold the key to growth, he requires large rewards. Yet there are few such supermen in the real world of industry and commerce, where competitive advantage increasingly derives from the effective management of wider human capital. That, in turn, calls for teamwork and a shared sense of common goals, which are unlikely to be fostered by excessive rewards in the boardroom. A better way of arriving at top pay is badly needed. And that means something more than cosy remuneration committees of non-executive directors for all quoted companies. Greater disclosure Britain's Cadbury committee on corporate governance would do well to ponder the US Securities and Exchange Commission's latest initiative to require greater disclosure, together with a shareholders' vote on management pay proposals. More disclosure is undoubtedly needed; and a vote on remuneration at British annual general meetings would have the effect of concentrating management's mind, even if institutional shareholders used the additional information chiefly to crack the whip behind the scenes. The institutions on either side of the Atlantic should also use their influence to steer management away from spurious performance measures in the direction of simpler reward systems. There is no wholly satisfactory measure of performance and in big industry today success frequently has as much or more to do with collective achievement than with the efforts of individual directors. Performance targets can provide an incentive to juggle with accounting or engage in unproductive takeover activity. And share incentive schemes should be just that: incentives, not rewards that entail no risks. The most damning aspect of the present system in the Anglo-Saxon world is the consistency with which managerial failure appears to be so handsomely rewarded. It would be foolish to expect top management to find its own remedy without constructive prompting from outside.</p>

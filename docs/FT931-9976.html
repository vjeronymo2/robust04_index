			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Toyota plunges 22% at halfway as sales improve TOYOTA, Japan's leading vehicle manufacturer, yesterday reported a 22.3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months ended December, partly because of lower interest income and exchange rate losses. Toyota's sales were Y4,564bn (Dollars 37bn), up just 2.9 per cent on the comparable six months of 1991. Pre-tax profits were Y46.5bn lower at Y162bn, operating profit was 24.4 per cent lower at Y58.2bn and net income was 30 per cent down at Y72.3bn. It was the third successive year of declining profits. The deterioration in Toyota's finances has prompted a sharp rundown in cash reserves. These have fallen from Y1,482bn at the end of July, 1992 to Y943bn at the end of December. The company also sold about 37.5 per cent of its stock of marketable securities, which stood at Y104bn in August. The fall seems likely to continue as about Y190bn of equity warrants falls due for redemption this June. The company, under the stewardship of chairman Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, said it was exploring a variety of ways to finance the redemption of the warrants. Toyota blamed most of the 24 per cent fall in operating income on adverse foreign exchange movements worth Y30bn, rising personnel costs worth Y20bn and Y30bn due to the fall in sales. Interest and dividend income fell by Y34bn to Y89bn, largely because of the fall in Japanese interest rates and the sale of securities. Although sales were up by 2.9 per cent, the cost of sales rose by 4.2 per cent to Y4,172bn. Overseas operations are playing an increasingly important role in bolstering performance. Although vehicle sales were virtually flat at Y3,004bn, this was largely because a Y75bn fall in domestic sales to Y1,698bn was offset by a Y78bn increase in overseas sales.</p>

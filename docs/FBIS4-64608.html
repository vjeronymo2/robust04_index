			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the European  Union [EU] should tell the Greek Cypriots that they cannot join  the Union so long as they do not reach an agreement with the  Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas today received the U.S. ambassador to Lefkosa  [Nicosia] Richard Boucher and conferred with him for some time.  The U.S. Embassy under secretary was also present at the  meeting.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he told  Boucher that the Republican Assembly, at its Cyprus debate  yesterday, expressed support for him regarding the principles he  stressed he would not be making any concessions on. He further  noted that he informed the ambassador that the parties  represented at the Assembly share his view that the package of  confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been punctured and that  it cannot be implemented in its current form. Denktas said: I  clearly told him that the ball is now in Kliridhis' court, that  the holes in the package have to be mended, and that the second  map is unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot side.    In reply to a question by a journalist on whether his  meeting  with Boucher is the beginning of a new process, Denktas said  that he might consider it to be so but that circles interested  in the Cyprus issue have, anyway, not accepted that the process  is over. Pointing out that it will be wrong to assume that the  Cyprus problem can be solved within a short period and that the  Turkish Cypriots will be left in peace, Denktas stressed that he  has very clearly expressed the views of the Turkish Cypriot side  but that they should be put forward even more clearly. Noting  that the circles interested in the Cyprus issue will, thus,  understand what can be solved and what cannot, Denktas added:  We have to explain to the world in detail on which parameters  and milestones we shall insist. Denktas drew attention to the  fact that the message being given to the Greek Cypriots that  they can still join the EU if an agreement is not reached due to  the failure of the Turkish Cypriot side gives the Greek Cypriots  the opportunity to play the game of throwing the ball into the  Turkish Cypriot court each time. Denktas said: I cannot  concede each time to prevent Kliridhis from playing this game.  No matter how flexible I am the result is still the same. What  kind of a game is this? We are only helping Kliridhis join the  EU. Europe has to be told that they should inform the Greek  Cypriots that this game will not prove to be successful. Europe  should tell the Greek Cypriots that the door to the EU is closed  to them.    Denktas said that he told the UN secretary general that a  decision should be reached through a referendum to be held on  both sides. He added that so long as the Greek Cypriots are not  informed of this the carrot to be given to the Greek Cypriots  will prove to be a very big stick for the Turkish Cypriots.  Denktas stressed that no results can be achieved at the  negotiations by giving hope to the Greek Cypriots and  threatening the Turkish Cypriots.    In reply to a question, Denktas said that the Republican  Assembly is the best national platform and that the government  will do whatever is necessary to expand the unity within the  assembly.</p>

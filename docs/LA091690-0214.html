			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING MANNERS  </P> <P> Recently we attended a concert at the Universal Amphitheater and we were  surrounded by talkers and smokers.  </P> <P> Why these people pay good money to talk through a concert is beyond me. But  could they please do it somewhere else? Some of us actually buy concert tickets  to hear the concert.  </P> <P> We asked the smoker to put out his cigarette since it was a nonsmoking  auditorium, and he wanted to fight over it. I had to get an usher, who escorted  him outside to finish smoking. When he returned he had the nerve to ask for our  binoculars. Did I miss something here?  </P> <P> MIKE AND LINDA SWILLER  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

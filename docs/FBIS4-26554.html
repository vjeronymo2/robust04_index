			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Should Compensations Be Made If the </F> Employment Contract Is Not Renewed After Expiration?"]    [Text] Recently, the secretary for civil service affairs of  the Hong Kong Government announced that he had explained to  administrative officers employed according to overseas contracts  that all expatriate employees in the policy-making branches of  the Government Secretariat will have to retire by the age of 57;  at the same time, the Government will promote local  administrative officers to various secretary posts ahead of  their previous expatriate superiors. After the secretary for  civil service affairs made the announcement, the overseas civil  servants revealed more inside stories. It was said that the  Hong Kong Government had promised to pay compensation to A- and  B-class expatriate officials in the policy-making branches who  could not be promoted. As the expatriate officials in the  policy-making branches will be forced to retire ahead of the  retirement age or will not be promoted, they will bring a suit  against the Government, which has harmed their "human rights."    The suit brought by the overseas civil servants against the  Hong Kong Government was based on the "Human Rights Act"  formulated by the Hong Kong Government. They held that taking  legal action against the government on the basis of the new act  certainly would drive the Government into an awkward predicament  in the proceedings. Such handling of the personnel arrangements  for secretary-level officials by the Hong Kong Government  obviously was a deliberate ploy to leave some loopholes so that  excuses could be found to make compensation before its power  comes to an end.    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the  administration of the British Hong Kong Government will come to  an end on 30 June 1997; and the Basic Law stipulates that the  secretary-level officials will be Chinese citizens who are  permanent residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, the British Hong  Kong Government cannot sign any employment contracts with  expatriate civil servants which extend beyond 1997. Moreover,  the Hong Kong Government has long announced its civil service  localization policy. When Edward Youde and David Wilson were  governors, local Chinese officials were promoted to be branch  secretaries and department directors. This fact never aroused  any controversy. However, after Chris Patten took the  governorship in 1992, the Hong Kong Government took such  measures as the naturalization of expatriate civil servants and  the adoption of the Human Rights Act, and this thus led to the  troublesome legal proceedings taken by the expatriate civil  servants against the government.    Why did the expatriate officials at the posts of branch  secretary and department director obediently retire without  taking legal proceedings before Patten took the governorship?  There were two reasons. First, according to the Letters Patent  and the Royal Instructions, all officials must obey the  governor, and the governor does not need to give any explanation  when deciding to promote or not to promote any official, or to  require any official to retire. Second, all expatriate civil  servants signed employment contracts that did not extend beyond  1997, and the contracts were normally two-year or four-year  ones. Moreover, the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions  were constitutional documents, which naturally took precedence  over any local legislation.    According to newspaper reports in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong  Government and the secretary-level expatriate officials have  reached a secret agreement, and the government will pay HK$2.9  million in compensation to them. The local public was not  consulted before this arrangement was made, and the Legislative  Council was not briefed. After this is made a fait accompli,  Hong Kong taxpayers will be forced to pay the bill without an  opportunity to say no.    According to usual practice, if the employment contract of  an  expatriate civil servant is not to be renewed, the government  will give notice 10 months ahead of its expiration. Once the  contract expires, the expatriate civil servant will have to  leave office, and the government will not have to pay any  compensation. In the current cases, however, some expatriate  officials received the relevant notices 18 months ahead of the  expiration of their employment contracts, and they had  sufficient time to seek new jobs in private institutions. How  could they be paid special compensation, or bring a suit in  court? Will the expatriate civil servants whose employment  contracts were not renewed before Patten took office also take  similar legal proceedings so as to claim compensation? If no  compensation is paid to the latter, how will the Hong Kong  Government justify its double standard?    In the Common Law areas, the expiration of the employment  contracts indicates the termination of the employment  relationship between the employer and the employee, and there  exists no issue of compensation. Now the Hong Kong Government  is showing its "generosity" by bestowing the Hong Kong people's  money in violation of legal principles and standard practice,  and without regard for the interests of Hong Kong people.    The present state of affairs shows that the "Human Rights  Act" is a carefully calculated plan of the British Hong Kong  authorities ahead of their withdrawal. On the surface, the act  was aimed at guaranteeing Hong Kong people's human rights; in  reality, it served some different purposes. According to the  "Human Rights Act," those who try to evade taxes or dodge their  creditors may flee Hong Kong without being held up by the court  and without being detained. What a disorderly situation will  this cause!    From the Hong Kong Government's plan for the naturalization  of the expatriate civil servants to the arrangement for huge  amounts of compensation for expatriate civil servants who leave  office after the expiration of their employment contracts -- all  these facts show how the colonial rulers are using public office  for private gain. The Hong Kong people now are worried that the  expatriate officials in the Mass Transit Rail Corporation, the  Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and the Provisional Airport  Authority will follow the example of the expatriate government  officials in taking away a huge amount of compensation before  1997.</p>

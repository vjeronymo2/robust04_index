			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 7 (AFP) -- UN aid officials are  preparing to withdraw staff from Serb-held areas in Bosnia,  including three Moslem enclaves, due to the threat of NATO air  strikes, according to an internal memo seen by AFP Saturday [7  May]. The UN refugees' office (UNHCR) memo, marked  "confidential," warns that the threat of air strikes is "ever  present," and says that such action could trigger Serb  retaliation, including kidnapping of UN aid personnel. "We  believe that until the present circumstances change, UNHCR  should suspend operations in Bosnian Serb held areas and in the  three eastern enclaves," it said, referring to Gorazde,  Srebrenica and Zepa.    A UNHCR official here, asked about the memo, confirmed its  existence and said the aid agency was "preparing" its withdrawal  from the three enclaves and Serb-held territory "for the safety  of staff on the ground." The official asked not to be named.    The memo, dated Geneva May 4, said: "There is believed to be  an ever present possibility of NATO air strike on Bosnian Serb  targets, moreover without advance warning or ultimatum."    "UNHCR staff in Bosnian Serb territory, whether stationed in  offices or driving convoys, are therefore facing an ever present  risk of retaliation either through direct targeting or by being  taken hostage."    The memo, the authors of whom were not clear, says the  recent  standoff between the Serbs and North Atlantic Treaty  Organization showed the limits of the UN Protection Force in  defending aid staff. "This means that UNHCR would withdraw its  staff from Banja Luka, Pale and the enclaves with the possible  exception of Gorazde at least for the time being and that it  would no longer run convoys through Bosnian Serb territory."    "This is a question of `force majeure,'" it concluded.    The UNHCR memo said aid convoys into the three enclaves  could  continue to be accompanied by UN Protection Force troops.</p>

This was  affirmed after talks today in Berlin on cooperation by German  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Polish counterpart Piotr  Kolodziejczyk.    The tried and tested cooperation should be expanded in the  spirit of the recent NATO summit decisions and with the goal of  future Polish membership in the North Atlantic defense alliance.  [passage omitted]    "No date can yet be set" for Poland's accession for the time  being, Ruehe said. It depends above all on how quickly the  necessary "compatibility" of the Polish Armed Forces could be  achieved. This includes a common understanding of defense  strategy as well as equal standards for telecommunication  equipment.    Kolodziejczyk said Poland has the "firm intention of  becoming  an active participant in NATO's Partnership for Peace program,"  but under no circumstances will it take part in a "race for  quick NATO membership." [passage omitted]    Commenting on recent developments in Russia, Ruehe said that  in the interest of "Russia's internal development and of  international stability," he believes it is important to seek to  establish intensive contacts and a political dialogue with the  Russian military.</p>

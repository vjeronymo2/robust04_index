			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION III BOYS;  </P> <P> LINCOLN IMITATES LAKERS, WINS 2 IN A ROW  </P> <P> Lincoln star Aaron Wilhite said his team was just following the lead of the Los  Angeles Lakers Saturday in the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> By defeating Clairemont, 89-59, in the San Diego Section Division III boys'  basketball championship, Lincoln won back-to-back titles and pulled off what  Wilhite described as something akin to the Lakers' consecutive NBA  championships.  </P> <P> "Back-to-back championships, just like the Lakers," said Wilhite, a senior  center.  </P> <P> Well, sort of. This was the first hurdle. Lincoln (27-1) advances to Southern  Regional play and if things go according to plan, the Hornets will continue on  to the State Division III final -- where they lost last year, 76-71, to Daly  City Jefferson.  </P> <P> Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski isn't thinking that far ahead but did say: "The only  thing I want to do is to win the last game we play."  </P> <P> If Lincoln keeps playing as it did against Clairemont (13-16), a team it beat  twice in the regular season by 20- and 23-point margins, the Hornets should  fare well in the coming rounds.  </P> <P> The Hornets set the tone by employing their familiar full-court pressure  defense and opened the first quarter with a 7-0 run.  </P> <P> By halftime, Lincoln led, 40-21.  </P> <P> "We had hoped to handle their press a little better," said Clairemont Coach  Greg Lee. "But they're an excellent team. They destroyed us on the boards, they  pursue the ball wonderfully and they have a couple of superstars who you can  play good defense against and they'll still score.."  </P> <P> Joe Temple, Lincoln's leading scorer, scored 30 points.  </P> <P> "After playing them twice I thought they would be tougher," he said. "In the  first half we just tried to discourage them. I came out pretty sloppy, but  Aaron (Wilhite) was hot at the beginning."  </P> <P> Wilhite scored 15 of his 29 points in the first half. Temple had 10 points in  the first two periods.  </P> <P> Clairemont's Ray McDavid led all scorers with 32 points.  </P></p>

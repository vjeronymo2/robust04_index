			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Lock up your hardware Thieves just cannot keep their hands off computers, with ready export markets in eastern Europe and the Middle East. Now, a British company called Circle Security has developed an anti-theft device for computers, whether in offices or showrooms, called Minder. It locks the computer to the desk-top with screws extending through the work surface to a special plate; further protection is provided by extra-strong adhesive. Thus the computer can only be stolen with the desk. The metal device, costing Pounds 59.50, has a seven-lever, anti-pick safe lock. Circle Security: UK, 0442 230925.</p>

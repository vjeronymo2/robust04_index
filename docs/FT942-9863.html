			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The value in diversifying Sir, John Gapper's analysis of the Royal Bank of Scotland , 'Where diversity helps balance the books' (May 11), only touches on the issue of the value added by the bank to its diversifications. Why? The only justification for making a diversification or retaining a multi-business portfolio is that the bank can add value to the businesses it owns. To be comfortable with chief executive George Mathewson's 'collection of several' businesses, we need to know more about Gapper's claim that 'Royal Bank's capital backing and management expertise have helped develop operations such as Citizens and Direct Line'. Reducing the volatility of Royal Bank's earnings and providing a 'balanced' chair for Mr Mathewson to sit in, creates no extra cash for shareholders and so provides no argument for diversification.

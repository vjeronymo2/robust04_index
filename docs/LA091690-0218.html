			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> COOKING BY THE BOOK  </P> <P> "I BRING THE COOKBOOK page to life by re-creating the look and taste of recipes  as their authors intended," says professional chef Ruth Hedges. Hedges, well  aware of the great number of us who read cookbooks like novels -- for pure  pleasure, with absolutely no intention of actually preparing a recipe -- has  created Cookbook Fantasies.  </P> <P> "This service is unique, because unlike when dealing with caterers, you can  control the entire menu," Hedges says. "You get to serve a fantasy meal to  friends without any effort." So the next time you're planning a party --  whether an intimate gathering or a large affair -- -- why not plan on pasta by  Wolfgang Puck, or blackened snapper by Paul Prudhomme, and a Martha Stewart  tart for dessert.  </P> <P>  Ruth Hedges Culinary Productions, Cookbook Fantasies; (818) 897-2128.

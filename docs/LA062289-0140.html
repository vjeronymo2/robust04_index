			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3 GROUPS SEEK TO PRODUCE 'FREEDOM FESTIVAL' DURING SOVIET EVENT  </P> <P> Three organizations have submitted proposals to produce a "freedom festival" to  run concurrently with the Treasures of the Soviet Union arts festival in San  Diego.  </P> <P> The City Council earmarked $30,000 for a freedom festival last September as a  response to critics' complaints about worldwide victims of Soviet aggression.  However, the city manager's May request for proposals made no reference to  victims.  </P> <P> The groups, which are competing for a city grant of up to $30,000, are Prophet  World Beat Productions, organized originally several years ago to present  "Third World shows" in San Diego; the Avenue of the Arts, which produces the  arts and crafts street fair during downtown's Artwalk and is sponsored by the  Llan Lael Foundation, and Freedom Festival Inc., a nonprofit organization  specifically formed to produce the festival. The proposals include a series of  Japanese and African dance workshops and concerts, a fine art street fair of  works by San Diego artists and a multi-ethnic cultural fest.  </P> <P> Freedom Festival Inc. plans a variety of folk concerts and arts and crafts  displays featuring 16 ethnic groups, according to Debra Schettino, a  spokeswoman for the group. Highlights of the proposed festival include an  exhibit of 16th-Century Bezhad-style Persian paintings, 400 decorative Pysanky  Easter eggs and a concert by Royal Thai dancers.  </P> <P> Also proposed are displays of Vietnamese miniature art and lacquer ware,  Laotian paintings and silverwork, a Hmong needlework collection, Mexican  serigraphs and watercolors and a concert by a local Ukrainian choir, Schettino  said. The proposal calls for a three-week festival, budgeted at $56,000,  located primarily in Balboa Park and running concurrently with the festival of  Soviet arts.  </P> <P> "We've asked all segments of society to participate," Schettino said. "We  didn't go just for the heavy political freedom things. We want to impact the  art community of San Diego as well." Freedom Inc. also plans education  programs, videos, lectures, and arts and crafts workshops, she said.  </P> <P> Schettino, who proposed a Freedom Arts Festival at a City Council meeting last  year, has been one of the chief critics of the Soviet arts festival. Responding  to Schettino's proposal and criticisms by her and others, the City Council in  September earmarked $30,000 -- 1% of the $3 million awarded to the San Diego  Arts Festival by the council -- for an alternative "freedom festival."  </P> <P> Freedom Inc. plans to raise $26,000 through donations and earned income to meet  the city's stated preference that an arts group raise at least $15,000 if it is  to receive the $30,000 grant.  </P> <P> Prophet World Beat Productions has proposed an International Dance Music  Festival featuring artists from Ghana and Japan. The proposal is built around  the visit of nine members of Japan's Mariko Dance Troupe and a 12-member  performance group from Ghana, featuring master drummer Obo Addy.  </P> <P> "Our main language is music, as well as dance," said Ruben Seja, of Prophet  World Beat Productions. "It's free. Our aim is to get the inner city kids to  open their eyes to the variety of music and dance available."  </P> <P> Prophet World Beat Productions was founded about seven years ago by Marianne  Makeda Cheatom, originally to present the arts of Africa and Jamaica. Since  then the organization has produced arts events from a number of countries.  </P> <P> The Mariko Dance Troupe was chosen because it mixes traditional and modern  Japanese dance, Seja said. World Beat's proposal calls for a week of concerts  and workshops. The dance concerts, which will involve local dancers along with  the Ghanians, will be in the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. Seja plans to  present a series of dance workshops at recreational centers in north and south  county communities.  </P> <P> World Beat has lined up about $20,000 in grants from two Japanese companies,  Seja said. The total budget for its proposal is $44,000.  </P> <P> The Avenue of the Arts' budget, in contrast the budgets for the other two  groups, totals just $18,200, said Lynne Walker, the group's spokeswoman. Walker  said the plan requires a four-block street closing, at a location to be  announced, on Nov. 11 and 12, the final weekend of the Soviet arts festival.  </P> <P> "We would have up to 120 booths for San Diego County artists to show,  demonstrate or sell, at no cost to the artists," Walker said. "We'll have one  and a half blocks of ethnic food booths and one block of hands-on activities  for kids, like mask making, working in clay and painting."  </P> <P> The Avenue of the Arts plan calls for a juried art exhibit. Walker also plans  to use a jury-like panel to screen booth applicants to obtain "higher quality  work. We're hoping to have more fine arts and not T-shirt booths," she said.  </P> <P> Walker is requesting only $14,000 in a city subsidy, she said. The remaining  $4,200 will be raised from participation fees for the food booths and through  the estimated purchases of canopies, which all booths must have.  </P> <P> Walker and Carol Dunn, who founded and operated the Avenue of the Arts the past  three years during Artwalk, view their proposed event as a bridge between the  last weekend of the Soviet Arts Festival and National Arts Week, which begins  the following week.  </P> <P> "We plan to have a mini-Artwalk" in which artists' studios and galleries are  open to the public, Walker said.  </P> <P> The three proposals will be reviewed by a panel of city staff members and  members of the Commission for Arts and Culture. The panel will make a  recommendation later this summer to the full commission, which will award the  grant.  </P></p>

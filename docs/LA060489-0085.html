			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANK STELLA: MINIMALIST TO THE MAX;  </P> <P> THE ARTIST;  </P> <P> HE HAS ENJOYED FAIL-SAFE CAREER  </P> <P> Frank Stella certainly doesn't look like the leading international Classical  Baroque master of abstract art. At 53 he is fit if a trifle paunchy. Installing  his show in the galleries of the County Museum of Art, he blends in with the  crew wearing gray chinos, gray T-shirt and black Reeboks. They match his short,  grizzled hair, but neither his tan complexion nor his huge colorful works.  Woody Allen could play the part of the painter if you toned the actor down a  bit.  </P> <P> Stella consults with museum director Earl (Rusty) Powell, who looks  resplendently dignified in a dark suit. They appear involved in a matter of  great import. Maybe something about changes Stella is making in the hanging.  The 40 or so works look airy but range up to a ton in weight and some are  cantilevered from false walls so switching them around is no easy matter. As it  turns out, the two men are just making a date to play squash later in the  afternoon.  </P> <P> There is something of the athletic realist about the painter. He used to go to  a lot of Formula One races in Europe, and he still breeds racehorses as a hobby  although he doesn't much like to talk about it. "My biggest nightmare is that  someday I'll breed a winner. Imagine having a horse that's more famous than you  are." He has the slightly incredulous twang and staccato delivery of a real New  Yorker. He used to have a reputation as a somewhat thorny character. These days  he is relaxed and affable even in the midst of an installation.  </P> <P> As painters go, there are very few who equal the stature and reknown of Frank  Stella. For nearly 30 years he has held center stage in the art world. He  started successful in the '60s and instead of fizzling out with the demise of  Minimalist abstraction, he got a huge second wind in his series of glitzy  Baroque template paintings.  </P> <P> "For a long time I resisted being an artist. In the social milieu where I grew  up, there was something demeaning about it. My parents' view was that artists  were possibly a little better than pimps. They thought art had to do with the  past. Michelangelo could be a great artist, but there was no sense in being an  artist in the present."  </P> <P> Stella was born in a suburb of Boston. His father was a gynecologist, his  mother had gone to art school. He attended Andover and Princeton. When he came  on the art scene, such tony university credentials were virtually unheard of.  He represented a new breed of intellectually sophisticated artist. He married  the art critic Barbara Rose. Another critic, Michael Fried, served as best man.  His early work was intensely rational and seemingly designed to fuel critical  dialogue. The work was tight. Today everybody wants to know how he made the  transition to his loose manner.  </P> <P> Some observers think it came from a happy second marriage to Helen McGurk and  the birth of two sons whom the artist enjoys enormously. But he doesn't much  like such psychological interpretations.  </P> <P> "I taught myself to paint doing the stripe paintings. I saw them as somehow  parallel to other painting but not really painting. Somehow I needed to isolate  myself. I wanted to be separate from it. Maybe something in my temperament.  </P> <P> "Doing the stripe paintings gave me the freedom and courage I needed before I  could loosen up and join the mainstream."  </P> <P> Stella has the reputation as one of the most influential figures of his day.  One sees his shadow constantly in the works of other artists both obscure and  famous. Just outside the galleries housing his retrospective there is a colored  sculpture by Nancy Graves, which bears a family resemblance to his art.  </P> <P> "Sure, I'm aware of influence, but it cuts both ways. How could you look at  what I'm doing now and not think of what John Chamberlain has been doing for  years? I just got to it later.  </P> <P> "I think the '60s were a good period. There was an extraordinary level of  energy both in the degree of talent and in the numbers of artists. Think about  all those good people from Ellsworth Kelly to Jack Youngerman and Pop people  like James Rosenquist. I'll give you nine to five there will be an Olitski  revival in a few years. Anthony Caro is an extraordinary talent."  </P> <P> But if they are still so good, why is he the one universally seen as the  unfaltering winner, the artist with the fail-safe career?  </P> <P> "Maybe I just have a talent for shooting my mouth off. You know the public is  lazy. If they see the same thing long enough, they accept it and fall asleep.  Change wakes them up.  </P> <P> But he didn't change, he says, for the public. In his view the changes that  evolved in the studio were gradual and logical rather than dramatic. It is  striking that late stripe paintings and the Baroque works in the galleries are  so clearly the creation of the same man.  </P> <P> "Painters paint to keep themselves interested," Stella shrugs.  </P> <P> The retrospective has been traveling since 1987, LACMA being its final stop.  Stella traveled to all six venues, including stops in Paris and Amsterdam. He  notices the work seems to change in each location.  </P> <P> "Some pieces get tired on the road, others seem to like to travel. You know  this is sort of trivial, but there are pieces here that seem to be finished and  others that stay alive. They all come back to the studio between shows and we  work on some of them. Those two (Wave Series) pieces over there were almost  completely repainted after the Berlin show."  </P> <P> He paces the galleries constantly as he talks to a visitor. Critics have raised  questions about the genre of the works. Are they paintings or relief  sculptures? Stella says he has been grappling with that, "learning" from the  works. He points out how he has progressively resolved the problems that arise  from having works jut so far out from the walls that they have several angles  of view.  </P> <P> "I think it's getting pretty well solved. When you study your own work, it's  the ideas in them that turn out to be useful. You try to combine the best of  what you've done before and come up with something that really has it all."  </P> <P> "I'm haunted by this fear that in the end what you make is only an object, only  a decorative thing. I try to infuse the work with real life, but you never  know."  </P> <P> Stella is noted as an obdurate defender of abstract art and of modernism, which  seem to be pretty much the same thing to him -- the legitimate extension of the  history of all art.  </P> <P> "I don't want to talk a bunch of baloney here, but painting is not a base  activity. Painting is a high calling and what you do should contribute to the  life of the overall thing.  </P> <P> "Maybe an artist like Lucien Freud is saying something interesting at some  level, but I don't think it's anything I should have to worry about. Balthus is  an even better example. He's almost prurient. I guess I find that kind of art  too eccentric, too individual.  </P> <P> "The artist has a funny relation to history. He is history but he has to be it  and do it at the same time. That requires some distance and some integrity."  </P></p>

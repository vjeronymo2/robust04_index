			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Home Office refuses aid for charity plan THE FIRST attempt to launch a generic advertising campaign to encourage support for charity in the UK has been abandoned through lack of Home Office finance. Voluntary-sector leaders have wound up the Windsor Group, a committee of large fund-raising charities set up in 1990 to explore ways of boosting charitable donations. It would have cost an estimated Pounds 4m a year to run the campaign. The 29 Windsor Group charities pledged a total of Pounds 500,000 provided the government put up Pounds 1.5m. Promoters of the campaign believed it would have been possible to use the pledge of government support to raise the other Pounds 2m from grant-making trusts and private-sector supporters. The Home Office has told the group that, in the present state of public spending, it will not be possible to put public funds into the campaign. The decision will add to charity managers' concerns about the government's attitude to the voluntary sector, which ministers want to take on more responsibilities. Charities face losing up to Pounds 147m a year in donations because of the national lottery, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations said yesterday. They would lose donations worth Pounds 232m and gain Pounds 90m from the lottery, it said.</p>

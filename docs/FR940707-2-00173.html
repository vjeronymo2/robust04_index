			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange states that the scope of the aforementioned definition is intended to be consistent with the goals of Section 15(f) of the Act and ITSFEA to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. The Exchange believes that this definition should be broad enough to encompass frontrunning, trading on the basis of material corporate inside information, tipping, and misappropriating material corporate inside information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplementary Material .02 defines the terms ``associated person'' or ``person associated with a member.'' These terms shall mean any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a member, or any employee of a member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplementary Material .03 requires, at a minimum, that each member establish, maintain and enforce certain policies and procedures. This provision specifically requires, first, that members must advise all associated persons in writing of the prohibition against the misuse of material, non-public information. Second, each member organization and all persons associated with that member organization must sign statements affirming their awareness of and agreement to abide by the prohibitions of the ITSFEA Rule. These signed statements must be maintained for at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place. Third, each member organization must maintain copies of trade confirmations and monthly account statements for each account in which an associated person has a direct or indirect interest or makes investment decisions. These trade confirmations and monthly account statements must be maintained for at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place. In addition, such brokerage accounts must be reviewed at least quarterly by the member organization for the purpose of detecting the possible misuse of material, non-public information. Fourth, an associated person must disclose to the member organization whether he, or any person in whose account he has a direct or indirect financial interest, is an officer, director or 10% shareholder in a company whose shares are publicly traded. Any transaction in the stock (or option thereon) of such company shall be reviewed to determine whether the transaction may have involved a misuse of material, non-public information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange states that the aforementioned policies and procedures may not, in all cases, satisfy the requirements of this rule. The adequacy of each member's policies and procedures will depend upon the nature of such member's business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplementary Material .04 and the Sample Membership Bulletin <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  (Exhibit 3 to the proposal) describe a set of forms, denominated as the ``ITSFEA Compliance Procedures'' (Exhibit 4 to the proposal), which may be used by certain eligible member organizations to facilitate their compliance with the recordkeeping and filing requirements of Chapter II, Section 37 (a) and (b). The Exchange states that the Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures are intended to constitute the minimum policies and procedures required by the Act and this rule. Their use, however, does not ensure compliance with the recordkeeping and filing requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the BSE's ``Sample Membership Bulletin'' and a ``Summary of the ITSFEA Compliance Procedures'' were filed with the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures require identification of securities accounts as described in ITSFEA Form 1 (``Form 1''). Form 1 requires each associated person to submit a list of each securities accounts in which he/she either has a direct or indirect financial interest, or makes investment decisions. This list is to include not only the accounts of associated persons, but also the accounts of relatives of such persons to the extent that an associated person has an interest in such accounts or makes investment decisions with respect thereto. Form 1 further requires all associated persons to transmit to the member organization duplicate trade confirmations and monthly account statements for each account in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or for which they make investment decisions. These account statements must be maintained by the member organization for at least three years. In addition, Form 1 requires all associated persons to disclose to the member organization if they, or any persons in whose account they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or over whose account they make investment decisions, is an officer, director or 10% shareholder in the company whose shares are publicly traded. Any transaction in the stock of any company shall be reviewed to determine whether the transaction may have involved a misuse of material, non-public information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He called for a firm resolve to prevail in  that dialogue for reaching an agreement which would be  consistent with the national interest and responsive to the  aspirations of the Moroccan people.    Yata, who was speaking at a press conference that was held  yesterday in Rabat, said, "The circumstances are right for such  an agreement to be reached provided we start our quest with the  premise that there are no pending issues which are impervious to  solutions." He pointed out that a solution was always possible  when the will to find it precedes the effort that is made to  find it.    The secretary general of the Party of Progress and Socialism  pointed out that the general national consensus was that  bringing about total change was extremely necessary. He added  that the present government had no credibility and that its  weakness was evident in the discussion, which is taking place at  the present time, about this year's state budget. Not only was  its term not extended for an additional month, it seemed also  that it might be overtaken by the month of Ramadan, the month of  fasting.    Yata pointed out that it was the failure to deal with the  situation politically that brought the country to this impasse.  He said that the forces of change represented the only way for  bringing about the radical change that was required. He called  for the reorganization of the Unified Front of the Moroccan  Opposition Forces, and he asked that the reorganization be  conducted without partisan fanaticism, in a spirit of  understanding and responsibility.    Yata spoke about Morocco. He said that while the country was  stable, it was everyone's national duty to concede that the  masses in cities and villages were very worried because of the  large number of unemployed youth in those cities and villages.    Yata confirmed that what can be found deep inside Moroccan  society must be taken into account. He pointed out that the  outcome [of the current situation] could be unpleasant and that  it might be similar to the bloody events which happened in Fes  and Tangier on 14 December 1990. He warned that the current  situation could lead to the same events.    Yata mentioned that his party does not want to take Morocco  backwards, but that it is rather the opinion of his party that  an effort be made to move beyond the present situation and set  the process of change in motion. No one disputes that this  process is necessary.    Yata said there was nothing new in the statement on  democracy  that was issued by the three parties of the democratic bloc, the  Istiqlal Party, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the  Organization of Democratic Popular Action, and he pointed out  that there was a set of ideas that these parties had compiled in  a document. That statement on democracy was issued on the 50th  anniversary of the day on which the document calling for the  independence of Morocco was presented.    Yata added that as he read that statement, he got no sense  of  any escalation or justification for the boycott on the part of  the three parties. He confirmed that there were ideas he agreed  with and others that were debatable, and he said that he would  like to discuss those ideas with yesterday's allies.</p>

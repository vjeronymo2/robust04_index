			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TAKING THE AIR OUT OF JORDAN HUBBUB  </P> <P> The National Basketball Assn. playoffs have inspired a lot of Jordan vs. Magic  columns. But how about Michael Jordan vs. Akeem Olajuwon, the man (along with  Sam Bowie, but that's another story) drafted ahead of Magic's Air Apparent?  </P> <P> The first instinct, of course, is to declaim the chowderheads who let Jordan  pass on down to the Chicago Bulls in that 1984 draft. But Tony Kornheiser of  the Washington Post has come up with some numbers that suggest the pick was not  all that foolish.  </P> <P> He points out that Houston was 29-53 the year before Olajuwon but that within  two seasons the Rockets won 51 games and reached the NBA finals. Chicago was  27-55 before Jordan and didn't get over .500 until his fourth season and is  still working on that NBA championship.  </P> <P> "Jordan," Kornheiser wrote, "hasn't won anything yet but the scoring title."  </P> <P> Further: "Giving Jordan a great center to work with wouldn't have improved  Chicago as much as giving Olajuwon a great point guard would improve the  Rockets."  </P> <P> Problem is, he gets out: Iran Barkley is preparing for his Aug. 14 fight with  middleweight champion Michael Nunn as does any other boxer these days: He's  going to jail. That is, he plans to spar with inmates at Rikers Island over the  next couple of weeks before opening training camp in California. The idea is to  get meaner. "My whole purpose is to get into the mood to kill people," he said.  </P> <P> Tubular, Bob: That fight, incidentally, will be held in Reno, away from Nunn's  constituency in Los Angeles, where he has fought the most. Reasons promoter Bob  Arum: "All those Nunn fans, where do you think they'll be on Aug. 14? On the  beach in Malibu. They're not going to go to the fight when they can sit back,  smoke some grass and watch it on HBO."  </P> <P> How sweet it is: Ken Griffey Jr. may not have Reggie Jackson's numbers yet but  at least Seattle's rookie outfielder didn't have to wait until he got to New  York for somebody to put out a candy bar with his name on it.  </P> <P> The Ken Griffey Jr. candy bar came out in Seattle stores on May 17 and the  entire production was sold out two days later.  </P> <P> High-fives for a full count: Rich Donnelly, a coach for the Pirates, remembers  hard times in the minors. "I managed a team that was so bad we considered a  2-and-0 count on the batter a rally."  </P> <P> They called him Catfish Morgan then: The Dodgers' Mike Morgan was a Charles  Finley creation 11 years ago when the Oakland A's owner put the youngster into  the starting rotation right out of high school. Said Morgan: "Oakland was  struggling for attendance then. I had nothing to lose, everything to gain. I  gained a lot of losses."  </P> <P> Morgan, 3-2 with the National League's best ERA so far this season, lost his  only three decisions for Finley and was sent to the minors. The next season he  lost his first six starts before winning and has been, up until this year, the  pitcher with the worst record (34-68) in baseball.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What winning Indianapolis 500 driver made the most pit stops? The  fewest?  </P> <P> More annals of boxing: Buddy McGirt, who recently lost a junior welterweight  title, is frustrated by his new invisibility. "Mike Tyson gets a speeding  ticket and it's news. I had three speeding tickets and no one wrote about  that."  </P> <P> It's not that simple, Buddy. In all fairness, c'mon. Tyson's were acquired in  two weeks. It took McGirt a year.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Bobby Unser made 11 stops in 1975. Johnny Rutherford made four  in the rain-shortened 1976 race. Such records were first kept in 1923.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Lesley Visser, who along with other female sportswriters had to  battle for years to be admitted to locker rooms for postgame interviews, said  this when she was finally inside the smelly, cramped quarters of the Boston  Garden: "We fought for the right to get in here?"  </P></p>

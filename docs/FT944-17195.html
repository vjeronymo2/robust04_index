			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Two clear ways for managers to increase profits Which of the new telecommunications services now on offer will give managers the best chance of increasing their profitability? OTR Group, a consultancy based in London and Brussels, has been investigating this question over the past two years and concludes that two - virtual private networks and nationwide fibre-optic networking - 'stand out like beacons'. The first, OTR says, will enable large cost savings. The second offers the promise of new services where some companies could make large profits in the not too distant future. The conclusions of OTR's report* will be welcomed by managers attracted by the excitement over multimedia and the information superhighway but dazzled by the options open to them. 'They have no intention of going on a technology buying binge in a fast-moving area of which they know little,' says OTR. Virtual private networks (VPNs) are an alternative to private leased lines and can work out 30 per cent cheaper. VPN is a form of outsourcing. The telecommunications carrier operates the network on behalf of the customer, almost certainly be a medium-sized or large business. According to OTR's figures, a VPN works out cheaper than private networks if the volume of traffic over the network is less than 2,000 minutes a day. The advantages from VPN include least cost routing - a call between the Amsterdam and London offices of a company, for example, would be charged only at local London rates. Holiday Inn Worldwide spends Dollars 425m with AT&amp;T on VPN services and reckons to benefit by a 40 per cent discount on tariffs, depending on volume. National fibre optic networks or information superhighways, are likely to be aimed chiefly at consumers. OTR has identified nine product categories for the superhighway, of which the first eight are consumer driven - video-on-demand, home shopping, home information, games, home financial services, videotelephony, education, news and medicine. According to OTR, business needs are already being met by conventional communications: 'There is not sufficient new demand from the business community to warrant the installation of a national fibre-optic network.' This conflicts with the commonly held view that business will be first to see the benefits of, and be prepared to pay for, information travelling on the superhighway. OTR sees the first beneficiaries of a national fibre optic network as service companies replacing, for example, expensive professional consultancy with videos explaining financial or legal matters. It estimates 2005 as the year when the superhighway will be fully operational in the US, Europe and Japan, but argues that the business benefits will start to trickle through by as early as 1995. *What new telecommunications services will provide the largest opportunities for business benefits?

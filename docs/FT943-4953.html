			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LEAD prices rose to a fresh two-year peak of USDollars 622 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange following speculative buying and short covering ahead of stock figures today expected by some traders to show another fall. This should spark more gains towards Dollars 650. ALUMINIUM vacillated, driven down by the end of the three-week strike at Australia's Tomago smelter, which cost output of about 80,000 tonnes, but given support by news that the Volta River Authority in Ghana had told Kaiser to halt output at its 200,000-tonnes-a-year Valco smelter. OIL prices slipped back as more evidence emerged that the strike in the Nigerian industry, which began on July 4, was coming to an end. Compiled from Reuters</p>

This is also indicated by concrete figures. In only four  months of this year, 2,178 crimes connected with narcotics were  registered in Kazakhstan--not so long ago, that many did not  accumulate even during a five-year plan! Two hundred eleven  cases of the sale of the killing "grass" have been exposed.  Thirty-four hideouts, where people of all ages and nationalities  "got kicks" were destroyed. Almost two metric tons (!) of  narcotics were removed. Criminal proceedings were instituted  against 1,276 people. Called to account were another 929  consumers of the poison; in all, 14,000 of them have now been  registered in Kazakhstan. Multiply by 10--and you will obtain  more or less the real number of potential killers, thieves and  users of violence, capable of doing away with their own mother  for a "a small amount of vodka."    Prior to 1986, in Kazakhstan, as throughout the entire USSR,  they obstinately pretended that "we do not have and will never  have any drug addicts in our country." Now for already eight  years running people in the republic "demonstrate constant  concern" and "they are considering a state program of struggle".  But while all the new documents on "counteraction" are being  discussed, the narcotics business is not losing time. It has in  abundance what the state does not have now--money. And thus, the  possibility of ordering their "music."</p>

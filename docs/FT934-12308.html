			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O plans flotation of US properties PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced that it was preparing a market flotation of some 6,677 US garden apartments. The apartments are part of Laing Properties Inc, a 50:50 joint venture between P&amp;O and Chelsfield. They were acquired when the two companies staged a Pounds 495m takeover of Laing Properties in 1990. The takeover was effected through an investment vehicle - Pall Mall - and in March 1992 Laing's worldwide portfolio, with the exception of the US properties, was divid-ed between P&amp;O and Chels-field. P&amp;O said it would next week file a notice with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the flotation of the portfolio as a real estate investment trust. REITs, property companies with management, acquisition and development capabilities, offer investors the opportunity to participate in diversified portfolios. Analysts estimate it could be worth some Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m). P&amp;O said Laing Properties Inc would continue to own some 2.7m sq ft of commercial property, which was part of the dealing portfolio, and was expected to hold some 25 per cent of the REIT. Analysts have said property sales would help P&amp;O to reduce gearing - which stood at 70 per cent in September - and raise funds at a time when cash generation by its other operations was being hampered by recessionary mar-kets.</p>

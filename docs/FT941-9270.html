			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Clinton blames Europe on jobs President Bill Clinton's administration is increasingly critical in private of western Europe's failure to stimulate growth to create jobs, according to confidential documents in the possession of the Financial Times. US economic policy-makers believe European governments are wrong to concentrate on structural supply side reforms in the labour market to cut their dole queues. They also want to see a European commitment to economic expansion. Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, warned European central bankers at a meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in December that unless European nations followed more ambitious growth objectives, unemployment would not be significantly reduced by the end of the decade. And last month in a letter to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD's director general, Mr David Aaron, new head of the US mission to the OECD, expressed criticism about OECD's 'lack of a positive role for macroeconomic approaches in addressing unemployment'. His remarks were in response to the draft OECD paper on employment and unemployment to be published next month. 'Structural reforms are more effective in an environment of growth,' argues Mr Aaron. 'In the present climate of inadequate demand, reforms are more likely to be ineffectual or merely cause jobs to shift from one sector or activity to another. Indeed, some structural reforms undertaken in a climate of deficient demand would exacerbate joblessness. 'This is particularly relevant in the case of Europe where there is substantial room to reduce short-term interest rates to stimulate aggregate demand, although fiscal policy is admittedly constrained,' wrote Mr Aaron. The US head of mission told Mr Paye he had the backing of Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist. At the December OECD meeting Mr Summers made it clear the US wants a European macroeconomic stimulus and not just structural reforms to create employment. He said the European situation was moving 'from stagflation to stagnation' casting 'doubt over the European medium term economic-political strategies'. The US under-secretary wondered 'if inflation could not become too low' and said it was 'difficult to understand why France and Germany accepted low growth rates'.</p>

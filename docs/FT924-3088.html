			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close after early loss reversed A SUDDEN revival of confidence in the UK stock market yesterday afternoon reversed early falls in share prices and put the market back on the bull tack. A recovery in stock index futures provided the trigger for the upturn in equities but sentiment was also encouraged by favourable reports from US Purchasing Managers. In early trading, a dull trend in the US dollar restrained the international blue chips and the FT-SE Index sagged by 8.8 points. But trading volume was very slow in the first couple of hours of the trading session. The turn came when the December contract on the FT-SE Index found support again and re-established a premium after the weakness of the past two sessions. Share prices quickly moved higher, and trading volume increased as ground was recaptured. The market closed virtually at the day's best, with a gain of 15.3 taking the FT-SE Index to 2,769.8. Seaq volume finally totalled 605m shares compared with 426.7m on Monday when retail or customer business fell away to only Pounds 879.6m; this retail figure represents a fall below the daily averages of around Pounds 1bn recorded steadily since Britain quit the ERM in mid-September. Traders commented that the market's volatility reflected its underlying confidence for the near term. While few strategists wanted to be drawn on prospects for favourable news from this morning's meeting at the Bundesbank  -news that a press conference has been arranged failed to stir excitement - but there are still some hopes that domestic interest rates could be trimmed by at least half a point before the end of the year. The best news of the day came from across the Atlantic, when the US National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM), in its semi-annual economic report, said that the outlook for US retail sales was the brightest for three years. The past fortnight has seen the London market responding readily to indications of economic improvement in the US. By the close, the internationals were mostly firmer on the day, although, with the Dow Average down 1.90 in London hours, support from New York was very selective. One Far Eastern house active in London has urged clients to 'Buy the Footsie, sell the Dow', adding that the UK is a likely switch for US equity investors now that the near term currency depreciation of the dollar seems to be over. However. a poor exception among blue chips yesterday was ICI, still out of favour with the UK investment community. A sharp cut in UK petrol prices by BP caused some surprise but strategists were unwilling to read too much into the move, in terms of benefit either for the consumer or industry in general. Retail and store issues, regarded as the sector likely to show the first signs of benefit from economic recovery, continued to move ahead in modest trading. Brewery stocks were in better form. But the best gains came in sectors which are deemed to have suffered over-severely as the stock market has slowed down over the past few sessions. Water stocks came in for renewed buying. A steadier trend in the Hong Kong market helped those UK stocks which have been vulnerable to shocks from this direction.</p>

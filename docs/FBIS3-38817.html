			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Transport Minister Raffaele Costa by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "The Liberal Party  Will Not Split"]    [Text] If he is not stirring up things, it is not him.  Raffaele Costa, Minister Raffaele Costa, is to open the 22d  Italian Liberal Party [PLI] Congress today by suggesting no less  than a renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty. "I will  challenge the European Community -- now the European Union --  over its bureaucratic and welfarist approach," Costa revealed in  this interview with IL GIORNALE, "and demand that the treaty be  renegotiated and its implementation reviewed."    [Guiglia] Is there still a Liberal Party?    [Costa] There are many Liberals. Many more than voted for  the PLI in the last election. I think that is what really counts.    [Guiglia] Are you not afraid that the PLI will end up  splitting like the PRI [Italian Republican Party], albeit in  choosing between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [Pact for  Italy leader] Segni?    [Costa] The Liberals are in a very different situation from  the PRI. None of us has gone as far as to question  liberal-democratic values. Among the Republicans there are  those who have no qualms about hitching up with the grouping  Communist Renewal is a part of. Frankly, I think that is a bit  excessive.    [Guiglia] De Luca is offering himself as a candidate for  secretary. Will you step down?    [Costa] I resigned from the post of secretary general a few  months ago. In the past few days De Luca has made no secret of  the fact that he is prepared to take on the job. I find that a  remarkably courageous gesture at a time like this. We will see  what the congress thinks about it.    [Guglia] What has the PLI done to erase the memory of  [former Health Minister] De Lorenzo?    [Costa] The ombudsman's office, that was reestablished last  summer after I took office, has gathered information from  hundreds and hundreds of citizens, for months, on the  inefficiency of the bureaucracy. We have listened to everybody.  We have also been able to help some stand up for their rights.  But that is not all: The overall picture that we have  presented to the Italians is one of a party of honest people.    [Guiglia] You are in your fifth parliamentary term. Do you  feel part of the so-called "new vanguard"?    [Costa] A mere two years ago, I appeared to be a sort of Don  Quixote tilting at windmills. All of a sudden I find myself  surrounded by illustrious people who appear to be discovering  only now that the civil service is inefficient, wasteful, and  arrogant. In 1992, I set up an inquiry into the 4 trillion lire  development cooperation [Foreign Ministry department] affair.  Everything is now in the hands of the magistracy, but at the  time it was as if nobody wanted to acknowledge what was going on.    [IL Guiglia] Will Segni continue to waver or has he settled  down?    [Costa] I would like to see him take one more small step  toward establishing a moderate grouping.    [Guiglia] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi, Berlusconi or  [National Alliance leader] Fini -- which one would you choose  for prime minister?    [Costa] Berlusconi has shown himself to be a capable  helmsman in a stormy sea. Bossi has exceptional insight, he  knows what people want. Fini would have made an excellent mayor  of Rome.    [IL Guiglia] What issues could unite the moderates?    [Costa] Privatization, deregulation, and the abolition of  bureaucracy.    [Guiglia] Do you accept the sanction opposed by the League  against Liberal Party member Sterpa?    [Costa] I have never heard of any sanction of that sort.    [Guiglia] Liberal Party member Zanone intends to run for  election in Turin. Will you vote for him?    [Costa] Zanone has been moving down a different path from  that of the Liberals for some time now. I do not see why our  paths should cross again, now of all times.    [Guiglia] Is it still possible to prevent Occhetto from  reaching the Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]?    [Costa] It depends. If those who claim they oppose him  manageed to adopt a more open-minded attitude and ceased their  futile arguing, we could succeed. The team we can count on now  is already very good.    [Guiglia] If it is to win, does the moderate grouping have  to conquer the north or the center-south?    [Costa] It has to convince the majority of Italians. And I  would suggest that we are already a fair way along the road to  success. How many Italians do you think want to see Italy turn  into the last paradise of real socialism.</p>

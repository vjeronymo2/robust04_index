			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Yugoslav republic of Slovenia defied federal authorities and vowed to give  itself the right to secede. Communist Party leaders in Slovenia, a small  republic of 2 million, said they will adopt amendments to their republic's  constitution declaring that it can split from Yugoslavia by referendum.  Yugoslavia's federal Communist Party leaders went into emergency session in  Belgrade to discuss the crisis, the biggest threat to the country's unity posed  by a single republic since the Communist takeover in 1945.  </P></p>

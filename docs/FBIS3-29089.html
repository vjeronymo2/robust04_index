			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- An enlarged meeting  of the executive Committee of the International Liaison  Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea [Cilreco] held in  Paris on February 6 adopted an action programme for 1994.    The action programme manifested support to the proposal to  reunify Korea in the form of confederacy which was advanced by  the great leader President Kim Il-song and clarified its policy  to dynamically conduct the international solidarity movement to  realise the proposal for founding the democratic confederal  republic of Koryo and the 10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation.    It noted:    The primary task of the international liaison committee in  its activities for 1994 is to check and frustrate the U.S.  adventurous policy of strength against the DPRK and rouse  widespread international opinion demanding a successful progress  of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The formula of reunification through confederacy is the most  realistic way of founding a unified state, independent and  neutral, peaceful and non-aligned, leaving the two systems in  the North and the South of Korea as they are, and achieving a  genuine unity of the nation.    The international liaison committee will further strengthen  the international solidarity movement with the Korean people in  their struggle for the reunification of the country and rouse  wide international opinion to urge the South Korean authorities  to promote the great national unity with an independent stand.    It once again expresses full support to the proposal for  founding the democratic confederal republic of Koryo and the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and  decides it as its main task for its activities in 1994 to rouse  widespread international opinion in favor of the proposal for  reunification by means of confederacy.    With a view to making solidarity movement powerful in many  countries of the world, it declares 1994 a "year of  international solidarity for support to the reunification of  Korea through confederacy".    While giving priority to the above-mentioned two points, it  will dynamically conduct the solidarity movement for the final  solution to the Korean issue.    It will make its utmost in its activities in 1994 to wage a  powerful movement for demanding the withdrawal of the U.S.  troops and nuclear weapons and other arms and equipment from  South Korea, a perpetual end to all forms of provocative  military exercises in the Korean peninsula, a termination of the  U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the [words  indistinct], replacement of the Korean armistice agreement of  1953 with a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United  States, urging the South Korean authorities to stop the  suppression of the democratic figures fighting for independence,  democracy and reunification, abrogate the notorious "national  security law", release the imprisoned patriots and respect human  rights, demanding the resumption of heart-to-heart North-South  dialogue for the faithful implementation of the inter-Korean  agreement and dismantlement of the concrete wall and supporting  the establishment of a nuclear-free, peace zone on the Korean  peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of  Korea.</p>

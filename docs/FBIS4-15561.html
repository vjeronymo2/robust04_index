			<p>BFN     [Text] The press center of the Baltic Fleet has described  as completely untrue reports in some of the media that the  command of the Baltic Fleet's Tallinn base has illegally sold to  local commercial bodies a number of out-of-service hover landing  craft containing sources of radioactive radiation.    The fact of the matter is that, after receiving permission  from higher authority, the command of Tallinn naval base agreed  in February 1993 to hand over two redundant minesweepers for  scrapping and subsequent sale to the Estonian (Bankir) company.  The terms of the agreement have been observed by both sides.  There were no sources of radioactive radiation on the  minesweepers. Moreover, ships of the type in question are not  designed to carry such installations.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Beijing may toughen line on N Korea China has given no official indication that it might be about to reconsider its refusal to countenance sanctions against North Korea over Pyongyang's resistance to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of nuclear facilities. But there is also no doubt that Beijing is viewing developments with increasing alarm, and may have decided to begin sending more pointed signals to Pyongyang that it cannot continue to defy international pressures. In Hong Kong at the weekend, the Beijing-funded newspaper Ta Kung Pao provided the first hint that China might, if all else fails, fall into line with sanctions that would include an oil and food embargo. China would also cease all border trade, the article said. China's oil exports to North Korea are critical to the continued functioning of its economy, and perhaps more importantly its war machine. Chinese foodstuffs are also vital to a country suffering from shortages of basic items. But, for the moment, it seems more likely that China will continue to insist that diplomatic efforts be exhausted before the international community resorts to sanctions. South Korea has few links with the North, so the impact of its sanctions would be limited without the participation of other nations. South Korean officials have indicated that Seoul wanted a resolution that would put an economic embargo into effect only if North Korea failed to offer a credible way to open its nuclear programme by a deadline. 'This formula might make it easier for China to take part in the resolution,' the official said. A conditional embargo seems compatible with a statement by US President Bill Clinton that Pyongyang could still head off sanctions. In Beijing last week a foreign ministry spokesman said that, while China was very concerned about the issue, 'we do not favour the resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation'. However, as the crisis deepens, it is becoming more difficult for Beijing to maintain that dialogue will yield positive benefits. In March, China headed off an earlier US attempt to promote a sanctions process in the United Nations Security Council, arguing that more time was needed to draw Pyongyang into discussion on the nuclear issue. Two months have passed without tangible progress. Indeed the IAEA conclusion that it may now be too late to verify what has happened to weapons grade plutonium from spent fuel rods in North Korea's nuclear reactors suggests that diplomacy has failed. Chinese officials were this weekend talking about 'fresh complications' over North Korea, but this is a long way from indicating a sea-change in policy may be under way. Beijing has no interest in seeing a further destabilised Korean peninsula and one in which nuclear weapons have become part of the equation on both sides of the demilitarised zone. But equally, it remains deeply opposed to meddling by outside powers in the region's affairs. One of China's abiding fears is that an economic blockade against an impoverished North Korea might precipitate a refugee stampede along the two countries' common frontier. If Beijing fell into line with limited sanctions it would almost certainly produce a deep chill, if not a diplomatic estrangement with Pyongyang. China would risk such a development only as a last resort.</p>

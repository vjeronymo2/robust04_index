			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALDEBERTS EXUDE SPECIAL CHARM  </P> <P> Monique and Louis Aldebert, on permanent loan from France for the past two  decades, have become as familiar a part of the local landscape as the room that  has been housing them lately, the Smoke House in Burbank.  </P> <P> Their special brand of charm still has Gallic overtones, though at their first  show Wednesday the Anglicization seemed to have been stretched a little too  far. It was a welcome change of pace when they got around to singing "One Note  Samba" in French.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the elegant essence remains: Monique Aldebert handles the lead  role in her pure, gentle voice while her husband hums an occasional obbligato,  joining her once in a while for a boppish unison, as in the wild and mostly  wordless workout on Lester Young's "Tickle Toe."  </P> <P> His main function is that of accompanist; in addition to furnishing sympathetic  piano backing, he has sequenced certain passages that enabled him to simulate  an orchestra with useful synth effects. If there were problems with the  amplification, was it ever any other way in a typical restaurant experimenting  with music?  </P> <P> The synth was helpful in establishing a mood on "Try to Remember." The  Aldeberts reversed their roles as Louis took over the lead voice for their own  composition "Home Is Where the Heart Is." Another, newer original, "Music Is a  Love Affair," reflected their special talents in the creation of music and  English lyrics.  </P> <P> Understatement has always been a keynote of the Aldeberts' offerings. If this  means they are swimming against the tide, so be it; too often on today's vocal  scene the waves in the other direction seem overwhelming.  </P> <P> They close Saturday at the Smoke House but will continue their other gig,  working Thursdays through Sundays from 3 to 7 p.m. in the Observation Bar  aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew into Britain for  today's Anglo-German summit to be met by John Major and a full  guard of honour. The one-day meeting provides Mr Major with an  opportunity to enhance his image as a European statesman in  advance of June's Euro elections after an embarrassing climbdown  over EU [European Union] voting rights.    Officials have stressed the close personal relationship  between the two leaders but divisions between Germany and  Britain have been reported over who should be the next president  of the European Commission. Britain wants Sir Leon Brittan,  the senior British Commissioner, to succeed Jacques Delors in  the 150,000 pound sterling a year job. But it is understood Mr  Kohl favours Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene. Tory Euro  sceptics claim Mr Dehaene is an avowed federalist.    Stepping out of a German Air Force jet at RAF Northolt, west  London, Mr Kohl refused to be drawn on the issue. He joked  that he could then be required to back every member state's  chosen candidate each time he visited their country.    Mr Major said: "It is our view that Sir Leon is the best  candidate. We will need to discuss that with all our  colleagues, it will be a collective decision."    Mr Kohl stressed the warmth of Britain's relationship with  Germany and Mr Major said he was delighted to see "such a good  friend of the UK" back on British soil.    Turning briefly to the situation in Gorazde, Mr Major said:  "It does seem we had a pretty quiet night in Gorazde. At the  moment aid is getting in and patients are getting out. I am  delighted that is proving to be the case and I hope further  examination today will show that the Serb armaments have been  moved 20 kilometres away, as requested."    The two leaders then boarded a helicopter for Chequers, Mr  Major's official country residence, for around three hours of  talks before they return to London to join their respective  economic and foreign ministers, who are holding separate talks,  for a news conference at the Foreign Office.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Shuxi (2621 2885 0823): "The Gold Industry </F> Is Being Made Part of Market Economy"]    [Text] The gold industry, which occupies a special  position within the economy of our country, has undergone great  changes and reforms since 1993. Gold enterprises have now left  the rigid control of the planned economy and the pattern of  solely relying on state policy for development, and have entered  the great sea of the market economy.    China is a big gold-producing and gold-consuming country.  Since reform and opening up, our country's gold industry has  rapidly developed and our gold production ability has increased  five times. In order to expedite the development of the gold  industry in our country so as to meet the needs of market  economy, reform, and opening up, the state has tremendously  reformed the system of production and management of the gold  industry.    First, reform of the system. The State Administration of  Gold Control has been abolished, and the management system  combining the government and enterprises has been changed. The  China Gold Company, which is now under the leadership of the  Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, has really become an  economic entity, and "the company has the right to occupy and  utilize according to law the assets granted to it by the  ministry for operation and management, as well as the right to  reap profits from the assets and take disciplinary actions  regarding the assets."    Second, reform of policy. Our country has carried out a  reform of the pricing system of gold beginning in September  1993, and the purchasing price of gold inside the country has  been increased 80 percent in one stroke, so that it matches the  gold price in the international community. However, the  preferential policy and favorable treatment provided by the  state to gold enterprises has been canceled. For example, the  development of the gold industry no longer enjoys low-interest  bank loans; gold mines no longer enjoy preferential tax waivers  or reductions, but must pay value-added taxes, resource taxes,  and geological resource compensation fees; the system of  retention of foreign exchange by gold enterprises has been  abolished, and so on. All of these work to strip gold  enterprises of their patron saint, so they can only enter the  market and develop and compete according to market laws. At the  same time, the state will gradually open up the gold market, and  gold will gradually lose its original currency role and enter  the market as a commodity.    Third, expand opening up. The state has agreed to let the  gold industry carry out pilot projects for attracting foreign  capital to develop China's gold mines, and the Ministry of  Metallurgical Industry has granted the China Gold Company the  corresponding rights. A person in charge of the China Gold  Company told this reporter that the company will first open up  some low-grade gold mines which require hard effort in ore  dressing, to carry out limited cooperation with foreign  businessmen. Foreign businessmen have been responding to the  idea very enthusiastically and have come to China to discuss  cooperation. On 20 January, Xu Daquan, vice minister of  metallurgical industry, said when meeting the gold delegation  led by former Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney that China  welcomes powerful foreign companies coming to China for  cooperation. Cui Lan, chairman of the board of directors of the  China Gold Company, said during an interview with this reporter  that, when we attract foreign capital to develop gold resources,  we are not doing so merely for attracting funds; it is more  important that we grasp the opportunity to learn advanced  technology and management experience from developed countries  through cooperation in development. The company has already  reached cooperation agreements with some advanced companies from  abroad.    Cui Xiwu, general manager of the China Gold Company, said  that, along with reforms of the gold price system and industrial  system, our country's gold production and management system and  operation strategy will change in five directions: From the  pattern in which the China Gold Company oversees administration  and shoulders unlimited responsibilities while its subordinated  enterprises operate in a scattered manner to the pattern whereby  the company is a shareholding state company while its  subordinated enterprises become the main body for production and  operation; from the pattern in which the company operates mainly  to discharge government duties and functions to the pattern  whereby the company completely becomes an enterprise which runs  the business entities well and realizes consortium-like  operation; from the pattern in which the company monopolizes  business and carries out construction with its own funds, to the  pattern whereby it actively utilizes domestic and foreign funds  and realizes joint-venture operation with funds from within and  without the country; from the pattern in which the company only  engages in gold exploration and dressing to the pattern whereby  it promotes gold products, develops areas to which gold products  can be applied, and diversifies operation so as to transcend  various trades; and from the pattern in which the company uses  only domestic resources to the pattern whereby it uses both  domestic and international resources, and walks toward  internationalized operation incorporating both the domestic and  international markets.</p>

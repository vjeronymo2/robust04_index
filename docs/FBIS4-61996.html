			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 11, BNS -- Arbalett Ltd., the first  company to give military production in Estonia after World War  II, has plans to move into a former Russian base near Turi,  central Estonia.    The base is located four kilometers from the nearest cow  farm, away from people and can be well guarded, said Andres  Rekker of the Defense League Fund, which owns one-third of the  company. The concrete hangars at the base also meet the  standards established for a military plant, he said.    Two-thirds of the shares in the company belong to individual  members of the Turi unit of the Defense League paramilitary  corps.    The issue of turning the base over to the company is  expected  to be under discussion at May 17 meeting of the government.    Arbalett Ltd. already has made and demonstrated in a field  test the serial parties of explosive packages -- used as  substitute for hand grenades in military training. The company  is set to assemble its first combat grenades soon and hopes to  launch production of land mines in June or July.    Metal shells for the hand grenades come from Erivasar, an  Estonian company. A part of the materials necessary for the  manufacture of grenades "is expected from a foreign country  soon," Rekker said.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Balladur will seek Kohl's help for way out on Gatt - France's prime minister is under pressure from his farmers and allies alike over proposals for liberalisation in agricultural trade MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, is an amenable sort of man who prefers conciliation to confrontation, but there is one issue on the agenda at his meeting in Bonn today with Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, which is in danger of being confrontational. France, like all the other participants, is anxious to conclude the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the December 15 deadline. But Mr Balladur is under pressure from France's militant farmers to reject the proposals in the hope of negotiating a more favourable agreement. If he did so, Mr Balladur would risk condemning France to international isolation. He has to persuade his allies to give him some sort of compromise so that he can placate the farmers and sign the Gatt deal. The talks today with Mr Kohl will, or so he hopes, be the first step towards such a solution. The French farmers are opposed to cuts in the EC export subsidy system which, they claim, has helped France to become the EC's largest agricultural exporter with almost a quarter of total EC production. They are a powerful political lobby in France, particularly on the right, Mr Balladur's side of the spectrum. They have already secured the support of the more outspoken members of the Balladur government, notably Mr Philippe Seguin, leader of the National Assembly. However the importance of agriculture to the French economy is fast diminishing. It now accounts for just 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product. In theory Mr Balladur ought to be able to placate the French by arguing that any threat to farming in the Gatt reforms will be easily out-weighed by the benefits to services, such as telecommunications and banking, which are a far larger part of the economy. France has already started to try to shift the emphasis of the Gatt debate by airing its grievances on services issues. It has lobbied for the US to accept further liberalisation in telecommunications and for the introduction of unilateral measures against unfair trade practices along the lines of 'Section 301' in US trade legislation. But the farmers are unlikely to let Mr Balladur off the hook. One of their most effective weapons is a talent for dramatic demonstrations, such as their tractor blockade of the EuroDisneyland theme park. The last thing Mr Balladur needs is a fresh onslaught from the farmers at a time when his government is already under fire for the sluggish state of the economy and its failure to halt the rise in unemployment. For France's allies, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round is of critical importance. A Gatt deal promises not only to end years of uncertainty on the world trade scene but to yield significant benefits for all the signatories, including France. The other signatories, not least the Germans, have made clear that they will be furious if France blocks the deal. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, recently attacked France for its 'protectionist' approach. However, after a meeting in Dresden on Tuesday with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, he said he was sure the 'few, small problems' could be resolved. The French hope that the forum for resolving those problems will be the special meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers due to be held in Brussels on September 20. France called the meeting last month in the hope that it can persuade its Community partners to re-open the Blair House accord on agriculture struck last year between the EC and the US. Mr Balladur plans today to table his proposals for a compromise deal on agriculture to Mr Kohl, in the hope of winning Germany's support before the Brussels meeting. French officials are not talking about the details although it is known that France is particularly concerned about the impact of the Blair House accord on the EC share of world cereal exports and on imports of meat and cereal into the EC. Most observers are cautiously confident that, somehow Mr Balladur will avoid vetoing the deal. 'There's no way that France wants to risk isolation,' said one. 'In any case the French have always been great last-minute merchants. They sit and sit until they have pushed the other side as far as it will go - then they back down.' Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: There is sympathy in Bonn towards Mr Balladur's difficulties with the farm trade chapter in the Gatt negotiations, but few concrete suggestions on how he might be helped. 'We would certainly try to help the French save face,' one senior official said yesterday. 'But we really do not see how we can re-open the whole negotiations with the US.' Although Mr Kohl has always been the EC leader most prepared to help France defend its agricultural interests - not least because of his own strong farming lobby - his patience has clearly worn thin. One reason is that the Blair House agreement was partly drafted by his own agricultural adviser, Mr Franz-Josef Feiter, precisely in order to help the French. Yet even that gesture was not enough for Paris. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Tokyo banks close to accord on loans group LEADING Japanese banks are close to agreement with the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan on a bail-out for Nippon Housing Loan, a housing finance company with an estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.46bn) in non-performing loans. Nippon Housing, founded by nine commercial banks in 1971, had been a leading lender to new home buyers, but became more adventurous during the late 1980s, leaving it with a large exposure to troubled property developers. The restructuring of Nippon Housing is made sensitive by its large borrowings from farm-related institutions, which pumped money into Nippon Housing as other commercial banks were increasingly reluctant to lend because of its high-risk exposure to developers. One Japanese banker said yesterday that nine banks - including Sanwa and Sakura, which have the largest exposure among commercial banks - will lower the interest rates on loans to Nippon Housing to 1.5 per cent or less. Other institutions, including those linked to agricultural co-operatives, are expected to cut their rates to around 3.25 per cent, the same as the official discount rate (ODR). In return, the commercial banks are expecting assistance from the Bank of Japan, which is likely to channel funds to them, directly or indirectly, at the ODR, enabling them to profit from the difference in market rates. While the interest rates will be reduced sharply, the banks' exposures to Nippon Housing Loan will not be counted in their non-performing loan amounts, which only include loans on which there has been no repayment for six months. However, the rapidly rising amount of loans with reduced rates is becoming as large a burden for the banks as their bad loans. These reductions have been given to a range of corporate clients and affiliated institutions weakened by falls in stock and property prices. The final rescue package for Nippon Housing, likely to be decided next week, will be a model for the restructuring of other housing loan companies, which have similar problems.</p>

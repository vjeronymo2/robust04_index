			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Big Award by Panel: The National Assn. of Securities Dealers said an  arbitration panel has ordered that Nancy L. Cooper, 42, of Atlanta be paid $1  million by broker D. Elliott Dahle Jr. and $2.1 million by Shearson Lehman  Hutton Inc., his former employer. Cooper charged that Dahle traded in her  account to generate commissions -- a process called "churning" -- and breached  his fiduciary duty, purchased stock on credit without her permission and bought  investment products that were unsuitable.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The signing of a foreign debt agreement  with the private banks means the resumption of foreign  investments in the country to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero,  and the possibility of creating jobs domestically. Ricupero  believes the agreement will be indirectly instrumental in  reaching an agreement with the IMF, which will in turn put an  end to a crisis that has afflicted Brazil for 12 years.    Ricupero said on 17 April that "the crisis that has erupted  in the country since 1982 provoked uncertainties in the  Brazilian economy and discouraged new investments."    To demonstrate that the agreement signed in Washington on 15  April will have a positive impact on the lives of all  Brazilians, Ricupero said the country now will be able to resume  major short- and medium-term investments that will increase the  number of jobs. He said: "To create more jobs is the main issue  in Brazil."    Ricupero said the agreement with the creditor banks  represents a reduction of nearly 25 percent of the overall  Brazilian foreign debt to private banks, which amounts to $51  billion. William Rhodes, Steering Committee chairman and  Citibank vice president, said in the United States that the  agreement is "historic for Brazil" and will open new fronts for  the country.    Ricupero noted that in the 1970's Brazil used to invest 25  percent of its GDP in the productive sector and today this  percentage only totals 16 percent of the GDP. He said this  situation could change as soon as economic growth is resumed  thanks to the inflow of foreign resources into our economy.    The minister said the country will get a new boost through  the approval of Provisional Measure [MP] No. 457, which creates  the Real Value Unit (URV). The MP already has been approved by  a special congressional committee and probably will be voted on  by the plenum on 20 April.    Speaking to reporters outside his home, Ricupero said: "The  MP's approval represents a guarantee for us that we are going to  resolve the inflation problem, and the agreement's signing  enables us to expect that the inflow of financial resources into  the country will soon return to normal."</p>

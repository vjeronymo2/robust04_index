			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Business expenditure on research revised upwards Spending on research and development by Britain's businesses has been more buoyant than thought in recent years, although in real terms it still has to recover to pre-recession levels, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. The CSO said its first large-scale survey for four years of business R&amp;D showed a 19 per cent increase in cash outlays to Pounds 9.13bn last year from Pounds 7.65bn in 1989, with the sums spent in both years amounting to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product. In real terms R&amp;D spending last year was 3 per cent down from the level of 1989, but had recovered from 1991 when spending dipped in the recession to 1.4 per cent of GDP. Following its survey of 5,000 businesses the CSO revised its estimates of R&amp;D spending in 1990, 1991 and 1992 upwards. Previously the CSO reported that R&amp;D spending fell in real terms in 1992 but it now says there was a slight increase. The four years to last year saw a marked shift from defence to civil R&amp;D. Civil spending increased 31 per cent to Pounds 7.77bn in cash terms in the period and in real terms was 7 per cent higher last year compared with 1989. Spending on defence R&amp;D fell 21 per cent in cash terms to Pounds 1.36bn and was 36 per cent lower in real terms last year than in 1989. Staff working on civil R&amp;D increased by 4 per cent in the four years compared with a 42 per cent fall in those engaged on defence projects. In the same period government funding of business R&amp;D fell to 13 per cent of the total from 17 per cent. The CSO said the number of staff employed on R&amp;D fell 6 per cent between 1989 and 1993. This reflected a 14 per cent fall in support staff while the number of scientists and engineers increased 2 per cent. The report painted a less gloomy picture of employment in British R&amp;D than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which recently said the decline in R&amp;D jobs had been 'particularly pronounced . . . for four years in a row'.</p>

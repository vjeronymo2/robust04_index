			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Machine tool body proposes policy for industry THE European Commission will shortly begin a new round of talks which could lead to Europe's first formal industrial policy for the fragmented and recession-torn mechanical engineering industry. Mr Alexander Schaub, deputy director general of its DG III division, confirmed yesterday that he had received a proposal paper from Cecimo, the umbrella body for 12 European machine tool associations, on a possible industrial policy for machine tools. The unpublished document, obtained by the FT, is part of a much wider proposal being prepared by Orgalime, liaison group for the European mechanical, electrical, electronic and metalworking industries, for an EC industrial policy covering the entire mechanical engineering sector. The industry believes such a policy could be vital in helping it counter foreign competition more effectively. According to Cecimo, the machine tool industry is facing heavy competition mainly from Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan because of its strategic position at the core of all key manufacturing industries. 'Without a firm industrial and trade policy, there is a risk that, in the future, Japan could decide what type and how European cars should be built.' Among its proposals are: raising ceilings on company size in last year's EC guidelines on state aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), so more machine tool builders can benefit; introducing measures to stimulate investment by SMEs in medium and high-technology capital goods; early adoption of the European company statute, to create the legal environment for establishing companies of an optimum size; clarification of overlapping EC directives affecting the machine tool sector. Mr Schaub said he hoped a decision would be made by the end of this year on whether to prepare a formal communication on industrial policy for mechanical engineering. Any communication, however, would be based on the EC's 'horizontal' rather than sectoral approach to industrial policy. Failing that, the talks would at least clarify what help the sector could reasonably expect from the EC. Cecimo was already concerned about the effects of the recession in early 1992 when it presented an initial document listing the industry's problems to Mr Schaub. Since then, conditions have worsened. Employment in the Cecimo countries, which include Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, fell 12 per cent last year to 166,000, excluding eastern Germany. Its latest document says there are some 1,500 European machine tool producers employing an average 125 people each.</p>

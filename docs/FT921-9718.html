			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Europe risks high air fares and poor choice, CAA warns AIR FARES in Europe could rise and consumer choice diminish unless there is a coherent policy on airline mergers and acquisitions, Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, warned yesterday. In his first important policy statement since becoming CAA chairman eight months ago, Mr Chataway said that without a vigorous European policy on mergers and competition there was 'every prospect that fares will rise and consumer choice will shrink as the little competition that exists today is further diminished'. His warning coincides with an acceleration of the restructuring of the European airline industry. British Airways is in advanced negotiations about linking with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, while this year Air France expects to complete a strategic partnership with Sabena of Belgium which will include the French carrier taking a significant stake in Sabena. While Mr Chataway does not want to prevent large European airlines from expanding their businesses to compete against large US and Asian airlines, he also wants a safeguard for smaller carriers and new entrants into the market which can stimulate competition and lower fares. He added that it was important for European air transport and consumers that a merger policy was formulated before the process of airline consolidation led Europe's airline to be confined to a few so-called megacarriers. Conditions should be attached to mergers between two national flag carriers to safeguard the position and prospects of smaller airlines, he continued. These would include the surrender to another carrier of landing times or of main routes where there would be otherwise little or no competition. Carriers would also be required to dispose of shareholdings in smaller airlines which are actual or potential competitors. Mr Chataway is also worried about the competence of existing European Community institutions to introduce a strong airline policy. 'The relevant institutions of the Community seem ill-equipped for the task,' he said. The EC's competition directorate would require considerable strengthening, he continued, suggesting that an independent agency should be set up to take decisions purely on competition grounds. The EC Commission would have the power to overrule the new agency but would have to explain its reasons. The agency could be the equivalent of a European version of Britain's Mergers and Monopolies Commission or Germany's Cartel Office.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BZW seeks Pounds 20m for endowment fund BZW is launching a Jersey-based closed-end investment company which is to be listed on the London stock exchange. The BZW Endowment Fund will invest in the second-hand with-profits endowment policies which are issued by insurance companies. The fund is raising up to Pounds 20m to invest in the policies, which it will buy from market-makers Beale Dobie and Policy Portfolio. The shares are being offered at 100p, with 50p payable in October and the remaining 50p in April 1994. No dividends will be paid. The costs of the issue are expected to be about 5.5 per cent and the annual management fee will be 0.5 per cent. As a Jersey-based company, it will be able to distribute its assets as capital profits during the final five years of its life between 2001 and 2005. This option is not open to an onshore investment trust. Private investors may find the five year pay-off efficient for financial planning and for capital gains tax purposes. With-profits endowment policies have terms ranging from 10 to 25 years. Policyholders face surrender penalties if they want to cash in their policies before maturity. Instead, many sell the policies in the second hand market, where investors are willing to pay more than the offered surrender values. Bonuses on endowment policies are being cut, as insurance companies adjust to the lower investment returns available in the 1990s. However, even allowing for a 10 per cent bonus cut over the next year and no growth in bonuses after that, BZW estimates that the fund can grow at 10.1 per cent per year.</p>

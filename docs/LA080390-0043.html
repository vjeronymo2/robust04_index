			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM  </P> <P> Art Seidenbaum kick-started my writing career in Los Angeles eight years ago by  assigning me book reviews (which he referred to as "chores"). At first I  demurred, uncertain of being up to the task.  </P> <P> But he bolstered my confidence, guiding me with his editing acumen, and on many  occasions rescuing my writing from sure consignment to the dustbin with his  suggestions.  </P> <P> And he made an indelible impression. Whenever I self edit, I continually ask,  "Would this pass muster with Art Seidenbaum?" The Irish have a phrase, "Ni bas  acht a fas," which translated from the Gaelic means not dead but continuing to  remain alive and, in fact, to grow in memory with time's passing. Every time I  write something, Art Seidenbaum remains very much alive for me.  </P> <P> TOM STAPLETON  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

Lapondic: "Danger of Dividing Bosnia and </F> Herzegovina"]    [Text] At a news conference last Friday, Ivan Kegljevic,  president of the Croatian Christian Democratic Party, said that  "the Granic-Silajdzic agreement that was signed in Washington  should be supported only as explained by Dr. Mate Granic,  Croatian foreign minister and vice president. He speaks of a  federation whose creation would include the Serbs. By contrast,  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in his address to the nation,  excluded Serbian participation in the federation. That  represents the danger of creation of a Serbian republic within  Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is not at all acceptable."    "Such an approach by the Croatian president," Kegljevic  continued, "opens the possibility of the division of Bosnia and  Herzegovina and thus threatens peace. As long as the agreement  proposes borders with Serbia, which is obvious in Tudjman's  statement, it does not propose a federation, because the borders  themselves exclude the possibility a federation. The result of  cramming the 60 percent of the population that is Croatian or  Muslim into only 30 percent of the territory would be continued  war."    The Croatian Christian Democratic Party rejects the part of  the agreement that deals with the confederation of Croatia and  Bosnia and Herzegovina because the party leader believes that it  violates the Constitution of Croatia.</p>

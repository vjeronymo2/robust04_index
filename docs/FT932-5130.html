			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / PW faces further BCCI probe PRICE WATERHOUSE faces investigation on three further substantive grounds by the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary body for its role as auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The firm is being examined by the Joint Disciplinary Scheme to determine whether its audits should have detected the fraud at BCCI earlier; and whether the form of its audit report for the 1990 accounts was adequate in view of the issues that came to light during that year. It is also being investigated to consider whether helping the BCCI management with the restructuring of operations and advising the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, adversely affected or was compatible with its role as auditor to the bank. An inquiry into the 'conduct and competence of members and member firms' in relation to the collapse of BCCI was announced in April last year by the scheme, operated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, its sister institute in Scotland, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Fuller details of the investigation have emerged as a result of documents lodged in the High Court when Price Waterhouse requested a judicial review to stall the progress of the scheme. Price Waterhouse argued any proceedings from the inquiry would be subject to legal discovery and could prejudice the outcome of writs against the firm by liquidators to BCCI for more than Dollars 8bn. It requested a delay until after this action was completed, which was resisted by the scheme, which wants to proceed as quickly as possible. But Mr Justice Tuckey has granted Price Waterhouse leave for judicial review next month.</p>

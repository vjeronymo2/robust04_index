			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND DIGEST: MID-CITY;  </P> <P> KOSHER SHOP CLOSES AGAIN  </P> <P> Emes Kosher Meat Market, a once-popular establishment that lost its kosher  certificate and closed its doors in May, then reopened under the supervision of  a controversial rabbi, has gone out of business again.  </P> <P> In an advertisement in a Jewish weekly, owner Semyon Rachshtut wrote: "To all  our friends and customers: We are sorry to inform you that Emes Kosher Meat  Market is closing down due to the suppression received from the Rabbinical  Council of California."  </P> <P> Open for three weeks under the supervision of an independent rabbi, I. Harold  Sharfman, Emes was crippled by an informal boycott by Orthodox Jews, whose  rabbis advised them against patronizing the establishment on South La Cienega  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "The RCC cannot recommend Emes Meats, even with other supervision," the  Rabbinical Council declared in an advertisement of its own, saying that its  endorsement was "permanently removed."  </P> <P> Sharfman then withdrew his independent certification, saying it had been issued  only pending reconsideration by the RCC.  </P> <P> An inspector for the Rabbinical Council is alleged to have found evidence that  non-kosher meat was sold at the store.  </P></p>

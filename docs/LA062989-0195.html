			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> WRIGHT ENDS 34-YEAR HOUSE CAREER, LEAVES CAPITOL HILL FOR FT. WORTH  </P> <P> Former House Speaker Jim Wright left Capitol Hill for the last time as a  congressman today, his 34-year career brought to an end by charges that he  violated House ethics rules.  </P> <P> Wright (D-Tex.) stepped down as Speaker June 6 and resigned from the House  effective at the end of Friday, but he left the Capitol this noon while the  House was debating a foreign aid bill. He and his wife, Betty, flew by private  jet to Ft. Worth, where his supporters prepared a welcome home party and  parade.  </P> <P> Smiling and relaxed, Wright, 66, waved to the tourists and congressional  staffers who happened to be in the area when he stepped out of the Capitol and  walked to his chauffeured car.  </P> <P> He joked with waiting reporters and photographers, "You ought to treat guys  this well when they come to Washington. . . . They might want to stay."  </P></p>

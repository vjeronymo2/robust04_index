			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Company doctor joins Spring Ram SPRING Ram, the UK kitchens and bathrooms group whose share price has halved since an unexpected drop in its profits, yesterday announced the resignation of its finance director and the appointment of a company doctor as its first non-executive director. The departure of Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director for the past two years, was expected. The appointment of Mr Roy Barber, who has a reputation for dealing with troubled companies, surprised the City. Mr Greenwood joined Spring Ram two years ago as its first finance director. In the past five months, he has had to explain two nasty surprises. False accounting was discovered at Balterley Bathrooms and belatedly disclosed, then 1992's pre-tax profit fell nearly Pounds 13m below expectations at Pounds 26.2m. The company blamed new accounting rules and new demands for a conservative approach to the figures. A profits warning was released only a few days before the results were due. Mr Greenwood's pay was between Pounds 80,000 and Pounds 100,000 a year and he was on a two-year contract. Details of his severance payment have not been disclosed. Spring Ram has also been under institutional pressure to appoint non-executive directors as a check on its chairman Mr Bill Rooney, who also effectively acts as chief executive. The appointment of Mr Barber received a mixed reception. One analyst said he was not regarded as a 'mainstream' non-executive director. His early background was as a finance director, for instance at the construction group Amec. He has since been put into a number of troubled companies by institutions. The roll includes Astra Holdings, the defence company which went into receivership, and Thomas Robinson, the engineering concern acquired by BM Group. The Prudential, which holds 12 per cent of Spring Ram, knows him from those two. He has a reputation for toughness and for standing no nonsense. He left Magnet, the kitchen group which was one of the first big management buy-outs to run into trouble, in late 1989 after a brief stint because he did not like what he saw.</p>

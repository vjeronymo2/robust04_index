			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Sterling reverse FRNs prove popular with institutional investors THERE was a rush of sterling reverse floating-rate notes totalling Pounds 300m yesterday as issuers tapped the current demand for instruments which will allow investors to benefit from falling UK interest rates. Syndicate managers said they were the first sterling reverse FRNs to be underwritten in the public domain. The paper proved popular with institutional investors who believe that sterling interest rates are set to fall further this year. All three issues are believed to have been swapped, leaving the issuers with a normal floating-rate liability. Goldman Sachs kicked off with a three-year Pounds 100m issue for Abbey National, the UK bank, which was snapped up quickly. It was followed by the Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, which raised a similar amount via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. In the early afternoon, Goldman arranged a further deal for Eksportfinans, the Norwegian import-export agency. The basic terms on the three deals were virtually identical. Each was priced at par, with the first coupon fixed at 7 per cent for the first six months. Thereafter, the semi-annual coupon will be fixed at 12.375 per cent minus six-month Libor. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director, corporate finance and capital markets at Abbey National, said that yesterday's issue followed the bank's strategy of having a mix of medium-term notes and that the structure lent itself well to this maturity. Syndicate managers said there was a limit to how much more paper could be issued in the near term because the swaps transactions linked to yesterday's deals had resulted in less favourable conditions in the swaps market. However, they did not rule out further issues, or variations on yesterday's structure, in view of the healthy demand from investors. The current climate prompted Bayerische Vereinsbank to re-open its Dollars 100m collared 10-year FRN, issued early in January, and raise a further Dollars 75m. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued DM500m with a 6.625 per cent coupon and priced at 101.10. The five-year issue was described as tightly priced and was trading at 99.43/48 late in the day to yield 6.75 per cent, just outside the fees. The stream of Canadian dollar deals continued yesterday. The CDollars 125m, 10-year offer from the city of Montreal and CDollars 300m three-year paper from Export Development Corp were both said to be aggressively priced with respect to comparable Canadian government bonds, and distribution was reportedly slow. Syndicate managers said much of the recent Canadian dollar paper remained unplaced and that spreads had widened as a result. For example, the spread on Credit Foncier de France's CDollars 200m deal launched last Friday was now at 53 basis points, compared with an initial 45. See Lex</p>

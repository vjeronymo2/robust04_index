			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, Feb. 17, IRNA -- Kuwaiti Minister of  Information Shaykh Sa'ud al-Sabah says that Iran is a key ally  for peace in the Persian Gulf, but he did not think there can be  real security in the region while the Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn remains in power.    Speaking at a London press conference Thursday, he said that  Kuwait had "good relations" with Iran and that his government  was working as much as it can as a "partner" with Tehran. The  Islamic Republic was a "major power" and had an important role  to play in security of the Persian Gulf, the Kuwaiti minister  told foreign journalists.    Iran and Kuwait were fellow victims of Iraqi aggression and  the former ambassador to London and Washington said that his  government had "respect" for Iran's policy of neutrality during  the 1991 allied war to end Iraqi's occupation of Kuwait.    Still feeling bitterness, he believed that the Persian Gulf  region would not be able to enjoy security while Saddam was in  power. His equal conviction was that UN sanctions against  Baghdad would not be lifted, either partially or fully, until he  was replaced.    The minister emphasised that he had sympathy with the Iraqi  people suffering the effects of more than three years of  sanctions, who he said were also victims of the Iraqi regime  since Saddam's 1980-88 war against Iran.    With regard to the declining price of oil, he suggested that  producing nations should seriously reassess the value of oil in  the world and that OPEC and non-OPEC countries needed to  cooperate together. Kuwait was not liberated for crude rates of  10 dlrs. [dollars] per barrel, which were "not helpful" to  anyone.</p>

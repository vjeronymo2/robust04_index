			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Active service - Crime THE WRITER of crime novels has a limited choice of protagonist: it can be the investigator (uniformed or amateur) or the murderer or, more rarely, the victim. If the investigator is chosen, he cannot be allowed to have too much personal life, otherwise wife, kids, the unrepaired dish-washer and the Sunday dinner interfere irritatingly with the crime's solution. For her first suspense novel, Kindness Can Kill (Constable, 190pp. Pounds 13.99), Jane Bolitho steers an ingenious but steady course concentrating on the victim but also allowing her DCI Ian Roper a considerable, engaging but apposite life of his own. The crime - an attractive, independent woman is brutally and inexplicably murdered - takes place in a rich context and touches many lives, described with perceptive economy and wry humour. The small-town setting is traditional (there is even a vicarage), but the author gives it fresh vitality. David Armstrong's first novel, Night's Black Agents (Collins, 184pp, Pounds 13.99) presents another new and arresting talent. Here the actual murderer, a misanthropic canal boatman, and his homicidally crazed employer, a cuckolded landlord, are the focus of attention, along with the unusual setting: the canals of the Midlands and the North-West during the 1930s. The debutant novelist reveals a genuine gift for atmosphere and for keen characterisation; (the errant wife and lonely child are tellingly drawn); the denouement, however, is a let-down, dependant on a man's somewhat unconvincing weakness rather than on the logic of events and the investigation. Still, this book is impressive and eminently readable. A Detective Constable on active service, Keith Wright has found time to produce three novels. The latest is Addressed to Kill (Constable 192 pp, Pounds 13.99), starring DI David Stark (with the usual vaguely dissatisfied wife and children neglected in the line of duty). In the course of the book, a rapist killer runs loose, but is finally apprehended in a good chase. Wright's forte is police-station atmosphere, chaff, routine, personality clashes, sententiousness. Nothing startlingly original here, but a highly competent performance.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> U.S. HINTED TO DUMP WORLD CUP  </P> <P> A West German newspaper said today the United States will back out of its  commitment to hold the 1994 World Cup soccer tournament, but an official of the  U.S. organizing committee and a spokesman for a major sponsor deny the charge.  </P> <P> "The United States this year will give up the 1994 World Championships," wrote  Bild columnist Paul Breitner, a former West German soccer player.  </P> <P> He said that two of the major American sponsors are backing out because there  is not enough interest in soccer in the United States.  </P> <P> But Ross Berlin, vice president for venues for the 1994 World Cup Organizing  Committee, told the Associated Press that the report "is ridiculous, and not  worthy of comment."  </P> <P> And Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, told the AP, "It is  absolutely untrue that Coca-Cola is trying to pull out of its support for World  Cup '94."  </P> <P> Breitner said low television ratings during the just-finished World Cup  convinced American sponsors that the tournament will not be a success in the  United States.  </P></p>

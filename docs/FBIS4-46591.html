For dozens of years, since the very origin of  nuclear missile weapons, the world constantly has been in the  sights of the nuclear button, so to speak. The missiles of  countries possessing these weapons were aimed not only at each  other, but also, it must be assumed, at important strategic and  industrial targets, lines of communication... in short, at you  and me.    Then, in accordance with understandings recorded in the  Moscow Declaration of Presidents of the Russian Federation and  United States of 14 January 1994 and in the Joint Declaration of  the President of the Russian Federation and Prime Minister of  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 15  February 1994, the heads of the three countries made the  decision to issue necessary instructions about nontargeting of  strategic nuclear missiles under their respective command.    Implementation of this understanding by the Russian  Federation signifies that day to day control of nuclear forces  now is exercised based on the fact that the United States and  Great Britain are not enemies of the Russian Federation and not  one of our more than one thousand missiles in silos, on  submarines and on mobile missile systems is aimed any longer  against any targets on the territory of the United States and  Great Britain.    It is hardly necessary to mention how much this step  strengthens mutual and international security and follows the  channel of fundamentally new relations of strategic partnership  among our countries and of their practical cooperation in the  military-political sphere. The Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs Statement which was disseminated states that  this important step will open the path to further steps on a  bilateral and multilateral basis in the interests of  strengthening trust, stability and predictability in strategic  nuclear arms. The document expresses the hope that the other  nuclear powers also will take this path.    But what does implementation of a regime of nontargeting of  missiles signify in practice? And is it necessary to be on  constant alert status in that case? Will not the combat  readiness of missile units suffer from this? These simple  questions cannot help but occur to people who are not too  familiar with the specifics of strategic nuclear forces.  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA repeatedly has touched on these subjects, but  today of course there is a need to return to this once more and  cite the opinion of people who are informed, as they say...    Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov, chief of the Main  Staff  of Strategic Missile Troops, says the following concerning the  regime of zeroizing the missiles' missions:    "The problem of zeroizing depends on the missile systems'  design features and will be resolved by us and by the American  side for each type of missile in our own way. But common to all  is an unequivocal reduction of the threshold of a surprise  strike, since each side will have to perform a number of  operational and technical operations to reestablish combat  plans. This will take time, which politicians can use  additionally for peaceful resolution of problems, should they  arise."    One can add to what was said by the chief of the Main Staff  that inasmuch as battle management systems of U.S. ICBM's and  our ICBM's differ somewhat, their missiles will be targeted  against uninhabited areas of the earth, while ours will have no  specific targets.    With respect to combat readiness, specialists believe that  zeroizing the missiles will not lower the combat potential of  missile units. Special measures have been worked out and  implemented to support the day to day activity and life of  troops with nontargeted missiles.    Hundreds of specialists worked to ensure that the  retargeting  of missiles, which lowers nuclear danger in the world, was  carried out within the time period set by the understandings--no  later than 30 May 1994. Nevertheless, this act of good will and  mutual trust does not relieve strategic nuclear forces of the  responsibility of providing protection for the homeland and  preserving stability on the planet. Therefore today, as always  over the last 35 years, more than 20,000 missilemen are at duty  stations around the clock.</p>

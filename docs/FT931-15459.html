			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Beijing serves up red-hot chips  -Citic's HKDollars 11.6bn asset shuffle to Hong Kong WHETHER or not you believe some brokers' talk about Citic Pacific being the 'hong of the future', there is no getting around the fact that the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Beijing's most important investment vehicle is the reddest of 'red chip' stocks listed in Hong Kong. Last Thursday, Citic Hong Kong injected a 12 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom, together with a controlling interest in two mainland power stations and a 20 per cent share of a Hong Kong chemical waste management plant into its 45 per cent-owned Citic Pacific. The HKDollars 11.6bn (USDollars 1.5bn) deal - financed by a HKDollars 7.1bn placement and HKDollars 3.7bn in loan facilities - should see Citic Pacific's ranking in the colony's top 100 companies rise from 22nd place to around 10th. The deal has met with general approval. The sale of the stake in Hongkong Telecom was done at HKDollars 7.8 a share - a near 20 per cent discount to Hongkong Telecom's prevailing share price of HKDollars 9.70 at the time. This has ensured that the acquisition for Citic Pacific will be broadly neutral in terms of its earnings per share and makes good a promise by Citic Hong Kong that any sale it makes to its listed subsidiary will not put minority shareholders at a disadvantage. But last week's transaction has raised some questions in the Hong Kong market as to the deal's timing and the impact the acquisitions will have on Citic Pacific's desire to be seen as a manager and operator of businesses rather than just a passive investor in blue chip stocks. Along with Hongkong Telecom, it also owns 12 per cent of Cathay Pacific, nearly half of Dragon Air, and 20 per cent of Macao's telecommunications monopoly. Citic Pacific is an unusual company by most western standards. It is the listed subsidiary of China International Trust and Investment Corporation - the first green shoot of China's economic revolution initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and arguably the most important western-style company in China today. Citic's chairman, Mr Rong Yiren, is also the father of Mr Larry Yung, the head of Citic's operations in Hong Kong. The Beijing parent's main aim is to assist in the modernisation of the Chinese economy through investment primarily internationally which will lead to the transfer of technology and management know-how to China. Citic Hong Kong, and its listed vehicle, Citic Pacific, has a different role. As Mr Yung explains: 'Citic Hong Kong is different from Citic Beijing. The main difference is independence. I can invest in China: I have the power, the money and the people.' Mr Yung has deployed these enviable resources with the aim of building up Citic Hong Kong and Pacific into a conglomerate that is arguably the most exposed of any leading company in Hong Kong to the Chinese market. He believes that, in some quarters, last week's transaction was misunderstood. As to timing, he maintains the moment was propitious because of the relative performance of both Hongkong Telecom and Citic Pacific in the wake of the stock market's reaction to the row between the UK and China over democracy in Hong Kong. He also scoffs at any suggestion that his superior connections in Beijing gave him any foreknowledge of destabilising rows to some. 'If the future held no hope, why do a new issue? Citic Hong Kong has increased its stake in Citic Pacific and I also personally subscribed to 30m shares,' he says. More seriously, he suggests that the question of the company's focus is largely based on ignorance. Firstly, Citic Pacific is not a passive investor. Its purchase of Cathay Pacific led, he claims, to the creation of Dragon Air - a Citic/Cathay joint venture which services mainland air routes out of Hong Kong and some regional destinations. Mr Yung agrees that Hongkong Telecom is likely to account for around 40 per cent of Citic's market capitalisation and around 30 per cent of profits in a full year. But the relationship with Cathay shows that new businesses can be created. If China were to relax its rules on foreign participation in its domestic telecommunications market then Citic/Hongkong Telecom would be well placed to exploit it, he said. In Hong Kong, the company most associated with privately-owned power generation in China is Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings. Citic Hong Kong's transfer of its interest in two power stations in China - one in Henan province the other in Jiangsu province - may lead to a re-evaluation of that view. Mr Yung - who from 1964 until 1978 worked as an engineer with the Ministry of Water and Power - believes that Citic's capabilities in power generation are unparalleled in China. It has 46 executives - six in Hong Kong and 40 in its Beijing office - working on power plants in China. 'As (China's) minister of water and power told me, it is a star team. Our engineers, construction people and plant managers are the best in China. Many are previous class mates of mine and my former bosses.' Citic Pacific acquired the interests in the two power stations at cost. It will pay HKDollars 530m for 56 per cent of the Jiangsu Ligang power station  -located in Wuxi, Mr Yung's ancestral home town - and HKDollars 360m for 50 per cent of the Xinli power station in Henan province. Both are expected to come on stream this year. Ownership of these facilities lasts for 15 years, at which time they are transferred to the state. But Citic Pacific has the right to participate in future expansion plans which envisage the doubling in size of both facilities and would give it a further 15-year interest. Citic Hong Kong is currently negotiating with the Shanghai authorities to build in Pudong four 300MW coal-fired units as the first stage of a 3,200MW facility. Mr Yung is also keen to point out that through Da Chong Hong, a trading company it acquired a year ago, he has expanded car sales to China and is expanding its retail activities as well. With this sort of involvement in China, Mr Yung can be forgiven for feeling aggrieved by the accusation that Citic is just a corporate rentier.  ----------------------------------------- CITIC HOLDINGS IN HONG KONG  ----------------------------------------- Citic Beijing           100% Citic Hong Kong            45% Citic Pacific  ----------------------------------------- Telecommunications  ----------------------------------------- Hongkong Telecom         12% Macao Telecom         20%  ----------------------------------------- Aviation  ----------------------------------------- Cathay Pacific         12% Dragon Air       46.2%  ----------------------------------------- Energy  ----------------------------------------- Jiansu Power Station         56% Henan Power Station         50%  ----------------------------------------- Trading  ----------------------------------------- Car dealerships Retail Import/Export  ----------------------------------------- Property  ----------------------------------------- Hong Kong Portfolio     valued at   HKDollars 5bn  -----------------------------------------</p>

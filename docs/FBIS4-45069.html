			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yusuf al-Khu'i, prominent Iraqi Shiite at the </F> Imam al-Khu'i Establishment in London: "The Persecution of the  Shiites Amid an Outcry and Foreign Silence"]    [Text] There are some basic assumptions concerning the  Shiites of Iraq which are wrong and are based on utterances and  analyses made by politicians and scholars, and which should be  corrected from the outset:    1) Shiites constitute the majority of the people of Iraq,  but  they are treated by the authorities as a deprived minority.    2) The Shiites of Iraq are Arabs, and Iraq is the historical  homeland of the Shiite movement. There are also [non-Arab]  Shiite minorities in Iraq such as the al-Kurd al-Filiyah [as  published] and the Turkoman Shiites.    3) The persecution of the Shiites of Iraq is being carried  out not be Sunnis, whether Arabs or Kurds, but rather by a small  tribal minority that is exercising absolute control over the  nation.    The reason for the organized persecution is to be found in  some basic contradictions. We find the majority of the people  totally excluded from participating in the formulation of the  nation's policy and the major administration of this policy. The  nation's authority is a sectarian, tribal authority, the  identity of the ruling party is secular, the state religion is  Islam, the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs is in the  hands of those whose doctrine is Sunni Hanafi, and most of the  country's people are Shiite Muslims.    The Shiite Muslims are being subjected to a process of  impoverishment and exclusion from government institutions, and  they are being subjected to campaigns that have the aim of  tearing them apart as individuals, families, and as a community,  whether they are in cities or in the marshes. This sectarian  persecution is not limited to those who are religiously  committed people or to religious establishments. It includes the  Shiite masses of people in general, even those who have served  in some of the government agencies, the army, the party, and the  labor unions on the lower levels.    The Shiites have suffered more from the dictatorship,  because  their numbers are greater, and because the ruling regime has  made persecution of the Shiites a daily and all-encompassing  practice. Deprivation of the Shiites has become a reality on  which the instruments of higher authority [of the state] are  based.    It is difficult to bring up the topic of persecution of the  Shiites in Iraq because of its extreme sensitivity and because  of the hateful feuds of sectarianism that might be aroused.    The person who benefits the most from not having this topic  brought up and discussed is the dictator himself, and the only  ones adversely affected are the people who are persecuted. We  feel that the first step toward dealing with a problem is to  acknowledge its existence, then assign a name to the problem,  then define it in order that ways of dealing with it can be  determined, and then begin solving it.    Work should be done patiently and quietly with the parties  concerned. The issue should be discussed and set forth in  detail, and a dialogue should be opened in order to bring up the  political, social, and religious problems that afflict the  Shiites of Iraq. Then action should be taken to eliminate the  historical and political injustice that has afflicted them. This  action should be taken within the framework of a single nation  and an advanced and civilized society which would permit freedom  of expression and freedom of religion and guarantee civil and  political rights to everyone.    Frank discussion about the crisis of the Shiites in Iraq and  open admission of one's Shiite affiliation does not mean that  the identity of others will be assaulted or that discord will be  stirred up. Any individual has the right to define himself in  terms of his national origin, tribe, religious beliefs, or  homeland. This does not constitute an assault upon, or  provocation aimed at, others. Bringing up the problem of the  Shiite crisis, assigning it a name, and demanding that the  people of the nation solve it, does not mean that dealing with  the crisis involves the creation of another type of political  sect. The solution is not to be found in mounting a  counterattack, nor do we call for a sectarian constitution. What  we are calling for is to safeguard the freedom of individuals  and the institutions of society within the framework of a single  nation and to safeguard the civil, political, and religious  rights of all sects.    We feel called upon to do justice to the truth, because we  know that the Shiites are not a group of people with a new and  heretical doctrine that has just come upon the scene. Their  doctrine is one of the oldest in Islam and one of the most  all-embracing schools of thought in terms of clarification of  the faith, and they constitute the great majority of the people  of Iraq.    In public life, they have been like other people in that  some  of them are open-minded and others are fanatical, some of them  are guilty of excesses whereas others believe in brotherhood  [with others], and some of them are tolerant whereas others are  zealots. But, in general, Shiites act as people who are  oppressed and ruled, and thus they are inclined to call for the  holding of a dialogue, casting fanaticism aside, and submitting  to the logic of reason, equality, justice, love, and peace.    In spite of the fact that the Shiites constitute a very old  and authentic sect in Arab and Islamic history, they have  remained far from the limelight of the world throughout this  century. Also, there has been [in terms of information] a  blackout against them in the countries where they live and among  their compatriots, such that people have only very limited and  faulty knowledge about them.    During the last few years, the word "Shiite" in most  countries has become synonymous with extremism, violence,  terrorism, etc. Furthermore, another view, which is mistaken and  which is no less important than the one mentioned above, has  become predominant, and it is a view from which the Shiites  still suffer. It is the fact that Shiites' patriotism is  questioned and they are accused of being loyal to Iran, and the  Shiite masses are looked upon as extremists and terroristic  minorities who threaten the security and stability of the Middle  East.    It is for this reason that Saddam Husayn has utilized these  mistaken views and unfounded fears concerning the Shiites to his  own benefit, he has acted with great skill to feed these views  and to attempt to prove that they are true, and he has committed  crimes against humanity and accused the Shiites of having  committed these crimes.    The result of all of this has been that a thick curtain has  obscured the importance of the Shiites' positive presence,  unjustified questions have been raised, and sanction has been  given to attempts to create a distorted image of the people who  belong to this branch of Islam. At the very least, they are  approached with wariness and caution, and at the worst they are  treated very negatively and are the victims of suppression and  torture. The most prominent example of this extreme negative  approach was the crushing of the rebellion of the people of Iraq  in February of 1991. For them this was a human and historic  catastrophe in which the religious centers, mosques, Shiite  gathering places, holy shrines, institutions of learning,  clergymen, and the Shiite masses were subjected to destruction  and genocide and their vital centers were crushed, and the world  has hardly seen anything like it during modern history. The  world looked on with silence while this great tragedy was  happening to our Shiite Muslim Arab brethren on all levels.  Anyone who reads the history of modern Iraq will find that the  Shiites of Iraq and their clergymen played a major role in the  struggle against foreign occupation and imperialism and  participated in the liberation of Iraq. And the fatwas  [religious orders] issued by Shiite clergymen dealing with the  holy war against foreign occupation in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon,  Libya, and Arab North Africa greatly influenced the feelings of  the Shiite people. Historically it is a fact that the Shiite  clergymen played a pioneering role in the process of human and  cultural development in the Arab world. Anyone can attest to the  fact that the Shiite clergymen and imams wrote all sorts of  works in the fields of science and literature and works in the  field of religion that dealt with Islamic jurisprudence,  principles of the faith, interpretation of the Koran, and  [Islamic] philosophy.    And now we are bidding farwell to the 20th century in which  we saw the occurrence of the world revolution in communications  between nations that has led to constant human activity and  caused the nations of the world to become opened up to each  other. We also saw the establishment of the UN, which brought up  the issue of human rights and freedoms, and dozens of public  organizations and bodies were established to defend the rights  of the oppressed. Also, public conferences and councils have  been held in order to help curtail the injustice that has been  the lot of those who generally have been people who have been  deprived, by virtue of their tragic situation, of even the most  basic opportunities--available in some nations--to have their  complaints and cries against injustice be heard.    In spite of all this, the Shiites of Iraq still are  suffering  the greatest hardships, in addition to what they used to suffer  because of the gulf between them and the ruling regimes. It is  very unfortunate that this feeling has not been restricted to  political establishments and governments. It has also been found  in many civil and religious circles and even in some  establishments that are characterized by open-mindedness such as  universities and other organizations that usually sympathize  with oppressed peoples. There is no doubt that the atmosphere  that accompanied the birth of the Islamic Republic in Iran  played a major role in causing these negative and tense  attitudes to become worse than they were previously. With no  justification at all, the Shiites of Iraq have had to bear the  brunt of this. They have even been hit with the accusation, in  general and in particular, that they constitute a danger, that  they are terrorists, and the like. The oppressed [Shiite] nation  has paid, and still pays, the price of this.    The Shiites of Iraq today are being subjected to  persecution,  expulsion, suffering, slow death, mass killings, and deprivation  of the most elementary human rights and the right of citizenship  because the world still is indifferent to their suffering, due  to sectarian, political, and geographical considerations.    In spite of informational blackout attempts, the world has  clearly witnessed the use of incendiary bombs and lethal weapons  by the Iraqi regime [against the Shiites]. They have been used  to commit genocide against peaceful communities of inhabitants  of a particular ethnic or religious origin, and human  communities have been destroyed by artillery shelling and  draining the waters of the marshes in southern Iraq. The world  has also seen tanks crush and destroy academic and cultural  establishments and public libraries, it has seen holy shrines,  places of worship, cemeteries, and Shiite gathering places  desecrated, and it has seen the killing and arrest of clergymen,  tribal chieftains, and ordinary people in vicious and  all-encompassing attacks against the Shiites and the cultural  heritage and legacy of the members of the Shiite community. In  addition to all these crimes, there has been followed, on the  pretext of the economic boycott, a policy of plunging most of  the Shiites into a condition of starvation because of the sect  to which they belong, while a very small minority of them live  in comfort, oppressing the others. Iraq's prisons are still full  of thousands of innocent people, including more than 100 Shiite  clergymen from the Imam al-Khu'i School in al- Najaf, which is  one of the most venerable of Islamic schools in terms of its  heritage and contributions to civilization, and is on a par with  the university of al-Azhar. Saddam Husayn's regime proceeded to  destroy this thousand-year-old school, burn its public  libraries, and imprison those from the institution.    It is clear that what is happening to the Shiites of Iraq  today constitutes a clear violation of the paragraphs of the  International Declaration on Human Rights and the rights of  minorities that appear in the documents of the UN. We hope that  this exceptional situation will be studied and dealt with, and  that the necessary proposals will be put forth in order to  prevent the repetition and continuation of this tragic situation  in Iraq and other countries.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Gorillas win the Christmas toy battle US toymakers are this year showing renewed determination to test the tolerance of the more politically aware. Girls can expect to unwrap not only the usual Barbie dolls, furry animals and miniature teasets. They may even dip into their Christmas stockings to find a product called Mommy's Having A Baby - a doll which gives birth to a 4 1/2 inch offspring through a Velcro opening in a maternity dress. 'Rub Mommy's soft tummy and you can actually feel the baby,' says the toy shop catalogue. 'See baby move . . . even decide when Mommy's ready to have baby. With birth certificate, diaper, bottle and more.' The manufacturer, Tyco Toys, says the Mommy doll addresses children's natural curiosity about childbirth and pregnancy in a sensitive way. But some women have pointed out that is not only politically, but anatomically, incorrect; a female doctor in Massachusetts has said the doll might lead children to believe all babies are born by Velcro caesarean. Other ideologically suspect products this year include Electronic Dream Phone, a game in which girls dial different numbers to find out which boys have a crush on them. 'One of 24 incredible guys really likes you. Now you just have to find out who by calling his friends for clues,' says the blurb. Girls can progress to another game, Perfect Wedding, in which they plan for the big event: 'The first to complete her plans and walk down the aisle wins.' For boys, the stereotyping seems to consist mainly of satisfying their perceived appetite for violent confrontation with powerful assault weapons, like this year's top-selling Nerf Arrowstorm - blasts six soft arrows over 30ft - or the Motorized Thunderstrike - the ultimate battery-operated air blaster. Video games are also growing more ghastly. In one, called Night Trap, players try to prevent a gang of hooded zombies from capturing a group of scantily clad sorority sisters: if they fail, the killers use a syringe to suck the women's blood from their necks. It has proved so offensive many retailers have removed it from their shelves. On a brighter note, not all the toys on sale are violent or obviously sexist. Mr Ian McDermott, senior buyer at FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy store, says the best-selling toy is a Dollars 6 (Pounds 4) stuffed gorilla eating a banana. 'I don't know why, but gorillas always sell well in any shape or form. People find them amusing, especially if they're licking a banana,' he says. And best of all, it is of indeterminate sex.</p>

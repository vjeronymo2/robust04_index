			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cash alternative at TV-am A DIRECTOR of TV-am, the former breakfast television company, promised yesterday that if the company decided to move into the casino business, a cash alternative would be available to shareholders. Mr Richard Redmayne of stockbrokers Smith New Court and one of five remaining TV-am directors, said the company had begun exploring the improved market for 'shell companies'. TV-am was outbid for its franchise by Good Morning Television and ceased broadcasting on January 1. The original intention had been to go for a voluntary liquidation and distribute to shareholders the remaining assets of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m. Mr Redmayne confirmed however, that the five remaining directors were talking to Crockfords, the Mayfair casino company, about the possibility of an acquisition. If the deal goes ahead, there would be a simultaneous rights issue, flotation and acquisition. Mr Redmayne emphasised that in such circumstances there would be a cash alternative for any TV-am shareholders who did not want shares in the new combined group. However, if the Crockfords talks do not lead to a deal, another leisure group is in the wings. The aim of the TV-am directors - as a trading entity the company no longer exists and doesn't even have a telephone - is to explore possibilities of adding to shareholder value while still retaining the liquidation option.</p>

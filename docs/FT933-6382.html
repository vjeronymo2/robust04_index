			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Recovery at National Bank of Canada NATIONAL Bank of Canada reports a strong recovery for the third quarter and nine months following a good performance by its stockbroking offshoot, tight control of costs and lower loan loss provisions. For the three months ended July, net profit was CDollars 47.3m (USDollars 36.90), or 27 cents a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 117.5m, or CDollars 1 a year earlier. Second-quarter net profit was to CDollars 40m or 23 cents. Third-quarter provisions were CDollars 75m, down from CDollars 358m a year earlier when the bank wrote off key bad loans. Return on average assets was 0.48 per cent, against a negative 1.16 per cent. Profit for the nine months totalled CDollars 132.4m or 78 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 37.9m or 52 cents a year earlier. Return on average assets was 0.46 per cent against a negative 0.13 per cent. Total assets at end-July were CDollars 39bn. A CDollars 14m gain on the sale of Brazil bonds was offset by securities trading losses and provisions. Most of the 14 per cent gain in other income came from the brokerage unit. Canada's fifth-biggest charter bank, Toronto-Dominion, said further provisions against investments kept a third-quarter gain in net profit to 1 per cent. Earnings for the three months ended July 31 were CDollars 102m, or 32 cents a share, against CDollars 101m, or 31 cents, a year earlier. Mr Richard Thomson, chairman, noted strong growth in net interest income, good asset growth and better brokerage results. But the bank set aside an additional CDollars 27m, bringing the nine months provision to CDollars 86m, and an estimated CDollars 113m for the full fiscal year. But non performing loans dipped CDollars 274m in the latest quarter to CDollars 1.29bn, the lowest in two years. Fiscal 1993 loan losses are estimated at CDollars 600m. Nine-month net profit before a restructuring charge for acquisition of Central Guaranty Trust loans, deposits and branches, was CDollars 272m, or 83 cents a share, against CDollars 295m, or 90 cents, a year earlier. After the charge, earnings were CDollars 193m, or 57 cents.</p>

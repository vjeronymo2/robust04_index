			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Pollsters hope it's second time lucky: Forecasters confident for tomorrow's Danish referendum SUPPORTERS of a Yes vote in Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty tomorrow are nervous, while opponents continue to hope, despite a clear lead for the Yes side in the opinion polls. The reason is not hard to find. In a poll on May 31 before last year's vote the Gallup Institute showed 55.7 for and 44.3 per cent against (after eliminating the don't knows). The actual result was a No - by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent. The difference between the survey and the actual result was 12.8 percentage points. Curiously, the Gallup poll a week before last year's vote gave a small No majority, as did two of the three polls monitored by the Financial Times. It was Gallup's surveys in the final week that got it wrong. A comparative analysis of surveys in 1992 and this year by the three institutes - Gallup, published in the Berlingske Tidende newspaper, Vilstrup, published in Politiken, and Greens, published in the Boersen business newspaper - suggests that a No this time would be more surprising than it was last year. This year not a single survey since the beginning of February has given a majority for the Noes. Last year nine out of 19 polls between early February and May 26, a week before the referendum, showed a No majority. There are fewer don't knows this year. In polls published by the three institutes last week, Gallup reported 13 per cent undecided, Greens 11 and Vilstrup 8. A week before last year's vote, the figures were 18 14 and 15 per cent. The average gap between Yes and No in the three polls last week was 22 points, with a 61-39 per cent majority for Maastricht (after eliminating the don't knows). Last year, a week before the vote, Gallup and Vilstrup showed a small No majority. Greens showed a Yes by 53.5 to 46.5 per cent. In daily polls by Gallup in the final week up to the June 2 vote last year there was a sudden and misleading (as it turned out) swing towards Yes. There has been no such swing, either way, in 1993. The Noes have gained ground this year from the beginning of February, when they were receiving 25-26 per cent of support, until the first week in May, when their support seems to have stabilised at about 32-34 per cent of the vote, including the don't knows and won't-votes, according to Gallup. The Yes vote lost ground in the same period, but since the beginning of May it has consistently been around 48-50 per cent. But in none of the surveys by the three institutes have the Yes and No curves come anywhere near crossing each other this year. In the survey conducted by Greens last week, however, the percentage gap between Yes and No, after eliminating don't knows, was a relatively meagre 11 points. Voters can still change their minds, of course, but, taking the average of the polls, there will have to be a landslide change of mind if the Noes are to win.</p>

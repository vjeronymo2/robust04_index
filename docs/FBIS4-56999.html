			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F> PAGINA/12 reporter Walter Goobar at the Internacional Hotel in  Panama on 9 May]    [Text] [Goobar] Many people did not want to vote for you  for fear of what the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] stands  for. They contend that "the problem is not the bull, but rather  the herd of cattle that comes behind it."    [Perez Balladares] A party comprised of 157,000 people  cannot  be judged on the basis of the bad reputation of 10 or 15  members. I say that most PRD members are high-minded men and  women. Besides, being a member of my party does not mean that  one is automatically a member of my government. I will try to  govern with the most qualified men and women, regardless of the  party to which they belong.    [Goobar] How was it possible to rebuild the PRD, which had  been virtually annihilated first with Noriega's administration  and then with the U.S. invasion?    [Perez Balladares] They are two entirely different parties.  Today's PRD has nothing to do with the PRD of 1989. The former  is a democratic party, under no one's control. The latter was a  party that had been ravaged by Noriega and the military. The  current PDR is an entirely different phenomenon. It constitutes  a return to our origins, to what we intended to do back in 1979  when we founded it together with [General Omar] Torrijos. We  recovered the democratic and civil institutionalism that had  characterized Torrijos' administration until his death. It was  then that Noriega and the military took over the party and  started to subvert it. I have worked with several fellow party  members who believe in the party's original line, and the people  believe us because they know that our objectives are real.    [Goobar] How did you manage to get from Torrijos to your  administration, skipping Noriega?    [Perez Balladares] Noriega's administration was an  interregnum. I had nothing to do with it.    [Goobar] The pro-Torrijos grassroots voted for populism, and  yet there is not much room for populism at present.    [Perez Balladares] I believe that rather than populism, they  are searching for a system of government that implements ongoing  dialogue and consultation. Populism costs a lot of money, and  as things stand now there is no way we can finance it.    [Goobar] You will have to set into motion an adjustment  process that the administration of Guillermo Endara could not  accomplish. How are you going to implement it?    [Perez Balladares] Do you know why the previous  administration could not effect an adjustment? Because it never  entered into negotiations. They accepted things that were  impossible to implement. We must start negotiating a realistic  adjustment, one that can be implemented. It is impossible to  make an adjustment without taking grain producers into account,  for instance. There must be some degree of protection.  Colombia has just obtained 80 percent protection for many of  its products through GATT. Panama, however, is absolutely  unprotected. It is absurd. Even NAFTA has protected goods,  items that are not part of the free exchange system. What  happened here is that the government was incapable of  negotiating a structural adjustment, an applicable adjustment.  It simply accepted the recipe without establishing the  importance of its basic components.    [Goobar] Panama's main problem is unemployment. Do you  have an economic program ready?    [Perez Balladares] You cannot start talking about the  economy  without first establishing the government's political support  bases. We cannot just swim against the current. We must  implement programs with social content. We must take measures  to immediately lower our unemployment rate.    [Goobar] How do you do that?    [Perez Balladares] By building infrastructure. We have  proposals from U.S. companies to build roads, with minority  participation by the Panamanian Government.    [Goobar] Many people fear that the dismantling of the U.S.  military bases will aggravate the unemployment problem. How  will you coordinate these issues?    [Perez Balladares] In the same way the United States has  done  this where military bases have been closed. We must use the  infrastructure to attract investment and create jobs through the  construction of plants for the production of exportable  products. Many Argentine investors are interested.    [Goobar] How do you explain the fact that Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber, the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias, ended up in  a surprising second place? All pre-electoral surveys and exit  polls placed Ruben Blades in second place.    [Perez Balladares] I think Arias followers' are cautious,  and  do not express their intentions publicly due to their long  history of persecution. Arias' followers vote in secret. They  do not want to express themselves publicly. I can only suppose  that many of them said they were going to vote for Blades or  Carles, and then voted for their own candidate.    [Goobar] Perhaps it was an anti-PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary  Party] vote?    [Perez Balladares] I do not think so. It is very difficult  to give your political strength to someone else.    [Goobar] You obtained 33.1 percent of the vote and the  simple  majority, which makes you president-elect. But 70 percent of  the people did not vote for you. How do you feel about this  fact?    [Perez Balladares] I must take into account that I have not  obtained an absolute majority, but I have obtained more votes  than anyone else. I think I represent the Panamanian people's  desire to have a government of national reconciliation and  unity. I understand the results in this way, and I intend to  proceed accordingly. I have already invited some people from  outside the party to join my government.    [Goobar] Panama and the PRD's relations with the United  States have undergone good, not so good, and bad times.  Washington, however, considers you one of the best candidates...    [Perez Balladares] I am very happy to hear that. I think our  relations with the United States will be very good. Besides, we  will be responsible for implementing the last leg of the  Carter-Torrijos Treaty. Panama and the United States have many  interests in common. Very few things can put us against one  another. I am sure we will work cordially and closely united to  implement our treaties.    [Goobar] According to the treaties, a condition for the  definitive transfer of the canal to Panamanian hands is that the  country must be able to guarantee the canal' security. How will  a country that was left without an Army after the invasion do  this?    [Perez Balladares] The era of intercontinental missiles has  made the canal undefendable. We would not be able to defend the  canal even if we dedicated our entire gross national product to  create an Army to serve that purpose. The United States is not  defending the canal against a true or possible military attack,  either. The Panama Canal is invulnerable because it is neutral.  No one will want to destroy it if every one can use it. There  is no need for an Army.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Kravchuk whips bank into line THE former Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and the chairman of Ukraine's national bank yesterday shared the dubious distinction of a dressing-down by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president. Mr Kravchuk followed a stern public rebuke of Mr Vadim Hetman, the bank chairman, who spoke out over the weekend for a tighter monetary policy, with the assertion that Mr Gorbachev, as a leader who failed in his efforts to preserve the Soviet Union, had no right to advise his successors. 'The national bank exists to carry out the will of the state, neither more nor less,' he warned at a news conference. This suggests he has sided with neo-communist bureaucrats in the cabinet in their struggle with the technocratic reformers who run the republic's central bank. Mr Kravchuk rejected the bank's proposal to reintroduce the rouble into the Ukrainian economy as a means of bailing out the coupon, Ukraine's faltering pseudo-currency. On Saturday Mr Hetman called for a restriction of credits and a reintroduction of the rouble in a 'tactical retreat' from the nationalist emotions which have coloured the government's economic policies. However, Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would follow the opposite course. On October 1 the coupon would take all the functions of the true currency, apart from convertibility. It now accounts for 97 per cent of cash transactions in Ukraine, but cannot be used in non-cash operations. The Ukrainian leader yesterday advanced a new and tougher interpretation of the Black Sea Fleet agreement reached earlier this month with his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, in a further effort to appease nationalist complaints that he is weakening in his defence of the republic's sovereignty. Mr Kravchuk said that the fleet had to be divided between Ukraine and Russia by 1995, rather than postponing the division entirely until the 1995 deadline. He also strongly dismissed Mr Gorbachev's suggestion in an interview published yesterday that a new union will rise from the ashes of the old. 'To force upon the people this idea, which has compromised itself and which is responsible for the worst features of our society would be unwise and tragic,' Mr Kravchuk said.</p>

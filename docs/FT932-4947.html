			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Malpratices at the BBC THE BBC board of management will this week receive a report from an internal inquiry into alleged malpractices in the awarding of external contracts in BBC Television. Allegations being investigated range from suggestions of gifts and favours from contractors eager to do business with the corporation, to conflicts of interest in the awarding of contracts. The role of Mr Bob Pugh, who until recently was BBC Television's general manager of administration and facilities management, has been looked at by the inquiry. Mr Pugh headed a department whose responsibilities included awarding contracts to private contractors to carry out non-programme work for the BBC  -a recent trend at the corporation. The BBC said it could say nothing until the inquiry was complete other than that allegations were being 'vigorously investigated'.</p>

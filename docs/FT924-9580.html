			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Carter Holt Harvey sale of fishing unit near CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, expects to announce the sale of Sealord, its fishing subsidiary, later this week, Mr Wilson Whineray, deputy managing director, said yesterday. This followed the decision by the New Zealand appeal court yesterday that it would not interfere with a deal under which the government plans to advance NZDollars 150m (USDollars 78.9m) to a group of Maori people to help them form a joint venture with Brierley Investments to buy Sealord. Sir Robin Cook, appeal court chairman, described the agreement between the Maori people and the government, which is aimed at settling fishing claims dating back to an 1840 treaty between the Maori tribes and Queen Victoria, as an 'historic step'. It has received two bids for Sealord: one from Ashlar Corporation - a consortium of Danish and New Zealand companies, led by the fishing group Royal Greenland - and the Maori-Brierley consortium. Both are believed to value Sealord at between NZDollars 300 and NZDollars 400m. It is New Zealand's biggest fishing company. However, two Maori groups opposed to the deal to buy Sealord say they will appeal to either the United Nations or the British Privy Council. They are opposed to the deal which sets out to be a 'final settlement' to the claims.</p>

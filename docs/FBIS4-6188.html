			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  accusing North Korea of taking every opportunity to own nuclear  weapons Saturday, stressed close South Korea-U.S. cooperation  and international coordination in resolving the problem.    Meeting former U.S. President George Bush on a visit here,  Kim said the U.N. Security Council has to act if transparency  is not guaranteed on North Korea's nuclear program, spokesman  Chu Ton-Sik said.    Bush came to Seoul to attend the 43rd annual conference of  the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA).    Bush agreed that the two countries must maintain firm  alliance in dealing with the North Korean situation. He warned  they should not be fooled by North Korea's attempt to break the  two countries apart during North Korea-U.S. dialogue, Chu said.    Bush commented that he saw the tension on the Korean  peninsula was not as tense as he had thought when he was in the  United States.    Kim accused "irresponsible" people of exaggerating the  situation, Chu said.</p>

He voiced profound sorrow and regret over the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, stressing the need to agree on  measures that guarantee Palestinian security in the occupied  territories.    The Egyptian diplomatic establishment, with its well-known  expertise and Arab and international influence, has succeeded in  using the hideous crime perpetrated by Jewish extremists inside  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque to exert great pressure on Israel in the  negotiations and has exploited the international condemnation of  the act by demanding stronger powers for Palestinian autonomy.  Egypt did not limit itself to denunciations but used the crime  to promote the desired strategic solution.    Over the past few days President Mubarak contacted the  leaders of many countries influential in the peace operation to  convince them of the danger threatening the peace, which is  illustrated by settlers with expansionist delusions in the  Palestinian territories who perpetrate crimes against the  Palestinians. These crimes are reaching new heights that  adversely affect regional peace efforts and provoke popular Arab  and Islamic wrath against Israel, as happened after the  appalling Hebron incident.    An Arab and international consensus exists that the  Palestinians need urgent international protection. Mubarak  found responsive ears and international willingness to examine  the issue of providing protection for the Palestinians inside  the occupied territories, including the prompt adoption of  actual measures for this purpose because no political power is  worth anything without actual power to defend it.    When President Mubarak tells the Arab press that it is  important to resume the peace negotiations and protect the  Palestinians, he is actually stating that the most important  reason to accept the peace agreement is to end the hardships of  the Palestinians inside the occupied territories, as they are  subject to military repression and face injustices at the hands  of settlers. An immediate return to the negotiating table is  necessary to prevent the extremist settlers from benefiting by  their crime, which aimed to undermine the peace process.    It is necessary to be reasonable and determine where  Palestinian interests lie: in suspending the negotiations or  returning to them. Hence Egypt is pursuing its political and  diplomatic efforts to save the negotiations from the predicament  in which the al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime has put them. We know  that Egyptian efforts have gone hand in hand with the peace  process from the beginning and have constantly been the  lifesaver that rescued the hopes for peace and took them forward  to a more advanced stage.

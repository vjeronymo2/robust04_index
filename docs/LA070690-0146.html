			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATO UNVEILS A NEW LOOK;  </P> <P> ALLIES VOW LESS TROOPS, NUCLEAR CUTS  </P> <P> The NATO allies pledged today to sharply reduce both nuclear and conventional  defenses in Europe, extending "the hand of friendship" to Mikhail S. Gorbachev  and the rest of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> President Bush hailed the outcome of the summit as "a historic turning point."  He said Gorbachev could use the summit's ending declaration "to convince  others" that the Soviets need not fear the West at a time when they find  themselves weakened economically and in military retreat.  </P> <P> "NATO now has a new international vocation, a political vocation," Canadian  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said.  </P> <P> With a joint statement titled "The London Declaration on a Transformed North  Atlantic Alliance," the 16 NATO heads of state ended a two-day summit intended  to adapt the 41-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization to changing  European realities.  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher termed the document "a landmark in the  history of NATO and of Europe."  </P> <P> Solemnly, Bush and his 15 Western alliance partners assured the Soviet leader,  who is under attack from left and right at the 28th Communist Party Congress in  Moscow, that they hold "no aggressive intentions" and "will never in any  circumstance be the first to use force."  </P> <P> In Moscow, Gorbachev said he was ready to accept the leaders' invitation to  address a meeting of the Western alliance, probably in December. And Soviet  Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said, "We welcome the results  of the (NATO) session."  </P> <P> But Gorbachev could take little comfort from Bush's comment that he had "big  problems" with the idea of direct Western economic aid to the Soviet Union -- a  subject likely to dominate the Houston economic summit where Bush and many of  the other Western leaders were flying after the NATO meeting.  </P> <P> In London, the allies agreed to shrink their arsenal of battlefield nuclear  weapons -- in tandem with Soviet action -- and relegate them to highly unlikely  last-resort use.  </P> <P> They also said, in their windup communique, that "once negotiations begin on  short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will propose, in return for reciprocal  action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its nuclear artillery shells  from Europe."  </P> <P> They also decided to field smaller and restructured ground forces, in the  newest sign that NATO's 40-year job of containing potential Soviet-bloc  aggression was nearing a successful end.  </P> <P> One shift in NATO doctrine, away from a quarter-century threat to use nuclear  weapons promptly if attacked, drew most of the notice. More subtle but also  significant was the decision to abandon the strategy of massing troops against  the East-West frontier, switching to smaller mobile units farther back.  </P> <P> "Allied leaders will have maximum flexibility in deciding how to respond to a  crisis," the communique said.  </P> <P> And, in a surprise move designed to allay one of Gorbachev's deepest concerns,  the NATO allies agreed to set a limit on the size of Germany's military forces.  That could mean a cut of more than 160,000 soldiers from the combined troops of  East and West Germany after merger.  </P></p>

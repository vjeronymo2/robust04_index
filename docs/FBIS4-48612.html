			<p>BFN     [Text] Statements by Albino Malungo, assistance and social  reintegration minister in Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government,  on the alleged sabotage by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] armed forces on the World Food  Program [WFP] warehouse are false. Our correspondent Augusto  Salupula reports from Uige Province:    Statements by Albino Malungo that UNITA troops attacked WFP  warehouses in Uige Province are unfounded. We hereby inform the  Angolan and international community that WFP operations in the  province [words indistinct] never seen them in areas controlled  by the government. Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  commanders have never witnessed any arrival of donations from  Luanda, hence, this is yet more evidence of well-organized  actions of corruption [words indistinct] agriculture and  livestock services [words indistinct] operations by any  humanitarian organization all over the province.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Chen Muhua,  vice-chairwoman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  Standing Committee, said here today that the NPC intends to  enhance its ties with the Surinamese National Assembly so as to  promote the all-round growth of bilateral cooperation.    She made these remarks while calling on visiting Surinamese  President Ronald R. Venetiaan at the state guesthouse here this  afternoon.    Suriname lies on the north coast of South America, and Chen  noted that China and Suriname are far apart geographically and  differ in national conditions, but they are both developing  countries, facing common tasks of developing their economies and  raising their people's living standards.    The two countries have shared identical or similar views on  many international issues, she added.    During the meeting Chen reviewed with pleasure her trip to  Suriname last July, saying that she was deeply impressed by the  visit.    Venetiaan said his visit was short, but he had witnessed a  prosperous and stable China.    He said he very much admired the rapid development of  China's  economy under the condition of a stable society, due to the  Chinese leaders' correct strategic ideology.    Earlier, when interviewed by Chinese journalists, Venetiaan  described his China visit as "very important for Suriname".    He said that during the visit he has been discussing with  Chinese leaders the situation of the two countries. His visit  to China has enabled the friendship between the two countries to  "become effective", he said.    On the future of bilateral ties, Venetiaan said that the  prospects for the relations between the two countries, economic  cooperation and trade in particular, "are very good".    He noted that Suriname is a country with a small population.  But, he added, it has a reasonable amount of natural resources.    Suriname has possibilities for development, he said, adding,  it is possible for the two countries to discuss how to use  Suriname's high proportion of forest coverage.    "I think there is possibility for the two countries to  cooperate" in this regard, he said.    On the question of Suriname's joining the Caribbean  Community, Venetiaan said political and economic integration in  the Caribbean region would benefit every country of this region.    Suriname is looking forward to joining the Caribbean  Community in July this year, he said. It is now an observer of  the organization.</p>

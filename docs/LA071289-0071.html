			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Randall Terry, the founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, which  staged demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta last  summer, has been arrested in that city on charges stemming from the protests.  Operation Rescue spokesman Joseph Foreman said Terry was a "political  prisoner." Foreman said there were no plans to post the required $50,000 bond  to release Terry, who was charged with one count of being party to a crime and  three counts of criminal trespass stemming from the demonstrations. His  Binghamton, N.Y.-based group has sponsored numerous protests nationwide. Terry  was arrested after he finished an appearance before the Christian Booksellers  Assn. to promote a book.  </P></p>

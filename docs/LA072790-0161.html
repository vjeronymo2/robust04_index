			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> READICARE WILL ADD 6 CENTERS FOR $2 MILLION  </P> <P> ReadiCare Inc., the West Coast's largest operator of medical centers that treat  workers compensation cases, said Thursday that it plans a $2-million expansion  program to add six new facilities in California and Washington.  </P> <P> The additional sites, scheduled to come on line by November, will bring to 50  the number of medical service centers owned, managed or under development by  ReadiCare on the West Coast.  </P> <P> The new centers will include one being acquired for an undisclosed price in the  San Francisco Bay Area and one, already owned by ReadiCare, that is being  reopened in Sacramento because of burgeoning business in that area, said  ReadiCare chief executive Dennis G. Danko.  </P> <P> Danko said he expects those two centers to add at least $2 million a year to  ReadiCare's revenue, which totaled $26 million in the company's fiscal 1990,  which ended Feb. 28. ReadiCare reported earnings of $1.7 million for the year.  </P> <P> Danko declined to estimate revenues from the four centers that will be built as  part of the expansion.  </P> <P> "Our expanded network will enable us to accommodate increasing patient volumes  in existing geographic markets, as well as permit us to add complimentary  workers compensation services, such as outpatient rehabilitation, orthopedics,  magnetic resonance imaging and others," Danko said.  </P></p>

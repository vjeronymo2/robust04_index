			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino on Foreign Policy"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- European monetary union  cannot be achieved in phases, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino warned here today in testimony to the Lower House  Foreign Affairs Committee in which he also urged the European  Union nations to avoid haste in naming a successor to European  Commission President Jacques Delors.    In a wide-ranging foreign policy briefing in the run-up to  the EU's [European Union] Corfu summit and the G-7 summit in  Naples on July 8-10, he also said that he would be seeking to  give Italy a higher-profile foreign policy.    Other points in the briefing included a proposal to debate  the Bosnian crisis at the G-7 summit where he said he hoped to  see an acceleration in Russian involvement. Bosnia, said  Martino, "can usefully be brought into the sphere of political  cooperation in the G-7 plus Russia, not only at the summit  itself, but as an appropriate forum for permanent political  consultation."    On the EU's plans for economic and monetary union, Martino  said that he sees the present procedures introduced to achieve  the economic convergence needed to create a common currency as  "excessively laborious and potentially ineffective, especially  where they don't take account of the deeper logic of market  forces." Monetary union, he added, would have to be based on a  monetary constitution to be put into effect "instantaneously" by  all the participants: "Put simply, if you want a single currency  for Europe, it will have to be achieved at one go."    These apparent criticisms of one proposed aspect of European  integration were matched by arguments advanced by Martino in  support of submitting some joint EU policies more systematically  to the winds of global competition, a development already under  way for the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP], whose subsidies  are to be largely dismantled under the Uruguay Round.    In Corfu, Martino urged, the EU leaders should decide on  ways  of achieving lower costs by opening Europe to competition from  the rest of the world. He also claimed that the CAP had  favoured rich farmers and middle-men. In similar points, he  said supplementary EU funding for infrastructural and other  projects outlined in the Delors White Paper should not distort  the European capital market nor create additional expense for  the EU budget.    Looking forward to a common European foreign policy, the  Italian diplomatic chief urged the creation of a new institution  on the lines of the European Commission, "with the power to make  proposals to the political authorities and the means to execute  and maintain actions."    In other foreign policy areas, Martino reiterated that Italy  has "no territorial demands" against Slovenia or Croatia and  that ongoing negotiations should resolve remaining bilateral  questions such as minority rights and compensation for  confiscated property. He also said that Rome favours Slovenia's  gradual movement towards its goal of membership in the EU, but  urged it to adopt an "open and constructive" attitude towards  Italy's legitimate expectations, "in line with EU principles."  In particular, he said Italy is demanding free access to the  Slovenian real-estate market for Italians born in ex-Italian  territories now forming part of Slovenia, in line with EU  regulations on free circulation. He said he expected similar  solutions with Croatia. The diplomatic chief then added how  Rome favored Slovenia moving "slowly" closer to the European  Union in pace with Ljubljana meeting Italy's legitimate demands  which "are based on Community principals," such as open markets  and free circulation.    As to the naming of a new Commission president, Martino said  that all the present candidates have the political  qualifications to become "potentially excellent presidents," but  he also repeated the view that the appointment should form part  of an agreement on the whole package of international  appointments now falling due.    Among these are the candidacy of ex-Foreign Trade Minister  Renato Ruggiero to head the new World Trade Organisation, which  will succeed the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. "We  are examining this question in all its ramifications," said  Martino. He also linked the issue of international appointments  to his moves to give Italy a more high-profile foreign policy,  which he said must be "coherent and recognisable" to be credible.    Saying that domestic uncertainties had meant a loss in  international prestige, he said the government would be seeking  to rebuild Italian participation in international  decision-making processes by "making the most" of its current  duty presidencies and working for a two-year stint on the UN  Security Council. This, he said, now looks a virtual certainty  because Sweden has withdrawn its candidacy and because of the  "assurances we have received."    On Rwanda, Martino voiced the hope that a joint action plan  would be adopted in Corfu and said that Italy was ready to play  its part, even through the use of its armed forces. He also  warned that, if two European countries -- for example, Italy and  France -- were to intervene instead of the UN as a whole, the  operation would be seen as "neo-colonialism."    In other points, he reiterated Italy's plan to use the G-7  summit as a forum for proposing the creation of a small rapid  intervention force -- "a small task force," he specified -- for  immediate intervention in small crises. Looking at the costs of  Italy's participation in international operations, Martino said  the time had come for the budget to include ad hoc allocations  for peace-keeping expenses.    Martino's foreign policy briefing also included reference to  his recent meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  who he said was totally satisfied over the political evolution  in Italy and confirmed the traditionally excellent relations  between Italy and Israel.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Celltech poised to sign another collaboration Celltech, the biotechnology company, is likely to sign another large collaborative deal with a pharmaceuticals company during 1995. Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive, said several companies were interested but would not say which of Celltech's potential products was involved. Any new partnership is likely to include the company's promising cancer-treating matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. The company has already received Pounds 13.6m from its partnerships and is set to earn up to another Pounds 47m by 1998, depending on the progress of drugs in development. Celltech shares rose 2p to a new high of 239p. The company also announced a pre-tax loss for the year to September 30 of Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 5.9m), largely as a result of higher research and development spending. Losses per share were 11p (10.3p). Cash outflow increased from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 9.7m after higher capital spending on a new plant. The company had Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 17.9m) cash at the year end. It raised Pounds 27.3m in a rights issue in December 1993. Mr Fellner said that 1995 would see results from small- scale but statistically significant clinical trials on its product CDP 571 in Type II for diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 14.2m, entirely from the company's Biologics manufacturing division. Mr Peter Allen, finance director, said that disruption caused by the construction of a bigger plant had hit the Biologics division in the second half and would continue to do so into the first half of this year. COMMENT A comparison between Celltech and British Biotech, which announced interims this week, is instructive. Celltech is about a year behind in terms of progress in clinical trials. The trials are slower. It takes longer to see whether a drug helps an arthritis sufferer than a cancer patient close to death. On the other hand, Celltech is conducting statistically significant studies at an earlier stage. It has more potential drugs in its pipeline, thus spreading risk. Most importantly, Celltech has collaborations with big name drugs companies, and their expert assessment is worth more than a City analyst's report. Where companies such as Merck, Bayer and Schering-Plough invest, others follow. The shares beat February's all-time high this week and should rise further.</p>

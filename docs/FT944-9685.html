			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Hunger worsening in Africa Hunger and malnutrition are growing in eastern Africa and the continent needs exceptional aid, according to a report to be presented to a council meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) today. Mr Jacques Diouf, who promised to make Africa his priority when elected head of the UN's main food agency last year, will detail a worsening hunger situation when he opens the meeting. 'Fifteen countries in the region are currently facing exceptional food emergencies and half of these countries are also being affected by civil strife,' the report said. Rwanda and Burundi were listed as being extreme cases, and in need of continued international aid and 'extreme agricultural rehabilitation'. The report also said famine conditions were emerging in several parts of the Horn of Africa including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan. Mr Diouf, a Senegalese who is the FAO's first African director-general, will address a 49-nation governing council, which is meeting for 10 days to discuss and vote on a range of agency business.</p>

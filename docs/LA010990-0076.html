			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> New Theater Group to Hit Town: Dan Lauria, who plays the grumpy Dad on "The  Wonder Years," will direct PKE Theatre, a new theater group that is being  completely funded by Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment, the Culver City company  that produced the TV movie "Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" and the  upcoming TV series "Working Girl." With a budget of $100,000 from partners Tom  Patchett and Ken Kaufman, PKE will stage four plays during the next year, using  rented theaters; the first will be "Old Friends," opening March 1 at the  Callboard Theatre in West Hollywood. Last year Lauria used his own "Wonder  Years" money to co-produce two smaller-theater hits, "A Bronx Tale" and "What  Everywoman Knows." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

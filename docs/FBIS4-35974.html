			<p>BFN     [Text] A state of top alert prevails among the Israeli  occupation forces and their puppet militia, on one side, and the  Lebanese Army and the Lebanese resistance groups, on the other.    The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY has learned that the UN Interim  Force in Lebanon has placed the personnel manning its  checkpoints on alert. It also beefed up the checkpoints with  additional troops.    The occupation forces have mobilized additional troops  inside  the occupied border strip. Convoys of tanks, military vehicles,  and troop carriers have been deployed on the hills overlooking  the liberated areas near the international border.    According to security sources, the Israeli occupation forces  have deployed long-range mobile artillery on the Muhaybib and  al-'Abbad hills, and Jabal Humayd.    AFP reported today that large numbers of Israeli tanks,  armored vehicles, artillery pieces, and troops carriers were  deployed on the Lebanese-Israeli international border but did  not cross.    Meanwhile, contrary to some media's claims, no flood of  refugees has been reported from the areas under attack despite  the atmosphere of tension there.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Solid gains despite bond price decline Wall Street Continued demand for cyclicals helped blue-chips post solid gains yesterday in spite of a sharp decline in bond prices that was sparked by an unexpectedly strong June employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.72 at 3,709.14, near its high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended higher, up 1.17 at 449.55, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.80 firmer at 425.45 and the Nasdaq composite 0.94 firmer at 707.47. Trading volume on the NYSE was 235m shares. The Labor department's announcement that non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 last month, and that the national unemployment rate held steady at 6 per cent, surprised the market. Analysts had forecast a rise in payrolls of only 280,000, and an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.2 per cent. The immediate reaction from investors was to sell shares, primarily because bonds had dropped sharply on the jobs data, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.691 per cent, its highest level this year. Bonds fell because the Treasury market feared that the strong jobs figures would persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to slow economic growth. Share prices, however, quickly recovered from their early lows, with investors encouraged by a comment from a Bureau of Labor Statistics official that the bigger-than-expected increase in payrolls was partly due to the fact that the reporting period in June lasted for five weeks, instead of the usual four weeks. By mid-morning, the Dow was up 20 points. The market could not hold on to its gains later in the session when still depressed bond prices and a weaker dollar forced a temporary retreat, but confidence about the outlook for second quarter earnings and continued strong interest in cyclical stocks ensured that blue-chip shares ended the day on a positive note. Among individual stocks, Alcoa rose Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 78 7/8 on news of stronger earnings. Other cyclicals also fared well, with Caterpillar adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 105 3/4 and Ford rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 5/8 . Nike jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 after the shoe-maker reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings that were below last year's level but still well above analysts' forecasts. Investors were also cheered by the company's statement that it should be able to maintain the level of its gross margins from this year through to the end of 1995. CBS fell another Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 303 7/8 as speculation continued that Disney would conclude some sort of business agreement with the broadcaster and its new merger partner, QVC. Investors had hoped that Disney, or other big entertainment groups, might make a rival bid for CBS. Canada Toronto prices closed higher in a late-session rally in quiet trading. The TSE-300 index rose 19.03 points, or 0.47 per cent, to close at 4,098.90. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 370 to 325. Volume was 45.82m shares, down from Thursday's 58.48m and trading value fell to CDollars 567.5m from CDollars 671. m. On the week, the index gained about 74 points. The market was flat in dull trading for most of the day, before finding some life in the final hour or so of trading. Brazil Growing optimism among investors over the election chances of presidential candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso helped Brazilian share prices make ground. The Bovespa of the 56 most-traded shares on the Sao Paulo bourse ended the day up 3.76 per cent at 40,519 after an early morning bout of profit taking.</p>

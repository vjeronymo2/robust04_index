			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils gloomy A downbeat mood hung over oil stocks after a meeting of the London oil analysts group produced a generally bearish stance on the outlook for European refining. The group spoke pessimistically about general prospects in Europe. The analysts also pointed to the costs of meeting increasingly stiff environmental demands as a check on the performance of companies with interests in European refining. While the group did not envisage downgrading profit forecasts, the gloomy conclusions led to a decline for many of the oil stocks. Burmah closed 13 down at 770p; BP lost 2 1/2 to 323p; Enterprise gave up 2 to 466p and Lasmo lost 1 1/2 to 140p. Shell managed to buck the downward trend, gaining 4 to 684p.</p>

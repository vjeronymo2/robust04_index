			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No way to behave Sir, Richard Gourlay's otherwise excellent guide to recovery for survivors of the recession (Management: The Growing Business, January 25) contains one lamentable anachronism. The only way '. . .is to be able to turn round to the customer and stick two fingers up' represents precisely the attitude most likely to extinguish any glimmer of improved prospects. We all have customers. What is called for from suppliers is to take the lead in developing healthy and commercially sustainable partnerships with their customers. This requires dedication to foster trust, and a mutual understanding of requirements and ambitions. Fingers should be put to work, not stuck up at customers. Kees J Kempenaar, Calle Avila 77, Valldoreix, 08190-Sant Cugat, Barcelona, Spain</p>

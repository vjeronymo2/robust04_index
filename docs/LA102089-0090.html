			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTONANGLERS LOAD UP AS ALBACORE, TUNA RUNS COME CLOSER  </P> <P> Anglers are loading their sacks as the terrific run of albacore and tuna is  within a one-and two-day reach of South Bay sportfishers.  </P> <P> The big outbreak of albacore started last month, prompting local sportfishers  to schedule three-to-five day trips.  </P> <P> Now the big bite is just 90 miles out and has surpassed last year's catch  counts.  </P> <P> The El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing found solid action south of San  Clemente Island. Capt. Cookie Cook said he made 30 jig stops on the two-day run  and anglers caught tuna up to 60-plus pounds.  </P> <P> Cook, 72, who has been on many tuna trips in the past 40 years, noted that he  hadn't seen the abundance of tuna like this for many years.  </P> <P> Every stop resulted in consistent hookups. The only puzzle he can't solve is  the albacore average of only eight pounds.  </P> <P> Yellow fin and blue fin tuna mixed with the albacore are heavyweights.  </P> <P> Leroy Januwc of San Pedro was a jackpot winner with his 65-pound yellow fin  tuna.  </P> <P> Ben Villaionoz of Redondo Beach decked a 53-pound yellow fin tuna. John  Meinich, also of Redondo Beach, decked a blue fin tuna weighing 44 pounds. The  total catch was 200 albacore, 106 blue fin tuna and 72 yellow fin tuna.  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach angler Ted Mancki, fishing in the second annual Oceans Shootout  in San Diego, took grand angler honors fishing aboard the Apollo with a  110-pound bigeye tuna.  </P> <P> Dean Drulias of Rancho Palos Verdes just returned from Cabo San Lucas with a  255-pound blue marlin.  </P> <P> Darrell Fleming of Wilmington, trolling aboard the Ghetto Queen for marlin at  Avalon, had a marlin jumper hit his mackerel. It escaped as a school of sharks  attacked the bait. Pulling his trolling line, Fleming brought aboard a 77  1/4-pound mako shark.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Beach launch ramp has been closed until spring, 1990. Work is  starting on new floats and dredging of sand that has built up at the ramp.  </P> <P> An alternate ramp for South Bay small boat anglers is the Redondo Beach ramp  site.  </P></p>

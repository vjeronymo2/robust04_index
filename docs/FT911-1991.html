			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sweden sets about slicing the cost of food - Robert Taylor outlines the benefits Swedes expect from agricultural deregulation SWEDEN is about to enjoy the first benefits of the long overdue deregulation of its over-protected agricultural system. A few days ago the ruling Social Democrats proposed a 10 per cent cut in import controls which is expected to bring a 3 per cent to 5 per cent reduction in food prices. The country's parliament is expected to vote soon by a large cross-party majority for the cut in duties. It is hoped the change will come into effect on July 1, the day that sees the start of the phased removal of Sweden's internal agricultural market controls agreed last year. With a general election less than five months away the government is also promising to cut the present 25 per cent value added tax on food, though this will have to wait until the autumn. All of a sudden the political parties in Sweden are competing with each other for the favours of the electorate in their commitment to cheap food in a country which has the most expensive food in the world. Mr Matts Hellstrom, the agriculture minister, said: 'The new food reforms will put the consumer at the centre of our priorities.' The Swedish government is committed to the introduction of free market principles of supply and demand in agriculture, which means a radical break with more than half a century of protectionism in the name of self-sufficiency. The new liberalising policy announced in July 1990 is intended to eliminate excess food production which has led to the export of surpluses, especially grain, onto world markets at a financial cost to the Swedish taxpayer amounting to as much as Skr2bn - Skr3bn (Pounds 189m - Pounds 284m) a year, 10 per cent of the total income from agriculture. Mr Hellstrom said: 'The system of collective financing of agricultural exports must be abolished if the national economy, the farmers and the consumers are to benefit from the reform.' From July 1 this year the phase out starts on internal market controls for grain, milk, eggs and meat. It has already been agreed that Sweden's farmers will receive SKr13.6bn in compensation as they adjust to the realities of the free market during a five year transition that will last until 1995. The money is to be spent on cutting milk and grain production and encouraging farmers to switch from growing grain to other forms of cultivation. Public resources are also being put into environmentally acceptable energy production like bio-fuels as a way of encouraging the rural sector to diversify. The ruling Social Democrats emphasise Swedish agriculture must accept the changes being proposed. These will eventually ensure Sweden has the same support level as that existing inside the European Community. Bilateral negotiations are going on between Stockholm and Brussels to look at ways of improving the possibilities for Sweden's food and agricultural industries in exporting their produce into the EC. Mr Hellstrom said: 'I believe in increased freedom of trade and I am convinced that Swedish producers can do well in a larger international market. Free trade means both freedom and choice for consumers as well as producers.' He remains very hopeful that a broad agreement can be achieved through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the end of this year which will exert a further downward pressure on the level of food prices in Sweden with greater access for foreign goods. The warm welcome that has been given to the Swedish government's proposed reforms suggests they are long overdue in a country that continues to have some of the highest food prices in the world. On average households spend 20 per cent of their budgets on the purchase of food. During the 1980s food prices in Sweden rose faster than in other western European countries and at a higher rate than the country's overall inflation. Of course, Sweden's farm lobby does not see it that way and Mr Hellstrom has been accused of betraying agriculture. Demonstrations by angry farmers can be expected in protest against the changes. But only an estimated 3 per cent of Swedes are employed on the land, less than a tenth of the country is cultivated and agriculture accounts for a mere 2 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic product. The surprise is that the government has not acted sooner for the high cost of living in Sweden has meant persistent wage-push inflation and hurt the country's international competitiveness in its export industries. An assault on food prices was long overdue through a shake-up of an agricultural system that belonged to a bygone age.</p>

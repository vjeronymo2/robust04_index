			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Inland Revenue seeks adjudicator for complaints THE INLAND Revenue has begun its search for candidates for the post of independent revenue adjudicator to deal with complaints from taxpayers. Job advertisements placed in national newspapers last Saturday said the job would pay Pounds 55,000 a year pro rata, with an initial estimate that the time required would be 20 hours per week. The candidate will be expected to have extensive business experience or involvement in managing a large organisation, but need not have any background in tax issues. The adjudicator's position was announced last month as part of the department's contribution to the government's Citizen's Charter initiative. The Revenue hopes to have an adjudicator in place by May to deal with complaints from the beginning of the new tax year. The job will investigate complaints about the way the Revenue has handled tax affairs, such as excessive delays, errors, discourtesy or the way in which discretion is exercised. It expects to deal with 20 to 50 complaints a week. There will be a small team of seconded Revenue staff initially to help the adjudicator. The Revenue said it had no plans to appoint a headhunter to help in the search for candidates.</p>

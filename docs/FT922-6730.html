			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Travel case will be heard in Egypt HAMED EL CHIATY &amp; CO v THOMAS COOK GROUP LTD Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: May 5 1992 A WRITTEN contract expressed to be governed by a foreign law but silent as to jurisdiction, may be treated as rectified for the purposes of the action in any Division of the High Court on the application of the plaintiff or the defendant, if there was prior oral agreement between the parties that the foreign court should have exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes and they mistakenly believed that the express wording as to the governing law achieved that effect. Mr Justice Hirst so held when staying three actions by Hamed El Chiaty &amp; Co, trading as Travco Nile Cruise Lines (Travco), against Thomas Cook Group Ltd, on claims arising under agreements for charter of the Nile Rhapsody. HIS LORDSHIP said Travco was an Egyptian tourist company specialising in Nile cruises. Thomas Cook was an English travel company. Under a project originating towards the end of 1987, Thomas Cook was to help finance the construction of Nile Rhapsody by Travco, and then charter her from Travco for use on package tours. Thomas Cook guaranteed a stipulated minimum of passengers for each trip. Written contracts were drawn up. They provided that 'this agreement shall be governed by Egyptian law', but were silent as to jurisdiction. Thomas Cook's case, strongly denied by Travco, was that in 1988 it was agreed that the contracts would be subject to Egyptian law and to the exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts. It said it could rely on the principle in El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119 that the court would generally enforce such an agreement unless the plaintiffs could show a strong reason for not doing so. Its second line of attack was that it was entitled to a stay on the basis of forum non conveniens on the principles in Spiliada (1987) AC 460. The consequence of establishing the Egyptian jurisdiction agreement would be a shift in burden of proof in favour of Thomas Cook. Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990. The ensuing crisis engulfed the tourist trade in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Thomas Cook failed to fulfil its guarantees. On February 4 1991, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised people not to travel to Egypt without strong reason. On February 25, Thomas Cook purported to invoke force majeure, and that was re-iterated in March. On the evidence, the court found that in January 1988 the parties agreed orally that disputes should be subject exclusively to Egyptian law and Egyptian jurisdiction, and that they thought (wrongly) that the clause inserted in the contract had that effect. Snell's Equity 29th Edition 1990, page 626, having noted that rectification claims were assigned to the Chancery Division, stated that 'any Division may give effect to a defence of rectification as regards transactions without actually rectifying the instrument'. In Mostyn (1876) 1 CPD 145,150, the Court of Common Pleas held that if a defendant in that Division set up facts which in the Chancery Division would entitle him to have an instrument reformed or set aside, 'though this Division cannot reform or set it aside with regard to its effect in future it may, for the purpose of determining the action, treat it as set aside'. In Breslauer v Barwick (1876 36 LT 52), the same court applied Mostyn and treated a charterparty as if a mistake as to the plaintiff's identity were amended, since 'facts were shown as would cause the Chancery Division to reform it'. Both cases were of general application. The statement in Snell was accurate, subject only to the qualification that, having regard to Breslauer, a plaintiff as well as a defendant was entitled to invoke the power. As to whether the Chancery Division would have made a rectification order, there must be 'convincing proof' that there was a prior agreement, that it was still effective when the relevant instrument was executed, that by mistake the instrument failed to carry out that agreement, and that if rectified as claimed, the instrument would carry out the agreement (Snell 628-632; Joscelyne v Nissen (1970) 2 QB 86). There was convincing proof of all four aspects. In the exercise of its discretion, the court would treat the contracts as rectified, so that 'this agreement shall be governed by English law' read as 'this agreement shall be governed by Egyptian law and all disputes hereunder shall be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts'. Thomas Cook was entitled to invoke the El Amria test. That was sufficient to dispose of the summonses in its favour. The Spiliada tests laid down by Lord Goff were that a stay would only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens 'where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for trial of the action, ie, in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice'. In applying the first test, the correct approach was to consider which country was the natural forum. On the second test, the key factor was whether the plaintiffs could establish that they would not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction. As to the first test, the fact that a contract was governed by foreign law was highly material - not only because a foreign court was obviously best fitted to adjudicate on its own law, but also because it avoided the expense of bringing expert witnesses to the UK to debate foreign law issues. In the present case substantial points of legal principle were at stake. Egypt had a modern civil code system, modelled mainly on French law. Other sources of law included custom, Islamic law, natural law and equity. It was not a case in which English courts would be applying familiar principles. On nearly all the Egyptian law issues, there was almost total disagreement between the expert witnesses. Force majeure was a very important potential defence. The experts disagreed as to the relevant provisions of the Egyptian Civil Code. The legal questions were pre-eminently more suitable for decision in Egypt than in the UK. Thomas Cook understandably found it necessary to lead evidence from Egypt as to the general effect of the Kuwait crisis and Gulf War on tourism there. In relation to Egyptian law and to Egyptian evidence, the force majeure issue pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt. As to damages, there was dispute between the experts. One said damages would be assessed on a net loss of profit basis. The other said parties might fix damages in advance. So far as evidence was concerned, Thomas Cook would need to scrutinise Travco's accounts (partly in Arabic) and to call crew members of Travco's vessels and suppliers of services on the Nile. It followed that in relation to Egyptian law and evidence the damages issue pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt. The court was satisfied that the evidence as a whole pointed overwhelmingly in favour of Egypt as the natural forum, since the actions had their most real and substantial connection with Egypt. Egypt was another available forum with competent jurisdiction which was clearly and distinctly the appropriate forum for trial of the actions. Thomas Cook had satisfied the first Spiliada test. As to the second test, the burden was on Travco to show juridical disadvantage. It relied on delay, interest and costs. In respect of costs, which were not recoverable in Egypt, and to a small extent in respect of delay and interest, Travco would suffer juridical disadvantages if the action was stayed in England. That fell far short of establishing that Travco would be deprived of substantial justice if the UK actions were stayed and trial took place in Egypt. Justice did not require that a stay should not be granted. Travco failed under the second Spiliada test. The actions were stayed. For Thomas Cook: Charles Haddon-Cave (Field Fisher Waterhouse). For Travco: Jonathan Gaisman (Linklaters &amp; Paines).</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARY;  </P> <P> LIFE IN A TIME OF CHAOS: PAST THE BULLETS IN BEIRUT;  </P> <P> IN A CITY OFTEN CRIPPLED BY VIOLENCE, THE BEACH CLUBS FLOURISH AND THE GOLF  COURSE IS GREEN AND GROOMED. THE EVIDENCE OF THE LEBANESE AS SURVIVORS IS  EVERYWHERE.  </P> <P> "Mitterrand or Bush?" a Syrian intelligence officer asked the blonde woman  waiting to cross the so-called Green Line that divides war-torn Beirut.  </P> <P> French or American? The question implied that anything else would be  unacceptable.  </P> <P> "Bush," the woman replied, producing a smile, a salute and no further  questions.  </P> <P> But the next person in line, a Lebanese, was asked for his papers. There was no  smile, no salute. His papers were carefully scrutinized.  </P> <P> Being an American may be helpful in getting past checkpoints manned by the  Syrian military, but given the six American hostages still held by one faction  or another, Lebanese friends think that an American who stays on here must have  a death wish.  </P> <P> "Dye your hair," they urge. "Never let on that you're a journalist."  </P> <P> True, Beirut is chaotic. After more than a decade of civil war, and despite the  presence of Syrian troops who were brought in to keep the peace, there is still  an occasional gunfight in the street, a car bomb, an exchange of artillery  fire.  </P> <P> People go about their lives as best they can. Every morning, as early as 5:30,  joggers and walkers appear on West Beirut's seaside corniche, among them Khalil  Dayya, a security expert trained in Canada, and Father Germanos el Hage, a  Greek Orthodox priest.  </P> <P> Most are gone by 7 o'clock. This gives them time to stop at the baker's on the  way home. And the men with children have to escort them to school.  </P> <P> About this time the hanging baskets begin to appear. This is an old practice  here, and it was widely adopted in January, when the city's main electric power  grid was knocked out by artillery fire.  </P> <P> Apartment-house dwellers tie a wicker basket to a length of laundry line and  dangle it from the balcony. Seven-story drops are common. The practiced  resident can place the basket at just the right height for the men who deliver  newspapers and groceries.  </P> <P> An Italian restaurant, the Moreno, has recently taken to making deliveries in  this manner.  </P> <P> Reuters, the British news agency, is using the basket. Reuters' building has  its own electric power generators, but they won't run the elevator up to the  agency's fifth-floor offices. So the basket brings up sandwiches and fruit from  shops nearby, along with an occasional statement from one of the gangs that  hold the hostages. A long buzz on the battery-operated signal downstairs means  lower the basket.  </P> <P> Resourceful Lebanese have worked out more up-to-date communications systems.  When the power went out in January, the government telephone service went with  it. So opportunists arranged to have international lines brought in from  Cyprus. In addition to telephone service, they offer telex and facsimile, or  fax.  </P> <P> With their help, you can reach out and touch someone in the United States for  $4 a minute; $3 to Europe. Their offices open early and close late.  </P> <P> One of the first to provide this service was Patrick Smith, a Lebanese/British  businessman and proprietor of Smith's supermarket, where West Beirut's 50  American residents stop regularly each Saturday to shop and socialize.  </P> <P> Some supermarkets have installed diesel-powered generators, and they offer  their neighbors electricity for 10 hours a day for about $75 a month.  </P> <P> The stores' shelves are not always full, but you can usually find adequate  supplies of breakfast cereal -- Kellogg's, Post and General Mills -- Whiskas  cat food, Paul Masson wines, frozen shrimp from the Persian Gulf and Danish  bacon.  </P> <P> You read and hear a great deal about the down-and-out Lebanese, but evidence of  the Lebanese as survivor par excellence is everywhere in West Beirut. Beach  clubs flourish; the private, 18-hole golf course is green and groomed.  </P> <P> The latest Paris fashions are available at Kookai, which has branches on both  sides of the city. The other day, Vivien Bayoud, a fashion-conscious, single  businesswoman, was joking about the importance of wearing epaulets, as shoulder  pads are called here. A friend had commented that they are too hot in summer,  and Bayoud countered: "But we must look good for all those men from East  Beirut."  </P> <P> Some women, Bayoud apparently among them, have found a silver lining in the  plight of East Beirut Christians who have sought safety in the western sector.  </P> <P> Along Hamra Street you see women in epaulets picking their way among vendors  and beggars en route to shops with names like Transparent Lingerie, Caviar,  Groovy.  </P> <P> A lottery-ticket vendor will bellow out over the roar of generators, "If you  buy my tickets you will win 25 million Lebanese pounds ($38,000)." But this is  qualified with a barely audible "inshallah" -- if God wills it.  </P> <P> Pedestrian traffic bunches up at sidewalk displays, perhaps a bargain in  Cartier watches at $6. Jeans, perfume, fresh fish -- all are available from  hatchback vehicles parked along the way.  </P> <P> To cross the street, it is best to wait in the shade for a break in the  traffic. But not long ago a Syrian soldier carrying a rifle stepped out without  even looking, certain that his uniform would get him safely to the other side.  </P> <P> There was a squeal of tires, and a car grazed him. The car stood stock-still,  as did the people around. No one would have changed places with the driver for  all the lottery tickets in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The soldier peered in, saw a woman at the wheel, and delivered a heavy-booted  kick that bent back the license plate. The driver had been saved by her gender.  </P> <P> Stories like this are told and retold at cocktail parties. A good story is as  welcome as a bottle of gin. But not as welcome as a bag of ice cubes. Many  people have installed generators, but few have the capacity to keep a  refrigerator going.  </P> <P> Then there's the water problem. The pumping station went out with the power.  You can buy ice cubes at supermarkets, but the purity is questionable.  </P> <P> An alternative water system was completed in March, and the water supply is  fairly regular now, but the pressure doesn't get it above the ground floor.  </P> <P> Still, if there is a problem in Beirut there is generally someone with a  solution. For $10 an hour, a man with a pump will get water to the rooftop  reservoir that is a fixture on most Beirut buildings.  </P> <P> The movie houses have generators, too, and the marquees are advertising  "Lambada -- the Forbidden Dance," "Revenge of Samson," "Raw Deal" and "Family  Business."  </P> <P> But the recently completed World Cup soccer tournament was the best show in  town. When there was a game, the streets of Beirut were all but empty. People  crowded around any convenient television set.  </P> <P> At times, even a journalist is safe. Armed men at a checkpoint asked the blonde  woman why she was carrying two bags. They could see cameras in one, notebooks  and folders in the other.  </P> <P> "Where are you from?" they demanded to know. "What do you do?"  </P> <P> Was this the time to take the friends' advice and lie? Impulsively, the truth  popped out.  </P> <P> They grinned and posed for a picture.  </P> <P> "Allah maa'ik," they chorused. God be with you.  </P></p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Customs staff given performance pay targets Thousands of civil servants in Customs &amp; Excise will receive no pay rise this year unless they reach basic performance targets. The deal is the first of what could be a succession of innovative pay agreements in the civil service agencies that have taken direct control over pay negotiations for the first time. About 65 per cent of all 540,000 civil servants will have their pay set by their agency this year, rising to 90 per cent next year. A few organisations, such as the Inland Revenue, have already devolved bargaining. The Customs &amp; Excise deal, which the unions hope might set a trend, will increase the pay bill by about 2.6 per cent. However the unions claim that it will increase the pay of some clerical workers by more than 5 per cent. There will be no pay rise at all for senior or junior staff who do not reach basic performance targets, but the unions say this is unlikely to affect more than a few dozen people. For higher executive officers and grades below them, pay will rise in steps  -related to performance - from 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. As the pay deal covers a 14-month period the rise will be slightly lower in annual terms. The Customs &amp; Excise agreement involves a complete overhaul of the previous complex pay grading structure and provides both more flexibility and a higher performance-pay element. Mr Mike King, who negotiated the deal for the NUCPS civil service union, said that in spite of the unhappy experience with some performance pay systems the union was confident that the system would work well. He added: 'The important thing is that we have shown that delegated bargaining can produce the goods.' Other big agencies such as the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service are similarly overhauling their pay systems, but have not yet reached agreement on this year's pay rise. Some agencies, such as the Driving Standards Agency, are likely to 'shadow' the outcome of the central bargaining undertaken by the Treasury. This still affects about one third of all civil servants. Those core negotiations are expected to produce a rise of around 2.5 per cent, although they are at present stalled. Union officials say that the Treasury is keen for several agencies to conclude their pay negotiations before the core agreement is concluded so that the temptation to shadow it will be avoided.</p>

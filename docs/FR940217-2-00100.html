By letter dated June 21, 1985, the ABA modified its application in response to the Department's tentative denial, explaining that it was no longer seeking exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between banks and plans where the banks or their affiliates have investment management discretion over the plan assets involved in the transactions. On September 15, 1986, the Department published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 32695), requesting additional information from the public on various issues being considered by the Department in deciding whether to propose a foreign exchange class exemption in response to the ABA application. The comment period ended on February 24, 1987. Seventeen substantive responses to the solicitation of comments were received. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of those comments, see the proposed exemption at 56 FR 11761 (March 20, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 20, 1991, the Department published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 11757) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of certain transactions described in section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code. The notice of pendency invited all interested persons to submit written comments concerning the proposed class exemption by May 20, 1991. The Department received nine public comments requesting, among other things, that the Department broaden the scope of the exemption to provide relief for transactions entered into pursuant to standing instructions. In view of those comments, the Department published a notice of public hearing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 46806 (September 16, 1991)). The hearing was held on October 3, 1991. Upon consideration of all of the comments received and testimony offered at the public hearing, the Department has determined to grant the proposed class exemption, subject to certain modifications. These modifications and the major comments are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

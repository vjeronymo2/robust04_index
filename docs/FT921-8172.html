			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Rushdie, no happy ending - The wound opened by the publication of The Satanic Verses has not yet healed 'I have lost my freedom - my home, my family, my daily life. I want it back.' I suppose some Moslems, reading those words uttered by Mr Salman Rushdie, the novelist, last week in his speech on the third anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa condemning him to death, will have felt a grim satisfaction. The rest of us, however, including many Moslems, must surely be moved by the pathos of Mr Rushdie's situation, and the words which he finds to express it. His situation is a terrible one: physically, much preferable to that endured until recently by Mr Terry Waite and other hostages, and no doubt also psychologically better - Mr Rushdie after all can move about, even across the Atlantic and back, and has access to a wide range of distractions - but terrible all the same. Nothing could be more understandable than his desire to see it ended, and he is entitled to expect the British government to do what it can to reduce the threat to him. Unhappily, though, there seems little prospect of its being reduced to a point where it will be possible for him to lead a completely open and normal life. The argument about The Satanic Verses is one in which there is not much pleasure for either side. If one takes Mr Rushdie's side, one can easily slide into polemics against Islam or Moslems as such, increasing the sense of grievance and humiliation that many Moslems undoubtedly feel about the attitude of the western establishment towards them, especially in Britain. And yet for anyone who takes liberalism seriously, defending Mr Rushdie is an inescapable task. In the first place he has to be defended against Khomeini's fatwa and its consequences. Whatever the right thing to do about The Satanic Verses may be, no liberal can entertain the idea that the death penalty should be imposed on its author or publishers or translators; still less that murder can acquire any kind of legitimacy in Britain by virtue of a death sentence passed in absentia by a legal authority in Iran. But for a liberal, saying that Mr Rushdie should not be killed is not enough. The question is whether there is any principle justifying the abridgement of his freedom of expression. Here the British establishment is clearly wrong-footed by the existence of the law of blasphemy, which the courts have ruled does not extend to offences against Islam. It is impossible for Moslems not to see that ruling as discriminatory. Historically, blasphemy was an offence against God, which a Christian society had to suppress in order to avoid being collectively guilty of it. The question that arises now is not that at all, but whether freedom of expression on religious matters should be limited in the interests of peaceful coexistence between different religious communities. Do we need an offence of 'incitement to religious hatred', comparable to that of 'incitement to racial hatred'? Perhaps we do, but even under that heading a case against The Satanic Verses would be difficult to sustain. In any event, it is much easier to respect the feelings of Moslems who are offended by the book than it is to accept the denigration of Mr Rushdie by non-Moslems. They often seem to be venting a rightwing, philistine grudge, with a hint of racial prejudice thrown in, against a successful left-wing writer of Indian origin. He has failed, they seem to feel, to show sufficient gratitude for his good fortune in being raised as a member of the British establishment, and is now driven to accept protection from the state he so intemperately criticised. One does not have to agree with all Mr Rushdie's political judgments (many of which were neither consistent nor profound) to find this line of argument contemptible. Whoever declares The Satanic Verses 'unreadable' is making a comment not on the book but on his or her own literacy. It is, admittedly, a book in which few if any readers can hope to catch all the allusions without some help. But it is, as Mr Rushdie himself has said, 'a serious novel' and also a funny one. It is clever but, with hindsight, also very silly, for the author chose to treat playfully, even scatologically, a subject which, as he well knew, is for millions of people deadly serious. Would he have written differently if he had known what would happen? Two years ago he asked himself that question and replied: 'Truthfully I don't know. Would I change any of the text now? I would not. It's too late.' True enough. The novel exists now as a historical, and indeed a historic, document. To alter its text would amount to tampering with the record, and would also make the whole controversy unintelligible. So what can be done? Can the fatwa be 'cancelled', as Mr Rushdie suggests? Technically not. In legal terms a fatwa is simply an opinion or ruling given by a learned authority. Only that authority could rescind it, and Khomeini is now dead. But different authorities can give different rulings and, especially in Shia Islam, it is admitted that the law needs constant reinterpretation to suit changing circumstances. Indeed, the Shia student is obliged to follow a living marja, or source of imitation. The trouble is that politically no living scholar's pronouncements are likely to carry anything like the same weight as Khomeini's. The Iranian government takes the line that this is a religious matter in which it cannot interfere. (That may be a less preposterous statement than it sounds: in a theocracy, government is subject to divine law. The reverse is not supposed to be true.) But Iran has exchanged pledges with the UK that neither will seek to interfere with each other's laws. On that basis Britain agreed to restore diplomatic relations in the autumn of 1990, but has yet to raise them to ambassadorial level. Both the British and Iranian governments say they would like to proceed to this step, but the UK has so far held back, mainly because it suspects that Iran has not fully abandoned its sponsorship of terrorism and assassination. Iran has denied involvement in the murder of the Japanese translator and attempted murder of the Italian translator of The Satanic Verses last July; but French and Swiss police found evidence that Iranian diplomats were involved in aiding and abetting the murder of Mr Shahpur Bakhtiar, a former Iranian prime minister, in France last August. Whether these actions were ordered personally by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani may be doubted. All the evidence suggests that he is genuinely anxious to improve relations with the west, or at least with Europe and Japan. But the record also shows that he was able to obtain the release of western hostages in Lebanon by Iranian-supported groups, once he was convinced that this was essential to the success of his policies. He should therefore be able also to impose the closing down of the Iranian death squads, especially if his supporters strengthen their position, as expected, in elections to the Iranian Majlis (parliament) in two months. Foreign governments - not only Britain - must keep telling him that this is essential if Iran is to be fully accepted as a member of the international community. Last Sunday's killing by the Israelis of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, one of Iran's more co-operative proteges in Lebanon, will hardly have made it easier to get that message across.</p>

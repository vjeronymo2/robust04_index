			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $6.4 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 8.17%, down from 8.50% last week. Another $6.4  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.99%,  down from 8.36% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills  sold for 8.14% on Dec. 19 and six-month bills averaged 7.87% on Nov. 14. The  new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.46% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,793.50 and 8.44% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,596.10. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value.  </P></p>

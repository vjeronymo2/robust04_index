			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Exports of toxic waste to be banned All exports of hazardous wastes from rich countries to poor ones will be outlawed from the end of 1997, the 64 members of the UN toxic waste convention decided yesterday. Exports of toxic waste destined for final disposal rather than recycling will be prohibited immediately. The ban was greeted with jubilation by environmental groups and developing countries which have waged a vigorous campaign to halt toxic waste dumping in the third world and, increasingly, in eastern Europe. Greenpeace hailed the decision, which was taken by consensus, as 'a striking victory for global environmental justice'. Mr Chris Lamb, who chaired the week-long conference of the parties to the Basle convention on transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, said the international community had taken 'an historic step'. The turning point came on Thursday when European Union ministers in Brussels decided to support the ban from end-1997. This brought into line two strong opponents of an outright prohibition, Britain and Germany, the world's biggest toxic waste exporter. Other dissenters, Australia, Canada and Japan, were then isolated. The United States, which also opposes a ban, is not a member of the convention and is not bound by yesterday's decision. A committee of the 1975 UN convention on international trade in endangered species (Cites) has decided not to recommend trade sanctions against China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, despite evidence that continued use of tiger bone and rhino horn for traditional medicines is bringing the protected species close to extinction.</p>

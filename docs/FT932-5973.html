			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / People: Barclays' high-flyer moves offshore Barclays has moved one of its young high-flyers into the growing private banking operation, making Catherine McDowell, previously head of investor relations, its first director specifically responsible for offshore banking. Based in the Mayfair headquarters of the private banking division, she joins its management board headed by Michael Tomalin, managing director. Private banking is increasingly in vogue with UK high street banks as a way of increasing income without tying up large amounts of capital. John Church, another director within the private bank, says that the offshore centres - including Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and Gibraltar - represent a 'very substantial part' of the division's overall operations. While traditionally strongest on the trust and fiduciary side, Barclays is now keen to offer an integrated service from banking through to investment management. McDowell has responsibilities for service and product development in addition to her geographic beat. Joining Barclays Bank International as a graduate trainee in 1978, McDowell, just 35, has gathered considerable experience around the group. In 1984 she moved to New York where she worked in the treasury division before being seconded to BZW Securities, also on Wall Street, marketing to US pension funds and other institutional investors. Since 1991 she has been head of investor relations, traditionally a job for the bank's fast-track executives. Her watch however has been a particularly challenging one - a period during which the bank has been hit by a series of bad loans and been the subject of intense scrutiny from its institutional shareholders over senior management succession.</p>

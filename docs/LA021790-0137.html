			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OILY 'MOUSSE' WASHES ASHORE NEAR TIDE POOLS  </P> <P> As an extensive effort to mop up the last of the 394,000-gallon oil spill was  being scaled back Friday afternoon, a light foam of oil began washing ashore  between Crystal Cove State Beach and Abalone Point.  </P> <P> The news sent local officials and about 40 cleanup workers scrambling to keep  the oil, which was spilled last week, from entering the tide pools that teem  with sea life along the rocky coastline.  </P> <P> "It looks like the consistency of chocolate mousse, only a little foamier,"  said Bob Scruggs of the Laguna Beach Fire Department, who is coordinating the  response for the South County beach cities. "It's really hard to clean out of  there with the tide action."  </P> <P> The effort ended a short time later, however, because, officials said, it was  too dark to continue working in that remote stretch of beach.  </P> <P> Cleanup work crews were reduced Friday to about 600 people throughout the  affected area, down from the more than 1,200 that had been working Thursday.  Only three skimmers remained to take oil off the ocean service, whereas there  had been dozens earlier in the week.  </P> <P> The oil, Alaskan crude, spilled from the tanker American Trader Feb. 7 after  the ship's own anchor gashed its hull in the waters off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Officials said, however, that they are keeping many cleanup workers on call  over the weekend because there is a threat of rain. An Alaskan cold front that  has been moving south this week is expected to arrive in the Southland, dumping  as much as an inch of rain on the area.  </P> <P> That would be bad news for those concerned about keeping the oil-tainted  seawater from leading to the environmentally sensitive Huntington Beach  wetlands. Environmentalists and cleanup workers have been keeping a watchful  eye on a temporary earthen dam built last week to keep the oily water from the  mouth of the Santa Ana River, which leads to the wetlands. Officials decided to  breach the dam to the Talbert Channel on Friday by lowering it four feet. This  was done, they said, because any storm water could cause flooding upstream. But  lowering the dam is a calculated risk to the wildlife on the other side of the  marshlands that the dam was designed to protect.  </P> <P> "It's a gamble," said Gordon Smith, director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands  Conservancy. "I'm concerned that if we have a really heavy storm, it will sweep  the berm away. It could wash out completely and leave us exposed to a  considerable amount of oil on the rocks."  </P> <P> The spill has so far affected 14 miles of beach and forced closures of the  entrances to the Newport and Huntington harbors in Orange County and the Long  Beach Marina in Los Angeles County. Officials say some of the beaches along  that 14-mile stretch will not reopen to the public until next month at the  earliest.  </P> <P> "Right now, all we've been able to say is they'll be open March 7," Huntington  Beach lifeguard Steve Reuter said. "Seal Beach is open, so if you want to surf,  go to Seal Beach."  </P> <P> Newport Beach Fire Department Capt. Ray Pendleton said, "If we allowed people  back on the beaches, we'd have a problem with them trampling the oil into the  sand."  </P> <P> Pendleton also said visitors would be in the way of cleanup equipment still on  the sands. "We don't want to get someone run over by any of these front  loaders."  </P> <P> Coast Guard officials flew over the area several times Friday to survey the  damage. They saw a light sheen extending from Huntington Beach to Reef Point  near Corona del Mar, they said. The slick was concentrated in an area about two  miles south of Huntington Beach, although fingers of oil spread out from that  spot.  </P> <P> Of the three skimmers, one was working off Reef Point and two others were  moving between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "It's real light," Coast Guard Petty Officer Carolyn Feldman said of the oil.  "They're just trying to pick up what they can."  </P> <P> The sheen indicates a very light transparent oil, officials said. Such a light  layer is difficult for the skimmers to pick up.  </P> <P> Officials also said that "extra-light oil" is still washing up on Bolsa Chica  State Beach and that there continues to be "light contamination" from the Santa  Ana River in Huntington Beach to 55th Street in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Feldman said her office has received dozens of calls asking whether the cruise,  whale-watching and fishing boats still inside the booms would be allowed to go  out during the weekend, she said. The answer, so far, is no. However, the  entrances to the Alamitos Bay and the San Gabriel River between Seal Beach and  Long Beach were reopened Thursday.  </P> <P> Feldman advised that boaters listen to radio reports on Marine Channel 22 for  updated information.  </P> <P> Although the cleanup crews have been scaled back, Huntington Beach Mayor Tom  Mays said at a press briefing Friday morning that "this disaster is far from  over." He predicted there will be several more weeks of cleanup work.  </P> <P> At the briefing with Mays was State Controller Gray Davis, who called on Gov.  George Deukmejian to declare a disaster. The governor said earlier in the week  that private efforts have been so successful in cleaning up the spill that  there is no need to declare a disaster.  </P> <P> "I cannot believe he has not shown the interest or the compassion or the  humanity to drive 15 minutes down here from his home in Long Beach to see the  situation," Davis said.  </P> <P> Tony Kozlowski, a spokesman for British Petroleum, whose oil the tanker was  carrying, said the remaining work crews are concentrating their efforts along  the shores of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Kozlowski said there were 270 crew members working in Newport Beach, 90 in the  area between the Santa Ana River and Newland Street in Huntington Beach, 35 at  the mouth of the Santa Ana River and 75 at Crystal Cove just south of  Huntington Beach. The remainder were scattered in other areas.  </P> <P> Kozlowski also said Friday that the cleanup has cost the company about $10  million so far.  </P> <P> Pete Weisser of the state Fish and Game Department said that 224 birds were  killed because of the spill but that 384 have been rescued.  </P> <P> Federal officials have been looking at the episode to determine whether  criminal charges should be filed. Coast Guard Cmdr. Scott Porter said Justice  Department representatives have been visiting the area all week to get updates  on the various investigations into the incident.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> WHEN IT COMES TO AIRLINE BUYOUTS, NEITHER BORROWER NOR LENDER BE  </P> <P> Talk about good luck. A year ago, people at United Airlines were getting ready  to slash their wrists because the $6.8-billion leveraged buyout of the company  had fallen apart. Today, they ought to be sending thank-you notes to the  Japanese bankers whose last-minute reluctance to lend blew the deal out of the  sky.  </P> <P> Because, you see, if the $300-a-share LBO had gone through, United would now be  choking on a combination of high interest payments and Saddam Hussein-inspired  fuel bills, the way that debt-ridden airlines such as Continental, Pan Am,  USAir, Eastern, Northwest, TWA, Midway, Hawaiian Airlines and America West are  doing.  </P> <P> Instead, United, like the country's two other major, relatively debt-free  airlines -- American and Delta -- can stand the strain of higher fuel bills  because its balance sheet is relatively debt-free. In fact, United has just  ordered new airplanes and is in a dogfight with American for the right to buy  choice European routes from debt-ridden Pan Am, which is once again selling  prime assets in an attempt to keep itself afloat.  </P> <P> The fact that United was lucky rather than smart is beside the point. If you  compare the United that is to the United that would have been, you begin to see  why, from the dawn of airline companies until junk bonds came briefly to rule  the earth, loan officers were taught to be very careful about lending money to  airlines.  </P> <P> The reason, when you think about it, is obvious. Airlines can be very  lucrative, but they're also very risky. There are expensive planes to buy,  unpredictable fuel costs to meet, fickle customers to lure. As Chairman Herbert  Kelleher of Southwest Airlines said in an issue of Forbes magazine earlier this  year, "You (can) go from spilling cash to bleeding red ink like the Mississippi  River going through the Delta."  </P> <P> Risks such as those are known as "operating leverage." Any time a company with  operating leverage borrows a lot of money, it's piling financial leverage onto  operating leverage. This doesn't merely add risk to risk; it multiplies them.  It's the financial equivalent of mixing drinking and driving.  </P> <P> But because shrewd and lucky financial operators such as Frank Lorenzo of Texas  Air Corp. (now Continental Airlines Holdings) seemed to be the wave of the  future, the old rule about not combining operating risk with financial risk  went out the window.  </P> <P> Any airline that wasn't loaded with debt was accused of not having done the  right thing by its shareholders. Analysts snickered at Delta for not being  daring enough. Marvin Davis, the California billionaire, raided United. Donald  J. Trump, then a real estate mogul, now a deadbeat, was threatening to raid  American.  </P> <P> Who's laughing now? Northwest Airlines, which went private in a leveraged  buyout that Chairman Alfred A. Checchi boasts is two years ahead of schedule in  repaying its debt, is talking about "major layoffs." Hawaiian, another LBO, is  on the brink of financial failure. TWA, hocked to the eyeballs by Carl C. Icahn  to buy out its shareholders and make huge payments to him, is choking. Braniff  has gone broke for the second time. USAir, which borrowed heavily to buy other  companies, is being squeezed, as are Midway and America West.  </P> <P> "We have proven that airlines are not candidates for LBOs," Pan Am Chairman  Thomas G. Plaskett told a group of travel agents earlier this month. "They  generate enough operating and financial leverage on their own, let alone adding  to the leverage to provide payouts to shareholders." Indeed.  </P> <P> Then there's our old friend Continental Airlines Holdings, formerly Texas Air.  The news leaked last week that Continental had considered going Chapter 11 but  decided not to do so. The disclosure that the company had thought of going  Chapter 11 may well end up forcing it into Chapter 11 because suppliers will  probably cut back on credit and travel agents may stop booking Continental  flights. They remember getting burned in 1983, when Texas Air put Continental  Airlines into bankruptcy, and again in 1989, when it was Eastern's turn to go  belly up.  </P> <P> Continental, which had $2.6 billion in debt and long-term leases on its books  as of June 30 -- not counting Eastern's multibillion-dollar debt -- said it is  thinking of selling its foreign routes to help buy its way out of trouble. The  problem is that Continental has pledged its foreign routes to the U.S. Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions. The agency  got Continental to pledge those assets to guarantee payment of the shortfall in  Eastern's pension plan, a gap that the agency puts at $565 million. Continental  is still on the hook for Eastern's pension plan, even though a bankruptcy judge  took control of Eastern away from Continental six months ago.  </P> <P> Continental's press relations people, as usual, wouldn't take my call. I didn't  even bother trying to find Lorenzo, whom I've called for more than 10 years but  who has never called me back.  </P> <P> But the Chapter 11 prospect makes Lorenzo's departure from Continental this  August look more than a little suspicious. Lorenzo, you recall, bailed out with  $27 million, thanks to a deal he cut with Scandinavian Airline Systems to sell  his Continental stock and stock options for about triple the market price.  That's continuing the pattern in which Lorenzo cut special deals with the  company that put millions of dollars in his pocket at the expense of other  shareholders.  </P> <P> Poor Frank. He said in August that he was leaving Continental to let SAS run it  unhindered. Yeah, right. At least when the Titanic sank, the captain had enough  class to go down with the ship.  </P> <P> Oops Department: Last week, in my Boston Celtics column, I wrote that master  limited partnerships will lose their tax breaks after 1997. I should have said  "most MLPs," because the post-1997 rule doesn't apply to real estate and  natural resource MLPs.  </P></p>

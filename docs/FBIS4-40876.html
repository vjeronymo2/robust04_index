			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 20, BNS -- The leader of the  Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, Vytautas  Landsbergis, is quite reserved in his estimations of Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius' proposal to set up an  international commission of experts to assess the possible  economic consequences of savings restoration.    At a press conference Monday, Landsbergis said there is  doubt  whether such a commission would be "objective and impartial."    The opposition leader, who also heads the Conservative  Party,  told reporters that the conservatives became cautious after a  meeting in early July with Peter Cornelius, representative of  the IMF in Lithuania. The IMF official expressed his negative  attitude toward the Conservative Party's initiative to hold a  referendum on unlawful privatization and savings restoration,  and warned that consequences of an indexation would be ruinous  to the Lithuanian financial system.    The conservatives, who suggest a hundredfold indexation of  people's savings, said Cornelius expressed "strange views" about  their initiative and Lithuania's economic policy in general. In  a letter sent to the IMF leadership, the Conservative Party  asked to explain whether Cornelius expressed his personal  attitude or the official position of the fund.    In Landsbergis' words, the IMF representative expressed his  opinion before he heard both sides. "We were under the  impression that Cornelius is not an independent expert, or  dependent on the Lithuanian Government," the opposition leader  said. In his view, the government uses representatives of  international organization "for internal struggle."    The Lithuanian parliament is scheduled to discuss the  premier's initiative Tuesday. Parliament Chairman Ceslovas  Jursenas said the proposal is "attractive" because "people must  understand what is suggested for the referendum."    Landsbergis said he hopes that an international commission,  if it is set up, will be able to analyze the general situation  in Lithuania more carefully, and the opposition will have an  opportunity "to explain some things about the government's  policy."</p>

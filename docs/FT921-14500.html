			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Executive Life taxation claim settled at Dollars 73m A SETTLEMENT has been reached between the US Internal Revenue Service and Executive Life of California (ELIC), the ailing Los Angeles-based insurer, the Californian Insurance Department announced yesterday, writes Nikki Tait. A Dollars 643m tax claim against ELIC had threatened to jeopardise attempts to rehabilitate the life insurer, which was seized by state insurance regulators in April after a policyholder run. Yesterday, however, the insurance department said that the claim had been settled for Dollars 73m. Late last year, the insurance department struck a deal with a French consortium, led by Credit Lyonnais and its Altus Finance subsidiary, over ELIC's future. Essentially, Altus would acquire ELIC's junk bond portfolio, while a group of French investors would take over the restructured insurance liabilities. Since then, two major matters - the tax claim and a dispute over how holders of ELIC's municipal guaranteed investment contracts should be treated in this reorganisation - have required resolution.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Supply chain in need of wholesale reform - The emerging consumer markets of central Europe have provided challenges and surprises for western companies Cuban cigars at Pounds 10 a box of 25, chocolate bars from Lesotho, imported Marlboro cigarettes 30 per cent more expensive than local ones . . . the shops and crowded street markets of Poland often seem to obey the random economics of an Arab souk. In Hungary, retailing is more orderly but still has its surprises. 'You name it, Indian toothpaste, obscure Brazilian brands - you can buy almost anything,' says Andre Mico of Unilever. In both countries erratic deliveries mean that many products - particularly imported ones - come and go from the shelves without warning. Western expatriate shoppers quickly learn to buy their favourite items in bulk and store them at home. For western companies seeking to do business in central Europe, the bewildering disorganisation of the region's distribution trade is one of the biggest and most frustrating obstacles. In Poland, officials say liberalisation has trebled the amount of retailing space in the past three years. Ashley Summerfield of the Central Europe Trust, a London-based consultancy, reckons that 110,000 new outlets have sprung up, half of them pavement kiosks. However, the government's failure to liberalise the property market has led to soaring shop rentals. These have increased more than 30-fold in central Warsaw, pushing many small retailers to the brink of bankruptcy. Marc Pol, a three-year-old Polish company, has set up more than 50 supermarkets and cash-and-carry stores. However, Marek Mikuskiewicz, Marc Pol's president, admits that he now faces a shortage of capital and growing cash flow problems. Though retailing reform in Hungary has been less sweeping, the sector was better placed to start with, thanks to the greater tolerance of its former communist rulers. Department stores and supermarkets are relatively common. Czemene, one of the largest chains, has been acquired by Julius Meinl, an Austrian retailer, which is renovating the stores and training staff in western techniques. But an executive of a large western consumer products company operating in Hungary, while applauding Meinl's efforts, says results will take time: 'We find we can negotiate with Meinl at the top, but on the ground things don't work very well'. Wholesaling in both countries is also haphazard. Once dominated by state-owned monopolies, it has been thrown open to private competitors. Many are individuals whose only asset is a truck and who cannot guarantee delivery of products to their destination. Determining trade creditworthiness is difficult for western suppliers, many of whom insist on payment in cash. Many western companies use their own newly-created sales teams to deliver products to larger stores. Another obstacle to controlling the supply chain is the flow of illegal imports, which higher duties and tariffs have manifestly failed to check. As well as threatening western suppliers' efforts to establish orderly distribution, 'grey' imports play havoc with pricing policies. Andrzej Szwarc of DMS reckons that at least a quarter of all Mars bars sold in Poland are smuggled in. Though devaluations have increased their cost, Mars has had to reduce the retail price in the past year to avoid being undercut by unauthorised imports. DMS is also trying to build retailer loyalty by working closely with larger outlets to improve standards of display, stock control and customer service. Many other suppliers of western products are adopting similar tactics. By building such relationships, they believe they are making worthwhile investments. But even the most optimistic concede that it may be some time before those investments really pay off.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear citizens: We will broadcast the report on the  al- Sulaymaniyah massacres, adding the latest information on the  shooting of defenseless civilians by the forces of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan [PUK] on Monday, 13 June, during a peaceful  procession to lay to rest the body of martyr 'Uthman Qadir  Munawwar, member of the working committee of the fourth branch  of our party, [Kurdistan Democratic Party] and the commander of  the al- Sulaymaniyah region in the Ministry of the Peshmergas  Affairs.    We have received additional information that the number of  demonstrators reached into the hundreds of thousands, raising  slogans praising our party and reiterating the genuineness of  this Kurdish city. Many of the girls and women of  al-Sulaymaniyah, who were leading the peaceful procession, were  martyred, and hundreds, including a large number of women, were  wounded.    Yesterday, the PUK continued to chase and arrest the  citizens  who took part in the procession or those suspected of being  loyal to our party. The most serious issue is that the life of  those under arrest is in danger. We now appeal to the friends  of our people, world public opinion, the United Nations, the  Kurdistan Front forces, the Iraqi opposition, and personalities  to intervene swiftly to save the lives of the thousands under  arrest, to release them immediately, and to respect the  processions during which at least 51 martyrs will be laid to  rest.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Creditor banks block KIO's debts move THE Kuwait Investment Office's attempt to extricate itself from its large and haemorrhaging property interests in Spain has met with a blanket refusal from creditor banks to accept a debt-for-equity swap. This development has brought Prima Inmobiliaria, a KIO-controlled property company, close to bankruptcy in what would be the second crash of a KIO Spanish asset in less than three months. In July Ercros, KIO's big Spanish chemicals group, went into receivership owing more than Pta200bn (Dollars 2bn). The KIO faces an additional problem with Prima, which has debts of Pta57bn. At issue is the extent of KIO's holding in the property company and this dispute brings to the forefront a row between the present and former managers of KIO and its Spanish investment arm, Grupo Torras. Grupo Torras acknowledges that a 32.45 per cent holding in Prima is contested by the banks which claim its actual equity could be in excess of 60 per cent. This higher figure takes into account the stakes in Prima of the two men who masterminded the growth of Grupo Torras - Mr Fouad Jaffar, KIO general manager until 1990 and Spanish financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, who severed his connections with KIO earlier this year. Grupo Torras says it is not responsible for such shareholdings while the banks claim they were all brought together at the time the loans were made to Prima. Grupo Torras' new management is investigating the business dealings of Mr Fouad, Mr de la Rosa and their associates in the KIO's investment drive into Spain. The Italian financier Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of the Saffa paper group which owns 5.77 per cent of Prima, resigned from Prima's board last week alleging that Grupo Torras's shareholding in the property company was greater than had been publicly stated.</p>

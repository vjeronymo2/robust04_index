			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Bank of Tokyo fears Beijing's wrath THE Bank of Tokyo is embarrassed by its success in winning Taiwanese government approval to open a branch in Taipei, because the bank fears that the announcement may offend a Chinese government still sensitive about dealings with the 'rebel province'. Japanese financial institutions attempt to be discreet in their dealings with Taiwanese authorities, while the Taiwanese, conscious of their competition with Beijing, are keen to boast about broader ties with the international financial community. The Bank of Tokyo yesterday refused to confirm that its representative office would be upgraded to branch status, saying only that 'the authorities in Taipei have made an announcement' and suggesting that the approval process was not yet complete. The most important part of that approval process is securing the necessary nod from Beijing, which punished the Bank of Tokyo in 1990 when it announced plans to open a Taipei representative office. A financial joint venture planned by the bank in Shanghai was delayed, and the Chinese government suggested that it would be denied other opportunities in the mainland market. Japan's foreign ministry has encouraged financial and non-financial companies to expand to Taiwan, and called in Chinese diplomats in 1990 to complain against the action taken against the Bank of Tokyo. The matter was also raised at ministerial meetings, and Beijing eventually forgave the bank. But the bank is still wary of irritating the Chinese government, which is concerned that Taiwan is on a course to independence from the mainalnd. Japanese officials counter these concerns by arguing that the Bank of Tokyo and other financial institutions act as 'a bridge' between Taipei and Beijing. The Japanese government is also encouraging newspapers to open offices in Taiwan. Only one group, Sankei, has a resident correspondent, and Chinese officials have warned off other newsapapers. The Taiwanese foreign minister is due shortly in Japan, the first such visit since the two sides cut diplomatic ties in 1972, Reuter adds from Tokyo.</p>

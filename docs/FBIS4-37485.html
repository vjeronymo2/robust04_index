			<p>BFN     [Text] Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, the person in charge  of economic affairs in the autonomy, said upon arriving in  Jericho that he is opposed to the economic agreement signed with  Israel since, in his opinion, this entire agreement works in  Israel's favor and lacks the basic conditions for the  realization of the Palestinians' rights. Our correspondent Moti  Amir reports that in a talk with correspondents al-Nashashibi  said he would base the Palestinian budget and daily expenditures  on the collection of taxes. In a few days he intends to  establish the nucleus for the Palestinian Finance Ministry in  Jericho, and later he will recruit employees and experts who  will work in this ministry's offices in Jericho and the Gaza  Strip.    Our correspondent adds that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat leveled harsh  criticism at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers in the Jericho  area, saying the IDF still behaves like an occupying Army,  blocking the town and barring tourists from entering, although  it is clear that tourism is an important economic branch for the  regional residents. According to 'Urayqat, one of the IDF  officers said at the joint security committee that Jericho can  be reoccupied within five minutes, and such a statement only  proves the Israeli Army's aggressiveness.</p>

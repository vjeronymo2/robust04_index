			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Telecom NZ warns price war would hit earnings TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand (Telecom NZ) yesterday said a continuing price war with its rival, Clear Communications, could hit future earnings, Reuter reports from Wellington. 'If competition for toll market share continues principally on the basis of price, this may have an adverse effect upon future net earnings, in which case the provision in the Kiwi Share enables the company to increase residential prices at a faster rate,' it said. The Kiwi Share commits Telecom NZ to maintaining free local calling and limits how much it can hike prices. Telecom said the extent and timing of any increases to domestic calling rates and the effect on earnings remained uncertain. Analysts believe that newcomer Clear grabbed 10 per cent of the long-distance phone market in 1991-92, mainly on the basis of price. They estimate Telecom NZ has lowered prices by 10 to 15 per cent since March 31 to match Clear's prices. Telecom NZ said long-distance revenue fell 2 per cent in the last quarter of the 1991-92 year as a result of lost market share and reduced prices. Telecom NZ expects long-distance and international calling revenue to decline in 1993. It said it sees Clear shifting its competition from price to quality in the second phase of its attack on Telecom.</p>

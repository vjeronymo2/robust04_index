			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Zornichenko, leading economist of the city </F> statistics department: "What We Breathe: Tomorrow Is World  Environmental Protection Day"]    [Text] Environment today needs protection more then ever.    The large quantity of pollutants discharged into the  atmosphere is one of the factors causing a drop in the birth  rate and an increase in the mortality rate. In 1993 the number  of births in Vladivostok declined by 13 percent as compared to  1992. In the same year, one and a half times more people died  than were born.    Vladivostok enterprises discharged into the atmosphere  691,000 tonnes of pollutants. Of them, 626,000 tonnes were  intercepted by scrubbers and neutralized.    While in 1992 an average of 169 tonnes of pollutants were  discharged daily, this year the amount increased to 176 tonnes.    The greatest culprits in atmospheric pollution are such  major  industrial enterprises as AO [joint-stock society] Dalzavod,  Vladivostok central heat and power station No. 2,  heat-distribution networks, the oil warehouse, and the maritime  fishing port. Many of them, in addition to dust, "present" the  atmosphere with ammonia, hydrocarbons, and a score of other  hazardous substances.    Over the year, 253 tonnes of soot, 1,239 tonnes of dust and  inorganic compounds, and four tonnes of hydrogen sulfide are  discharged into the atmosphere.    The high level of discharge of hazardous substances--3,000  tonnes--is produced by means of transportation and  transportation and road complex enterprises.    The ecological policy should be one of priorities for the  state. People's health depends on it.</p>

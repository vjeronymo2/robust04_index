			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Israelis seal Gaza Strip Israel yesterday said it would seal off the occupied Gaza Strip, after a knife-wielding Palestinian killed two Israelis and wounded eight others in Tel Aviv, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the closure, which was to begin at 0100 GMT today and would affect over 100,000 Palestinians who enter Israel daily, would last only a few days.</p>

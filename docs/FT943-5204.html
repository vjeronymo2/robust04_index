			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (2): Liberalisation is in full swing - Trevor Petch examines the new growth markets in Europe, Asia and Latin America In recent months liberalisation of the insurance industry throughout the world has reached a speed which only the most optimistic would have predicted at the beginning of the 1990s. Steady progress towards the single market in western Europe, finally completed on July 1 this year, has been paralleled by the creation of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) linking the US, Canada and Mexico, and in South America by the Mercosur Common Market between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The opening of the markets of eastern and central Europe followed naturally from the collapse of the centrally-planned economy. Although most states have retained a measure of control over foreign involvement in insurance and reinsurance, it is anticipated in most cases that this will disappear by the end of the decade. With the exception of the Baltic states, these restrictions are generally tightest in the former USSR. Earlier this year, important progress was made when both Russia and Ukraine, as part of wide-ranging economic co-operation agreements with the European Union, agreed to liberalise access for EU insurers by spring 1999. In Asia, the impetus for more open markets was the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The General Agreement on Services (GATS) was eventually agreed at the end of last year. Insurance is one of a number of problematic areas dealt with by complex annexes agreed in a last minute compromise. One effect of these was to create a period of two years during which the US in particular will remain free to try to use bilateral pressure to force access to insurance markets it considers closed. Insurance is one of the three areas it has chosen to include in negotiations with Japan. A number of governments which have traditionally favoured purely national insurance markets have recognised that, in the medium-term, open markets are inevitable. This year, Taiwan has permitted investment in insurance by non-US insurers (US companies were already able to operate), and measures of demonopolisation and denationalisation are under way or under active discussion throughout the Indian subcontinent. Most major international insurers are opening offices in China in preparation for the expected opportunities there, and a number have also set up in Vietnam. The growth potential for primary insurance is perhaps most obviously apparent in the Communist and former Communist countries in economic transition. Property and liability risks for which there was no perceived need for cover are now being insured, and privatisation creates its own additional requirements, especially in commercial lines. Last month an important breakthrough was made when American Re announced that it had successfully placed a Dollars 500m (Pounds 750m) property cover for Russia's largest truck-maker KamAZ with leading international reinsurers and Russian insurers. Last year KamAZ lost its western-equipped engine plant in fire which cost in the region of Dollars 375m and was completely uninsured. Another particular area of growth, in which the role of reinsurers has been central, is motor and health lines related to foreign travel. Growth in any insurance market will also follow general economic growth, and this is the major factor in the Indian subcontinent. In some ASEAN member countries, growth by medium-sized industrial companies is particularly strong. International investors are once again turning their attention to Latin America after the 'lost decade' of the 1980s, and as in the more developed industrialising markets of Asia, the traditional progression from domination of insurance market volume by commercial lines to a greater incidence of personal property and life and savings business is to be expected. In most of the major markets of Latin America, the pension and private health sectors are also major areas of expansion as the role of the state decreases. In all areas, however, while Munich Re is 'prudently optimistic' about the potential for growth of insurance and reinsurance business, it is careful to emphasise that it is much more circumspect in its analysis of the prospective results. In the ASEAN countries, for example, the reinsurance market is already very competitive, and margins are 'quite low, to say the least,' the company says. Catastrophes are another worry, especially in areas where there is risk both from windstorms and earthquake. Last year Cologne Re announced that it planned to cease providing catastrophe cover in Latin America on a proportional basis. Munich Re began to require clients to take more active measures to control aggregate catastrophe exposure, and expressed particular concern over adequate pricing of the earthquake element of property covers. The same concerns apply in much of Asia. For reinsurers rather than primary insurers, a longer-term concern is that the economic growth which increases personal wealth and insurance demand brings with it a marked increase in aggregate exposure in the event of a catastrophe. Property previously uninsured becomes insured, and the amount available to be insured increases both in terms of volume and of value. There is also the danger of 'Florida syndrome' as residential buildings become both more concentrated and sited in ever more unsuitable locations from a meteorological point of view. As one reinsurer points out, a significant proportion of any major catastrophe loss is a large number of householder claims of relative low average value, a value which tends to increase the worse the catastrophe is because of the upward pressure on repair costs. The lesson of this year's Northridge earthquake in the US was to demonstrate that a 'number of extremely well-run insurance companies mis-evaluated their exposure', he says. Nor does deregulation bring automatic benefits to reinsurers. In countries such as Chile, Colombia and Mexico, deregulation was at first accompanied by a sharp increase in competition and a decline in original premium rates. In markets which have been protected by a domestic reinsurance monopoly and regulated tariffs, the level of underwriting expertise is often low, while fear of competition can delay correction in rates even when results deteriorate. Nor does the volume of reinsurance premium itself automatically increase with liberalisation. If there is market concentration or significant local investment by large multinational insurers, retentions may increase significantly. In Argentina, for example, in 1989 reinsurance represented 28.7 per cent of total direct premium. The monopoly reinsurer INdeR was closed in 1991, and premium ceded is now around 13 per cent.

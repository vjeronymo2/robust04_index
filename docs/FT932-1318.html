			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Technology: Closer to the paperless office - Software that can store exact copies of documents Adobe Systems, the California-based software house whose Postscript font technology played a crucial role in the desktop publishing revolution, this week launched software that promises to be good news both for finance directors and for the world's endangered forests. Called Acrobat, the software is designed to make it possible to distribute documents of all kinds across different computer systems. Nothing too remarkable about that, you might think, but it has not been done before and it brings closer the prospect of the 'paperless office'. The important feature of Acrobat is that documents are received exactly as transmitted. Fonts are accurately transcribed, full-colour photographs reproduced exactly as in the original, diagrams rendered precisely as drawn. According to John Warnock, the mathematician and computer engineer who co-founded Adobe, the new software opens the prospect of companies' using electronic storage and dissemination, rather than paper, for company documents of all kinds. Large companies that, for example, distribute corporate handbooks could save the cost of buying Acrobat simply by storing the handbook on an optical disk to be accessed by staff through their workstations. 'Paper,' Warnock says, 'imposes an artificially short lifespan on information.' Acrobat is currently available for Apple Macintosh and personal computers using MS/DOS Windows but MS/DOS and Unix versions are expected to be available in late 1993. Adobe's special skill lies in mathematics and in the use of mathematical equations to describe exactly what a computer screen should show or a computer printer should print. The contents of a document are, after all, a collection of straight lines and curves all of which can be represented by equations. Essentially, Acrobat is a translation device, a collection of software that receives information about the way a page of a document should look and formats it for the specific computer or printer on which it is to be displayed or printed. Acrobat is not designed so that several users can work on a document at the same time like, say, Lotus Notes. It is a product for storage and transmission. And the data compression it allows is striking. According to Warnock, up to 100,000 pages of text can be stored on a single compact disk. The key to Acrobat's antics is a special file format called Portable Document Format. According to Adobe, it can describe a document of any length, containing any combination of text, graphics and images in a format independent of device and resolution. PDF uses Adobe's Postscript language to describe not only the elements of the document to be viewed or printed but also annotations, miniature views of pages and 'hypertext' links through which the reader can explore further information about a topic. The Acrobat product line comprises three products: Acrobat Reader, which enables customers to view information; Acrobat Exchange, for customers creating or exchanging documents; and Acrobat Distiller, which translates Postscript files into PDF format. Acrobat, obviously, does not work alone. Each workstation has to have its own version of the software. Acrobat Reader is priced, Adobe says, so that large companies can afford multiple copies. In volumes of 50 copies it costs Pounds 36 a copy while in volumes of 500 copies, the price drops to Pounds 25 a copy. Adobe's potential competitors in this new field include Microsoft, Apple Computers, Interleaf, Frame, No Hands and EBT, all of whom are working on similar software. Among Adobe's test sites in the US were the financial services companies Aetna Life and Liberty Mutual. RR Donnelley &amp; Sons, the world's largest commercial printer, has signed a letter of intent to license the software.</p>

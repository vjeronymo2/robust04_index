			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDELLIN CARTEL OFFERED NEW CONCESSIONS TO SURRENDER;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA: GOVERNMENT PROMISES DRUG TRAFFICKERS NO EXTRADITION TO U.S. IN RETURN  FOR CONFESSIONS TO AT LEAST ONE CRIME EACH.  </P> <P> The Colombian government granted Medellin drug cartel members new legal  guarantees Monday in yet another concession to try to persuade them to turn  themselves in.  </P> <P> But the administration of President Cesar Gaviria tried to answer critics'  charges that it is caving in to traffickers by rejecting the cartel's main  condition for such a mass surrender.  </P> <P> Medellin traffickers have denounced as unconstitutional a government  requirement that surrendering suspects confess to at least one crime in order  to receive lenient treatment. The government refused to drop the demand, saying  confessions are necessary to ensure that the drug traffickers are jailed.  </P> <P> "The foundation of this process is (traffickers) submitting themselves to  Colombian justice," said Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel in a Monday press  conference. "On this point the government has not budged one millimeter."  </P> <P> Giraldo was responding to strong criticism of the government's policy by  foreign officials as well as some local press commentators and politicians. The  critics say that the Gaviria administration is repeatedly changing the law  according to the cartel's wishes.  </P> <P> An earlier government decree, issued Sept. 5, promised no extradition to the  United States and reduced prison sentences for traffickers who confess their  crimes. A subsequent statement from the Extraditables, as cartel members call  themselves, demanded that the government further clarify its promise.  </P> <P> Giraldo said the new decree gives those who confess even one crime an "absolute  guarantee" of no extradition -- a major demand of the cartel, whose members  greatly fear being prosecuted in U.S. courts.  </P> <P> The cartel statement also said the government should protect the human rights  of its members by housing them in special compounds guarded by either the army  or human rights groups. The cartel members have long sought to be treated in a  category separate from common criminals.  </P> <P> The government's latest decree seems to meet that demand. It stipulates that  the attorney general's human rights office must delegate an agent to oversee  each drug suspect's surrender and trial. The decree also says that suspected  traffickers and terrorists will be housed in special jails -- guarded by the  army to prevent attacks from "outside source" -- currently being prepared in  several cities.  </P> <P> The new decree states that suspects will serve no more than 30 years in prison  no matter how many crimes they have committed. It maintains reduced sentences  for traffickers who cooperate with authorities.  </P> <P> According to the plan, Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel leader accused of  killing hundreds of people, could spend as few as 15 years in prison, Giraldo  said. But he stressed that Escobar and others will either accept the decree and  serve a significant sentence in Colombia or be captured and extradited.  </P> <P> Giraldo's statement is unlikely to reassure those foreign and Colombian  officials who view the government's offer of lenient treatment as mistaken, if  not disastrous. They say Gaviria should never have shown traffickers any  flexibility.  </P> <P> "Every time the government makes a change in the law, the drug traffickers make  new demands," Carlos Lemos Simmonds, a member of the president's Liberal Party  and a former interior minister, said in a recent interview. "This process is  not likely to end until the drug traffickers receive something approaching full  amnesty."  </P> <P> An international law enforcement official said Gaviria was making "a horrible  mistake" by believing the promises of the Medellin cartel. He noted that  traffickers had courted the government with a pledge to turn in their cocaine  laboratories. But a recent report from Interpol, an international police  agency, states that the cartel has moved a significant amount of its operations  into neighboring countries including Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia.  </P> <P> "What the drug traffickers will turn over here will be the leftover garbage,"  said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Colombia's police force, the official adds, has not eased its efforts to rid  the country of drug traffickers and their operations. "But everyone is  discouraged because after so many sacrifices, the government is now ready to  cut a deal (with the cartel)," he said.  </P> <P> Escobar and other cartel leaders are accused of masterminding a terrorist  campaign that killed hundreds of Colombians, including 250 police officers in  1989 and early this year.  </P></p>

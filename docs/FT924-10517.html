			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: San Miguel registers rise in sales and income SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, yesterday reported consolidated net profits of 2.16bn pesos (Dollars 98.1m), on net sales of 42.4bn pesos, for the first nine months of the year. Net income rose 6 per cent from the comparable period last year, while sales grew by 10 per cent. The increase in net profit was faster than the 3 per cent recorded in the first six months. The company said third-quarter profits were up 17 per cent from the year before due to streamlining measures in operations, 'more effective control' of costs, and 'higher efficiencies' from the group's expansion and modernisation programme. As well as beer production San Miguel produces and markets various beverages, food and dairy products and has a newly established subsidiary in property development. Volume sales of beer, still the group's flagship product, and of 'many other products' declined in the third quarter due to 'the continued weakness of the economy'.</p>

He was walking with  his white girlfriend in the mostly white neighborhood when a truck driver  yelled at him, provoking three white pedestrians to join in with racial slurs  and chase him, police said.  </P> <P> The incident resembled one in Howard Beach in which a mob of whites chased a  black man to his death on a busy highway.  </P></p>

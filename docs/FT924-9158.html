			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots CBI attacks A1 upgrading THE upgrading of the A1 road between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh to dual carriageway throughout its length would be a 'white elephant', the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland said yesterday. Mr David MacLehose, director of the CBI in Scotland, told the Commons Scottish affairs committee in Edinburgh that upgrading the 122-mile stretch of the A1 'would yield minimum or negative returns on investment'. So far only 31 of the 122 miles have been turned into dual carriageway. The CBI was lukewarm because most Scottish exported goods originated in the west of Scotland and used the A74/M74 from Glasgow to reach England including east coast ports such as Hull. Mr MacleHose said it was vital that the Scottish Office, responsible for roads in Scotland, completed the project to upgrade the whole A74/M74 to motorway standard as soon as possible. In March, just before the general election, the government announced that it would be 'desirable' for the 91 miles of single carriageway on the A1 between Newcastle and Edinburgh to be improved to dual carriageway. Previously the Scottish Office had argued that traffic did not justify total dualling. There is as yet no project to make the entire road dual carriageway. Work on a number of other improvements is going ahead. Mr George Kynoch, Conservative MP for Kincardine and Deeside, suggested that it was desirable to spread the traffic load and double the number of routes available to goods traffic. But Mr MacLehose told him that CBI Scotland saw the priority elsewhere. 'It doesn't mean that we wouldn't like to see it go ahead at some stage.'</p>

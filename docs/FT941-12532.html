			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hardy optimist banks on obscure fortunes of jute - The worldwide development plans of Titaghur in India and Scotland Jute has been a sunset industry for 100 years, according to one industry observer. But the chairman of the only UK company still operating mills in India is confident that he can buck the trend. While observers generally dismiss most ideas for new markets for jute as pie in the sky, Mr Reg Brealey, chairman of Titaghur, says that the material, best known for its use as sacking and carpet backing, has a bright future as an environmentally friendly material. On Monday he will outline his plans to shareholders in London at the 110th annual meeting of the company, which has its origins in Dundee, once known as Jute City. He has other ideas for taking Titaghur forward, including a scheme to train disadvantaged youngsters at a newly acquired remote estate in the Scottish highlands and at his Calcutta jute mills. He also plans to build the biggest stock of jute goods in the world in Scotland. But current needs, let alone these plans, urgently require fresh capital. The company is trying to sell Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) of bonds and get a US stock listing following its drumming out of the London Stock Exchange four years ago. Controversy and bold schemes are not new to Mr Brealey, who is also chairman of Sheffield United football club. After his arrival at Titaghur in 1988 the shares soared spectacularly, becoming share of the year that year and peaking at Pounds 16.88 in 1989. However, the following year the Stock Exchange cancelled the quote on the grounds that the company's heavily qualified accounts meant there was inadequate financial information. Mr Brealey also became the first person in the UK to face charges of insider dealing. At the trial the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence on the charges, which related to Titaghur shares. The judge ordered the CPS to pay defence costs estimated at Pounds 500,000, and described the 'catalogue of omissions' in the case as 'so appalling as almost to be considered scandalous'. The following year the Court of Appeal rejected a shareholder's attempt to refer the Exchange's delisting procedure to the European Court of Justice. Meanwhile, Mr Brealey, whose 29.9 per cent stake in the company cost Pounds 2.5m, had little option but to work through its numerous problems. The turbulence of the jute industry is reflected in the company accounts, which now show an accumulated deficit of Pounds 61m after a loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 4.3m in the year to end-March 1993, the latest figures available. The shares have been trading recently on a matched bargain basis at 25p. In his statement in the 1992-93 annual report, Mr Brealey blames the latest loss on shortage of raw materials, which led to labour unrest and temporary closure of two of the company's six mills. In the past 12 months Mr Brealey has made three visits to Calcutta and now claims to be well on the way to solving the labour problems. For the first time a team of 10 UK managers is in place in Calcutta. The workforce has already been reduced from 18,000 to 16,000. More importantly, according to Mr Brealey, the company has an agreement with its unions to reduce the number of workers employed for the manufacture of each tonne of jute. Further reforms of shift systems are expected. Full production at the mills would yield 2,500 tonnes a week of finished jute product. At that level Brealey's mills would have 10 per cent of Indian jute goods production. However, the mills are by no means running smoothly. The Victoria has been closed for the past six weeks while the new managers continue union negotiations. None of the others are working at full capacity, partly reflecting the continuing shortage of raw jute. There are 61 jute mills in Calcutta. While a large number have changed hands recently, it is impossible to uncover what price they have fetched. Many are closed at any one time, and some produce only 15 to 20 tonnes a week. The industry remains troubled, with the mills this week making desperate attempts to organise imports of raw jute from any possible source. Raw jute prices have almost doubled since last September, with standard grade jute now at Dollars 325 a tonne. Titaghur needs cash badly. Mr Brealey will not reveal with whom he is holding negotiations over the Dollars 50m bond, but claims that a successful conclusion would transform the company's balance sheet, giving shareholders' funds of Pounds 74m, compared with Pounds 58m at March 31 last year. The group's main assets are the jute mills in Calcutta, operating with Victorian machinery. The notes to the accounts show the land, buildings and plant at Pounds 76.4m, as valued by the Indian government authorities. Part of the bond, which would be secured on properties and stock, would be used to buy raw jute, and part to finance a 25,000-tonne stock of finished product in Scotland. Mr Brealey believes that if he can bring finished product to the UK for sale into Europe he will realise enhanced profits. He is planning to hold the stock in new warehouse facilities so that carpet makers can forward buy and fix their costs. To put this in perspective, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations put 1992 UK imports of jute goods at 38,500 tonnes, while EU imports were 277,300 tonnes. 'Jute has to be the backbone of the company because that's what it is,' says Mr Brealey. But he has further plans for the group, and has made two important acquisitions since March last year. The most controversial has been the purchase of the 16,500-acre estate on Knoydart Peninsula, one of the most remote parts of Scotland. About Pounds 2.5m has been invested so far in a project to train young people who have been in care. It will be run by a retired army colonel and has been described as National Service for civilians. A sojourn at the jute mills in Calcutta will be an integral and character-building part of the course. 'Youngsters will see how people earn their living and change their attitudes,' he says. The purchase of the estate is also aimed at establishing assets in Britain. To this end he has also purchased, through the issue of 2m shares, West Midland Surfacing, a road surfacing group with an annual turnover of about Pounds 6m. The group is also moving into the bio-technology market, although details have yet to emerge. Mr Brealey promises some eye-opening presentations at the annual meeting of biotechnological projects, at least one of which will use jute products. Mr Brealey, who says he has drawn only expenses from Titaghur since 1988, describes the task of sorting out the company as Herculean. But he points out that he holds 29.9 per cent of the stock. 'It's in my interests to look after it.' However, it has been difficult to make good profits in the Calcutta jute industry for the past 20 years. Of all the mills in India, totalling about 70, only 12 are now thought to be making reasonable returns. As one industry observer said: 'It would need a very clever man to go from Europe and make money from jute.' Additional reporting: Kunal Bose in Calcutta</p>

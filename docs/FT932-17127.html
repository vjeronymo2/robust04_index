			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Bank publishes guide to gilts IN THE latest move to ease the pressure of funding the government's heavy borrowing requirement for the next financial year, the Bank of England yesterday for the first time published a free guide for private investors on investing in government stock, or gilts. The guide explains how private investors can buy and sell gilts. With a forecast public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, the Bank is looking at several ways of making gilts more attractive to as wide a range of investors as possible. It expects to publish a guide to the gilts market aimed at foreign investors shortly. Private investors have shown considerable interest in buying gilts, especially since last autumn when sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism - paving the way for steady cuts in the base rate. Dealers said that private investors have been keen to switch into government stock because of the attractive long-term interest rates available and the opportunities for making capital gains. However, the surge in private investor interest took the market by surprise in November, causing a log-jam in the settlement system for a few days. The Bank remains confident that in future the gilt-edged market should be capable of coping with a rush of private investors switching into gilts. Further changes are being introduced to make gilts more attractive to private investors. With effect from April 7, private investors will be able to buy up to Pounds 25,000 per stock per day through the National Savings Stock Register (NSSR), raising the upper limit from Pounds 10,000. At present, investors can only buy from a restricted list of stocks via the NSSR, but this list will be increased to include all stock during 1993. Dealers welcomed the Bank's measures. 'These steps will enhance the attraction of gilts,' said one marketmaker. However, one dealer suggested that private investors would be encouraged to buy more gilts if the Bank provided a wider variety of stocks available at below-par.

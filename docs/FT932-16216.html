			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / MMC recommends ITV changes THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday recommended significant amendments to the way the ITV network is run. It aims to ensure more flexible arrangements between ITV companies and independent producers. The decision was welcomed by the ITV companies, independent producers and the Independent Television Commission, all of which had been in conflict over programme rights. The commission backed the finding last December by the Office of Fair Trading that ITV proposals for running the national network were anti-competitive. It said there should be no rigid limits on the acquisition of programme rights, and rejected the OFT's insistence that when an independent producer agrees a programme deal with the ITV network, the network should retain exclusive UK rights over the programme for no more than five years, with an optional additional two years. Instead the commission has laid down guidelines based on the network centre being granted exclusive UK broadcasting rights for up to five years, with longer periods possible through options. The commission said it had introduced guidelines rather than specifying a fixed maximum period of rights to reflect the different circumstances that may arise in practice. The ITC yesterday warned ITV that it would monitor the new guidelines, which in effect make terms subject to negotiation. The commission also modified an OFT recommendation that producers should have the right to be commissioned by the network rather than having to work through a sponsoring ITV company. An independent producer will be able to agree a deal directly with the network centre. The producer will then enter a three-way contract with the centre and an ITV company, whose role will be limited to ensuring the programme complies with the requirements of the ITC. The commission also removed a barrier imposed by the OFT to ITV companies having options on series and programme formats, which had been condemned by the television industry. Mr John Woodward, director of the group, said he was delighted at the commission's verdict, but added: 'It looks more like a multiple car accident for ITV. But . . . if they're happy I'm happy.' Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of ITV, said the commission's document was 'a very very practical piece of common sense.' The report was also welcomed by Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television, who also chairs the ITV steering committee on the issue. He said: 'The onus is on us not to abuse the system otherwise we will get investigated again.' Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Finland cuts spending to avoid devaluation THE FINNISH government promised yesterday to make significant cuts in spending on the welfare state in an emergency package aimed at avoiding devaluation and preventing a collapse of the centre-right coalition government. The proposals followed a rise in interest rates and a massive outflow of funds on Friday after Mr Rolf Kullberg, central bank governor, resigned amid differences with the government over who was to blame for Finland's economic problems. The government confirmed its commitment to low inflation, a stable exchange rate and defending the external value of the currency in order to prevent further loss of confidence when the financial markets open today. The proposals had the full backing of other Nordic central banks which pledged, if necessary, to support the Finnish markka this week. The other Nordic countries would probably do this by lending from reserves. The bank also announced that Ms Sirkka Hamalainen would take over from Mr Kullberg as central bank governor immediately, not from July 1 as had been originally proposed. The immediate appointment of Ms Hamalainen was seen as a further step aimed at calming the markets. After spending the weekend in emergency meetings, the government agreed to cut expenditure by FM10bn (Pounds 1.28bn) in 1993, equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP. The cuts should help to keep government spending within the FM 174bn proposed limit for 1993, and are supported by the four coalition member parties. The central bank said the measures would reduce the government's level of indebtedness. Cuts include limits on government funding of municipalities and reductions in state sector pensions, unemployment payments, child benefits and overseas aid. Wary eye on the market, Page 17</p>

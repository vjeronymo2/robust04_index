			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Palestinian officials, Ilyas Frayj, Muhammad </F> al-Nazal, Ghassan al-Khatib, Muhammad Ghunaym, Dawud al-Tilhami,  Dr. 'Awwad M. 'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis,  Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not  given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories  Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"]    [Text] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied  territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great  as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that  demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment. The  importance and gravity of the situation lies in the upcoming  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and the implementation  of autonomy in those two areas, with the start of the five-year  transitional phase, according to the Declaration of Principles  (the Oslo Accord) signed in the White House garden last 13  September. Its importance and gravity also lie in the fact that  some people anticipate that it could--if it continues--lead to a  civil war along the lines of what happened in Afghanistan or  Somalia.    There may be a good deal of exaggeration in such  expectations, as many Palestinians say, both supporters and  opponents of the accord. They attribute it to various causes:  the nature of the Palestinian people, their level of political  awareness, and the fact that the Israelis will not be  withdrawing completely from the occupied territories. Hence the  spread of this quantity of arms (between 10-15,000 weapons,  according to one Fatah official), especially in the Gaza Strip.  The fact that these arms are reaching the hands of citizens,  wary of the future and afraid of the unknown, creates fear and  unease among those who hope that this will not lead to a civil  war, or to armed clashes between factions--or even inside a  single organization, to settle old scores. They could be used  for revenge, armed robbery, and theft, which have recently been  on the rise. And then there is Israel's attempt to exploit the  situation, stir up trouble, and use their agents to foil the  autonomy experiment.    In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian  factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of  questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons,  motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of  the Palestinian police in containing them.    What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from  Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization  officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's  Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami,  member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior  official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi,  member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union  (DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of  the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad  'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure,  from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid  al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a  member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus;  and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known  figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip.    [Salih] How widespread are weapons in the occupied  territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say?    [Abu Mahir (Fatah)] There are an estimated 10-15,000  weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza Strip.    [Al-Nazal (Hamas)] I doubt that there is any great spread of  arms. It is extremely difficult to obtain arms to fight the  occupation, and this is a major obstacle. We have reports that  confirm that the allegations about the abnormal spread of arms  are untrue.    [Al-Khatib (People's Party)] There is a widespread,  large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and  in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem  of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over  who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political  organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and  individuals that get them if they can afford them.    [Dawud al-Tilhami (DFLP)] Perhaps there is some exaggeration  about the volume of arms in the occupied territories, especially  in Gaza. This exaggeration is intended to create a climate of  fear for the residents of Gaza at a time when the occupation  forces are preparing to pull out of the cities and camps and  redeploy in the sites specified in the Cairo accord between  'Arafat and Peres.    [Al-Shu'aybi (DPU)] The spread of arms is relative to how it  was in the past. What is remarkable is the transformation in  this phenomenon now, to a virtually public one, especially in  the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type of phenomenon  existing in the West Bank. But there is a noticeable increase in  the buying and selling of arms, and a boldness in carrying them.    [Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad)] The spread of arms is aimed at  the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of Nablus in the  West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale alleged by  newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with which people  are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This comes after the  Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer hold Fatah people  responsible specifically for bearing arms. Some families  historically known for owning arms, for trading in them, or  other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them. Most of  them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not exceed  the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions and  families, by more than a few hundred weapons.    [Dr. 'Awwad (Independent)] There are several reasons why  arms  are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in the West Bank, but  there are no precise estimates about this. Regarding the spread  of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now said jokingly that arms  are sold by the bushel, like fruits and vegetables in Gaza. But  the truth is that there is a noticeable rise in armament, with  hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis, and pistols reaching  Gaza.    [Frayj (Independent)] There is no accurate information about  the volume of arms. Talk on this subject is exaggerated.    [Al-Hamdulillah (Independent)] Where there is smoke, there  is  fire. Guns have begun to appear openly, especially in the Gaza  Strip, and much more widely than was normal in the years of  intifadah. But the reports being circulated are not accurate,  and do not present a reliable or realistic picture.    [Al-Rayyis (Independent)] This phenomenon has become clear  and well known; it has been acknowledged by Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in official reports. I believe that the  quantities of arms in people's hands are increasing day by day  despite the continuous warnings of the danger of this phenomenon  and the negative effects it might have, especially in Gaza.    [Salih] The causes and motives behind the spread of arms--do  the factions have a hand in this?    [Abu Mahir] There are many and varied reasons for this  phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows:    First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the  transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be  no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms.  Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks  and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the  occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people  and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong  to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about  interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins.    [Al-Nazal] We believe that the most important reason for the  purchase of arms is confrontation with the occupation  authorities. And I repeat that there is no phenomenon of  widespread arms.    [Al-Khatib] There are a number of reasons for the spread of  arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources, through  the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel. Second,  citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the  uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times,  among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of  monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or  possessing them, especially in Gaza. [Al-Tilhami] Naturally,  a large number of intifadah fighters had arms, especially in the  last three years. This was a distinct increase, to confront the  occupation. In recent months, especially after the Oslo accord,  there have been more guns in Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai  or bought from arms dealing networks in the occupied  territories. Of course, in light of the mounting chaos in Gaza,  it was natural for organized Palestinian forces to provide the  arms necessary for self-defense against occupation attacks,  settler operations, or occupation agents. We do not rule out  that the Israelis, using their access to arms-dealing networks,  might be trying to turn political disputes among the factions  into armed clashes. This is something we seriously and firmly  warn against.    [Al-Shu'aybi] Historically, the national movement has sought  to obtain arms to use them in militant operations. They used to  smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with the difficulty  of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining arms from Israeli  dealers in the underworld. They get arms stolen from Israeli  camps. After the Madrid negotiations and Israel's willingness to  withdraw from Gaza, the Israeli fist began to get lax in its  rule and control, and this phenomenon encouraged a large number  of people to buy arms and start dealing in them. The state of  intensified polarization among factions after Madrid and Oslo  aided the wish to strengthen every faction, and very openly, in  society, to increase the trafficking, and sometimes the  transport of arms stocks in the West Bank and Gaza directly to  the market for sale. They took advantage of the high prices that  resulted from the worsened financial conditions of many social  factions and faction members, after the PLO cut off their  financial aid.    [Al-Shaqaqi] The enemy is helping Fatah to get weapons for  its members, since these arms no longer pose a threat to  [Israel]. Some Fatah elements have begun to traffic in arms.  There are other fighting factions who want to buy arms, either  to fight the enemy or for self-defense. This is rather limited,  because arms are expensive and there is a limited supply. On the  other hand, some families have begun to fear for the lives of  their children in the coming phase, about which nothing is  clear. So they want to protect themselves. Some of these  families previously owned guns, which they are now bringing out  to use in familial or organizational problems.    [Dr. 'Awwad] I think the main reason for the spread of arms  is to settle scores, for self-defense, and the political  struggle within some of the major groups in the PLO. There are  scores to be settled among families and organizations, in  addition to fear and the wish for self-defense: fear of a  security vacuum when the withdrawal begins. These reasons have  led some persons to leave Gaza for Egypt until things settle  down.    [Frayj] I think it unlikely that the factions have any  desire  to see arms spread.    [Al-Hamdulillah] We in the occupied territories accuse the  occupation authorities and their intelligence service of playing  a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this phenomenon.  These authorities have recently begun to arm their collaborators  more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend themselves, instead  of moving them behind the so-called Green Line [pre-1967  border]. There is no doubt, however, that the "transfer of  authority," which has not yet occurred, may be seen as one of  the major causes for this phenomenon. Add to that the family  feuds, the assassination of collaborators, and the rivalry over  power centers. All these have made some people keep guns handy  for self-defense. Some others, of course, carry guns to combat  the occupation. In short, the policy of the occupation  authorities, and the vacuum created after the withdrawal, could  result, some believe, in an interest in guns stemming from fear  of the future. I personally do not think that the factions have  any hand in this.    [Al-Rayyis] The diverse factions have their own reasons and  motives that compel them to stockpile what arms they can gather.  This is in spite of the constant assurances that there will be  no fighting among brothers, and that the government will be  reasonable and logical. But what makes the situation dangerous  is the spread of arms among ordinary citizens, who imagine that  these weapons are necessary to safeguard their security and  safety, and to confront the unknown.    [Salih] What are the sources of these arms?    [Abu Mahir] Recently, most arms have come from southern  Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with occupation  officers.    [Al-Nazal] There are numerous sources for obtaining arms. It  varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal source of arms  is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam heroes, who take  their guns.    [Al-Khatib] Israel is encouraging this phenomenon.    [Al-Tilhami] As I mentioned previously, most of these arms  come from arms dealers and even the occupation soldiers, some of  whom sell arms for material gain. There is a certain quantity of  arms smuggled in from Sinai.    [Al-Shu'aybi] In the Likud era, Israel made it easy for some  of the groups opposed to PLO factions to obtain small arms,  specifically in the Gaza Strip. The negotiations encouraged  Palestinians and Israelis to start trafficking in arms across  the Egyptian border.    [Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that the phenomenon is a limited  one.  It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The supply is meager,  and the high prices are staggering. The cost of a gun, since the  signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone down one cent. The  price of a revolver is the equivalent of $3,000. A Kalashnikov  is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at least $10,000. The sources  of the guns are as follows:    1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the  territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns  inside.    2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border.    3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in  exchange for their guns, which are then sold.    4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza  and bring arms to their relatives.    5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements.    6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These  are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from  high prices before it is too late and they lose their value.    [Dr. 'Awwad] There are a number of sources. There are  Israeli  arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities. There are  arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use at the  proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there are arms  smuggled over the Egyptian border.    [Frayj] If the reports are true, the people fueling this  phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people.    [Al-Hamdulillah] In my view, the sources are restricted to  the following: the remainder of the arms left behind by the Arab  armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over the borders of Egypt,  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli sources, including the  arming of collaborators.    [Al-Rayyis] Recently a gun-toting Palestinian youth was  shown  on Israeli television answering a reporter's question by saying  that, since it is now possible to move people and cars in and  out of Gaza, it isn't difficult to take in a little gun that  could easily be hidden, from any source, and by any means. It  may be said that the arms sources are the Israeli intelligence  services, Israeli soldiers, the bedouin, and smuggling from  Jordan and the Sinai.    [Salih] What might be the outcome of this spread of arms?  Could it reach the point of civil war, as some reports say?    [Abu Mahir] Apart from the motives of those who promote  guns,  or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms are patriotic  and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They will  eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation and  the settlers. There is no danger of gun ownership leading to a  civil war, because a gun by itself is not a condition for civil  war, which has its own causes, terms, and motives. These factors  and conditions do not exist. There are no ethnic divisions or  sectarian conflicts among our people. Guns in our people's hands  frighten the occupation soldiers, settlers, and agents, and give  citizens self-confidence, especially when security is lacking,  as is the case before the transfer of power to the Palestinians.    [Al-Nazal] I do not believe that combatants bearing arms  against the occupation will lead to civil war. I believe in the  good sense and ethics of our people in managing and solving its  problems. Times past are the best proof of this. The strange  thing here is that one political movement--in support of the  Oslo and Cairo accords, that is, 'Arafat's group--is behind the  allegations about the abnormal spread of arms, and its being  blown out of proportion in the media. We have not heard anything  about there being something scary about the spread of arms from  any opposition faction. In addition, exaggeration is part of the  campaign 'Arafat's group is waging to get wanted persons to turn  themselves in, along with their guns, to the occupation  authorities.    [Al-Khatib] It is to be feared that this phenomenon may  increase the chances that people will resort to arms in any  political or tribal, or even personal, dispute. There is also  the danger of the spread of vendettas and vengeance, especially  given the assassination of those accused of collaborating,  without any trial or investigation of the charge, in most cases.  Finally, there is the likelihood that it will be difficult to  control the situation when the PLO and the Palestinian police go  into Gaza. I believe that this is Israel's goal in encouraging  this phenomenon.    [Al-Tilhami] We do not rule out that the occupation  authorities might intend to "Somaliaize" or "Afghanize" the Gaza  Strip, and create violent anarchy and civil war in order to keep  Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo-Cairo accords from  continuing their resistance to the occupation. It would also  weaken the uprising against the occupation and give the  impression that the Palestinian people are unable to handle  their political relations and disputes in a rational manner. For  our part, we will foil the Israeli plans and do everything in  our power to prevent a civil war. We will keep all guns pointed  at the enemy, and keep political disputes within limits, giving  the masses a voice in them.    [Al-Shu'aybi] The spread of this phenomenon, apart from its  direct aims, behind which some of the Israeli security services  may lurk, is an attempt to position its aims and outcomes  negatively, to hasten the outbreak of internecine fighting, and  create an unstable social situation, preventing the natural  transformation of Palestinian society into an independent state,  and to push the people into accepting any solution, even an  annexationist one. Particularly as the trial run will be in Gaza  and can affect the people's position in the West Bank later, and  in the diaspora too. It would be hard for a civil war to break  out between factions, because public opinion is against it. But  it would be possible to cause family conflicts and at times  internal fighting, within a single faction.    [Al-Shaqaqi] The existence of a few hundred guns cannot  ignite a civil war. If families feel that their children are  safe, there will be no danger in these families owning guns. But  we must consider that some of these families have members with  differing organizational loyalties and affiliations. This is  especially true with families loyal to the opposition because of  their members' loyalties. Here the autonomous authority comes  into play. If it behaves as an oppressive power, as many fear it  will, then the problems will come to a head--but I rule out  civil war. There is another point I want to explain, that the  Israeli army has acted officially so far to spread arms; yes, it  has eased up a little in some areas. But not to the point of  being responsible for spreading the phenomenon. If that were the  case, there would be more guns and they would be cheaper. I am  afraid that the Isareli army's accusation is the prelude to  repression of those who are bearing arms against the enemy  today, and buy them with their food money, or their children's,  to defend their country and their land.    [Dr. 'Awwad] Armed struggles and internal purges within  major  organizations have been attributed to this phenomenon. This  phenomenon will serve to increase the opposition's armed  operations against settlers and the Israeli army when the  withdrawal begins. The spread of arms will escalate the armed  struggle between supporters and opponents of the settlement.  These confrontations could escalate into a civil war in the  event the Palestinian authority is unable to create political  channels for solving disputes by democratic means.    [Frayj] It makes no sense whatsoever for Palestinian  factions  to ignite a civil war.    [Al-Hamdulillah] I would like to say, frankly and with  certainty, that we do not sense or see any competition or  rivalry in the occupied territories, or any struggle to obtain  arms. So I do not agree with those who are afraid that this will  lead to a civil war. Everyone knows that the enemy is present  there, and not moving. I do not believe that the Palestinian  sides will lose their reason or rationality. This does not mean  that there may not be some undesirable and unacceptable, or even  dangerous practices and violations. But the occupiers' desire  for Palestinian infighting and civil war will not be satisfied.  Our people, suffering under occupation, and following the course  of events silently, will not forgive those who harm or squander  their rights.    [Al-Rayyis] The spread of arms is pushing events to the edge  of the abyss, and raises doubts about all the assurances about  good intentions and the genuine desire for a solution to  conflicts through dialogue, with higher interests prevailing.  After that, the discipline we need becomes difficult and will  require redoubled efforts on the part of everyone who wants to  avoid collapse and deterioration.    [Salih] And the role of the Palestinian police in containing  this phenomenon when they take over security affairs, after the  evacuation of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories?    [Abu Mahir] Unquestionably, when the Palestinian police take  up their duties, they will have an important and basic role in  creating an atmosphere of security and stability among citizens.  They must also build national unity, provide social justice, and  establish democracy in society and its institutions, and enforce  the law among the people. These factors will lead to an  atmosphere of self-control among citizens, helping them to  control and regulate arms, preventing infractions, and turning  the arms phenomenon into a positive factor helping the authority  to establish security and deter violence when Israel withdraws  its army and settlers from the occupied areas.    [Al-Nazal] We are afraid the 'Arafat group's talk about the  arms phenomenon is just a prelude to the repression of opponents  and disarming them to prevent them from fighting the enemy, in  accordance with the promises they made Israel about ceasing  military operations. I believe that this is the real motivation  behind this overblown campaign warning of so-called dangers.    [Al-Khatib] When the Palestinian police assume their  security  responsibilities, they should take arms away from individuals  and groups, excepting those who have official tasks assigned  them by the government or the security service. There must be  strict controls on the transport and possession of arms. Most  importantly, a feeling of security must be created for citizens,  to put an end to any motive for possessing or using arms.    [Al-Tilhami] We are afraid, after reading the provisions of  the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called Palestinian  police will be entrusted with the mission of repressing the  intifadah and the people. This is something the occupation  forces have been unable to do for the more than six years of the  intifadah. We do not rule out that the promotion of anarchy,  criminality, theft, and the terrorizing of citizens in Gaza  might open the way for the Palestinian group that signed the  Oslo and Cairo accords to be put to the test, controlling the  intifadah and repressing its people. This is what makes us fear  the content and provisions of those two accords, to which we are  totally opposed. They do not ensure withdrawal from the occupied  territories. So we will work with all opposition patriotic and  Islamic forces, groups, and persons, including members of Fatah  and the Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in  order to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called  Palestinian police. We reject the transformation of this body  into an instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a  plan to repress the intifadah and provide security for the  occupation, instad of eradicating it.    [Al-Shu'aybi] The Palestinian police, in the context of  public law and order, will limit the consequences of arms  purchasing, even if they cannot put an end to arms purchasing  itself.    [Dr. 'Awwad] The Palestinian authority will not succeed in  collecting arms from organizations and the populace, because  that would lead to a clash that would not be in its interest.  Plus the fact that disarming the opposition would be seen as  cooperation and collusion with Israel. That would certainly lead  to an open confrontation between the authority and opposition  forces.    [Frayj] [He did not respond to this question.]    [Al-Hamdulillah] This question would be better put to the  leadership that concluded the Oslo accord with Israel, and  subsequently the Cairo accord, on forming the Palestinian police  and the missions with which the Israelis entrusted them. So  excuse me for not answering this question.    [Al-Rayyis] The ordinary Palestinians look very positively  upon the Palestinian police and have great hope in it. They have  confidence that they will represent discipline, the law, and  human rights, and with the same strength and to the same degree,  they see them as a force for maintaining public order, and not  just the system of autonomy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- In connection with the reports by  a number of agencies about the possible withdrawal of Russia's  peacekeeping battalion in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the Press and Information Department at the Russian  Foreign Ministry, today said the following to an ITAR-TASS  diplomatic correspondent:    "In the event of an escalation of tension in  Bosnia-Herzegovina which poses a threat to UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] troops, be it as a result of mass air strikes  by NATO, or of military activities of the sides directly  involved in the conflict, then the question could arise of  whether it is expedient to keep peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.  The UN secretary general's special envoy, Y. Akashi, also said  this recently. A whole number of states with peacekeeping  forces in the zone of conflict have said several times that if a  real threat to peacekeepers develops, the question may arise of  withdrawing military contingents. It goes without saying that,  in this event, the Russian side would not sit with its arms  folded either."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Stockholm--Saab Aircraft AB announced 17 January in  Linkoeping that its new, radar-carrying Saab-340-AEW had made  its first test flight, which lasted two hours.    The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model,  which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab-340  type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900-kg radar made by  the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics.    The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary  electrical power system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply  the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its  computers.    Sweden's Defense Equipment Office (FMV) ordered six of the  aircraft for surveillance of national land and sea territory. A  spokesperson for Saab Aircraft AB said that construction of the  craft, excluding radar, would cost just over 500 million Swedish  crowns (a little over 365 million French francs [Fr], give or  take).    The new Saab-340-AEW, which the British have nicknamed "the  poor man's AWAC", has attracted the notice of international  specialists. This, says the company spokesperson, "is a very  good sign for future exports." The first AEW will be delivered  to Sweden's defense forces during the first quarter of 1995.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH CITES REGULATIONS IN VETOING AMTRAK FUNDS  </P> <P> President Bush today vetoed a bill authorizing funds for Amtrak, the nation's  rail passenger service, protesting a provision to bring railroad acquisitions  under new government scrutiny.  </P> <P> Bush said the provision "represents a step backward for the entire rail  industry."  </P> <P> It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He vetoed 10 measures last year and has yet  to have one overturned.  </P> <P> In a veto message to Congress, Bush criticized a provision that would require  the government to review and approve proposed acquisitions of railroads by  non-railroad companies and organizations.  </P> <P> "This new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of the nation's  largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or to change existing  capital structure," Bush said.  </P> <P> He said it would even subject to new scrutiny attempts to take over a rail line  by "a carrier's own management or employees."  </P> <P> "This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to financial  restructuring of the railroad industry," Bush said.  </P> <P> He said there is also adequate protection under existing law "to protect the  public interest in acquisition situations."  </P> <P> The provision would require Interstate Commerce Commission approval of all  railroad takeovers by non-railroad companies.  </P></p>

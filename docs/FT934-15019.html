			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Planned Inmarsat flotation would create company worth over Dollars 2bn INMARSAT, the international satellite operator owned by 71 of the world's telecommunications authorities and companies, will in effect be floated next year under a plan put forward by the company. The move would create a company likely to be worth more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The biggest shareholder is Comsat, the publicly quoted US company, with 24.6 per cent. British Telecom comes next with 11.7 per cent, followed by Norwegian Telecom with 10.7 per cent and Japan's KDD with 9.1 per cent. Inmarsat was established in 1979 to provide satellite communications for shipping. It has since expanded into land and air mobile communications and is now used for telephones and faxes in passenger aircraft and by newsgathering and emergency services. The organisation's annual turnover exceeds Dollars 300m and it has a 'surplus', equivalent to a profit, of about Dollars 100m a year. Its annual growth has exceeded 20 per cent for the last four years. The mechanism likely to be put to Inmarsat's owners early next year is that their stakes become tradeable with each other. From there it is a relatively small step to allowing third parties to buy stakes in Inmarsat. If Inmarsat were to be valued on a similar basis to companies such as BT or Cable and Wireless, it would be worth more than Dollars 2bn. On a valuation of Dollars 2bn, BT's stake in Inmarsat would be worth Dollars 236m, compared with its net investment so far of Dollars 35m. Inmarsat has in recent months laid plans to move into mass markets for mobile communications. It wants to build a global mobile telecommunications network based on its satellites. But the scheme is bringing it into conflict with private sector companies such as Motorola. 'We're operating in an increasingly competitive environment. It is useful to have an accurate value of shareholders' investment,' said Mr Ramin Khadem, Inmarsat's chief financial officer.</p>

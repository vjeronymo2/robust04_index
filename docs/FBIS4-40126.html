			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy, 13 Jun -- The armed groupings of Ruslan  Labazanov and Khoza Suleymanov, which rose up against Dzhokhar  Dudayev, have been almost completely crushed, the republic's  Ministry of Internal Affairs told ITAR-TASS.    As has already been reported, these two powerful groupings,  equipped not only with infantry weapons, but also with seven  units of armor, sent their men into central Groznyy over the  weekend, making a number of demands of the present Chechnya  authorities. Lengthy talks were unproductive. Furthermore, on  Sunday evening the insurgents shelled the building housing the  National Security Department and tried to hold a rally on the  city's central square. The authorities decided to eliminate the  groups.    By 0400 this morning forces loyal to Dzhokhar Dudayev had  blocked the insurgents in one of the rayons of Groznyy and,  following a long battle involving the use of armor, took by  storm the four four-floor buildings that the insurgents had  occupied.    Eight government soldiers were killed, including Khamzat  Khankarov, the commander of the Chechen formations that had been  fighting in the conflict in Abkhazia.    The number of victims of the other side and among civilians  is still unclear. Khoza Suleymanov, badly wounded, has been  arrested. It is not known what has happened to Ruslan Labazanov.    Chechnya's law enforcement bodies are carrying out a search  for remaining insurgents who have disappeared in the city and in  the republic and who may commit individual acts of terrorism.    An emergency sitting of the Chechen Cabinet has been going  on  in Groznyy since this morning.    [Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 1300 GMT on 13  June  adds: "The press service of the Chechen Interior Ministry has  told ITAR-TASS that by 1200 local time the operation conducted  by the forces of the Interior Ministry, the State Security  Department, and the Special Purpose Detachments of the Chechen  Armed Forces in the outskirts of Groznyy was completed."]</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Southern hits the front in dividend race A NEW leader emerged in the electricity industry's dividend race yesterday as Southern Electric increased its payout to shareholders by 17.6 per cent, the highest so far. Southern's increase capped the 15.9 per cent set by Seeboard earlier this week, and virtually ensures the Berkshire-based utility first place when the six-week long electricity results season ends next Tuesday. In common with other electricity company chairmen, Southern's Mr Geoffrey Wilson, denied that a race existed. 'We are not looking over our shoulders and trying to be top of the pops,' he said yesterday. The increase was justified by Southern's strong financial performance, which included a rise of 12.6 per cent pre-tax profits to Pounds 187m on sales of Pounds 1.8bn (Pounds 1.75bn), and its success in bringing down costs. Although the increase to 19.6p caused a fall in Southern's dividend cover - earnings per share rose to 54.5p (47.8p) - Mr Wilson said that several other electricity utilities paid larger dividends. He also stressed that Southern's domestic customers were sharing in the benefits. Tariffs had fallen by at least 2.5 per cent this year, with a further rebate promised for next year. The casualties of Southern's success are its own staff. After shedding 600 jobs this year, the company warned that a further 1,000 jobs would have to go over the next three years, bringing annual savings of Pounds 20m. Mr Wilson said the redundancies would be achieved through early retirement and natural wastage. Southern, one of the 12 regional electricity distributors privatised two years ago, serves central southern England, and has been among the most aggressive in cutting costs inherited from the days of state ownership. Mr Wilson said yesterday it aimed to have the lowest costs of all the utilities. The biggest blot on yesterday's result was a Pounds 7.2m loss in the company's electrical appliance retailing subsidiary, E&amp;S, set up jointly with Eastern Electricity last year. But Mr Henry Casley, Southern's chief executive, said the losses would be eliminated as the company became more established. 'We are confident it was the right thing to do,' he said. A big influence on the electricity sector's results is the price review being conducted by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. Regional companies have been anxious to cut costs in anticipation of a tightening of price controls. However, there has been some anxiety in the markets that the double-digit dividend increases announced by most electricity companies could encourage the regulator to take a tougher line.

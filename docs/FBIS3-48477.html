			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jan 94 </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] On 21 January, government agencies in Kasumigaseki  were greatly shocked by the news that the political reform bills  had been killed in the upper house. Bureaucrats were  disappointed and felt uneasy about this incident on the eve of  the compilation of the pump-priming package and the fiscal 1994  budget. With the Japan-U.S. summit in February near at hand, (a  senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] noted)  "we do not know when and what kind of pump-priming package we  can work out, and this will make the attitude of the United  States unpredictable." While the Ministry of Finance [MOF]  usually reacts coolly to developments in political circles,  senior officials were busily engaged in information-gathering in  the evening.    "What the deuce is going on?" Earlier in the day, senior MOF  officials hurriedly called on the prime minister's office, and  it appeared they were perplexed with the information that the  bills were likely to be killed at the upper house. Immediately  after television reported the upper house decision, top MOF  officials gathered at Vice Minister Jiro Saito's office. They  reportedly agreed to "watch development of the situation since  the political scene is so uncertain." The MOF then started  analyzing possible directions of the political scene.    MOFA and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] are concerned about possible delays in economic policies  in preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit. MITI Vice Minister  Hideaki Kumano said the incident is "no big deal," but he looked  nervous. A senior MITI official said: "The prime minister  cannot go to the United States if the government fails in  hammering out the new pump-priming package. I am really worried  about the direction of the tax system reform."    The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo held an emergency meeting in the  evening, probably to study possible influences on Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's Tokyo visit. An embassy official said  "we thought the possibility (of defeat of the bills) was 50-50."    As the coordinator of economic policies, the Economic  Planning Agency is becoming tired of the "political agenda badly  affecting our job" (as noted by a senior official). If the  agency has to work out the pump-priming package before settling  the tax reform issue, the package will inevitably be less  effective.    The Labor, Health and Welfare, and Transportation ministries  are all concerned the uncertainty of the political situation may  delay the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, and this would  affect their employment, welfare, and railroad construction  policies. A senior Labor Ministry official said: "Taking the  worsened employment rate into account, we are now in big  trouble."</p>

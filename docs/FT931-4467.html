			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Swiss women in rare triumph WOMEN scored a rare triumph over Swiss male chauvinism yesterday when Ms Ruth Dreifuss became only the second woman to be elected to the seven-member federal cabinet. It took considerable backroom intrigue, angry demonstrations by women throughout the country and ultimately three rounds of balloting among the mainly male federal parliamentarians before the little known Ms Dreifuss emerged a victor. And in the end no one was happy. 'It is a typical Swiss compromise, with no winners or losers,' one parliamentarian said. The trouble began in January when Mr Rene Felber, the foreign minister, resigned from the cabinet. As Mr Felber was a member of the Democratic Socialist party and a French Swiss, the 'magic formula' agreed by the four parties in the coalition government required that his replacement also be a French Swiss socialist. The socialists quickly discovered that Ms Christiane Brunner, a trade union leader, was one of only two to meet the requirements. Making a virtue out of near necessity, they championed her, saying it was high time a woman was in the cabinet. The liberal and conservative parties in the coalition disagreed, at least as far as Ms Brunner was concerned. Her dress was too casual, her private life unorthodox, they complained. Worse, she had once supported a proposal to abolish the Swiss army. Give us a choice, they demanded, but the socialists refused. When it came to the vote a week ago, they rejected Ms Brunner, electing a French speaking socialist man, Mr Francis Matthey, instead. For the socialists, this was unacceptable. They ordered Mr Matthey not to accept his election, and threatened to leave the coalition, a move that some of their conservative partners secretly hoped for. Instead, they turned the tables, proposing Ms Dreifuss, a trade union leader with views virtually identical to those of Ms Brunner. The liberals and conservatives fumed and squirmed, but obviously influenced by the wave of protest against their shoddy treatment of Ms Brunner, most reluctantly fell into line.</p>

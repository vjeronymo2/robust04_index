			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Bomb blasts Egyptian tour buses A BOMB explosion damaged seven empty tour buses parked yards away from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo's busiest square yesterday, one of a series of attacks a week after Egyptian security forces launched a tough crackdown on suspected Islamic militants, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Tourists had left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, , just 100 yards away. No one claimed responsibility. It appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants who have waged sporadic attacks on tourist targets for much of the past year.</p>

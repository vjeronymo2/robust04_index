			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ELDERLY MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTEMPTING TO MURDER HIS WIFE  </P> <P> A 79-year-old Ramona man who tried to smother his wheelchair-bound wife pleaded  guilty Wednesday to attempted murder.  </P> <P> Walter Watson entered his plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew  Wagner, who set sentencing for Dec. 1. The incident occurred July 15 in the  couple's home.  </P> <P> Mary Watson, also 79, testified at a July 31 preliminary hearing that her  husband forcibly put a plastic bag over her head. During the struggle, she also  broke some fingers.  </P> <P> The couple's son heard his mother screaming and removed the bag from her head,  Deputy Dist. Atty. George Beall said.  </P> <P> Beall said Watson faces a maximum 9-year state prison term and a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> However, because of his age, the prosecutor acknowledged that getting a prison  sentence for Watson would be difficult.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a battle getting him to prison at all. A prison sentence  would probably be a death sentence," Beall said.  </P> <P> Mary Watson suffers from Parkinson's disease, according to court testimony. Her  husband reportedly has been frustrated in dealing with his handicapped wife,  said Herb Bowman, a prosecutor who previously worked on the case.  </P> <P> After the incident, Watson reportedly put a bag over his own head in the  basement, where he was found unconscious, Beall said. He also apparently tried  to drink carburetor fluid.  </P> <P> Watson posted $10,000 bail in August, and he remains free on the condition that  he have no contact with his wife.  </P></p>

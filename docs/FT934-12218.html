			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (10): Risky business  -Profile: Credit Lyonnais OF ALL the financial companies primed for privatisation by the Balladur government, Credit Lyonnais is by far the most risky - and the most exciting. Credit Lyonnais is now counting the cost of five years of aggressive expansion under its chairman, Jean-Yves Haberer. It has been left with an impressive European retail banking network and a bulging junk bond portfolio, but with a large number of bad loans on its books and a trail of losses that added up to FFr1.8bn in 1992 and to FFr1bn in the first half of this year. Mr Haberer recently confirmed that he was considering a post at another company. The hot tip to replace him is Jean Peyrelevade, the highly-respected head of the UAP insurance group, who is one of the few figures in French finance deemed capable of taking on Credit Lyonnais. Nevertheless the Credit Lyonnais scenario is not entirely grim. Its big corporate catastrophes are now over. As the economy recovers it should start reaping the benefits of its impressive domestic network and of Mr Haberer's best legacy, its brand new European network.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREDIT LYONNAIS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated value*                           FFr12.9bn Government stake                       52.2 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Net banking income           FFr49bn         FFr46bn Net loss                    FFr1.8bn        FFr3.2bn profits  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Morgan Stanley, European Privatisation 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant US demand behind Quarto advance Buoyant US demand last year for books and art prints fuelled a 46 per cent increase in profits at Quarto Group, the publishing and printing services company. Reporting a pre-tax outcome of Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 3.42m) for 1993, the US-registered group hailed signs of economic upturn in its markets - particularly North America - as the main factor behind the improvement. Although the 1992 results were restated to reflect Pounds 551,000 of exceptional charges, underlying profits rose 26 per cent from a restated Pounds 3.97m. Turnover also rose 26 per cent as contributions by new subsidiaries helped lift group sales to Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 39.4m). Those subsidiaries were dominated by Scafa, the US publisher of fine art prints, which Quarto acquired last September with an initial Pounds 2.9m payment. The acquisition, funded by a Pounds 9.5m rights issue, meant art market sales now accounted for more than a third of group turnover. Funds outstanding from the issue were used to reduce net borrowings from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 3.4m, and gearing declined from 91 per cent to 27 per cent. While welcoming the figures, Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said: 'Margins, both at the gross and pre-tax level, have deteriorated slightly. Pressure on prices remains intense and we and our suppliers have to adjust to working in a low inflation and low growth environment'. He claimed the group's best prospects lay in further expansion in the US, where it has allocated Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) for acquisitions by Scafa. 'US sales have increased from 42 per cent of turnover to 50 per cent, and we expect it to stay above that level,' he added. That growth helped earnings per share rise 20 per cent to 19.7p (16.4p), while the final dividend is increased to 4p, making a total of 6p (5.37p). 4p (3.76p), making a total for the year of 6p (5.37p).</p>

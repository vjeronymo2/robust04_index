			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAKES ARE HIGH FOR O.C. IN HIGHWAY FUND BATTLE  </P> <P> In 1944, when citrus groves and bean fields were the icons of an Orange County  rich in open space and free of choking traffic, Congress decided to build a new  network of federal highways that promised to speed people and cars to  destinations in ways no one had yet dreamed possible.  </P> <P> Nearly 50 years later, the $122-billion, 42,500-mile system of federally funded  interstate highways is all but complete. As gridlock becomes a daily reality,  Congress is poised to begin the most significant revision of the country's  national highway program in more than 30 years.  </P> <P> At stake for densely populated, traffic-clogged urban centers like Orange  County is nothing less than the quality of their economic and social  development, say local, state and national officials who are working to  influence the new federal policy.  </P> <P> "We're at the crossroads," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), a member of the  House Public Works and Transportation Committee, whose 43rd Congressional  District includes southern Orange County.  </P> <P> "It is very much a watershed," said Francis B. Francois, director of the  American Assn. of State Highway and Transportation Officials. "And these  watersheds come along once in a generation."  </P> <P> The battle in Congress is expected to last at least through next year, and  possibly into 1991.  </P> <P> The lexicon of this transportation war will include buzzwords like smart car,  block grant, demand management, HOV lane, transit corridors, congestion tax,  mobility study, user fee and private sector. But in the end, the keyword is  likely to be money.  </P> <P> "Because of the lack of funds . . . over the last several years, highway  construction and highway improvement has been lagging behind, and of course  Southern California feels the pressure," Packard said. "We're going to have to  develop a blending of several approaches to highway funding."  </P> <P> By way of example, a study released this summer projects that in the next 20  years traditional local, state and federal funding sources will fall short of  providing enough money to meet Orange County's transportation needs by as much  as $12.4 billion.  </P> <P> To bridge the gap, the county must look increasingly to private investment in  roads and transit systems, said Monte R. Ward, manager of government and  community relations for the Orange County Transportation Commission. But  current federal law, fashioned largely in an era of government largess,  severely frowns on mixing federal money with private funds.  </P> <P> Many Orange County officials said they want the federal government to loosen  the strictures on the way local governments can spend federal highway and mass  transit dollars. Instead of building roads, the federal government should be  concerned with moving people, the officials said.  </P> <P> "What we're looking at is maintaining and upgrading our existing freeway  facilities, and then looking at newer and more flexible ways of moving people,"  Ward said. That may include car-pool lanes, rail systems, ride sharing, work  schedule changes and even home work stations, he added.  </P> <P> "One day we are going to have to get out of our cars and move people in a  better way than we are doing today," said John Meyer, the former executive  director of the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, which are  working to build three new toll roads.  </P> <P> The current system of federal funding dates to 1956, when Congress created a  special highway trust fund to finance construction of the interstate highway  system. A separate account to pay for mass transit projects was added later.  </P> <P> The trust funds are supported with receipts from the 9-cent-per-gallon federal  tax on gasoline and other highway-related taxes. Eight cents of the gas tax  receipts go to the highway fund, while the transit fund receives a penny. In  the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1988, highway fund revenues exceeded  $12.8 billion, and transit fund income totaled nearly $1.3 billion.  </P> <P> For more than 30 years, the highway trust fund has supportedconstruction of the  interstate highways. It also has paid for other state and local road-building  projects through a series of complex matching formulas that financed bridges  and primary, secondary and urban roads.  </P> <P> Authority for the federal aid program for highways and mass transit, last  enacted by Congress in 1987, is set to expire at the end of the 1991 fiscal  year. The program that replaces it is expected to be a dramatic departure from  the funding schemes of the past.  </P> <P> "What we have to do now is look at what our transportation system should look  like in the next 40 years," said one key congressional staffer.  </P> <P> The process will begin sometime before Christmas, when the surface  transportation subcommittee of the powerful House Public Works and  Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold the first in a series of  hearings. Packard is a member of the subcommittee, as is freshman Orange County  Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach).  </P> <P> The Public Works Committee expects to draft legislation early next year.  </P> <P> At about the same time, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner is expected  to unveil a national transportation policy that his office has been preparing  since last spring. Legislation to implement the policy will probably follow in  a few months, said James McCarthy, chief of policy evaluation for the Federal  Highway Administration.  </P> <P> At the moment, McCarthy said, "What the post-interstate system will look like,  we don't know."  </P> <P> But there is no dearth of speculation.  </P> <P> Some members of Congress, including Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of  the House Ways and Means Committee, want to increase the federal gasoline tax,  not to build more roads, but to cut the federal deficit.  </P> <P> Congress already has adopted a practice of maintaining healthy balances of  unspent gasoline tax money in both the highway and mass transit trust funds. At  the end of the 1988 fiscal year, those balances totaled about $14.4 billion.  One congressional staff member called it a "smoke and mirrors" trick to make  the deficit appear smaller than it really is.  </P> <P> Local and state transportation officials, as well as members of the House  Public Works Committee, strongly oppose the use of gasoline tax revenues to  shore up the federal budget.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see them release the $14 billion they're sitting on right now.  That's really our biggest concern," said Ernie Schneider, director of Orange  County's Environmental Management Agency, which has road-building  responsibilities. "We're in a desperate situation here . . . we need relief."  </P> <P> Said Cox: "It would do irreparable damage to our national infrastructure to do  what Dan Rostenkowski wants to do with the trust fund, and that is to steal  from it. There is an important national need, and it must be met."  </P> <P> Cox represents one school of conservative thought that favors turning over to  states, or regional transportation planning agencies, large portions of the  federal gasoline tax revenues through a block grant program.  </P> <P> "To think there is any repository of knowledge back here in Washington about  where roads ought to go in Orange County is to miss the point entirely," Cox  said.  </P> <P> Without committing himself, Packard said the idea has some appeal. Even  California Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), chairman of the Public Works  Committee, has flirted with the notion of block grants.  </P> <P> In a speech last month in Anaheim to members of the Amalgamated Transit Union,  Anderson said: "One much discussed alternative assumes the creation of a block  grant program, which would allocate funds by formula to urbanized areas,  provide for ongoing funding for existing programs, and then allow the use of  federal funds for either highway or transit purposes based on the need for  increase in transportation capacity."  </P> <P> But many in Congress are likely to oppose block grants because lawmakers would  have to surrender much of their life-and-death power over hometown public works  projects, several congressional aides said. "A lot of congressmen still want  their name on the bridge," one aide explained.  </P> <P> In addition, congressional representatives from rural areas are likely to fear  that block grant money would flow to centers of urban and suburban congestion,  largely at their expense.  </P> <P> Even if a block grant program is not enacted, Orange County transportation  officials said they will push Congress to allow them to use federal aid for  highways and transit with much greater flexibility than ever before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT'S NEXT  </P> <P> The future of federal funding for highways into the 21st Century will be  developed by Congress in a process to begin this fall. The process will begin  with hearings by a subcommittee of the powerful House Public Works and  Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEEDED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND COSTS  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission has identified the top  transportation needs of Orange County during the next 20 years as three  tollways in South County, the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway from 6 to 12  lanes with transitways for buses and car pools, and repaving and signal  synchronization projects on surface streets.  </P> <P> But improvements would cost $12.4 billion more than revenue now projected to be  available during that time period, according to the commission.  </P> <P> In thousands of dollars, through July 1989  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:2.22IN:2.22IN:2.22IN:2.22IN"

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / New accounting rules will shake up councils NEW RULES requiring councils to keep registers of fixed assets will revolutionise local-authority accounting and are expected to improve financial management. A new statement of recommended practice, approved last week by the Accounting Standards Board, means that councils will have to show the value of property - such as schools and equipment - in their balance sheets at current cost and recognise the cost of using such assets. 'As local authorities become more like commercial organisations they have got to manage their assets properly,' said Mr Martin Evans, head of the technical division at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, who describes the changes as the most radical in local-authority accounting for 100 years. 'Many authorities are asset-rich but do not know the value of the assets they hold,' he said. Most councils are obliged to implement the changes by the 1994-95 financial year. The move to capital accounting will also help comparisons between public and private-sector services in the move towards compulsory competitive tendering by local authorities. However, early indications are that few will embrace the change with enthusiasm. Mr Martin Pilgrim, of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said many councils were concerned about the cost of the exercise. 'Although it is inevitable that our present practices have to change, many authorities will not see this as positive or helpful.' Mr Evans said that in some respects the new statement goes further than current practice in the private sector. It requires that fixed assets be included in the balance sheet at current value and be revalued at regular intervals. Depreciation charges will then be charged in their accounts based on these amounts. There are also new guidelines to improve the presentation of local-authority accounts. Mr Evans said that the new rules will provide local authorities with a 'better basis for financial decision-making. At a time when all local authorities are under pressure to perform because of constraints in their expenditure this should sharpen up asset management.' Local authorities have never been required to show fixed assets in their accounts in the past. The emphasis has been on showing outstanding borrowings on assets which were externally financed. Assets financed from internal resources or which are paid for have not been shown. A pilot programme carried out by the institute in Solihull metropolitan borough council has demonstrated the potential impact of the changes. Solihull had previously shown fixed assets in its balance sheet of Pounds 117m. Under the proposed system, these rose more than five-fold to Pounds 588m.</p>

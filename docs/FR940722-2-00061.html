Approximately $75,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project period. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed cooperative agreement is to address the need to improve information exchange and transfer between State and Federal agencies, and among State agencies; to increase training opportunities to help States improve the capacity to conduct risk assessment and risk communication; to recommend a strategic plan to increase public and State health professionals' awareness of the toxic pollution problems in the Great Lakes States, improve their ability to diagnose, treat and manage illness or injury related to environmental problems, and enhance their ability to communicate health risk information; and to build capacity to respond to community concerns by providing training and guidance in addressing issues of community concern related to hazardous waste sites. Funding is to support a full time position to implement and conduct these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATSDR will collaborate with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk communication training programs, Public Learning Institute, teleconference briefings, consultation service, newsletter column and materials; and development, printing, and distribution of the national directory of risk assessors and environmental scientists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

Through its own membership, the ASTHO Environment Committee, the Association of State and Territorial Health Risk Assessors (ASTHRA), other affiliate organizations, and the Public Health Foundation, ASTHO has developed unique knowledge and understanding of the needs and operations of State health agencies. Association members have already developed an enormous wealth of experience in risk communication and have identified risk communication programs as a priority need for State health agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

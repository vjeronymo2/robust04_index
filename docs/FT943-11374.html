			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Capital available for C&amp;G buy Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds Bank's chief executive, yesterday expressed confidence that the bank would have sufficient capital to buy Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society without difficulty given its strong cash flow, writes John Gapper. Shareholders' equity grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 3.37bn over the six months to June 30 1994 and a further Pounds 800m was raised in loan capital. The interim dividend is increased by 14 per cent to 7.5p, payable from earnings per share ahead 15 per cent to 27.1p. Analysts estimated that the bank's tier one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets would fall to about 5 per cent if the cash was paid immediately, but Sir Brian said the bank could release further problem country debt provisions. Pre-tax profits from UK retail banking and insurance rose to Pounds 198m (Pounds 130m) after a fall in debt provisions from Pounds 233m to Pounds 182m. Corporate banking and treasury profits rose from Pounds 108m to Pounds 171m with provisions falling to Pounds 7m (Pounds 38m). Profits from private banking and financial services rose slightly to Pounds 53m (Pounds 51m). Sir Brian said this was because charges depended on the value of assets managed, and these had been affected by financial markets turmoil. The overall group net interest margin fell to 3.28 per cent (3.33 per cent), despite a slight rise in the domestic margin to 3.98 per cent (3.97 per cent). Sir Brian said this was because of growth in overseas assets. Balances in non interest-bearing current accounts rose to Pounds 3.9bn (Pounds 3.5bn), while money invested in savings and investment accounts fell from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 9.3bn.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: ALUMNI GATHERING MAKES FOR 'A SAN DIEGO STATE OF MIND'  </P> <P> Quite by chance, Le Meridien hotel helped the organizers of Saturday's 12th  annual San Diego State University alumni awards gala with the thankless and  typically tedious chore of herding VIPs from a private cocktail party to the  general reception.  </P> <P> The allures of the VIP reception, given in one of the hotel's plush villas,  were sufficient to induce a feet-of-clay state in the gathering of university  and Alumni &amp; Associates principals and honorees. The majority of the guests  had gathered on a lawn that offered a particularly inviting view of the  Coronado Bridge and the bay's obligingly cheerful waters, and seemed reluctant  to move along to the hotel ballroom until the sprinkler system, activated by a  timer, sent them jogging across the grass like a covey of startled quail. The  scene was amusing to witness, and apparently amusing to experience, at least in  the opinion of SDSU alumnus Tom Gable, who wisecracked, "At some parties, when  they want you to move on, they dim the lights."  </P> <P> Slightly damp but otherwise none the worse for wear, the VIPs ascended to the  St. Tropez Ballroom, where they joined the rest of the 500-plus guests at the  event's first sellout. According to alumni director Richard Talmo, the awards  dinner is the most important annual fund-raising event on the alumni calendar.  </P> <P> Wendy Blair, a 1973 graduate, chaired "A San Diego State of Mind" and arranged  such happy details as the centerpieces assembled from campus memorabilia and  the presence of the SDSU Jazz Ensemble, a collection of more than 20 musicians  and singers who could easily outplay most of the city's professional  orchestras.  </P> <P> "I think SDSU was wonderful and nice to ask me to put this on, and I'm sure  that one day I'll be rich and able to donate money back to the school," Blair  teased. Her husband, San Diego Union columnist Tom Blair, served as master of  ceremonies.  </P> <P> The program commenced during the dinner of roti de boeuf a l'Aztec and  chocolate-marbled cheesecake. Outgoing alumni board President Bernie Rhinerson  informed the audience that, at a strength of more than 100,000, the the local  SDSU alumni association represents the largest nonprofit organization in the  county. University President Tom Day then commented that May is a particularly  pleasant time of year for the school's faculty and administration because  "commencement is at hand, and we can all run for the hills."  </P> <P> A thoroughly detailed, painstakingly produced video presentation introduced the  event's nine honored alumni, who represented the seven SDSU schools, the  Imperial Valley campus and the alumni in general. The roll included San Diego  City Manager John Lockwood, businessman Jack Goodall, educator Ron Bolles,  engineering whiz Russ Common, community activist Mateo Camarillo, Imperial  Valley attorney Mercedes Zaragoza Wheeler, biologist Linda Maxson and  entrepreneur Luis Nogales.  </P> <P> The Alumnus of the Year award was given to banker Tom Carter, who received a  standing ovation as he approached the podium. The San Diego native surprised  the audience somewhat by extending his remarks beyond the usual words of  gratitude to comment on problems facing the area. Among the solutions he  suggested were combining the city and county governments into a single entity,  and regarding Tijuana as important to the area's economic life as San Jose is  to San Francisco.  </P> <P> Previous recipients of the Alumnus of the Year award include Old Globe Theatre  executive producer Craig Noel, television personality Art Linkletter, Greater  San Diego Chamber of Commerce President Lee Grissom and Richard T. Silberman,  the businessman and chief of staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. who  recently was indicted on money-laundering charges.  </P> <P> Channel 10 newsman Jack White conducted the traditional banquet-closing  auction, at which symbolic footballs that entitle successful bidders to  participate in interesting off-field proceedings at SDSU games sold for as much  as $600 each. A baton, which the purchaser will use to lead the fight song at  the Oct. 21 homecoming game against the University of the Pacific, also sold  for $600.  </P> <P> The guest list included incoming Alumni &amp; Associates President Art Flaming  and his wife, Gwen; Tracy and Tom Stickel; Cheryl Ayers with fiance Ron  Kendrick; Lynn Stedd-White; SDSU Vice President for Academic Affairs Albert  Johnson and his wife, Susan; Judy Carter; City Councilmen Ron Roberts and Bob  Filner; Maureen and Emil Ghio; Linda and Mel Katz; Barbara Bry and Patrick  Kruer; Betty Hubbard; university President's Council Chairman Norma Assam and  her husband, Dr. Sam Assam; Richel and Tawfiq Khoury; Jo and Tom Hazard; Police  Chief Bob Burgreen, and Patty and Bob Payne.  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO -- Part of the funds that enable the 338,000 client visits made  annually to the 31 countywide Episcopal Community Services programs was raised  at Saturday's May Faire, the 62nd anniversary dinner-dance and auction given by  </P> <P> the charitable organization.  </P> <P> About 400 ECS supporters, led by the Right Rev. C. Brinkley Morton, bishop of  the Episcopal Diocese of San Diego, gathered in the San Diego Marriott main  ballroom to bid on a silent auction of more than 100 unusual packages,  including smocking lessons for four, a somewhat premature Christmas tree  decorated with exceptional angel ornaments (an ECS dinner dance tradition), and  a home-video package that, given the event's religious association, included  tapes of "Ben Hur" and "The Ten Commandments" along with a sack of popcorn and  a hot-air popper.  </P> <P> "May Faire is given to help the least, the lost and the last," said chairman  Joyce Pedlow, echoing the ECS motto.  </P> <P> ECS spokesman Patt Casey described some of the services that will receive  funding from the event.  </P> <P> "ECS has the county's largest employment program for the homeless, and we're  currently trying to expand our services to both homeless men and women. We've  recently added a 'sheltered' workshop, at which a woman who's never had work  skills can develop them, and we emphasize teaching what it requires to keep a  job. This is a real problem for a lot of homeless people who want to be  self-supporting and independent."  </P></p>

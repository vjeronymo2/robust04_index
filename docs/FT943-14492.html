			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Panel concept a useful first step to restoring shareholder purpose Sir, The shareholder panel concept outlined in the article, 'With strings attached' (July 12), will doubtless be feared by die-hard captains of industry as the thin end of the Teutonic wedge in the shape of the supervisory board. Yet Professor David Hatherley's suggestion would bring the sort of informed and responsible involvement from a company's owners that would elude any centralised and bureaucratic audit commission. Shareholders are the only people properly positioned as the source of ultimate authority and legitimacy of the corporate form, yet few understand that along with shareholder rights come the obligation to ensure that elected managements perform properly. The architects of the joint stock company could never have imagined that, 150 years after the Registration Act of 1844, shareholder influence would in so many cases be effectively debilitated by the imposition of investing institutions between the mind of the investor and the company into whose shares his money eventually flows. A shareholder panel would provide a useful first step towards restoring the corporation's legitimacy of purpose.

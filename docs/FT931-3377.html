			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: HSBC strong The continuing wrangling over political reforms ahead of the handing over of power in Hong Kong in 1997 caused only a mild ripple of unease in shares of HSBC, holding company for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and its merged Midland Bank. HSBC was among the best performers on the London market after it revealed a much better than expected final dividend. The Hong Kong market itself came under heavy pressure after Chinese officials attacked British proposals for the colony, causing a general marking down in London of leading UK groups with significant interests in Hong Kong. HSBC's profits were slightly disappointing, according to dealers, but the dividend was ahead of the most optimistic forecasts, pitched around the 15.5p to 16p mark. The shares were tentatively marked up to 609p by dealers wary of the steep retreat on the Hong Kong market. Buyers moved in quickly, however, and drove the stock up to a close of 624p for a net gain of 20. Turnover was a good 7.7m. Other leading UK stocks heavily influenced by events in Hong Kong performed relatively well. Standard Chartered settled a net 4 higher at 704p ex-dividend, while Cable and Wireless, which derives more than half of its earnings from Hong Kong, settled only a fraction off at 712p, having fallen to 698p at the outset of trading. Inchcape rose 5 to 588p.</p>

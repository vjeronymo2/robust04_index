			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Jerusalem] </F>   [Text] A report by the Palestinian Information Center on  Human Rights, affiliated with the Arab Studies Association,  yesterday published statistics on the planning policy and the  demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem, as part of  the extensive popular plan the center is launching against the  demolition policy pursued by the Jerusalem Municipality.    The report estimates the number of Palestinian families who  lack proper housing in East Jerusalem and who have been forced  to live in shelters and tents, or in homes occupied by one or  two other families, at 21,000.    According to the report, this is the direct result of the  authority's policy of demolishing homes and expropriating lands  and its discriminatory housing policy that restrict landowners'  use of their lands.    The center provided documented facts revealing that over 210  Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem have been demolished by the  Israeli authorities for reasons related to construction licenses  since 1986.    The report revealed that 50 Palestinian homes are being  demolished in East Jerusalem every year. Of the total area of  the city of East Jerusalem, which is 73,000 donums, 29,000  donums have been, or are waiting to be, expropriated soon to  build Jewish settlements. Palestinians are allowed to build on  10,000 donums, while 35,000 donums are being left without  planning, the report says.    According to the report, Palestinians have been licensed to  build on 14 percent of East Jerusalem lands, on which  Palestinians have already built homes. Buildings in Palestinian  neighborhoods cannot exceed two stories, while those in Jewish  suburbs rise as high as eight stories.    The report notes that Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem pay  26 percent of the cost of services provided by the municipality,  although they received only 5 percent of these services. The  property taxes ranged from 14 to 39.2 new shekels per square  meter in 1994.    Illustrating the policy of discrimination against citizens,  the report pointed out that the Israeli Government provided  subsidized homes for 70,000 Jewish families in the settlements  of East Jerusalem alone, against 555 for Palestinian families.  The structural plan for Jerusalem reserves over half the area  of East Jerusalem for Jewish settlements and institutions.    The report cites a sampling study by Dr. Bernard Sabila  [name  as transliterated], political science lecturer at Bethlehem  University, that provided the following estimates of  Palestinians who emigrated with their families since 1967:    - 16,917 have emigrated to other countries since 1967;    - 12,080 moved outside the limits of the municipality;    - 12,500 reside in north Jerusalem; and    - 7,630 were abroad prior to 1967 and accordingly never  obtained Jerusalem identity cards.</p>

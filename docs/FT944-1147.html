			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Taiwan's Gatt application makes progress Negotiations on Taiwan's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have moved into the final stage, making it virtually certain that Taipei will be ready for admission to Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation, at the same time as China, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Taiwan's Gatt bid was accepted in 1992 on the understanding it could not join the world trade body before Beijing. However, unlike China's gruelling eight-year membership talks, negotiations with Taiwan have made steady progress. Yesterday's meeting of the Gatt working party on entry terms agreed to start drafting the protocol of accession, after hearing that bilateral talks on access to Taiwanese markets for foreign goods and services were going well. Taiwan says it hopes to complete the bilateral talks early next year and accession proceedings 'at the earliest possibility'.</p>

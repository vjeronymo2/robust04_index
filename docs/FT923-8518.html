			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Taiwan scraps export plan to aid Gatt entry TAIWAN has formally abolished a three-decade-old export subsidy system to help its application for entry to Gatt, the country's central bank said, Reuter reports from Taipei. The system, which helped to fuel the island's export-led economic boom, was one remaining area where Taiwan did not satisfy the world trade body's free trade rules, a senior bank official said. The central bank provided low-interest loans to exporters under the system beginning in 1961. The island's trade surplus totalled Dollars 5.47bn (Pounds 2.86bn) in the first seven months of 1992. The need for the system had diminished and fallen into disuse after Taiwan liberalised bank interest rates in 1989. It was abolished last week. In December 1989, after the last loan was granted, outstanding export loans had totalled Taiwan Dollars 14.5bn. Taiwan applied to join Gatt in 1990 but entry has been delayed by concern over its trade policies and opposition from China.</p>

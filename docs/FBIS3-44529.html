			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Abridged" version of interview with Gong Yuzhi, vice </F> chairman of the Study Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, by Bian Yanjun (6708 1750  6511), Zhang Suhua (1728 4790 5478), and Wu Xiaomei (0702 2556  2734): "Two Revolutions, Two Leaps, and Two Major Theoretical  Achievements" -- first paragraph is editor's note; original  published in MAO ZEDONG SIXIANG YANJIU]    [Text] The following is a conversation between Gong Yuzhi  and the interviewers; it views the angle of historical  continuity the relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This is a topic that greatly fascinates the  people. This record of the interview certainly can help the  people ponder the issue deeply.    [Question] Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, our party's second-generation leading  collective, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, has  explored diligently the road of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and has formed a set of new theories. What is  the relationship between this set of new theories and those  established by the first-generation leading collective, which  was represented by Comrade Mao Zedong? Please tell us something  about this from your research and experience.    [Gong Yuzhi] In the course of compiling the book The  CPC's 70 Years, Comrade Hu Sheng has held discussions with  us, and these discussions have led to the proposal of an idea,  which is that concerning the division of the historical periods  of the party, the historic status of the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee should receive greater  emphasis. That is to say, if we stand higher and look further  ahead, we may consider dividing the party's history into three  major periods, and the textbook on party history into three  major chapters. The first chapter is about democratic  revolution, and explains how the party led the people to begin  the grand and vigorous revolutionary struggle -- which  experienced two major twists, but had a relatively smooth  development following the Zunyi meeting -- and eventually ended  with a great victory, which was the founding of the PRC. The  second chapter is the opening chapter on socialism, and  discusses how the party led the people after the nation's  founding to embark upon the road of socialism, to make important  achievements in socialist construction, and to go through two  major twists in the middle. It ends with another victory: The  crushing of the "gang of four" and halting of the Great Cultural  Revolution. The third chapter is the new chapter on socialism,  which began from the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee. It is still difficult to say when it will  end.    At present, I feel that we may further consider using the  viewpoint of "the second revolution" to observe the historic  status of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee. Comrade Xiaoping said many times: "The reform is  China's second revolution." It was in 1985 that he directly  raised this proposition, but judged from his way of thinking, we  may trace it back to an even earlier time. Comrade Xiaoping's  speech -- "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, and Unite  to Look Forward" -- was, in fact, a report on the main theme of  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. It  said: "Realizing the four modernizations is a profound and great  revolution." On the eve of the plenary session, he addressed  the ninth meeting of trade union representatives, saying: "This  is a great revolution to completely change the economically and  technologically backward situation of our country, and to  further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Since this  revolution has to change greatly the currently backward  productive forces, it naturally must change in many ways the  production relations, the superstructure, the management style  in industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the manner in  which the state manages them, so as to make them adapt to the  needs of a large modernized economy." Here we can see that both  before and after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping and the Central Committee of  our party already had raised the issues of the new revolution  and of China's second revolution from the angle of uniting  modernization with reform. The Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee was the starting point for China's  second revolution.    Thus, we can stand on a higher and borader plain to sum up  the 71-year history of our party: Two generations of mature  central leading collectives led two great revolutions and  achieved two historic leaps in integrating Marxism with China's  practice. The mature first-generation central leading  collective, with Mao Zedong as the core, led us to overthrow the  three big mountains, found the PRC, establish the basic system  of socialism, and accomplish the first revolution of China. In  the process, it accomplished the first historic leap in  integrating Marxism with China's practice. The theoretical  achievement in this leap was Mao Zedong Thought. The mature  second-generation central leading collective, with Deng Xiaoping  as the core, led us to begin the second revolution of China,  that is, to carry out profound reform for the achievement of  modernization, and in the process, it has begun to realize the  second historic leap in integrating Marxism with China's  practice. The theoretical achievement in this leap is Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    The assessment given by the report to the 13th party  congress is: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, our party has proposed a series of scientific  theoretical viewpoints "that constitute an outline of the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." The  assessment that the "outline" has been constituted carries a lot  of weight and a sense of propriety. Comrade Xiaoping's southern  tour speech has further used a new viewpoint for a new  elaboration so as to upgrade the theory to a new level.    [Question] There are two generations of leaders, two  revolutions, two leaps, and two theoretical achievements. Do  they illustrate the relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, judged from the main process of CPC history?    [Gong] It is necessary to further analyze the relationship  between the theories and practices of the second-generation  central leading collective with Deng Xiaoping as the core, on  the one hand, and the theories and practice of the  first-generation central leading collective with Mao Zedong as  the core, on the other. What is the relationship? I want to  stress three conditions, which are correction, inheritance, and  development. It will not work if we discuss only one condition,  nor will it work if we discuss just two conditions; we have to  talk about all three. The first condition is correction, which  means correction of the theoretical and practical mistakes Mao  Zedong made in his later years.    [Question] You have published your work entitled "Under the  Banner of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," in which you  first talked about inheritance when talking about this  relationship.    [Gong] That is also a way to write things. The purpose of  this method is to stress the continuity and the inherited nature  of the undertakings led by our party. Speaking from the actual  process of historical turning points, the first thing is  certainly correction of the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his  later years because there is a basic historical fact here: The  10 years of internal turmoil during the Cultural Revolution  severely harmed the people in our country, and brought the party  and the country to a difficult and dangerous situation.  Escaping the mistake of the Cultural Revolution is the  precondition for entering the new period. The crushing of the  "gang of four" began a turning point in history. In the first  two years, however, the process of this historical turning point  met with some difficulties. The crucial problem at that time  was whether we had the courage, resolution, and ability to face  directly the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years, and  to handle properly the issue of upholding the scientific system  of Mao Zedong Thought on the one hand, while one the other hand,  correcting the mistakes he made during his later years. Why was  there "two whateverism" and "hesitant progress?" In the final  analysis, it was because the central leaders did not have the  political and theoretical courage to solve the problem, and they  lacked the resolution and ability to steer the helm of history  so as to change direction.    To the central leaders at that time, if these major mistakes  were pointed out and corrected, Mao Zedong's banner would be  lost, and knife would be lost. That is to say, they set up a  simplistic opposition between correcting the mistakes and  hoisting the banner -- in order to hoist the banner one cannot  correct the mistakes; to correct the mistakes would mean losing  the banner.    Under these conditions, Comrade Xiaoping showed his courage,  resolution, and ability as a proletarian revolutionary. Comrade  Xiaoping dared to point out clearly the mistakes made by Mao  Zedong in his later years, and to correct them resolutely. He  also stressed that only by correcting these mistakes can we  truly raise the banner of the scientific system of Mao Zedong  Thought. Of course, when we talk about the mistakes, we have to  look at the situation insofar as to when and to what extent we  should discuss them. When Deng began, he said Mao Zedong  Thought was a scientific system and that quoting fragmentary  sayings out of context could in no way represent this system of  thought. Later, he said that the theory and practice of the  Cultural Revolution were basically wrong, and when he said this,  it was not simply a problem of quotations. Here we see a process  of understanding, as well as the art of guidance. Mao Zedong  made great historical contributions to the party, to China's  revolution, and to the founding and development of the PRC. His  great creation was the integration of Marxism with China's  practice; his problem was that he started the Cultural  Revolution in his later years, and deviated from the correct  line of integrating Marxism with China's practice, a line which  he had established himself. Therefore, the new period must  begin with correcting the Cultural Revolution mistake, and with  "sorting out the chaos." Comrade Xiaoping's definition of  "sorting out the chaos and bringing things back onto right  track" was "correcting the chaos caused by the destructive Lin  Biao and the `gang of four,' criticizing the mistakes made by  Comrade Mao Zedong in his later years, and returning to the  correct track of Mao Zedong Thought."    The second condition is inheritance. "Bringing things back  onto the right track" is inheritance. To sort out chaos and  correct mistakes is not to completely overthrow the past, for we  never can deny the things that have been proved correct through  practice. Shortly after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping proposed the four  cardinal principles our party must uphold, the fourth of which  is "upholding Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong  Thought -- which has been proven as a scientific principle  through the practice of revolution in China, and which includes  all the positive fruit of Mao Zedong's thinking when he pondered  China's own way of building socialism -- must be inherited and  developed today. Without this relationship of inheritance,  history is negated and severed, and we will lose our basic  foothold and the direction in which we advance.    [Question] We have read some materials stating that at the  time there was a trend of thought on completely negating Mao  Zedong, but Comrade Huang Kecheng came out to make a speech and  publish an article. Comrade Xiaoping presided over the work of  drafting the "Decision on Several Historical Problems of the  Party Since the Founding of the Nation," and he demanded an  overall assessment of Mao Zedong, and a special chapter on "the  historic status of Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought"  within the historic decision. Was the trend of thought on  negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought that serious at the  time?    [Gong] It has to be divided into several levels and  domains. One kind was the comments from overseas, Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and society, and these comments were very strong, that  is, they completely negated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought.  To this extent, they completely negated the CPC. The other  kind was certain comments within the party, and even though some  of these comments were rather extreme and some were rather  erroneous, they were different in nature from the first kind.  However, it is not advisable to look at historical questions  with an agitated and absolutist attitude and without an  analytical attitude. In the course of presiding over the work  to draft the historic decision, Comrade Xiaoping spoke  frequently, criticizing and refuting certain viewpoints; he was  getting at something. In addition, some people specializing in  theoretical work suggested that the concept of Mao Zedong  Thought should no longer be used; they said that if Mao Zedong's  name is used to name a certain system of thought, then Mao  Zedong's "leftist" mistakes should be included as well. They  held that it would be unjustifiable to include only the correct  things while excluding the incorrect things. I disagree with  this viewpoint. I think that since our party has used the  concept of Mao Zedong Thought for so many years, if the concept  were to be written off at a single stoke, this would not be  beneficial politically, nor would it conform to history, and not  conforming to history is not conforming to a scientific  attitude. The fact of history is: The integration of Marxism  with the practice of revolution in China has resulted in a  scientific theoretical achievement. Can we deny this fact? As  for how this theoretical achievement should be named, this is a  secondary problem. Since in the past we have used Mao Zedong  Thought to refer to this theoretical achievement, and Mao Zedong  has indeed made the greatest contribution to the creation of  this theoretical achievement, we have no need or reason now to  cancel the term. What we should do now is to use practice to  examine many of the viewpoints that were raised in the past, to  see which have been proven correct through practice and which  viewpoints practice has proved erroneous. In addition, we  should use the name Mao Zedong Thought to refer to the  scientific theoretical achievement of the central leading  collective represented mainly by Mao Zedong, and should  distinguish it from the mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his  later years.    The mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his later years must  be negated, but Mao Zedong's great historical merits and the  scientific theoretical achievement of Mao Zedong Thought never  can be negated. We must adopt a scientific and analytical  attitude when dealing with the history of the party and of the  people's revolution. We must not write off everything at one  stoke, nor must we completely negate its basic achievement when  we have to correct mistakes arising from the historical process.  Of course, neither can we lack the boldness and resolution to  correct these mistakes while safeguarding the basic achievement.  We must see clearly the following fact: Mao Zedong is closely  linked to the history of the CPC and of the Chinese people's  revolution. Completely negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong  Thought means completely negating the history of the CPC and of  the Chinese people's revolution.    In 1983, when the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  (1975-83) were published, I wrote an article for RENMIN  RIBAO entitled "An Important Document of China's Marxism," in  which I wrote: "Concerning the problem of how to deal with the  mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong during his later years, as  well as with Mao Zedong Thought, our party's political courage  and leading ability have undergone the sternest test." Under  conditions of the Mao Zedong cult reaching its zenith through  the Cultural Revolution -- and that at that time the central  leaders were still adhering to the two "whatevers," -- Comrade  Xiaoping courageously came out and said: The two "whatevers"  were not in accordance with Marxism; Mao Zedong made mistakes  during his later years and those mistakes were serious. This  demonstrated the great political courage of a Marxist. In the  course of correcting this kind of mistake, there emerged a trend  of thought that doubted and negated the historical status of Mao  Zedong, as well as Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Xiaoping came  out again to "prevail over all dissenting views," demanding that  the party explicitly affirm the most basic achievement of  China's revolution, safeguard Mao Zedong's historical status,  and uphold and develop Mao Zedong Thought. The political  courage in these two areas surfaced in an environment in which a  great historical turning point was taking place. The political  courage of Comrade Xiaoping in these two areas enabled our party  to pass this great historical turning point in a relatively  smooth, steady, and healthy manner. Without the first  condition, there would have been no historical turning point,  and we might still be dragging our feet along the original road.  Without the second condition, the turning point might not have  been good and might have caused chaos, and those things that  completely deviated from the revolutionary track would have run  rampant. These two areas faced a relatively strong kind of  trend in which steering the helm of history required great  political and theoretical courage, as well as the resolution and  boldness of a revolutionary.    [Question] This is the charisma of a great man, for no  ordinary man could have done it.    [Gong] Also he has to give reasons: Charisma, plus  authoritativeness, plus reasons; and reasons mean theory.  Comrade Xiaoping was situated in an influential position. In  addition, he had such resolution and charisma, and he also gave  reasons, which he discussed with the whole party, so as to  concentrate the wisdom of the whole party. He not only broke  the taboo of the two "whatevers" and corrected the mistakes made  by Mao Zedong in his later years, but also gave a scientific  explanation of Mao Zedong Thought, made a scientific judgment of  the right and wrong things in history, and gave a scientific  plan for the road to be followed in the future. That was the  historical background against which the Sixth Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee made the "Decision on Several  Historical Problems of the Party Since the Founding of the  Nation."    Why did a historic decision have to be made at that time?  Because there was a need for a conclusion on the right and  wrong things in the history of the Cultural Revolution. It was  not an easy thing to judge and determine that the Cultural  Revolution was basically a mistake, and to foster such a  consensus within the party. The two "whatevers," first and  mainly, involved three things: First, the Tiananmen incident;  second, the "campaign to criticize Deng and strike back at the  right-deviationist trend of overthrowing verdicts"; and third,  the Cultural Revolution. These three things could not be shaken  because they were decided by Chairman Mao. The Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee criticized the two  "whatevers" and settled the first two things, but the third --  whether the Cultural Revolution was right or wrong -- was left  unsolved. Later, the "historic decision" solved the third  thing, clearly pointing out the basic mistake in the practice  and theory of the Cultural Revolution, and analyzing the cause  and development of the "leftist" mistake in the Cultural  Revolution. Thus, the basic problems could be regarded as  having been solved, and the problems that remained unsolved were  less important ones, such as the criticism of the movie "The  Biography of Wu Xun," which could be settled through other means  and methods.    Therefore, the "historic decision" was first, to "sort out  the chaos," which was to clearly determine and completely  correct the mistakes in Cultural Revolution; second, to "bring  things back onto the right track," which meant, while correcting  the mistakes, to affirm the most basic practical and theoretical  achievements in China's revolution and socialist development, to  affirm the historical status of Mao Zedong, and to affirm the  scientific principle of Mao Zedong Thought. After adopting the  "historic decision," the CPC Central Committee announced: The  party's duty -- to sort out chaos and bring things back onto the  right track in the area of guiding thought -- basically had been  accomplished.    [Question] Judging from the development of the party's  undertakings in the new period, it seems that these two  conditions alone are not sufficient.    [Gong] These two conditions alone -- sorting out chaos and  bringing things back onto the right track -- still remained  within Mao Zedong's theoretical and practical domain, and were  nothing more than correcting the incorrect things through  practice and examination, and upholding the correct things. New  innovations have to be made in the new period.    Among correction, inheritance, and development, the  combination of the first two means sorting out chaos and  bringing things back onto the right track, and the combination  of the last two means inheriting from the past and opening up a  new situation. Overall reform means opening up a new situation,  exploration, innovation, and development. The new period has  met with many new problems. So-called new problems mean new  conditions which we did not come cross in the time of Mao  Zedong, as well as many problems arising from new needs, or  problems we encountered in the time of Mao Zedong but we did not  solve properly. From domestic to foreign policies, the reform  and opening up have met with many new problems, which require  innovative solutions from us. Regarding the problems of  exploration and innovation, these cannot be solved simply by  distinguishing the right things from the wrong things in Mao  Zedong's theoretical and practical domains. To correctly  understand the new problems arising from the new situation and  to solve them innovatively, it is necessary to enable Mao Zedong  Thought to have a new development.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, our party has indeed had a new development in the  area of theory. It is very important to honestly understand and  admit this point. It is a correction of the mistakes made by  Mao Zedong in his later years on the one hand, and on the other,  an inheritance from the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought.  At the same time, it is a new development in solving the new  problems of the new period in which we face a new situation.    [Question] That means a new theoretical framework has been  formed.    [Gong] Perhaps we may say that it has begun to take shape.  As to the concept and language that should be used to sum it  up, that is a decision for the central leadership. The 13th  party congress used the wording "the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics." Since Comrade Xiaoping  made his southern tour speech, I have noticed that some central  documents have used the wording "the theory and line of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics advocated by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping," and the wording "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics." All these  have further emphasized Comrade Xiaoping's status in  establishing the theory, as well as the main content of  "building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the inheritance and development of Mao Zedong  Thought under new historical conditions. Why must we use a  single concept to sum it up? Precisely because it has not  simply added several trifles on the foundation of the  theoretical achievement already secured by Comrade Mao Zedong,  but has made a relatively great advance, and has involved a  series of searches, new explorations, and new creations  beginning to form a set of new theories, and so there has to be  a new summation.    I feel that on the one hand, there indeed has to be a new  summation because a new theory has begun to take shape. On the  other, just as proposing Mao Zedong Thought as a new concept at  the seventh party congress did not mean abandoning  Marxism-Leninism, advocating Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics at this time does not  mean abandoning Mao Zedong Thought. From Mao Zedong's theory  and practice, the root of and the preparation for the new theory  can be found, and there is a linking spirit, which illustrates  the relationship between Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought:  Inheritance and development.    [Question] You have just mentioned the linking spirit. Does  this mean that between Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping there exist  some common features?    [Gong] I think it would be very meaningful to carry out a  comparative study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. For example,  their greatest point in common is that they stressed "seeking  truth from facts." When Comrade Xiaoping talked about Mao  Zedong Thought, what he talked most was seeking truth from  facts. He thought that this was the quintessence of Mao Zedong  Thought. He said himself: I am one in the clique that seeks  truth from facts. In his southern tour speech he stressed again:  "Seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Marxism. This  must be advocated in stead of book worship. We do not rely on  book worship to make our reform and opening up a success; we  rely on practice and seeking truth from facts." I adhere to  "one rule, which is that I believe Mao Zedong's words on seeking  truth from facts." Some people are not comfortable with this  advocacy; they think that there are several volumes of the works  of Mao Zedong on a great variety of topics -- such as political  theory, military theory, and cultural thoughts -- so how can we  mention just the four characters "seeking truth from facts?" In  fact, the ultimate reason why Mao Zedong Thought could have so  many creations that suited China's conditions in the political,  military, and cultural areas was because he could seek truth  from facts and integrate Marxism with China's practice, and not  just copy from books or foreign experience. When Comrade  Xiaoping stressed that seeking truth from facts was the  quintessence of Mao Zedong Thought and of Marxism, he wanted us  to understand correctly and grasp the position, viewpoint, and  method of Mao Zedong Thought, and to create new theories for  ourselves in response to the new situation.    The root of our socialist ideology is certainly the  scientific socialism of Marx. They derived many concrete  conclusions in those years, but from then to now, some 100 years  have elapsed, and the situation has changed tremendously. Just  as Comrade Xiaoping has said, we cannot ask Marx to provide  concrete conclusions for us to solve the problems arising 100 or  1,000 years after his death. By the same token, Lenin cannot  take responsibility for things that happen 50 or 100 years after  his passing. The real Marxist- Leninists must inherit and  develop Marxism-Leninism according to their understanding of the  current situation. This remark was contained in his May 1989  speech. If the descendants confine themselves to the framework  of concrete conclusions given by their predecessors, they will  bind their own minds, feet, and hands. When Mao Zedong  criticized dogmatism in the past, he said that we should not  copy concrete conclusions, but grasp the basic position,  viewpoint, and method, and use them to face China's reality and  solve new problems. We also must study and learn from the  scientific results of our predecessors, for we cannot do without  knowledge. In the final analysis, however, we must apply those  results to today's objective reality, raise new questions, and  solve new problems. Therefore the ideological line of seeking  truth from facts remains the most important thing.    Regarding the concrete conclusions on socialism, one is the  model provided by the Soviet Union, the other is the idea Mao  Zedong had in his later years. Comrade Xiaoping did not copy  from these, but grasped the spirit of seeking truth from facts,  and brought all the past concrete conclusions on socialism, for  examination according to the practice and development of today.  By so doing he could make innovations, and have the great  political and theoretical courage to break through the  ideological trammels so as to open up a new situation of  socialist reform, opening up, and modernization in China.    For example, Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong, as strategists,  have a very big point in common: In China's democratic  revolution, one of the very important rules of Mao Zedong's  strategic thinking was to go to the rural areas to establish  revolutionary bases, and follow the road of surrounding cities,  village by village. It was Mao Zedong who used and developed  Marxism in an innovative way, found a breakthrough point in the  rural areas where the rule of China's reactionary forces was  weaker, and opened up the road on which China's proletariat and  peasants united as allies so as to increase their strength.  This was the revolutionary road with Chinese characteristics.  The problem of rural areas and peasants has always occupied a  central position in China's revolution. Today, Comrade Xiaoping  is leading China to reform, and in his strategic thinking too,  rural areas and peasants have always occupied a very important  position in China's reform. Therefore, since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's reform has  started from the rural areas, and has scored results. In my  opinion, in China's revolutionary strategy and reform strategy,  if the point of rural areas and peasants is grasped, China's  characteristics are grasped. Those who do not understand  China's conditions cannot understand this basic strategic point.  Both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping thoroughly understood China's  conditions and Chinese history, and both of them have  flesh-and-blood connections to rural areas, where the majority  of the Chinese population is to be found, so they knew the  status of peasants in China, and they knew how to grasp this  basic point when solving China's problems.    China's unbalanced revolutionary development is a problem we  may cite as another example. Mao Zedong once expounded on this  issue profoundly when he criticized "left-deviationist"  dogmatism. He criticized the "left-deviationists" as having an  acute revolutionary disease, meaning that they were anxious to  realize a nationwide revolutionary peak, and they failed to see  that in a big country such as China, the development of the  revolution will be unbalanced in different periods and in  different places, and this kind of imbalance originates from  China's unbalanced political and economic development. Now we  are carrying out reform, opening up, and modernization  construction, and Comrade Xiaoping also has raised the issue of  the unbalanced development of construction in China. It also  includes two areas: First, the imbalance of development in  different periods; for example, the imbalance of economic growth  rates in different years belongs to this area. Second, the  imbalance of different regions; for example, allowing some  regions, enterprises, and people to become rich first, and the  gradual advancement of opening up from the coastal regions to  the interior, belong to this area. Speaking from strategic  thinking, this is to grasp the unbalanced development of China,  including political, economic, educational, cultural, and  geographical imbalances, and proceeding from this basic point,  to seek the most effective development method on the foundation  of the unbalanced development, to stimulate development through  the unbalanced development, and to realize comparatively  balanced development in the future.    To conclude, it is very meaningful to carry out a  comparative  study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Here we see common  things, things that are linked, and things that are inherited  from and surpass the predecessors. When descendants inherit  things left behind by predecessors, and when they sum up the  experiences and lessons of their predecessors, they should be  able to see more clearly and walk more vigorously than their  predecessors.

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Vans boost commercial vehicle sector THE START of a recovery in the van market helped to push sales of all commercial vehicles last month to a level 4.4 per cent higher than a year before. It was the second consecutive monthly year-on-year increase. The sector has taken much longer than cars to emerge from recession, but there are growing signs that a recovery is under way. New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 16,148 last month from 15,465 in October last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. But registrations for the first 10 months of the year at 169,359 were still 2.2 per cent lower than a year earlier. Demand for medium-sized vans has also begun to pick up, albeit from a low base. The first signs of recovery in the heavy-truck segment of the market came late last year as hauliers began to replace ageing fleets. Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 14.4 per cent in the first 10 months of the year to 30,314, while sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) jumped 23.4 per cent in the same period to 17,045. During the recession heavy-truck sales more than halved from 38,935 in the whole of 1989 to 16,118 in 1991 and 16,427 last year. Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, and the Swedish producers Scania and Volvo have gained most ground and drawn most benefit from the Daf collapse with their sales volumes increasing by between 35 per cent and 45 per cent this year. European truckmakers, hit by a heavy fall in new-truck sales in continental Europe, are concentrating marketing efforts on the UK - virtually the only European market where sales are growing. MAN, the German truckmaker which took control of its UK importer/distributor last year from the Lonrho trading group, increased its sales by 66 per cent in the first 10 months. Registrations of medium vans and pickups (1.81 tonnes to 3.5 tonnes) rose by 15.2 per cent in October following an 11 per cent rise year-on-year in September. The increases have begun to compensate for the continuing weakness of the market earlier in the year, although sales for the first 10 months at 75,890 were still 2.1 per cent lower than the same time last year. Light van sales (up to 1.8 tonnes) have remained the most depressed segment of the market, reflecting continuing uncertainty among small businesses and traders. Sales details, Page 10</p>

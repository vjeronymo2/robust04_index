			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Disturbing conspiracy to gild the lily - Stratagems used by accountancy firms to inflate fee income when reporting their results New draft reporting guidelines from a little-known sub-committee of the Accounting Standards Board have fallen into the hands of the Financial Times. They make disturbing reading. The document is called Hype 1, How You Present Earnings, a recommended statement of financial reporting practice for British accountancy firms. It should be read in conjunction with the latest fee income figures produced by the firms last week. It contains a series of basic rules to be followed by firms in preparing their results. The first chapter is a framework 'statement of principles' on which all the detailed rules are based. Its principal recommendation is: Decide the figures you want and aim for them. Firms should be publicly required to deride the importance and reliability of the figures. Privately many readers - most importantly existing and potential clients - take the results seriously. They are important for marketing and morale. As a result, the full force of creative accountancy should be used to help in their compilation. The most important detailed proposals are as follows: Alter the year-end yearly. Using significantly different year-ends from other firms makes comparisons between firms more difficult and ensures that income-generating or -depressing events can be excluded or included as necessary. This also makes easier explanations of discrepancies from the general trend - which may or may not correspond with the actual treatment of the figures. Change the comparatives. Less assiduous readers may not bother to check last year's published figures and simply look at the re-stated version of the previous year in the new set of results. For the more assiduous, the explanations for the variations can include the suggestion that the old version was produced with too tight a timetable to permit proper assessment, or that important new accounting systems have been introduced which now permit a more reliable estimate of last year's results. Create dissonance around de-consolidation. If total fee income must be broken down between different categories - audit, tax, consulting, insolvency, and so on - there is no reason why these headings need correspond too strictly to the billed time of the respective departments. Gild by association. Include in the figures as much income as possible from autonomous regional partnerships, associate and affiliate firms or other arm's-length entities. The guiding rule is that they should be included if there is a marketing advantage in doing so; linkage in any formal, legal sense such as profit-sharing is irrelevant. Juggle off-shore subsidiaries. Play around with operations or affiliates in regions such as the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Northern Island. Ideally throw in additional income from international networks of firms too. Swell with secondments. Any contributions made by affiliates overseas to staff on secondment can be added in; but it may be useful to exclude these staff from the totals of professional staff to reduce the apparent cost base of the firm. Subsidise with non-subsidiary subsidiaries. Consulting operations, financial service advice and other areas well beyond the traditional remit of accounting firms are all welcome inclusions to increase total reported fee income. Confuse income and costs. Include items such as goods like software packages and computer equipment which have been bought on behalf of and then sold on to clients. Add the effects of acquisitions. Consider the scope for taking a substantial amount of the year's income from any mergers with other accountancy firms. A final section of Hype 1 deals with implementation, which stresses that early adoption of the guidelines is encouraged. The most significant recommendations are: Agree the ground rules in advance. Most of the larger firms meet to discuss the format of the figures long before publication. The biggest eight firms have separate gatherings for senior partners and public relations officers on the subject, and Group A - the tier below - also hold such meetings. Do not trust the competitors. Ideally co-ordinate a simultaneous release of the firm's figures to the press and to competitors. Then break that schedule to allow time to inspect everyone else's results and tweak the results to provide the desired position in the rankings. Though Hype 1 has not yet been released for discussion and comment, many of its recommended practices seem to have been implemented by the UK's accountancy firms, as the presentation of the figures last week clearly shows. Commentators should perhaps not complain. The firms - as they constantly stress - are private partnerships which are under no obligation to produce any results at all. And some are making improvements to disclosure: KPMG produced separate figures for corporate finance forthe first time this year, for instance. Equally, even the more creative approaches to reporting listed have been unable to completely conceal the impact of the recession. The top 30 firms reported near static income in the last year, below inflation although totalling about Pounds 3.4bn. The number of partners and professional staff dropped by 4 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Stripping out the effects of the few firms defying the general trend, the pattern looks far more gloomy. Only 7 of the top 20 firms reported any rises in income - generally at very modest rates. Of these, two had large contributions from unusual activities - consulting and financial services - two had mergers, and one added a substantial number of new offices. Growth in insolvency income - in as far as the category can be trusted  - at 10.8 per cent was clearly insufficient to compensate for the decline in other forms of income, notably audit, which provides 41 per cent of all fee income and was down by 2.4 per cent. But there is almost certainly worse to come. The 'leverage' or ratio of professional staff to partners has fallen across the larger firms. In other words, there is a shrinking number of salaried staff supporting each partner. It is highest - at 15 - for Andersen, down to as low as 9 at Price Waterhouse. Leverage by the 'Big 6' firms remains above those of their smaller rivals - if they can be considered competition - but the decline almost certainly suggests that more partners will need to be shed in the future if incomes of the remainder are to be sustained. There is one important final section circulated as an appendix to Hype 1: 'All accountancy firms should publish their true profit figures,' it recommends. 'This will disprove the rumours of financial instability affecting them and demonstrates the underlying strength of the business. With the firms as large and powerful as they are, there is also a strong and legitimate public interest in producing these details.' Just kidding.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): On a wing and a profit European tour operators should be keeping an eye on Vassilis Plevris, writes Kerin Hope. The chairman of Cretan Airlines, a charter operator based on his native island of Crete, runs the only Greek carrier making a profit. Plevris started out as a theology teacher on Crete after paying his way through university by working as a bell-hop at one of the island's first big hotels. Now he owns two luxury hotels near Heraklion, the capital. Together with a group of Cretan hoteliers and travel agents, Plevris decided two years ago that there was room for a local airline to carry package tourists to Crete from Germany, their main market. So the moment Greece permitted private airlines to start competing with Olympic, the state carrier, Plevris and his friends leased two Airbuses from Adria, the Slovenian airline, and started flying. No matter that their German agent, the tour operator Mit Uns Reisen, went bust this season, owing Cretan Airlines Dr800m (Pounds 2m); Cretan now controls 5 per cent of the total package tourist market to the island and forecasts modest profits this year of around Dr32m. There is room for growth: next year, more than 3.6m tourists are expected to visit Crete, a 20 per cent rise on this year. Cretan already offers scheduled flights to Athens at lower prices than Olympic. Its 3,000 shareholders are encouraged to fly the flag - Cretans are notoriously chauvinistic about their island. Cretan also lays on charter flights to Paris for locals in winter - the time of year when islanders have the time to spend the money they make out of tourism. The ebullient Plevris is an archetypal Zorba the Greek character; board meetings are likely to continue at the cafeneion to the accompaniment of Cretan cheeses and generous measures of tsikouthia, the island firewater. Plevris now wants to start island-hopping routes across the Aegean for tourists based on Crete. Cretan is acquiring two new Dornier 30-seater aircraft. Eventually, he wants Cretan to become a regional carrier for the south east Mediterranean. Now that Olympic is finally being restructured, plenty of experienced airline executives are available. Plevris expects to reinforce Cretan's technical and marketing arms with energetic managers keen to take early retirement from the public sector.</p>

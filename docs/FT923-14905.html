			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The big scoop I BEHAVED out of character last weekend. I went to the shops and bought myself a present, an Italian ice cream machine that, even as we speak, is churning out pail after pail of ice cream and sorbet (sherbet, to Americans)  -flaming fudge sundae, chestnut parfait, old-fashioned strawberry, tutti-frutti. It cost Pounds 250, which is why its purchase was out of character for a simple soul like me. To judge from readers' letters, there is a widely-held view that life, for me, is just a bowl of cherries. That nice things happen to me every day of the week. Exotic travel. Breakfast with Virginia Bottomley. Visits to racing stables. Tea with dowagers. Afternoon roulette. Outings to the theatre. The ear of Jacques Delors. Invitations to join the Committee to Elect Ross Perot. But the fruits of the loom are not easily gained. If nice things happen to me, you can bet there is a reason for it. Nor is my sangfroid exactly what it seems. I am like a waterfowl: galleonesque above the surface, but paddling furiously underneath. For most of the time I live quite quietly. I do not have a choice, for my life is circumscribed by the terrible scrutiny of my executive assistant, Miss Lee, a Jaeger-clad nd an elephant's memory who monitors my movements like a Cold War satellite. I am Miss Lee's thrall and bondman; she treats me like an insect. (There is a good American expression to cover this sort of thing, but as it is rudely tinted I had better not employ it). I have very few possessions: a flat, a car and a television; two pairs of shoes and two-and-a-half-suits; some books and tennis balls; a porcelain Dalmatian (I used to have a real one, liver-spotted, who lived to 13 1/2 - my brain misses him enormously, refuses to accept his absence, still sees him on the street, or running across the common); a painting by John Bellany and a camellia in a tub. To which I have now added an ice cream machine. Its purchase was an act of rebellion. Last Saturday, Miss Lee relaxed her satellite watch over my affairs for about 47 minutes, which enabled me to bus to Selfridges and, down in the basement, to purchase a Gaggia Gelatiera, a splendid machine, product of the space age, which, starting from scratch, can make perfect ice cream or sorbet in about 30 minutes. What a week I have had. Bitter chocolate ice cream. Coconut ice cream. Zabaglione. Hazelnut and toasted almond ice cream. Prune sorbet. Papaya and mango sorbet. I have even learned how to translate American measurements into Imperial ones (my ice cream book is American), though it requires deftness and concentration. In a further act of defiance, I have bought ice cream glasses and spoons, and a beautiful silver scoop. As the ozone layer vanishes and the Earth heats up, I shall retreat deeper and deeper into my kitchen, into a world of peppermint snowballs and chocolate mousse topping. The only sticky moment came when I offered Miss Lee a scoop of banana ice cream. She does not approve of my machine, mainly because it was bought without her authority. She prodded the offering suspiciously. 'Michael, are you sure these were fresh bananas? Your banana purchasing is invariably erratic.' All this ice cream has had a soothing effect. I have not read the papers this week. They have been full of the usual squawking. Instead, I have turned (once again) to the New Yorker essays of E B White. In 1935, White penned a perfect little essay called 'Technological Progress.' He was lamenting the loss of a lighthouse-keeper's job because of the invention of a gas buoy capable of winking a mechanical warning to shipping, thus putting the keeper and his family profoundly out of business. 'The empty lighthouse,' wrote White, 'seemed a symbol of all that is going on in the world: new devices putting men and their families out of work . . . Science, blessing us with gas buoys, is a hard master and perhaps an evil one, giving us steel for flesh, dole for wages, solving every problem except the essential one: what to do about the pride of a former lighthouse-keeper, who doesn't want relief, who wants bread earned by toil, seeing his light shine afar.' When Tina Brown telephones me tomorrow to ask how best to edit The New Yorker, I shall tell her to read a lot of E B White and consume great quantities of banana ice cream.</p>

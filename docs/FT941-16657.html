			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Analysts differ on US equity targets in 1994 - The outlook for Wall Street Although the US stock market posted solid enough gains in 1993 (the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose almost 14 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by 7 per cent), they paled in comparison to the stellar performance of many overseas equity markets. Wall Street last year lagged behind the main bourses in Europe, where share prices rose by an average of 39 per cent, primarily because the US was at a different stage in the interest rate cycle. Having fallen sharply in 1991 and 1992, interest rates stabilised in the US last year, albeit at historically very low levels. In comparison, interest rates in Europe were still on the way down throughout 1993. What is more, European rates look as if they have further to fall as Germany, France, and to a lesser extent, the UK, ease monetary policy to boost economic growth. In the US, however, rates can only go one way: up. That means the US may again be outshone by foreign markets in 1994, even although stocks in Europe will find it tough to match last year's returns. So what do strategists at the top securities houses on Wall Street expect the US market to do this year? Although there is a reasonable consensus about how the economy and interest rates will perform - the former will grow, but not particularly strongly, while the latter will rise, but not particularly far or fast - and a general agreement that corporate earnings will continue to improve, there are differences over how share prices will move. Wall Street's most well-known optimist is Elaine Garzarelli, the high-profile market analyst at Lehman Brothers, who expects stocks to rise between 10 per cent and 15 per cent this year. If her most optimistic forecast is met, the Dow will end the year at over 4,300, and the S &amp; P at 535. Her confidence is based upon the expectation that short-term interest rates will not rise by much in 1994. Although the health of the economy will continue to improve, inflation will remain unthreatening (primarily because of low oil prices), so market and Fed pressure on interest rates will not be particularly strong. The only thing that could unsettle the market seriously, says Ms Garzarelli, would be a big rise in long-term interest rates - like a jump in the 30-year Treasury bond yield from its current 6.3 per cent to 7.2 per cent. This, she says, is unlikely. At the other end of the spectrum is David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, who is distinctly bearish about 1994. Mr Shulman eschews a Dow forecast, but expects the S&amp;P 500 to trade in a range between 420 and 480 (the index is currently trading around 467). His reasoning for the gloomy prognosis is simple. In 1993, the market performed well because of four factors: a once-in-a-generation long bond rally; a Dollars 5 decline in the price of oil; 18 per cent growth in corporate operating profits; and a friendly Federal Reserve. None of these positive influences, however, will be present this year, says Mr Shulman. Instead, he believes that the Fed will tighten monetary policy, the bond market will not rally, the oil price will hold near current levels, and operating profits will grow by only 11 per cent. Liquidity will also shrink, as the rise in interest rates slows down the flow of money out of short-term assets and into equities. 'Everybody's complacent' about market prospects, he warns. In between Ms Garzarelli and Mr Shulman lie the majority of Wall Street forecasts. One of the more bullish firms is SG Warburg, which has set a target for 4,200 on the Dow and 530 on the S&amp;P. Like Ms Garzarelli, the Warburg analysts Gail Dudack and Jennifer Ludington are confident that inflation will remain low during the year. Like many others, they also envisage solid profitability gains by US companies. Abby Cohen, the chief strategist at Goldman Sachs, sits roughly in the middle of the forecasting range. She is looking for stocks to rise about 10 per cent. She also makes the point, echoed across Wall Street, that equities will be increasingly decoupled from the bond market. Unlike 1993, when the bond market rally kept share prices buoyant, she expects equities significantly to outperform bonds. Where Ms Cohen stands out from the crowd, however, is in her assertion that stocks are undervalued by as much as 15 per cent on the S &amp; P in relation to inflation and interest rates. She explains: 'Our valuation approaches make the key assumption that investors are willing to pay more for a given level of earnings, cash flow or dividends when inflation and interest rates are not troublesome.' Hence she believes that inflation and bond yields will remain low in 1994. As for what Wall Street analysts have to say about particular sectors in the market, the central message to investors is stick with economically-sensitive stocks, stay away from interest rate-sensitive stocks, look out for companies with exposure to what should be an improving European economy, and keep an eye on the entertainment and media sector, especially the companies that will provide the programming for the multi-media age.</p>

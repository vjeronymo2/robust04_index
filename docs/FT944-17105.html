			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Fund managers turn to fledgling Arab bourses - The Emerging Investor Iraq's manoeuvrings, raising fears of another invasion of Kuwait, coincide awkwardly with the latest initiative from fund managers with a taste for developing countries, who are attempting to sell the Middle East as the last frontier for emerging markets investment. Having watched returns in Asia and Latin America slip earlier this year, the professionals have turned to a clutch of fledgling Arab bourses. Three funds have been launched since June, and another three are waiting to take off in the next two months - the Framlington Egypt Fund, the Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Middle East Fund and the Fleming Arab Countries Fund. In all, fund managers may have raised as much as Dollars 270m this year to invest in the region. Long constrained by political turmoil and strict government economic controls, the Middle East and North Africa got short shrift during last winter's emerging markets investment boom. Of Dollars 52bn in cross-border equity flows invested in emerging markets worldwide in 1993, a mere 0.4 per cent went into the Arab markets, according to Baring Securities. No-one is bracing for a Mideast 'miracle' and the political risk, as evidenced by Iraq's threatening moves this week, remains high. But with the peace process in full swing, the Arab boycott crumbling, the World Bank forecasting real regional GDP growth of 3.8 per cent a year in the coming decade, and most countries successful graduates of the IMF's liberalisation policies, fund managers are eager to cash in. The International Finance Corporation's emerging markets index was down by 8.5 per cent in the first half of this year, while all Arab markets - with the exception of the more mature bourse in Amman - shot up. 'The overall idea is that these countries can't go right and left, either you eat in the hands of the IMF or you don't eat at all,' said Mr Mohamad Mourabet, fund manager at Fleming Investment Management. The rush to the Middle East began earlier this year when the Omani government, seeking to boost the Muscat Stock Exchange but rein in volatility - only 70 stocks are listed for a total capitalisation of Dollars 2bn - approached Blakeney about setting up a country fund with the exclusive licence to invest on the bourse. The Dollars 52m closed-end Oryx Fund, launched in June and jointly managed by Blakeney and the Oman National Insurance company, has already invested 70 per cent of its funds and expects to be fully invested before the end of the year. Listed in London, the fund recently traded at about Pounds 7, a slight premium to net asset value. The Muscat bourse was up 17 per cent in the first half of the year. Now, says Mr Abdel Majeed, who manages Oryx, Blakeney is planning another fund to invest in unlisted securities in the Middle East and Africa. Also in June, the US's Salomon Brothers Asset Management and Morocco's Omnium Nord Africain launched the first Morocco country fund, worth Dollars 52m. The fund will start trading next year, when it is fully invested, on an exchange yet to be determined. Next came the Maghreb Fund in September. Framlington Investment Management, a unit of CCF of France, raised Dollars 30.5m from institutional investors and the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm, to invest in Tunisia and Morocco. The closed-end fund trades in Dublin. Bolstered by the success of the Maghreb Fund, Framlington announced last week its intention to raise another Dollars 30m at the end of October to invest in Egyptian securities. Other fund managers are taking a more regional approach. Foreign &amp; Colonial, the UK fund management group, is marketing a Dollars 60m closed-end fund for emerging Middle East markets. At least 65 per cent of the fund is to be invested in equities of five core markets - Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Oman - with the remainder placed in neighbouring countries, mainly Turkey and Israel, and fixed income instruments. Fleming Investment Management, meanwhile, is focusing on Arab markets only. Fleming is 'considering' launching a Dollars 50m closed-end fund concentrating on Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, but expecting also to invest in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Lebanon. Expected to be launched by the end of November, the fund will be listed in London. However, it is still early in the game. First, the region may burst into conflict again, driving countries to redirect resources into defence at the expense of economic development. Second, only five markets in the region - Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Tunisia - allow foreign investment, and this in varying degrees. Tunisia, for example, requires authorisation for every investment; thus, every purchase or sale may take up to a week. Oman, which had granted Oryx the exclusive right to channel foreign capital into the Muscat Stock Exchange, has informed other fund managers that they will be allowed to buy selected stocks, while Lebanon is set to open the Beirut bourse this year and promises open access to foreigners. Bahrain, which has 64 listed stocks, allows foreigners to invest in only four companies. Saudi Arabia boasts the largest stock market in the region with a healthy Dollars 42bn capitalisation, but it is not expected to open to foreign capital before 1997. These markets are also, for the most part, extremely illiquid. Morocco's Bourse des Valeurs, which offers the most promising prospects in the region, has a market capitalisation of Dollars 4.2bn and average monthly turnover of Dollars 60m. The Tunis stock exchange trades daily between 10 and 11am and, with 20 listed stocks, has a market capitalisation of less than Dollars 2bn. Average monthly turnover is Dollars 14m. Fund managers, of course, are all too happy to get in before the markets expand or be ready to enter when more markets open up. They are pinning their hopes on big privatisation programmes planned in most of these markets. Predictably, some programmes are moving faster than others, with the Egyptian one bogged down in bureaucracy. According to LCF Edmond de Rothschild Securities in London, lead manager of the Framlington Egypt Fund, the IMF has delayed the last of a series of Egyptian debt write-offs to pressure the government into action on the privatisation front. A more promising programme is taking place in Morocco, where the government last year selected 112 companies to sell off for a total of Dollars 2.2bn, and was able to raise Dollars 250m in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STRICT CONTROLS SOUGHT ON ADULT BOOKSTORE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking strict  controls on the operation of a North Hollywood adult bookstore where police  have made 21 lewd-conduct arrests and several prostitution arrests in the last  two years.  </P> <P> The J&amp;B Bookstore in the 10900 block of Vanowen Street has been "a center  for lewd conduct and prostitution" and needs to develop "a degree of decorum,"  said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Store Manager Steven Wiener and owners Ambros and Friederike Dragojevic, and  Dan and Silvia Gerstner could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> The suit accused them of creating a public nuisance under a section of the  state penal code called the Red Light Abatement Law, Goldstein said.  </P> <P> The civil suit asks a judge to order the store's operators to install more  lights and to hire a 24-hour private guard to patrol the premises, Goldstein  said. No court date has been set.  </P></p>

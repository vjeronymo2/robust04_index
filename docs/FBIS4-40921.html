			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev intends to visit Brussels soon, he said in an  interview today to a RIA correspondent.    During the visit the Russian minister expects to meet U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Kozyrev will discuss  with the NATO leadership the questions of signing a NATO frame  document for the Partnership for Peace and a Moscow-proposed  programme of strategic cooperation between Russia and NATO. The  latter document would determine the main documents of  Russia-NATO cooperation with regard to the role and weight of  Moscow in world affairs.    We believe, noted the Russian minister, that it is necessary  to sign both documents simultaneously and will be ready to do it  depending on how soon the entire required preparatory work will  be completed in NATO headquarters. Kozyrev said that he could  not give the precise date of his visit to Brussels since this  question has to be agreed with all the parties concerned.</p>

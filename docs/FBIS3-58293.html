			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Klaus </F> Wirtgen and Olaf Petersen in Cyprus; date not given: "When I Am  Chancellor...."]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Scharping, you have been  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] for  only six months and you are the youngest chairman of the postwar  period. There are some indications that in autumn you might  become the youngest chancellor. Does this speed not sometimes  frighten you?    [Scharping] No.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is a lot of self-confidence for a  46-year-old from the provinces in Mainz.    [Scharping] At 46 one is right in the middle of one's life  -- hopefully. Should I apologize for having learned and done  many things when I was younger?    [DER SPIEGEL] How do you respond to the skepticism that you,  as a foreign policy layman, are challenging the statesman Kohl?    [Scharping] As far as I know no one has yet been born  chancellor. And what someone can do outside depends very much  on what he achieves at home: in overcoming mass unemployment,  in dealing properly with public finances, for more social  justice or ecological modernization.    [DER SPIEGEL] Kohl can show off his official visits. You  are touring districts in Rhineland-Palatinate and undergoing  training in a fitness room to get broad shoulders.    [Scharping] Fitness is always good. I will certainly not be  accused by anyone of not fulfilling my office properly. This  includes direct contacts and a precise knowledge of the inner  workings of a country. Whoever has spent a long time on the  stage in Bonn, removed from everything else, no longer knows  everyday life. A chancellor should not just tour flourishing  landscapes in the Far East but also get to know the misery in  the east close by, in the new laender.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not frightened by the prospect of  becoming chancellor right in the middle of a crisis?    [Scharping] No question, this is a serious challenge. But  things depend not only on one person alone but also on the  quality of the team. I am very confident in this respect. The  SPD will have no problems in being better in any office than the  current government.    [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you going to nominate, and when are  you going to present them?    [Scharping] On 22 June we will first adopt the government  program. Then we will name the people -- mostly men and women  who are already working on the government program.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will there be fewer ministries in a Scharping  government?    [Scharping] Quite certainly. The former Ministry of Youth,  Family, Women's Affairs, and Health has been turned into three  ministries. I think this is superfluous. It is not absolutely  necessary that the Ministry of Education and Science as well as  the Ministry of Research and Technology are separate. When the  postal reform has been completed, we will no longer need the  respective ministry. And a Construction Ministry in which one  official coordinates the work of three state secretaries is also  absurd.    [DER SPIEGEL] Under Kohl the number of parliamentary state  secretaries rose to 26. Will you abolish these expensive  servants of the state?    [Scharping] In any case, there will be clearly fewer of  them.    [DER SPIEGEL] The FRG is also in a political crisis: The  trust in the people's parties is waning, there are right-wing  extremist trends, and in the east the Party of Democratic  Socialism, the successor of the Socialist Unity Party of  Germany, is getting more and more followers. Do you see any  dangers for democracy?    [Scharping] The stability and the ability of the democratic  institutions to act are being affected. Major and minor  scandals are one thing. Second, the citizens realize that  decisive politicians -- in particular after 1989 -- do not say  what they think and do not do what they say. And third, the  people are right to say that many politicians' ability to expect  their own followers to accept unpleasant truths is clearly  lagging behind the inclination to inflict new burdens on the  followers of the other parties.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see a way out?    [Scharping] We will get out of this situation probably only  if the citizens and those who hold responsibility in the parties  realize that in politics, and also in everyday life, one needs a  different mode of behavior than the one that has become usual in  the west German distribution society: Solidarity and internal  peace mean not only that the weak should stick together but also  require the model of the elites. And without unemployment, the  lack of housing, and the bitter social injustices one cannot  explain the rising outrage and the political extremism.    After all, there is a great readiness to get involved. Look  at the many citizens' initiatives. When these people no longer  let themselves be integrated into the large parties, the trade  unions, or the churches, this must have something to do with the  state of affairs in these institutions. Therefore, we have  consistently modernized the SPD, and we are also giving  independent experts a chance.    [DER SPIEGEL] Have you already resigned yourself to the fact  that your party will get stuck in the 30-percent range?    [Scharping] No, of course not. However, one must realize  that a high turnout and large shares in the votes by the two  large parties were phenomena in particular of the 1970's. In  this respect, we now have some sort of normalization, which  naturally bothers me. Without people's parties, at least  without the SPD, there will be no social democracy in Germany.  However, in the meantime we have already been achieving quite  respectable results again....    [DER SPIEGEL] But still below 40 percent -- this is  certainly a reason why party colleagues of yours, like  ex-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, are flirting with the majority  voting system.    [Scharping] I am not.    [DER SPIEGEL] Because in Mainz you are ruling together with  the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would not then  exist any more?    [Scharping] No, because I am convinced that our voting  system has proved its worth. I think the parties should rather  try to convince the citizens of the quality of their policy and  themselves than think about how a stability that does not really  exist can be fabricated with the help of the election system.    [DER SPIEGEL] It has always been one of your political  principles not to talk about coalitions before elections. Why  is it that you now rule out a grand coalition at the federal  level so definitely?    [Scharping] Have you ever asked this question of someone  from the Union? No one wants a grand coalition. Nor will there  be one.    [DER SPIEGEL] But you, like us, know that there may be an  election result that hardly permits anything else than an  elephants' wedding -- just as in Baden-Wuerttemberg.    [Scharping] Why should I worry about necessities at a time  when I have the possibility to use every ounce of my strength to  make sure that this does not happen.    [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds different.    [Scharping] No, I would like to repeat: There will be no  grand coalition, before or after the elections.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your big election campaign topic -- employment  and social justice -- was also the focus of the unsuccessful  campaigns of Johannes Rau and Oskar Lafontaine. Why should it  be successful this time?    [Scharping] In Germany we are short at least 5 million jobs,  and, thanks to the cold policy of this Federal Government,  social division has reached alarming proportions. I am sure  that citizens have become much more aware of the need for a  national employment pact than they were four or six years ago.  We are striving for this pact: easing the burden of costs on  labor; easing the burden on the companies so that they can  invest, modernize, and create jobs; easing the burden on the  social security systems constituted by tasks that are tasks for  all of society and, therefore, must be paid for by everyone --  just to cite the central points.    [DER SPIEGEL] Some proposals by the SPD Commission, which is  working out your government program, do not sound like easing  the burden. Thus, the Brandenburg social minister wants  "children's cash," with every child getting 600 German marks  [DM] per month. Can something like that be financed at all?    [Scharping] What must be urgently achieved is exempting the  subsistence minimum from taxes and easing the burden on families  with children. In this respect I agree with Regine Hildebrandt,  but I do not agree with the instrument. Furthermore, the  advantages of splitting taxes among spouses should have an upper  limit. Families with children must be better off in the future.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your deputy, Wolfgang Thierse, calls for an  equalization of burdens between east and west or a tax for the  benefit to the east. Can the SPD win the elections in the west  with that?    [Scharping] The equalization of burdens is taking place.  More than DM150 billion is being transferred to the east every  year. The problem is not the equalization of burdens but its  wrong financing from loans and from contributions by working  people. This must be changed, because reconstruction in eastern  Germany is a common task. A debt explosion a la Waigel and the  unilateral burdens on working people ruin both solidarity and  solidity.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you do not have a "pfennig for the east"  in your government program?    [Scharping] We will develop the program on the basis of  decisions made at the Wiesbaden party congress -- and they do  not include a "pfennig for the east."    [DER SPIEGEL] Can you envisage anything else for the  reconstruction in the east?    [Scharping] Yes. I am very much in favor of using French  experiences: Prime Minister Balladur issued a loan. Instead of  the planned 40 billion francs, it yielded more than 100 billion  francs. Analogous to that, we could issue a loan for the  reconstruction in the east, but also for large infrastructure  investment or for a future investment program and make the  revenue exempt from tax.    Balladur linked the project with the possibility to  redistribute existing savings assets and to acquire an option on  purchasing shares of privatization projects, such as the  privatization of French Telecom. Now he has relegated  privatization to the back burner. However, no one prevents us  from making such a loan attractive and from making such an offer  after turning German Telekom into a shareholding company. This  also applies to other public companies.    [DER SPIEGEL] Have industry and the banks already reacted to  your idea?    [Scharping] I have talked about it with some people; such an  activity would not be considered competition. All in all, I get  the impression that the SPD and, in particular, its chairman get  a better response in many internal talks with leading industry  managers over the past four months than the Union or the  chancellor.    [DER SPIEGEL] Lafontaine demands that a government headed  by the SPD also reexamines all the social services. Does this  also mean cutbacks in unemployment benefit or sick pay?    [Scharping] No, we concluded this debate in connection with  the thrift, consolidation, and growth laws. I say it quite  clearly: When I am chancellor, we will retract the cutbacks in  bad-weather compensation, because in winter they just lead to  rising unemployment.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, nothing will be reduced after  reexamination?    [Scharping] Many things will remain as they are; regarding  other measures, the scope and purpose of the financing will be  changed, and then there can be gradual corrections, for instance  on subsidies. Specifically: We will abolish tax credits for  children for the benefit of a unified children's allowance. We  will introduce income-neutral promotion instruments for the  construction of one-family and two-family houses. We will  struggle against abuse in the tax and social system.    [DER SPIEGEL] When things get serious, the SPD also shies  away. For the sake of your government power in Duesseldorf and  Saarbruecken, you do not dare to abolish the billion-mark  subsidies for coal in the Ruhr and the Saar.    [Scharping] This has nothing to do with government power but  with industrial policy and the contribution to a certain  independence of German energy supplies.    [DER SPIEGEL] Imported coal is cheaper.    [Scharping] Giving up domestic coal for the benefit of  imported coal would be a structural break with unpredictable  consequences in the Ruhr area, in the Lausitz region, and in the  Saar. Rainer Barzel once said: "When there is fire in the  Ruhr, the waters of the Rhine will not be sufficient to  extinguish it." The steel and coal policy is a pillar of jobs  and social peace, that is, of Germany as an industrial location.    [DER SPIEGEL] After the elections in Lower-Saxony in March  the SPD will soon be facing another test. How important is the  presidential election on 23 May for the Bundestag elections?    [Scharping] At the election of the president, it will be  decided whether the Federal Assembly follows exclusively party  policy interests and thus decides against the will of the clear  majority of the population. Then there will be a new debate  about having the president elected by the people....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...which you have hitherto rejected.    [Scharping] Yes, but a considerable number of parliamentary  deputies from the Union will vote for Johannes Rau. Then one  must not forget the FDP and the three possible ballots.    [DER SPIEGEL] With Constitutional Court President Roman  Herzog the Union is backing a candidate who meets with more  approval than Steffen Heitmann.    [Scharping] The president of the Federal Constitutional  Court should be more restrained in interviews. As a party  candidate he cannot be an independent judge. If Mr. Herzog  become the candidate of the Union, he should not exercise his  office in Karlsruhe any more.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why has the SPD not suggested east German  Richard Schroeder as a candidate for all parties?    [Scharping] This is being done for Johannes Rau. He is the  best man for the office.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have often and with pleasure met with the  chancellor....    [Scharping] ....it is you who say that it is with pleasure.    [DER SPIEGEL] Could people be confused when Kohl and  Scharping attack each other publicly in the super election year  and then get together behind closed doors?    [Scharping] Kohl has once again issued an invitation for 14  January. The topic will be the move to Berlin. As regards  legislation, nursing-care insurance still has to be settled, in  addition to the postal reform. My need for small talk with  Helmut Kohl is very small. However, it is not my fault that his  government is unable to do anything useful, not even in  connection with combating organized crime.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Scharping, thank you for this interview.</p>

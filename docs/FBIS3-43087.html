Moldovyan; UDC 681.3] </F>   [Abstract] A two-stage cryptographic transformation system  with probabilistic selection of pseudo-randomly-long key  sequences from several initial secret keys is described. This  system exhibits a resitance to cryptoanalysis, based on the  known initial text and the corresponding cipher, which is  sufficient for any practical applications. The first stage  consists of preliminary preparations when the specific  transformation mechanism is rearranged, depending on the user  selected password, and the second stage is the actual coding. A  programmable three- key cryptomodule was developed, with a 2M  bit/s coding rate and 16 MHz clock frequency for applications  with IBM PC/AT type computers. With this module, it was possible  to convert any initial text into a pseudo-random train of  characters with code representation by binary numbers from 0 to  255. The frequency distribution of characters in the code was  nearly uniform, and the rms deviation was from 1 to 10%  for  different texts. This implies that statistical methods of  cryptoanalysis for deciphering such codes are not effective. It  is pointed out that in systems with a special type of addressing  to the on-line memory this method can provide much greater  coding rates. Figure 1, references: 2 Russian</p>

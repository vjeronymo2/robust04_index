			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 2 (UNI [United News of India]): The  Home Minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, on Wednesday accused the United  States of meddling in Kashmir and went to the extent of  questioning the locus standi of President Bill Clinton and his  administration challenging the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to  India.    In a hard-hitting reply in the Lok Sabha to the debate on  the  resolution extending the President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir  by another six months from Thursday, he said the United States  had a vested interest in the matter.    The House later unanimously adopted the resolution, which  has  already been approved by the Rajya Sabha.    In the first-ever strong criticism of the current US  position  on Kashmir by a senior government representative, Mr. Chavan  said the United States was "neither interested in helping  Pakistan or India, but helping themselves."    "We have to be on guard," said Mr. Chavan, wondering "what  really are their (US) intentions." The Home Minister said the  United States had raked up the issue of human rights in Kashmir  as a sort of balancing act.    He said Washington was thinking in terms of declaring  Pakistan as a State sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir. But just to  maintain a balance between that country and India, it played up  the issue of human rights in Kashmir.    Mr. Chavan said both United States and Pakistan had no  "right  or credibility" to talk of human rights and went on to recall  how human rights were crushed by the former when its supreme  national interests were involved.    As for Pakistan, it was "ridiculous" for it to talk of human  rights, he said amid cheers and mentioned how human rights were  trampled upon in the provinces of Baluchistan, Sind and  elsewhere in that country.    Mr. Chavan said he could not believe that Mr. Clinton had  not  been properly briefed on Kashmir. Again, he said, the statements  of administration official Robin Raphel questioning the Kashmir  accession to India were rather consistent.    On the other hand, three republican Senators and former US  Ambassador to New Delhi Patrick Moynihan, who had met him  recently, had categorically stated that what Ms. Raphel was  saying was not the right line. He even quoted the US Charge  D'affairs in New Delhi as having taken this position in one of  these meetings.    Mr. Chavan claimed that the United Kingdom also did not  agree  with the US line and based his claim on what was told to him by  an unnamed UK Minister.    The Home Minister said there was a qualitative improvement  in  Kashmir especially after the peaceful resolution of the  Hazratbal standoff. Pakistan was no longer getting the sort of  the peoples sympathy it used to earlier, he said.    Mr. Chavan said it was a "delicate national issue," and  appealed to all sections and political parties to exercise  restraint in their utterances on the topic.    Mr. Chavan said the government had an open mind in  discussing  Kashmir. "We have to take everybody along" in finding a solution.    He said it was wrong to describe the perpetrators of  violence  in Kashmir as "militants." They are "terrorists, nothing less,"  he added.    Mr. Chavan regretted the references during the debate to the  so-called differences between Jawaharlah Nehru and Sardar Patel  over the approach to Kashmir issue. They were tall and great  leaders and worked together to create and build an independent  India. There was absolutely nothing surprising if they had  differences of perception, if at all, on certain issues, he said.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commonwealth team to go to South Africa THE COMMONWEALTH will send a team of about a dozen prominent citizens to help end violence in South Africa and facilitate renewed constitutional negotiations, it was announced yesterday. The groundwork for the Commonwealth role was carried out last month when Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary general, visited South Africa for talks with political leaders. During his visit Chief Anyaoku won government approval for a plan setting out a Commonwealth contribution to the search for a political settlement. Many of the elements, including the suggestion that there should be close liaison with the country's National Peace Secretariat, an independent body formed last year which monitors political violence, were taken up by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to South Africa. In response to his report, the Security Council has authorised stationing UN observers in South Africa, expected to number around 30, to help end township violence. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the European Community are also expected to send teams. Yesterday the South African government accepted the report, saying it would welcome the stationing of observers in the country. 'The resolution is acceptable in its main components. Blame is not apportioned to any party. Even-handedness is maintained,' Mr Pik Botha,the foreign minister said in a statement. 'The need is emphasised to strengthen South African structures such as the National Peace Accord. So is the importance of co-operation of all parties in the resumption of the negotiation process as speedily as possible,' Mr Botha added. In its statement the Commonwealth secretariat said that Chief Anyaoku 'is hoping to constitute a group of prominent Commonwealth citizens and it is expected they will work in quiet, non-public ways in order to make a practical contribution to help end the violence.'</p>

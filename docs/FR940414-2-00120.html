(70&hyph;7201) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Leidy Hub, Inc. (``Leidy''), formerly Enerop Corporation (``Enerop''), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, a nonutility subsidiary company of National Fuel Gas Company (``National''), a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act to its application-declaration which was originally filed under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By orders dated May 1, 1986 and March 18, 1988 (HCAR Nos. 24081 and 24604, respectively), the Commission authorized, in relevant part: (1) National to loan $200,000 to Metscan, Inc. (``Metscan''), a New York corporation that has developed an electronic meter reading system (``Metscan System''), and to receive an option to convert the note (``Note'') evidencing the loan into 80,000 shares of Metscan's preferred stock, at a price of $2.50 per share; (2) National to assign the Note and option from Metscan to Enerop; (3) National to provide Enerop $442,500 as a contribution to capital, which funds Enerop was authorized to invest, together with third parties, in Metscan Technology Partners (``Partnership''), a New York partnership formed by Metscan, after which Enerop would own approximately 9.96% of the Partnership; and (4) the Partnership and Metscan to be reorganized as a corporation before the end of 1989, and Enerop to acquire approximately 7.23% of the common stock of the new corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March 18, 1988 order contained a reservation of jurisdiction over this reorganization which was released by order dated April 27, 1989 (HCAR No. 24874). The reorganization occurred on May 17, 1989, and the new corporation was called Metscan Acquisition Corporation (``MAC''). Pursuant to the reorganization, the Note and Enerop's Partnership interest attributable to the $442,500 investment were converted into 80,000 shares and 177,000 shares of MAC common stock, respectively, at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share. MAC subsequently changed its name to Metscan, Inc., and the 257,000 shares that Enerop then owned represented 6.0% of the total shares of Metscan common stock outstanding, and 5.1% of that total if shares subject to outstanding warrants and employees' options were included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By order dated September 7, 1990 (HCAR No. 25143), the Commission authorized Enerop to acquire an additional 143,000 shares of Metscan common stock for $357,500 ($2.50 per share), and 39,500 shares of Metscan Class A Preferred Stock (``Class A Preferred'') for $158,000 ($4 per share). The Class A Preferred pays a cumulative annual 7% dividend, and is convertible by the stockholders to Metscan common stock on a 1:1 basis, through July of 1995. As a result of the September 7, 1990 order, Enerop owned 9.4% of Metscan's common stock and 7.1% of Metscan's Class A Preferred, or 7.9% of such common stock if the Class A Preferred stock is converted into common stock, and if all warrants and other rights are exercised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

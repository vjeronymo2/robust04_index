			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / WHO sets out HIV strategy THE World Health Organisation yesterday launched a new Aids research strategy which it says 'could revolutionise' efforts to prevent the disease. The WHO, the United Nations health agency, will co-ordinate a campaign by the world's pharmaceutical industry to develop a safe antiviral agent capable of killing or inactivating HIV, the virus that causes Aids. It would probably take the form of a gel or foam which a woman could administer to her vagina before having sex. Dr Michael Merson, head of the WHO Aids programme, said a vaginal virucide 'would make a real difference to the future course of this epidemic'. The male condom remained the primary means of preventing HIV transmission, he said. 'However, faced with the prospect of at least 1m women being infected with HIV every year, it is clear that we need a new method to enable women to protect themselves from HIV infection.' Sperm-killing contraceptives, including the widely used nonoxynol-9, kill HIV in test-tube tests but there is no evidence that they prevent viral transmission in practice. Indeed some clinical studies suggest that their long-term use may increase the risk of infection by damaging the vaginal lining. The new strategy follows a meeting at WHO headquarters in Geneva, at which representatives of 21 drug companies (including Glaxo and Wellcome of the UK) agreed to a co-ordinated R&amp;D effort. Dr Merson said an existing compound might turn out to work in clinical trials; if so, it could be used in Aids prevention within two or three years. 'A new product may take longer to develop but this meeting has demonstrated a commitment from all sectors to a concentrated research effort.'</p>

Kim  is said to have thoroughly prepared for his "live" encounter  with the media since the middle of last month, making revisions  over the year-end weekend.    Presidential aides chose this year's tasks to be reported  and  senior press secretary Chu Ton-sik drafted the speech based on  their recommendations.    Kim, making jokes off and on, displayed confidence  throughout  the 75-minute-long conference even while receiving questions.  Writing down every question, he showed efforts to make his  answers as sincere as possible. He invited 70 reporters from  the foreign press, and the same number of Korean reporters, and  tried to give them equal chances to ask questions.    -- Unlike the June conference, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang  and all cabinet members, Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil and  leading policymakers of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, and  Chief of Staff Pak Kwan-yong and senior presidential secretaries  were present.    "New Year conference will be unveiling a blueprint for this  year's work and I think their (all cabinet, DLP [Democratic  Liberal Party] policymakers, presidential secretariat) presence  is aimed at showing the determination of the government and its  party," a presidential aide said.    Kim made his New Year speech without the help of a  teleprompter as he wanted to appear to the public as natural and  spontaneous as possible, he said.    -- President Kim Yong-sam started his New Year's press  conference by reading from prepared text for about 27 minutes  and then spent around 50 minutes answering questions. Reporters  raised their hands and Kim randomly selected 14 from Korean  media and five foreign correspondents. [passage omitted]    -- Reporters burst into laughter when President Kim Yong-sam  evaded attempts to get him to elaborate on possible improvement  in inter-Korean relations after the North Korean nuclear issue  is resolved by noting that the North Koreans were also listening  to his news conference.    Kim smiled at a question about the future of close aide Rep.  Kim Tok-yong, who was excluded from recent cabinet and party  reshuffles.    "What a strange question to ask," he said, but nevertheless  he answered it. "We (Kim and I) go back a long way. My  affection for Rep. Kim, who has been through the long and dark  opposition days, remains the same."    "Too many hands," Kim observed, when almost all reporters  shot up their arms for a chance to ask a question. Trying to  give all a chance, Kim paid attention to foreign reporters  seated at the back of the room and pointed to a woman reporter.  He also said thank you to each foreign reporter when they  finished a question.    -- Told that he depended too much on private channels in  policymaking, President Kim Yong-sam said that that was an easy  thing to say but untrue.    "You needn't worry about that, because I listen to opinions  through both public and private channels when deciding a policy  or making appointments," he said.    Kim laughed when he was described as "fearful."    "I think you say that because I did tough things in the  opposition days... I'm actually a gentle type," he said.    -- After his news conference, President Kim Yong-sam shook  hands with cabinet members, leaders of his party and reporters.  He then met with cabinet members, party leaders and senior  presidential staff to review the press conference.    "I think I couldn't give all a chance to ask... As I said in  the press conference, I hope the party and government unite in  one mind to save the country this year," he said.    Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said that he thought the foreign  reporter who asked about illegal trade union activities and high  labor costs was not fully satisfied with the president's answer,  so he went to the reporter after the press conference to explain  the government position.    Marking Kim's words that he will not hold a party convention  in May but retain Kim Chong-pil as chairman, some ministers went  up to Kim Chong-pil and jokingly congratulated him on "today's  party convention."    Chongwadae officials refused to comment on the news  conference, but hinted at satisfaction with Kim's tactfulness  and spontaneity.    Although the president evaded questions on the North Korean  nuclear problem, he made his point clear in all other issues,  the officials noted. They explained that Kim's comment that it  is wrong to stick with 30-year-old ways of working and thinking  should not be taken as his word on reorganization of the  government.    "The president did not mean government restructuring, but  some role changes considered by some ministries," Chief  Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong said.</p>

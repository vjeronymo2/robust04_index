			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana hopes for Dollars 100m from gold mine sell-off GHANA'S CASH-strapped government hopes to raise Dollars 100m this year through the sale of a 20 per cent stake of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, the country's biggest gold producer jointly owned by UK-based Lonrho group and the government. Mr Emmanuel Agbodo, the head of Ghana's privatisation programme, said the government was calling for bids from interested mining companies. Ashanti Goldfields, he said, was 'conservatively' valued at Dollars 500m. The company produced 654,293 ounces of gold in the 1991-92 fiscal year, which ended in September. The target for the present fiscal year is 744,345 ounces. At present the government of Ghana owns 55 per cent of Ashanti Goldfields. Lonrho, with 45 per cent, also has the management contract for the mines. Mr Agbodo said the government planned to reduce its shareholding to about 35 per cent. The new partners would be required to accept Lonrho's operational control of the mines. The sale, which will be Ghana's biggest sell-off exercise to date, is being handled by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. The projected Dollars 100m windfall has already been included in the government's 1993 budget. Without this pivotal source of income, the government risks derailing its carefully balanced budget - the cornerstone of World Bank-approved economic reforms. But Mr Agbodo conceded that the timing of the sale might not be to Ghana's advantage, as mining multinationals are unlikely to rush an investment decision of such magnitude. The proposed sell-off, however, underscores Ghana's commitment to pursuing one of the few privatisation programmes on the African continent. Mr Agbodo also confirmed that a Guernsey subsidiary of Gold Fields of South Africa had acquired a controlling stake of the government-owned Tarkwa underground gold mine for Dollars 2m. Tarkwa, in Ghana's western region, still has large reserves of low-grade ore, but has conducted virtually no exploration work in recent years. Gold Fields of South Africa is also looking into the possibility of purchasing the neighbouring Prestea gold deposits for a similar sum.</p>

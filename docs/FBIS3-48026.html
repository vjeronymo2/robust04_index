This was confirmed by Negri Sembilan police chief SAC  [Senior  Assistant Commissioner] 1 Abas Johar here.    Kitingan was released from the Kamunting detention camp on  December 22 last year after being held there under the Internal  Security Act since May 13,1991, and put under restricted  residence in Seremban for a duration of not more than two years.  Under the earlier restriction order, Kitingan was not allowed  to write or help to write any article that is political in  nature, hold gatherings in his house or compound or in any  building under his control or make Press statements.    Kitingan, 45, collected his release letter after police  officers escorted him from the Allson Klana Resort hotel to the  police headquarters at 12.25pm [0425 GMT].    He said he was very happy and thanked Prime Minister Datuk  Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, who is also Home Minister, for  releasing him unconditionally.    "I am very happy and I take this opportunity to thank Dr.  Mahathir for releasing me without any conditions," he told  reporters at the hotel lobby.    Kitingan said he hoped the Prime Minister would also release  other Sabah people who were still under restricted residence.    He said he would leave for Sabah tomorrow morning.    Asked if he would contest a seat in the forthcoming Sabah  State elections, he said, he would do so if he was named as a  candidate. [passage omitted]</p>

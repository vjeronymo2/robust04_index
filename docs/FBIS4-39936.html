			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 0525 GMT 11 June carries a seven-minute interview  with Griroriy Yavlinskiy, the leader of the Yabloko faction in  the Russian State Duma. The program was recorded 10 June.  Reception is good.    Yavlinskiy is speaking with an unidentified correspondent in  the lobby of the Duma. He begins by summing up the budget  debate in the State Duma. Yavlinskiy then asserts that the  Russian parliament was not properly equipped to debate the  matter properly. He says that "the Duma was not sufficiently  prepared to debate each budget amendment individually. This is  linked with the fact that neither the Duma nor, in my opinion,  any of the other representative bodies are in any way ready to  tackle the budget question as such. We lack a control chamber,  a real budget control committee. Strictly speaking, there is no  one in Russia's representative bodies independently analyzing  the budget in detail. This is a serious problem, as the budget  contains the money of every citizen of this country of ours.  Under proper conditions, there is always control over how a  government uses the money entrusted to it."    After outlining his faction's proposals to amend the budget,  noting that 73 percent of these proposals were adopted,  Yavlinskiy stresses the incompetence of the Duma to tackle the  budget. He then responds to a question on the political battles  in the budget debate.    Yavlinskiy replies: "From our point of view, this budget  does  not mirror the priorities we need to get the country out of  crisis. We have consistently said that a budget like this is  not worthy of the country. It does not expand reform, it does  not make life any easier for people, it puts up taxes, and does  not address our pressing problems. Moreover, it lacks any  priorities whatsoever. That was our stance on the budget as a  whole. so we decided that such a budget should not be passed."    Yavlinskiy then turns his attention to the military budget  and the failed attempt to increase it by 18 trillion rubles. He  portrays this as an attempt to destabilize the Russian political  situation. He says: "As for the 18 trillion, then an amendment  to the budget on that scale should be decided by the president  as the supreme commander in chief. It happened that neither the  government nor the president wanted to make such an amendment.  Strictly speaking, what were the grounds for allowing this  question to become a topic for debate? I don't think that an  individual deputy can make an amendment on that scale when the  budget is in the process of being adopted.    "The time up through 10 June has been used to create an  atmosphere of confrontation. This is a policy we are familiar  with. We have already gone through one tragedy in connection  with this policy and it is unfolding again as follows.    "There was--and there remains--a problem linked to funding  defense and the defense industry. The Duma debated the matter.  Neither the president nor the government had any amendments to  make on the matter in question. We took the decision we were  able to take within the limits of the revenue and expenditure  approved. Then, out of the blue, it was said that the upper  chamber was principally opposed to the Duma's decision, that it  was accusing it of some sort of non-statesman-like behavior's,  and that it was possible that events might so develop that the  president would address the upper chamber to say that the Duma  was not up to its job and that the real champions of the  people's happiness were in the upper chamber.    "I want to emphasize that this confrontational situation has  been created absolutely artificially. The political situation  has been aggravated for no good reason. It is hard to explain  why then, for instance, Mr. Rybkin and Mr. Shumeyko signed such  a grand treaty on accord if the impression is given that they  are constantly looking for a pretext to create a new enemy.    "As for the president, he has still to make his position  clear on this issue. The last thing I want to see and the thing  that worries me most is that this whole situation being might be  used to whip up a gigantic confrontation, between the chambers  of the Federal Assembly, and then with the president taking the  side of one of the chambers. That's the most unpleasant aspect  of this affair."</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: Europe adapts to a dragging German anchor MR Kenneth Clarke's recent announcement that he favours delaying sterling's re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism may turn out to have been well timed as well as politically expedient. For while attention in Britain was concentrated last week on the final days of Mr Norman Lamont's chancellorship and his replacement by Mr Clarke, tensions were again beginning to appear in the European Monetary System. True, the European Community's monetary committee and the EC central bank governors' committee papered over the cracks in the system in two separate reports commissioned by the special meeting of EC heads of government in Birmingham last autumn. But in Copenhagen, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank president, declared that currency co-operation in the system had 'collapsed'. For a day or two, it seemed that speculators were limbering up to force Spain into yet another devaluation. Within the group of core countries, interest rate changes were under way that could have significant effects on how the system works. At the beginning of last week, the Banque de France cut its interest rates for the seventh time in six weeks and, in the process, brought its intervention rate down to 7.5 per cent, and so below its German equivalent, the Bundesbank's 'repo' rate. The money markets' response was to quote French three months money rates of 7.44 per cent, slightly below the German 7.5 per cent level. Although the French three months rate later moved back above its German equivalent, there was a sense in European financial circles that last week marked a watershed. Last Monday, four ERM countries - France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland - had three months money rates below German levels. But while some hailed this event as proof that the tensions in the inner core of ERM currencies had dissolved, others began to fear new instability, should the role of the D-Mark as ERM anchor be called into question. The D-mark's anchor role came about by accident rather than design. It reflects the fact that the D-Mark is the preferred European currency for investors wanting to switch out of dollars or Japanese yen. It is the world's second largest reserve currency. Perhaps most important, the D-Mark has never been devalued in the EMS. That four narrow band countries could have market interest rates below German levels showed how concerned international investors are becoming about the outlook for the German currency. Relatively high inflation, mounting government deficits, weak government in Bonn and the unresolved problems of integrating eastern Germany with western Germany underline how far the fundamentals relating to the D-mark have changed since the late 1980s. However, it would be wrong to suggest that recent developments have triggered alarm in the core countries' central banks. Germany is not alone in having economic problems: indeed of the core countries only Luxembourg at present qualifies for European economic and monetary union under the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. German bankers point out that there are not that many attractive alternatives for investors in the D-mark. When it comes to operating the ERM, some currencies - such as the Belgian franc or Danish krone - are simply too illiquid to act as primary means of intervention. Nor has the French franc any track record as the system's anchor. Certainly, the Banque de France is not writing off the D-mark as the ERM's key currency, although officials suggest that it will be less dominating than before. The Bundesbank is taking the view that it is quite acceptable for interest rates in other ERM countries to go below those of Germany providing the margin is not too great. Such moves can readily be explained by differences in the business cycle. On the other hand, German officials admit that the world has changed since unification. No longer is the D-mark underpinned by a large current account surplus and a small and manageable budget deficit. The Bundesbank is having to look over its shoulder at the foreign investors who hold D-marks. It is also having to think what might happen if the problems associated with the absorption of eastern Germany mean that Germany cannot resume its former role as the EC's leader in price stability. The Bundesbank seems to be drawing two conclusions, one of which may please both Mr Clarke and the Tory right wing and another which will please neither. A plus for the UK is that the Bundesbank is unlikely to give its support to any move for the ERM core group to press ahead with a partial monetary union in such a state of uncertainty. Frankfurt feels that the pressure for a core country union is easing in any case. There are some signs that the new French government might be rather less enthusiastic about Emu than its predecessor. A union of the core countries would be difficult to reconcile with the Maastricht Treaty. Moreover, the large fiscal deficits that are a feature of most core countries will make it impossible for them to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria by the treaty's union deadlines of 1997 and difficult by 1999. A less palatable conclusion is that the Bundesbank will be even more cautious about lowering interest rates in spite of Germany's worsening recession. Last week, three of Germany's regional central bank chiefs warned against early interest rate cuts, mainly because of the threat that rapid money supply growth poses for inflation. But the Bundesbank also believes that it cannot risk alienating foreign holders of D-marks by dramatic interest rate reductions with the D-mark anchor seeming to drag. With the recession gathering pace in Britain's key continental markets, that is the kind of news that Mr Kenneth Clarke and other EC finance ministers can do without.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW COACHES BREAK EVEN IN OPENERS  </P> <P> As far as debuts go, things didn't turn out too badly for several first-year  coaches Friday night. Of the eight Valley-area coaches opening 1989 at a new  school, four won and four lost. And the point spread in three of the four  losses was 10 points or less.  </P> <P> The results:  </P> <P> * Palmdale and Coach Kent Bothwell lost to Muir, 14-7. Muir is the top-ranked  team in the Southern Section Division II preseason poll.  </P> <P> * Newbury Park and Coach George Hurley pulled off a mild 17-3 upset of Agoura,  snapping a two-game losing streak to the Chargers.  </P> <P> * Westlake and Coach Jim Benkert fell to Buena, 35-30. Buena was a Division II  playoff semifinalist last season and Westlake was 2-8.  </P> <P> * Hart and Coach Mike Herrington humbled Canyon, extending the Indians' win  streak over their cross-town rival to three games. Calling Herrington a  first-year coach might be stretching it -- he took over last month.  </P> <P> * Crespi and Coach Tim Lins lost to Redlands, 17-7. With three scholarship  players gone from the backfield, the Celts stayed close until turnovers did  them in during the second half.  </P> <P> * St. Francis and Coach Bill Garrison lost to Burroughs, 23-8, but the Golden  Knights have company. All three Valley-area Del Rey League teams (Crespi,  Alemany and St. Francis) lost Friday.  </P> <P> * St. Genevieve and Coach Mark Lovett defeated Murphy, 9-7, snapping a  seven-game losing streak in which the Valiants had been outscored, 221-38. Last  season, St. Genevieve was held to seven points or less seven times in nine  games.  </P> <P> * Behind a pair of second-half touchdowns, L. A. Baptist and Coach Mark Bates  defeated Cathedral, 15-12.  </P> <P> In all, a fair first night, considering the combined record for the eight teams  was 35-44 last year.  </P></p>

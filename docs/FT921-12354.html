			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Executives take on the task of typing BRITISH executives who would have been shocked just a couple of years ago by the concept of even touching a typewriter are now happily turning out their own letters and reports. Nearly 80 per cent of executives and managers currently do at least some of their typing, according to a survey of over 500 companies published today Job demarcations between bosses and their secretaries have been eroded because of the growth in the numbers of personal computers. An estimated 7m employees now use computers during the working day; the increase in the number of PCs on managers' desks has been particularly marked, say experts. Mr Richard Grace, managing director of the Gordon Yates secretarial recruitment group, which carried out the survey, says the trend in managers doing typing is going hand in hand with an increase in 'developmental training' for secretaries. This includes courses in communications skills and time management. 'As bosses become more computer-literate, they are working in a more team-based way with their secretaries. It's no longer simply 'take a letter Miss Jones',' says Mr Grace. Younger managers are more likely to consider a PC as simply another consumer durable, according to Mr David Flint, senior consultant with the Butler Cox Foundation which syndicates information technology research. The typewriter may have been seen as inconsistent with managerial status; the computer is an entirely different matter, he adds. The demarcations between secretaries' and bosses jobs may have been eroded but differentials between salaries are likely to remain in place. The survey finds that central London secretarial salaries have increased by an average of 5.3 per cent over the past year. A junior secretary can expect to earn about Pounds 10,500 in the capital, while the secretary of a chairman or chief executive is likely to earn about Pounds 18,600.

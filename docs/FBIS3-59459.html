			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> Interview with Iko Stanic, member of the Croatian National </F> Council of Bosanska Posavina, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not  given: "We Belong to Both Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina"]    [Text] [Sabic] The Province of Bosanska Posavina was  founded despite the decision of Herceg-Bosna to establish in  this area a zupanija [parish] with special government. What is  the reason for this?    [Stanic] We believe that the founding of a zupanija did not  suit the Posavina inhabitants, i.e., that this was not a  solution of the territorial- political problem of the Bosanska  Posavina.    The reason for this is a whole series of specific  characteristics, mainly its distance from Herceg-Bosna.  Moreover, one should not disregard the fact that we are under  occupation, so that our interests and the interests of Croats  who live in the free territory of Herceg-Bosna are not the same.  Our specific characteristic is also that we are not at war with  the Muslims. Our relations are very correct, Croats and Muslims  are waging the war together against those who attacked them.    [Sabic] How would you define the position of the province in  relation to Herceg-Bosna and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Stanic] We believe that we are entitled to a place both in  the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna. Simply stated,  we are part of the Croatian body but also of the internationally  recognized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In declaring the  province we are not threatening what Herceg-Bosna has positively  achieved thus far, nor do we intend to do anything that would  lead to a conflict among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    No political or legislative body existed in Posavina, there  was no unified government because municipalities were directly  linked with Herceg-Bosna, so that the founding of the province  was a great accomplishment.    [Sabic] You say that you do not want a conflict to occur  among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, certain  political disagreements exist, and with the founding of the  province of Bosanska Posavina they gain importance.    [Stanic] A political conflict already exists, but it will  remain just that. I must emphasize that the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] as well as representatives of political  and military leaderships, cultural societies, and the Church  participated in the convening of the first general assembly of  Bosanska Posavina.    A few days later, the same people who participated in the  proposal of the decision and in the conclusions publicly  disassociated themselves from the decisions of the assembly,  which is rather unbelievable. We believe that this is the  influence of the people from Herceg-Bosna, which means that  there is an effort from one center to carry out a policy that  should be valid in the entire territory.    [Sabic] Posavina residents held assembly meetings even  before  the one at which the decision on establishing the province was  made. How many assembly meetings were altogether held?    [Stanic] What is in fact happening, what each of these  gatherings mean was probably not explained in the best way.  There was only one general assembly, the one that was held in  Slavonski Brod. Before that, an assembly of Croats who emigrated  or were exiled from Bosanska Posavina was held.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Molyneaux calls for new N Ireland assembly Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux (above) yesterday urged Mr John Major to help set up a new Northern Ireland assembly instead of searching for a comprehensive constitutional settlement for Ulster. He said the groundwork for all-party talks on devolved government could be completed within two weeks. The resumed negotiations should focus on the creation of an 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in abortive talks last year. In an interview with the FT, Mr Molyneaux said the Major-Reynolds initiative was doomed to failure. Report, Page 22; Political Notebook, Page 8</p>

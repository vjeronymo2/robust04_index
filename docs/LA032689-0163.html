			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST REGIONAL AT EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.;  </P> <P> BEAST RISES WITH GEORGETOWN, DUKE;  </P> <P> EAST POWERS MEET FOR RIGHT TO PLAY IN THE FINAL FOUR  </P> <P> Questions, like points and rebounds, abound.  </P> <P> Such as:  </P> <P> Which East Coast college basketball power -- Georgetown or Duke -- will survive  today's East Regional title game and advance to the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. tournament's Final Four?  </P> <P> Who will own the lane -- Danny Ferry, Duke's 6-foot 10-inch All-American of the  present, or Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown's 6-10 All-American of the future?  </P> <P> Which part-time player will be the favorite of the international satellite-dish  set -- Georgetown's 7-foot Dikembe Mutombo or Duke's 6-10 Alaa Abdelnaby?  </P> <P> And in what shape will we find these teams' outstanding senior guards -- Duke's  Quin Snyder, who lately has been stricken with migraine headaches, and  Georgetown's Charles Smith, who has been running a fever that keeps him playing  hot and cold?  </P> <P> Smith could hold the most important answer, if favored Georgetown is to win  this season-making game. Coach John Thompson wants the real Charles Smith to  please show up. The one who was voted the Big East Conference's player of the  year. The one who averaged nearly 20 points a night.  </P> <P> After Smith scored one point in 32 minutes in Friday's 69-61 victory over North  Carolina State, Thompson wondered just how much Smith's strength had been  sapped by his bout with the flu, and just how long it would take him to fully  recover.  </P> <P> "I ran into a friend who said, 'Charles Smith didn't look too good last night,'  " Thompson said Saturday. "I know what he meant. Charles didn't feel too good,  and I don't feel too good, either, when he's not around."  </P> <P> Thompson said he was reminded of a scene in a film in which a dead soldier was  strapped to a horse and sent out to lead a charge, simply for inspiration's  sake. He was thinking of trying that with Smith, he joked.  </P> <P> Smith managed only a season-low four points in the regional opener against  Princeton, but then bounced back with a healthy 34 against Notre Dame.  Supposedly, he was back in form. Against N.C. State, though, Smith looked  sickly.  </P> <P> Smith, who had snapped, "I'm entitled to a bad game," after the Princeton  affair, claimed he got motivated against Notre Dame by a courtside fan who at  halftime hollered that he was overrated. Thompson also took credit for prodding  Smith with a 2 a.m. phone call that told him to stop being so nice and start  being more selfish.  </P> <P> "See, Charles gets caught up too much in that company line of ours where he  thanks his teammates for everything and plays the game like it's an  equal-opportunity sport," Thompson said. "It's not an equal-opportunity sport.  He has to get things going for us and take over sometimes. We're a better team  when he's not so democratic."  </P> <P> Mourning, who looks up to the senior despite being nine inches taller, said of  Smith: "He's our leader. It seems like the whole team rides on his shoulders."  </P> <P> So, as Smith goes today, the Hoyas might go. Funny how these things work  sometimes: Smith's teammates hope he is feeling selfish and malevolent, while  Duke's players hope he is feeling sweet and benevolent. A timid Smith would  work to Georgetown's disadvantage.  </P> <P> Even Ferry remembers, from U.S. Olympic training camp, that Smith was "the  politest person I'd ever met."  </P> <P> The Blue Devils would love it if Smith, a defensive ace, would politely allow  them to drive right past him.  </P> <P> Also worrying Duke is the shot-rejecting Mourning, who blocked five Friday  night. Snyder said he and the Blue Devils intended to practice Saturday using  the "broomstick method" -- having someone bat down shots with a broom, for an  idea of how difficult it will be to shoot over Mourning's reach. "You can't  pull up for a jump shot two feet from him or you'll get it blocked," Ferry  said. "You've got to drive on him."  </P> <P> The last time Duke confronted such an intimidating center, Blue Devil Coach  Mike Krzyzewski said, it was Navy's David Robinson. "But he just had a bunch of  Midshipmen around him," said the coach, an old Army man who could not resist a  dig. "Georgetown's got some players to go along with Mourning."  </P> <P> East Regional Notes  </P> <P> Dikembe Mutombo, the Georgetown sophomore from Kinshasa, Zaire, was asked if he  was familiar with Seattle, the Final Four site. "Oh, yes. I have big map of  United States," he said. . . . Smiling his way through a locker-room  conversation, Mutombo was interrupted by a mock-angry Georgetown Coach John  Thompson, who said: "You're enjoying that interview too much. You can't do that  if you want to be a good Georgetown man."  </P> <P> A victory today would be Thompson's 400th. . . . Georgetown is averaging a  staggering 9.2 blocks a game, and has long since eclipsed the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. season record for blocks by a team. . . . When  Charles Smith was a scrawny, 160-pound high school player, Thompson told him,  on a recruiting visit in front of Smith's mother, "You will never start for us.  Don't pout." The coach says now: "He epitomizes the person who's pulled himself  up by his bootstraps."  </P> <P> The career series favors Georgetown, 4-2, but the schools last met in 1933.  "I'm amazed we haven't run into each other at least in tournaments," Duke Coach  Mike Krzyzewski said. . . . Duke hasn't met any Big East team since a 1985  National Invitation Tournament game against St. John's. . . . For the record:  iDuke alumnus Richard M. Nixon was in the stands Friday night. His absence was  incorrectly reported in some editions Saturday.  </P></p>

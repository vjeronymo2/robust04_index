The conference will also provide an opportunity to discuss the criteria that should be used in determining whether significant scientific agreement on the validity of a dietary fiber-cancer or a dietary fiber-coronary heart disease relationship exists. The conference will include invited summary presentations and panel discussions by expert scientists and public discussions of the scientific evidence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public conference will be held on May 12 and 13, 1994, 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Interested persons may submit written comments by May 9, 1994.

In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 6, 1993, FDA issued final rules announcing its decision not to authorize the use on the label or labeling of foods of health claims relating to an association between dietary fiber and cancer (58 FR 2537) or dietary fiber and coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim relating dietary fiber to reduced risk of cancer was adequately supported by the totality of publicly available scientific evidence. FDA concluded that the role for dietary fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may be associated with reduced risk of some cancers (58 FR 2537 at 2548).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim relating dietary fiber to reduced risk of coronary heart disease was adequately supported by the totality of publicly available scientific evidence. As was the case with respect to dietary fiber and cancer, FDA concluded that the role of fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption of diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may be associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552 at 2578). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296), FDA published a proposed rule not to authorize health claims on five nutrient-disease relationships, including dietary fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease, for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances. In that proposal, FDA reviewed the available evidence on the relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and on the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart disease. Based on its tentative conclusion that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that the totality of publicly available scientific evidence supported these nutrient-disease relationships, FDA proposed not to authorize claims on these relationships. On January 4, 1994, in a new statutorily-mandated rulemaking, changes in the agency's regulations (21 CFR 101.71(a) and (b)) reflecting those that FDA had proposed in October 1993, became final by operation of law (see 59 FR 436, January 4, 1994). However, the rulemakings that FDA instituted in October 1993 continue (59 FR 436). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 12 and 13, 1994, FDA will cosponsor a public conference with other units of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Institute of Medicine, the American Medical Association, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Congressional Research Service to review the publicly available evidence on the relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart disease with particular emphasis on refining the issues relative to dietary fiber definition and levels to disease risk. The purpose of this public conference is to update and summarize the scientific information available on these associations and to discuss criteria that should be used to determine whether a significant scientific agreement on the validity of these nutrient-disease relationships exists. FDA is taking this action because it is aware, based on its review of the evidence on these nutrients-disease relationships, that at least some promising evidence exists. The agency believes that the conference will help elucidate whether recent developments have provided the basis for significant scientific agreement. The agency notes that the review of the issues regarding dietary fiber/disease claims on dietary supplements is ongoing. FDA solicits the input of all segments of the food industry and of other interested persons on these issues, however, because the agency intends, if the evidence justifies, to authorize any claims that are warranted for foods in conventional food form as well as for dietary supplements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has invited experts in medicine, nutrition, epidemiology, pathology, and other disciplines related to dietary fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease to serve as speakers and panelists. They will summarize and update the publicly available evidence, react to any evidence that is presented, and provide additional comment based on their individual expertise. Others may submit data from new research and will be given the opportunity to participate during the open discussions. Cancer and coronary heart disease will be the focus of the conference because they are the diseases that were highlighted by the 1990 amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conference will be divided into four major parts as follows: (1) Opening and overview of dietary fiber; (2) dietary fiber and coronary heart disease; (3) dietary fiber and cancer; and (4) the criteria for determining whether significant scientific agreement on dietary fiber and cancer or dietary fiber and coronary heart disease exits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before May 9, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this notice. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael R.

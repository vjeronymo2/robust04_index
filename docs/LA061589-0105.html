			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUGHTS ON REJECTION OF SOUTH PASADENA SCHOOL TAX  </P> <P> On behalf of Support South Pasadena Schools, we want to express our  appreciation to the hundreds of parents, teachers, business people, school  administrators and community members who worked tirelessly for the passage of  Proposition A.  </P> <P> While the measure lost at the polls, we believe a coalition in support of our  schools has been built. We also believe that Support South Pasadena Schools is  a good example of the greatness of our community -- people working in concert  to find solutions to some tough problems.  </P> <P> When former President Reagan defeated Walter Mondale in 1984, his 59% of the  vote was viewed as a "landslide victory," one of the biggest winning margins  ever. Yet, when Proposition A garnered 63% of the vote on June 6, it was  defeated because a two-thirds majority was required. It is sad, and it is  completely undemocratic that a small minority -- about 1,700 voters out of  14,000 registered -- could thwart the will of the substantial majority of us  who supported Proposition A.  </P> <P> We want South Pasadena to have the best schools in the San Gabriel Valley. This  will require excellent teachers, excellent facilities, excellent administrators  and excellent programs. All of these require money, but money alone is not  enough. People committed to building institutions, not destroying them, are  even more important.  </P> <P> After the election, many members of the community called with the excellent  suggestion that we seek contributions to replace the lost $98 tax increase per  parcel in the city.  </P> <P> To that end, we will recommend to the school board that a fund be established  called the Prop. A Fund. Monies deposited in that fund will be used for the  same purpose for which monies raised under Prop. A would have been used -- to  improve basic education, particularly reading, mathematics and science; to  attract and retain excellent teachers; to provide library books and textbooks;  to provide drug education programs, and to reduce class size.  </P> <P> In the weeks to come, pledge cards will be sent to members of the community. We  won't be able to generate the same amount as Proposition A would have raised,  but believe this effort is a step in the right direction.  </P> <P> JESSICA KATZ  </P> <P> Campaign manager, Support  </P> <P> South Pasadena Schools -- Yes on A  </P> <P> RICHARD JONES  </P> <P> Financial Strategy Planning Committee  </P></p>

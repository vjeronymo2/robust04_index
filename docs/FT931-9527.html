			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / McMahon attacks 'insult to Bank' SIR KIT McMahon, a past deputy governor of the Bank of England, has accused the government of delivering a 'breathtaking insult' to the Bank in the way that it appointed Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea to occupy his former office, Robert Peston writes. In the magazine Euromoney he says the appointment of deputy governor Mr Eddie George as governor 'must be taken as a compliment to the Bank'. He is a 'highly professional insider' with an 'impeccable (even frightening) hatred of inflation'. But he adds that 'the effect (of Mr George's appointment) was rather spoiled by the appointment as deputy governor of an outsider, Rupert Pennant-Rea, editor of the Economist, who, whatever his intrinsic merits may prove to be, has prima facie no qualifications for the job and who was approached for the first time that morning'. The government's behaviour was a 'breathtaking insult to the Bank (and in some ways to Pennant-Rea himself)'. Sir Kit accuses the government of giving the Bank too little independence over the operation of monetary policy and the fight against inflation. He was deputy governor for two years after Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor, took up office in 1983. He is also a former chairman of Midland Bank.</p>

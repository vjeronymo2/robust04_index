			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vo Hong Anh: "Border Defense Troops Show </F> Strong Fighting Spirit, Close Army-People Solidarity"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our country is getting better  everyday as it travels on the total renovation road under the  leadership of the party. What is important in the new period  is to maintain political stability in order to gradually achieve  economic, cultural, and social development, as well as  strengthening of national defense and security. Taking  advantage of the renovation policy, open borders, and  international circulation, the adversary forces from without  have been strengthening their infiltration across the borders,  maintaining contact with the reactionaries within the country to  develop their strength, and building covert installations along  the borders and the coast. Through touristic activities, visits  with relatives, and border crossings, they have been bringing in  people, means, and reactionary materials to support the forces  within the country. They have been taking advantage particularly  of our ethnic people's current economic difficulties in order to  incite them, to distort our party's policies and line, and thus  to destroy their confidence in the party, and at the same time  using economic means to gain the support of the masses, to  attract them to their side, and to gradually create an  opposition force fighting against the revolution. In the last  several years, they had been taking advantage of the  nationalistic and freedom-of-religion policies adopted by our  party to engage in illegal propaganda, with the hope that they  could raise complicated political issues, gain influence toward  the masses, and cause instability from within, particularly in  border areas, where the standard of living and intellectual  capacity of the people remained low. Although the development of  a market economy and business deals with foreign countries was  active, there appeared a lot of complications such as  across-the-border smuggling, criminal acts, and social ills,  which sometimes destabilized law and order in border areas and  made the border defense troops' responsibility for protecting  and managing the borders much heavier.    In the last 5 years, the forces in charge of the southern  sea  zone caught 596 foreign boats which had violated our fishing  grounds. With active support from the people, the border defense  troops handled 186 cases of illegal border entries and 8,567  major cases of smuggling involving 533 cars and motorcycles,  2,284 kilograms of opium, and so on.    To help the people, particularly the ethnic people, has  always been considered by the border defense troops their  central work. Their activities, such as "medical doctors of  blue military rank" and "teachers of blue military rank,"  reflecting their spirit of sacrifice in saving the people in  natural disasters like storms and floods, and in sharing food  and clothing with the people, have further strengthened the  close relationships between the army and the people.    On 22 February 1989, the Council of Ministers issued  Decision  16/HDBT to set the 3rd day of March every year as the Border  Defense Day. Since the promulgation of this decision, party  committee echelons, local administrations, mass organizations,  and social organizations have been showing their wholehearted  interest in turning the activities on "Border Defense Day" into  a widespread movement being carried out in many rich and lively  forms. In border provinces and cities throughout the country,  many movements, such as "assault youth being the masters of  borders," women "for our borders," "peaceful hamlets," "model  elders and village chiefs," and so on, have succeeded in  mobilization.</p>

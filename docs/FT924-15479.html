			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fisons US operations chief resigns THE HEAD of US operations at Fisons, the pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments and horticultural products company, has resigned following the group's failure to clinch the reintroduction of two of its withdrawn products in the American market. Mr Stephen Attwood, president of Fisons Corporation and a director on the group's pharmaceuticals board, is leaving the company after 20 years. He was responsible for US sales and marketing operations as well as local regulatory affairs. Fisons said the departure was entirely amicable. Fisons' first half profits, announced last month, fell 58 per cent after pharmaceuticals sales fell Pounds 16m to Pounds 206m following the drugs' withdrawal. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said the sales decline was unusual and unpalatable. Opticrom, an eye treatment, was withdrawn from the US in 1989 after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US drug licensing body, criticised production methods. In spite of a visit by FDA officials in April, the product is still not available in the US. The company said the fall in operating profits at the pharmaceuticals division from Pounds 68.1m to Pounds 23.1m for the first six months was partly caused by the absence of Opticrom and related problems. The company has yet to decide whether to reapply for a licence for Imferon, a blood product, which was pulled in 1990. The cost of refurbishing the manufacturing facilities would be as much as Pounds 30m. Fisons has also failed to gain a US licence for Tilade, its new asthma treatment, which was expected to be launched on the American market two years ago.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Brazil market tumbles after loan fraud claim THE MAIN Brazilian stock market in Sao Paulo plummeted to close down 9.3 per cent on the day yesterday, after an opposition senator said he could prove evidence presented to a congressional inquiry into alleged presidential corruption was fabricated. Mr Eduardo Suplicy of the Workers' party had told Congress earlier in the day that the fabrication was the work of Mr Claudio Vieira, a former senior aide to President Fernando Collor. The accusation thickened the clouds over the president's political future. Mr Vieira told the inquiry on Monday that suspect payments into the bank accounts of the president and his wife were the remains of a Dollars 5m (Pounds 2.6m) loan Mr Vieira had raised in Uruguay in 1989, through which gold had been bought to help fund the presidential electoral campaign that year. Bank documents before the inquiry last week suggested that the deposits, running to Dollars 1m-plus, had been made by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's friend and former campaign treasurer, who is under investigation for alleged running of a bribes scheme. Mr Suplicy claimed yesterday that Mr Vieira's evidence had been 'cooked up' in recent meetings with Mr Farias and that the Uruguay loan documents were typed last week in the office of Mr Alcides do Diniz Santos, a Sao Paulo businessman. The senator said that Ms Sandra Fernandes de Oliveira, secretary to Mr Diniz, was prepared to testify that she was at the meetings and had typed the documents.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CONVICTION UPHELD IN ILLEGAL EXPORT CASE  </P> <P> A federal appeals court has affirmed the 1987 conviction of a Costa Mesa man  for attempting to export technical military manuals to South Africa.  </P> <P> The 9th District U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena also upheld Posey's  4-month prison term and $12,000 fine for trying to illegally export manuals on  jet and transport aircraft engines.  </P> <P> Through Newport Aeronautical Sales, Posey bought nonclassified military manuals  from the government and sold them to prospective government contractors. His  lawyers claimed that because the information he was attempting to sell was in  the public domain under the Freedom of Information Act, his conviction should  be overturned.  </P> <P> But in an opinion written by Judge William A. Norris and issued this week, the  court held that the government has the power to restrict the export of  information that is already available to the public.  </P> <P> Posey's associate, Edward Bush of Agoura, was arrested 2 years ago as he  attempted to board a plane to South Africa with three cases of manuals. He was  convicted of violation of the Arms Export Control Act and sentenced to 3 years'  probation.  </P></p>

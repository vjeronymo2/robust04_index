			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW BAD IS CAMPUS CRIME IN CALIFORNIA?  </P> <P>  -- At Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, Robbin Brandley, 23, was murdered  on Jan. 18, 1986, while walking to her car in a dimly lit parking lot after  ushering at a school concert.  </P> <P>  -- At San Diego State University, there have been eight rapes and attempted  rapes in the last two years, the most on any California State University  campus. In 1985, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity was banned for five years as a  result of a rape during a party at the house.  </P> <P>  -- An 18-year-old freshman asleep in her fifth-floor dormitory room in San  Nicholas Hall, University of California at Santa Barbara, was brutally beaten,  gagged, blindfolded and raped in February, 1987.  </P> <P>  -- At UCLA in 1985, a 21-year-old woman student working the night shift at the  Guest House, a campus hotel for visiting VIPs, was assaulted by two men who  attempted to kill her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Urban Campuses  </P> <P> UC Berkeley, with a student body of about 31,000 and 71 violent crimes, ranked  No. 1 in violent crimes in 1986 among 330 campuses nationwide reporting in the  annual FBI Uniform Crime Report. (However, reporting is not mandatory and many  large urban campuses do not do so). In 1988, the number of violent crimes at  Berkeley dropped to 45.  </P> <P> On the University of Southern California campus, there were 3 rapes reported in  1988, 9 robberies, 7 aggravated assaults and no homicides. The figures -- 1,412  total crimes including 449 burglaries from motor vehicles -- reflect a marginal  decrease from 1987.  </P> <P> UCLA, with 35,700 students, reported 22 violent crimes in 1988.  </P> <P> At a public hearing on campus security at UCLA in March, 1987, members of the  state's Little Hoover Commission, a bipartisan watchdog panel, said the nine UC  campuses are among the most crime-ridden in the nation and must be made safer.  Robert T. O'Neill, then the commission's executive director, said then, "In  some people's minds, the UCs are sanctuaries. That's just not the case any  more."  </P> <P> Jeannine English, who is now executive director, says the commission made  recommendations, including establishment of a security review committee on each  UC campus to report directly to the chancellor: "We felt that one of the  problems with campus security was that a lot of times it was just being ignored  in terms of budgeting and the overall emphasis the administration was placing  on security."  </P> <P> The Cal State system's 1988 report on crime at the 19 campuses in 1988 showed a  10.9% increase from 1987 in the total number of felonies, but a 34.8% dip in  violent crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery and assault.  </P> <P> Neither the state universities nor the UC system reported any homicides in  1988, but rapes and attempted rapes increased 20% systemwide at the Cal State  campuses from 1987, with 18 reported. Violent crimes on UC campuses included 18  rapes, 9 attempted rapes, 38 robberies and 70 aggravated assaults. Still,  violent crime was down overall by 16%, the lowest since 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Violent Crimes  </P> <P> In the state university system, San Jose State University reported the most  violent crimes, followed by Cal State Northridge and San Diego State. At San  Diego, the number of violent crimes has dropped dramatically, largely, says  John Carpenter, public safety director, as a result of a concerted,  high-visibility effort that included officers on overtime on foot patrol.  </P> <P> The San Diego campus, he points out, is the system's largest, with 36,000  students, and "the urban area is coming closer and closer to campus. We're not  isolated."  </P> <P> Carpenter says most college campuses are safer than the cities in which they  are located, but cautions that parents can't simply "drop their children off at  the dorms" and think their worries are over.

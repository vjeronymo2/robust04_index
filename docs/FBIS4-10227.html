			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], stressed  that we must thoroughly explore every possibility to achieve  higher economic efficiency. Alarcon made this assertion at the  closing of a meeting with deputies, Communist Party of Cuba and  government officials, and presidents of the People's Councils in  Las Tunas Province. Alarcon stressed that the difficulties of  the special period will not be solved through nationally  implemented measures alone.    The ANPP special session convenes in less than a month to  analyze measures aimed at streamlining Cuba's economy, as well  as to make it more efficient.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman lifts year's forecast AssiDoman, the Swedish forestry group partly privatised earlier this year, yesterday raised its forecast for full-year profits after reporting a 77 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the first half. The group, Sweden's fourth largest forestry concern, said profits after financial items rose to SKr809m (Dollars 105.3m) from a pro-forma SKr457m in the same period last year, due to an 11 per cent increase in sales to SKr8.16bn from SKr7.38bn and a fall in financial charges to SKr90m from SKr142m. Mr Lennart Ahlgren, chief executive, said if production conditions remained stable, the full-year profit after financial items was expected to reach between SKr1.6bn and SKr1.8bn. This compares with a forecast made in the February privatisation prospectus of between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.5bn. The company was formed before the sell-off by a merger of Assi and Doman and later took over a third majority state-owned concern, NCB. NCB results were consolidated in the latest figures. A total of 49 per cent the whole new group was sold off, raising SKr7.6bn in Sweden's biggest privatisation. AssiDoman benefited from higher sale prices for sawn timber and pulp. Its forest and timber products division lifted sales to SKr2.5bn from SKr2.1bn, and operating profits to SKr694m from SKr435m.</p>

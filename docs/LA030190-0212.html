			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL PANEL SEEKS TO OPEN SHELTERS TO HOMELESS DURING SPRAYING  </P> <P> A City Council committee Wednesday ordered two city agencies to offer shelter  to the homeless on nights when aerial sprayings of malathion take place.  </P> <P> The homeless would be housed in the same shelters that the city opens during  cold and wet nights, according to the plan approved by the Community  Redevelopment and Housing Committee.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Community  Development Agency would be instructed to open recreation centers and other  facilities "immediately . . . in communities that are being sprayed," said  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who proposed it.  </P> <P> Buses would transport homeless people to shelters from specified pickup points.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said it would not be difficult for the city agencies to comply with  the order, which still must get full council approval later this month.  </P> <P> "As bad as the spraying is, it's not every night, seven nights a week, as cold  weather can be during the winter," Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> The committee's decision was hailed by advocates for the homeless.  </P> <P> Toni Reinis, co-director of the California Homeless Coalition, said, "I  appreciate that the city is willing to do it."  </P> <P> Reinis had been working with other organizations that petitioned the city to  open the shelters. Homeless people in spraying areas have complained of  flu-like symptoms and other health problems, she said, and many have no means  of showering after the sprayings.  </P> <P> "When malathion is sprayed over a neighborhood, people are advised to keep  their pets inside," Yaroslavsky said. "It is morally indefensible not to  provide people the same protection we tell pet owners to give their pets."  </P> <P> Last month the Legal Aid Society of Orange County lost a bid for a temporary  restraining order to halt the spraying of malathion. The lawyers demanded that  the state give 48-hour notice of spraying to all homeless people, provide  shelter during the spraying, as well as medical care and laundry services to  those sprayed.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles committee also approved a proposal to develop a program to keep  shelters open at night all winter next year.  </P></p>

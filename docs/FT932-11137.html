			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Russia and US show unity on tactics for Bosnia THE US and Russia yesterday glossed over their differences on Bosnia to present a show of unity, as the Bosnian Serb parliament met behind closed doors in its mountain headquarters of Pale to decide whether to endorse the international peace plan. The debate continued into the night, following an impassioned plea for the plan's endorsement from Belgrade leaders, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia. 'We cannot wage war until we commit suicide,' Mr Cosic said. Even Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who signed the agreement in Athens last weekend under great international pressure, warned deputies that 'enormous dangers hover over us' if they should reject the plan. He added that the Bosnian Serbs could still attain their goals through peaceful neg-otiation if they endorsed the plan. After talks in Moscow between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, the two sides issued a bullish statement clearly designed to encourage a 'yes' vote in the Bosnian Serb assembly. The statement said both sides were prepared to commit 'appropriate' military forces to a peacekeeping operation, if the Bosnian Serbs accepted the peace plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. However, like Britain and France during previous stops made by Mr Christopher on his current tour, Russia did not commit itself to specific military measures if the Bosnian Serb assembly rejected the peace plan for the third time. 'If it is not accepted and implemented, Russia and the US will immediately resume discussion of new, tougher measures. No measures are prejudged or excluded from consideration,' the statement said. Although the western allies and Russia are clearly keen to maintain the pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, their reservations about lifting sanctions on arms supplies to Bosnia or making selective air strikes would make it difficult to reach a consensus taking on military action. The US, has said it will not act unilaterally, even if the Pale assembly rejects the peace plan. The differences over possible responses should the plan be rejected are compounded by disagreements about the terms of engagement for the 60,000 to 70,000-strong peacekeeping force destined for Bosnia to oversee the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan and its command structure. Lord Owen, who visited Nato headquarters in Brussels yesterday, emphasised that the Nato-led force had to be prepared to fight if necessary to enforce the plan and that it should be deployed even if the Bosnian Serb assembly does reject the plan. That view has been categorically contested by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that 'we are not envisaging the deployment of troops into a war. 'It is not their job to move in to enforce a plan. It is their job to monitor its implementation,' he said. Background, Page 2</p>

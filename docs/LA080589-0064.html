			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN OGDON, 52; CONCERT PIANIST AND COMPOSER  </P> <P> John Ogdon, a concert pianist and composer known for his work on behalf of  modern music who had been making a comeback after suffering a mental breakdown,  died Tuesday at age 52, his agents said.  </P> <P> Manygate Management said Ogdon died peacefully after going into a coma after  his admission to London's Charing Cross Hospital on Monday for  bronchopneumonia.  </P> <P> Before the time in the late 1960s that the schizophrenia that ran in his family  sharply limited his career, Ogdon had developed a vast repertoire of classic  and modern music and composed chamber music, a symphony and a piano concerto.  </P> <P> A golden future seemed assured when, at 25, Ogdon shared top place with Soviet  pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy in the piano section of the 1962 Moscow Tchaikovsky  International Competition for young musicians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acclaimed by Audience  </P> <P> After Ogdon played the Liszt No. 1 Piano Concerto and the Tchaikovsky No. 1  Piano Concerto, the audience rose and demanded that he be awarded first prize.  </P> <P> Ogdon and Ashkenazy became friends. In 1966, Ashkenazy performed a new work by  Ogdon at the Cheltenham Festival in England. Ogdon toured the Soviet Union  several times and traveled throughout Europe, the United States, Canada and the  Far East.  </P> <P> After his breakdown, Ogdon's hair turned white, he became obese and he spent  time in a mental hospital. This year the British Broadcasting Corp. presented a  television program called "Virtuoso," describing his crippling bouts of mental  illness. It was based on a book his wife had written about her husband's  despair.  </P> <P> But Ogdon began a comeback in 1981, and in the last 12 months he recorded the  complete piano works of Sergei Rachmaninoff, several albums of popular piano  pieces and Kaikhosru Sorabji's "Opus Clavcicembalisticum."  </P></p>

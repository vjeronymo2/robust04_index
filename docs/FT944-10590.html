			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Battle joined for WEU post: Differences within Europe's defence club The transformation of the nine-nation Western European Union into a full blooded defence club will get under way today with an ill tempered contest for its top job. Whoever wins the race to become WEU secretary-general will have to reconcile differences between Britain and many of its continental partners over the route and pace of Europe's path towards greater self-sufficiency in defence. The winner will also be struggling to settle another, even tougher argument  -between the WEU, including Britain, on the one hand and the US on the other - over the terms on which the US will 'lend' military hardware to European defence missions. Having failed to reach consensus on who will be the next secretary-general, ambassadors of the nine member states will be voting in Brussels on Italian, Portuguese and Spanish candidates. If there is deadlock, the Dutch incumbent, Mr Willem van Eekelen, could remain in office. The job seems certain to be a substantial one, because the principle of reviving the WEU as the European pillar of Nato, and the defence arm of the European Union, is no longer questioned by any of its members. The 40-year-old WEU - which groups all EU members except Denmark and Ireland, and will soon incorporate Greece - binds its members to defend one another in even stronger terms than the founding treaty of Nato. But in practice, Nato has largely overshadowed the European club, at least until last January when the US told its allies to take more responsibility for their own defence. The candidates for the WEU job are two diplomats - Mr Giovanni Jannuzzi of Italy and Mr Jose Cutileiro of Portugal - and Mr Enrique Baron Crespo, a Spanish Socialist politician. If today's vote yields a clear result, the winner will be endorsed at next week's meeting in the Netherlands of WEU foreign and defence ministers, which will also hear calls for rapid progress towards a common European defence policy. Britain, which used to argue that a strengthened WEU would alienate the US, is now stressing that it fully supports the idea of giving the European body some extra punch. In practice, that would mean that certain defence tasks - in which the Europeans wanted direct involvement but the US did not - would be shouldered by the WEU, which would borrow US military hardware from Nato as necessary. However, the US wants to retain considerable say in any missions for which it is providing military assets, and ideally the right to pull its equipment out if a more pressing need arises elsewhere. The French - and, as of recently, the British - argue that the new arrangement will work only if the Europeans can count on being able to borrow Nato's military hardware whenever it is required. 'There would have to be a presumption, at least, that Nato assets would be available,' said a UK diplomat. Despite moving closer to France on some issues, Britain is putting the brakes on proposals to issue a toughly worded statement on a common European defence identity in the near future. It says this would pre-empt preparations for the 1996 conference on the future of the European Union. London is also talking down the idea of an early 24-nation summit grouping the WEU's full members and nations with associate or observer status. In today's vote, Mr Cutileiro expects the backing of Britain and probably the Netherlands, while Mr Jannuzzi enjoys French support and is hoping that the Germans - waverers until the last minute - will rally to his cause. UK diplomats have hinted that they would prefer Mr Jannuzzi to Mr Baron.</p>

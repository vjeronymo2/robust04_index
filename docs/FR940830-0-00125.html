			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Section 3833.1&hyph;6 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3833.1&hyph;6  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the Act of August 10, 1993, and other exceptions_applicable from 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1993, until 12 o'clock noon September 1, 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A small miner may, under certain conditions described in this section and in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, perform the assessment work required under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and record it pursuant to Section 314(a) of FLPMA and &sect;3833.2 in lieu of paying the maintenance fee. Assessment work shall conform to the requirements contained in subpart 3851 of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) In order to qualify for a waiver of the maintenance fee requirements, a small miner shall meet all of the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The claimant and all related parties shall hold no more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, or any combination thereof, on Federal lands in the United States on the date the payment is due, which is each August 31. For purposes of determining the small miner waiver, oil shale claims shall not be counted toward the 10 claim limitation for the small miner waiver of the $100 maintenance fee. A claimant who owns 10 or fewer claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, is not precluded from paying the maintenance fee in addition to filing for a small miner waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All mining claims and sites held by a claimant and all related parties shall be counted toward the 10 claim and site limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Mill and tunnel sites of a qualified small miner, if listed upon the exemption certificate along with the affected lode and placer mining claims, are waived from payment of the maintenance fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Mining claims and sites that are undergoing final reclamation, as approved by the authorized officer pursuant to subparts 3802, 3809, or 3814 of this title, with no intent by the owner thereof to continue mining, milling, or processing operations upon or under the mining claims or sites, are excused from payment of the maintenance fees. The owner shall file a certified statement by August 31 in the proper BLM office attesting to the reclamation status of the affected mining claims and/or sites, with reference to a reclamation plan approved by the authorized officer for plan-level activities or submitted in consultation with the authorized officer for notice-level activities, and to his or her intent to place them into permanent closure. If the surface is managed by an entity other than BLM, the claimant shall submit evidence of a final reclamation plan that conforms to the requirements of the managing entity. A certified statement of such intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7. The number of mining claims or sites that may properly qualify for a reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-claim limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act (50 U.S.C. Appendix 565), military personnel on active duty status may, under certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of assessment work and the payment of maintenance fees. See &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;7(e)(2) and 3851.6 of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Under the following circumstances, a waiver may be obtained from the payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims and sites:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The claimant has received a declaration of taking or a notice of intent to take from the National Park Service pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of September 28, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1905, 1906), or the Act of December 2, 1980, as amended (16 U.S.C. 3192); or the claimant has otherwise been denied access by the United States to his/her mining claims or sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

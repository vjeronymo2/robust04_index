			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The news of the shooting incident at the  immaculate mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased with  him, on the first day of the glorious celebration of the 10 Days  of Dawn of the Islamic revolution while the beloved president of  the nation was making a speech, immediately caused a wave of  concern among the faithful people of Islamic Iran. [passage  omitted]    Hashemi-Rafsanjani is the comrade-in-arms of the eminent  leader of the revolution and reminds us of the late imam. That  is why that prominent revolutionary figure has always been the  target of the enemies of the revolution in various forms. Today  the enemy is focusing all its efforts on dealing blows against  the holy system of the Islamic revolution and weakening the  presence of the people in the arenas of the defense of the  revolution.    The attempts to instill despair in the people, propagated in  the past few months by the horns of world arrogance and  international Zionism and spread in the society in various  forms, contained the message that the enemies of the revolution  are hatching an extensive plot to deal blows at the revolution  and its foundations.    The incitement to revolt by certain saboteurs in Zahedan,  which took place at the same time as the anti-revolutionary move  at the immaculate mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased  with him, cannot be a coincidence. Such incidents can only be  the work of organizations such as CIA and Mosad. They are the  ones who, from the first day of the victory of the Islamic  revolution, have girded their loins to destroy the Islamic  revolution. But thanks to Almighty God, since the Islamic  revolution and its movement has enjoyed divine support, once  again the efforts of the conspirators failed and the leader and  the ummah were joyful to hear that the beloved president is  safe. The shouts of greetings to Hashemi were the people's  crushing response to those who hatched that evil plot. [passage  omitted]</p>

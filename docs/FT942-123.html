			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Charter It is always pleasing to see a company delivering on promises. By buying a market-leading position in welding equipment, Charter has deployed its cash pile in a manner wholly consistent with its stated strategy. A multiple of around 15 times this year's forecast earnings looks a reasonable price to pay for a manufacturing business close to its cyclical floor in profits. Since the acquisition of Esab is being funded with a mixture of surplus cash and a rights issue priced at a similar multiple, the benefit to earnings per share should be immediate. Yet yesterday's 7 per cent rise in Charter's shares suggest that investors are taking a lot on trust. The group is doubling its sales at a stroke but has no track record of digesting such large prey. Contrasting management styles will have to be reconciled without creating damaging waves. And while Charter has examined Esab in detail, investors were offered little by way of segmental information yesterday. For Charter to justify its new premium rating, Esab's operating margins will have to be restored to double digits within a couple of years. With the economic cycle moving in its favour - and allowing for some rationalisation benefits - that is not an impossible task. But Charter must deliver handsomely on its promise to satisfy the City's high expectations.</p>

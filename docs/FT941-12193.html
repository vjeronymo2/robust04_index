			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Rules tighten on child agency The government is to tighten rules governing the Child Support Agency to ensure that addresses of separated parents are not disclosed, David Owen writes. The announcement by Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, came as the government told MPs that proposed changes to the way the agency functions are expected to take effect from next Monday. The new arrangements - which are due to be debated by parliament this week - will provide a number of changes, including enabling absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18 months. They follow a government review of the agency conducted late last year after widespread anger over the formula used to calculate maintenance.</p>

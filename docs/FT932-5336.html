			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Tory right squares up for Euro battle TORY RIGHTWINGERS yes-terday made what were virtual declarations of war on the government, as ministers prepared for a tough time when MPs return next week from the Whitsun recess. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, struggled to assert his authority over the party, Mr Edward Leigh, sacked as a trade and industry minister in last week's reshuffle, called on the right of the party to organise more effectively and exercise its political muscle. Mr Leigh used an article in The Spectator to accuse the government of being unwilling to tolerate dissent and to claim it was afraid of views 'different from its own.' Giving an account of his sacking, Mr Leigh spoke of his 'despair' at having voted for Maastricht because he did not want to rock the boat publicly in difficult times. 'Never again will I vote against my conscience,' he said. He claimed the cabinet was still unrepresentative of the parliamentary party. The Left had 'achieved its ambition to control economic, foreign and industrial policy' while the Right sat 'beleaguered in isolated fortresses.' The news that German chancellor Helmut Kohl was to convene a special EC summit this autumn to relaunch the drive to political and monetary union sparked a fresh outburst from Tory Euro-sceptics. Other right-wingers warned of a possible battle over the government's moves to narrow the budget deficit. Any move to reduce public sector borrowing by raising direct taxation would spark 'an unholy revolt', one senior MP warned. Further high-profile clashes on Europe and public spending are in prospect when parliament reconvenes next week. On Monday and Tuesday, the Lords are to start debating the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty, which completed its tortuous passage through the Commons last month. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, and Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, are among more than 100 peers who are understood to be intending to speak. Meanwhile Labour will probably give MPs the chance to discuss public spending on Wednesday by selecting it as an opposition day debate.</p>

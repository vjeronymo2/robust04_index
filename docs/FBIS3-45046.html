According to the investigation, since the beginning of this  year, the Tongchuan Mining Office's coal production has shown a  significant downward curve and its deficit dramatically  increased, which has seriously undermined the production of  coal, circulation of funds, worker livelihood, and the stability  of the mines.    In view of the existing problems, provincial CPPCC committee  members put forward a six-point suggestion. Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua, upon reading the investigation report of the Shaanxi  provincial CPPCC committee, which had been transmitted to him by  a relevant department on 27 October, commented: These  suggestions are very good. They should be really looked into.  I hope the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Railways,  the Ministry of Labor, and relevant financial and banking units  will form a work team, to be led by the Ministry of Coal  Industry, to join hands with the Shanxi government in helping  Tongchuan solve the problem. The same principle should apply:  Reducing workers, enhancing efficiency, recognizing clearly who  the users are, and organizing transportation.    According to Comrade Zou Jiahua's comments, the State  Council  work team, the provincial economic and trade commission, the  labor department, the coal industry administration bureau, the  Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and the Xian Railway Subbureau  conducted a joint investigation and study and put forward  specific solutions to the difficulties now facing the Tongchuan  Mining Office.</p>

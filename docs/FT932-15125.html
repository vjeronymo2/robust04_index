			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / British Coal considers court help in dispute BRITISH COAL seems certain to ask the High Court to resolve a dispute over 10 pits earmarked for early closure unless three of its four main unions have a change of heart in the next few days. Following a High Court ruling that its original closure plans were illegal, the corporation has given the unions until today to respond to its latest proposal on consultations. This involves the appointment of a single scrutineer to study all closures 'in a single procedure', rather than each one individually, as suggested by the National Union of Mineworkers. The British Association of Colliery Management has said it is willing to accept the suggestion. Other unions are still considering how to respond. In spite of today's deadline, British Coal is likely to allow the unions several days before returning to the High Court for a ruling. It has for some months been indicating it will not apply the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, previously used as the conciliation procedure for closures in the industry, either to the 10 or another nine the corporation wants to close, mothball or cease large-scale production at. MCRP procedures can take nine months. British Coal believes the court would be satisfied by its use of John T. Boyd, the US consultancy which has already evaluated the pits, and by the appointment of a single scrutineer. In a letter to unions before Easter it said the scrutineer could consider each pit individually. A review could be carried out by mid-May, it said. The corporation has also told the unions it does not believe an 'independent element' is required in consultations involving the nine to be closed, mothballed or placed on development work only. British Coal wants to cease coaling at the six to be mothballed at the end of April. The government has formally rejected calls by the Commons employment committee that it failed to take into account the full financial cost of pit closures.</p>

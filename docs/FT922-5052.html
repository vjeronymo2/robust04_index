			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Discussion on aid for Names THE COUNCIL of the Lloyd's of London insurance market will consider a proposal to help some of the worst-affected Names at its monthly meeting tomorrow. However, Lloyd's said yesterday that there was no certainty that it would adopt any plan. An ad hoc committee has been considering possible schemes for several weeks. The adoption of any plan is likely to depend on the approval in a ballot of the market's 22,400 Names - wealthy individuals whose capital backs the market. The Names may have to meet much of the cost of any scheme through a special levy. Although most agencies - which manage syndicates and handle the affairs of Names - favour a bail-out plan, many of the Names are less enthusiastic.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> KIROV BALLET PERFORMS 'PAQUITA' AND CONTEMPORARY MINIATURES  </P> <P> The Saturday Kirov program in Segerstrom Hall seemed like old times: the same  mix of "Chopiniana," "Paquita" and contemporary miniatures that the company  offered on the final night of its 1986 engagement in Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> "Paquita" remains one of the glories in the Kirov repertory: a suite drawn from  a 19th-Century Petipa classic that tests, molds and displays the dancers  technically but also allows each soloist to make a personal statement.  </P> <P> Yulia Makhalina hasn't yet the consummate technical authority required for the  prima ballerina role, but she danced stylishly, with gorgeous line, partnered  by the conscientious but effortful Eldar Aliev.  </P> <P> The trio found Irina Chistiakova technically uneven but Veronika Ivanova  perfectly suited to the lacy network of beaten steps and small turns in her  variation. In the solo that Mikhail Baryshnikov interpolated into his "Don  Quixote," Andrei Garbuz looked very polished indeed.  </P> <P> The five major women's variations juxtaposed dancers who have become familiar  this season (Makhalina, Zhanna Ayupova) with others not prominently cast until  Saturday (Elvira Krylova, Elena Martinson). Inevitably, though, they were  dominated by Tatiana Terekhova, a senior Kirov luminary seen at her most  majestic and serene.  </P> <P> Conductor Victor Fedotov adopted faster tempos than the dancers faced in 1986  -- indeed, faster tempos than American Ballet Theatre or Dance Theatre of  Harlem adopt in their "Paquita" productions -- and helped enhance the vibrant  attacks and intricate footwork that give this ballet its distinctive  neo-Spanish flavor.  </P> <P> All of the modern pieces looked as if bravura stunts had been added to the  choreographies at the last moment -- none more so than Boris Eifman's "Adagio"  (to Albinoni), a study of group solidarity versus individual freedom. Here the  intense Evgeny Neff would periodically stop his melodramatic flailing to  execute an air-turn with a split-leap termination or something equally  difficult and out of character.  </P> <P> Similarly, the hyper-gymnastic adagio from Oleg Vinogradov's "Knight in a  Tiger's Skin" (music by Alexei Machavariani) lost all sense of human  relationships in its relentless pursuit of startling balances. And there were  times when even Eldar Aliev and Tatiana Ariskina could not smoothly unsnarl  themselves from one another's interlocking limbs.  </P> <P> Two pieces by Dmitri Bryantsev proved engaging not so much for their obvious  dramatic content as their formal movement values. Tracing a path from anguished  oppression to a sense of hope, "The Conception" (music by Arvo Part) contrasted  brief, galvanic pulsations with sustained gymnastic partnering gambits; limp  sprawling with forceful linear statements. Vanda Lubkovskaya and Andrei Bosov  danced everything powerfully.  </P> <P> Blithely performed by Irina Chistiakova and Yuri Fateyev, Bryantsev's jokey  character showpiece "Pas de Deux in the Style of the Thirties" (music by  Shostakovich) played inventively with asymmetrical body-shapes and other  surprising, anti-classical locutions.  </P></p>

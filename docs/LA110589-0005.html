			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOICES FROM THE FIRST GENERATION;  </P> <P> THE RAMIREZ &amp; HERNANDEZ FAMILIES  </P> <P> TO HEAR MARILU Ramirez talk, you would not believe that two of her brothers  have been killed by the Salvadoran military; that she has been separated from  five of her nine children since she fled her country in 1987, and that the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service is trying to have her deported. There is  little trace of anger or despair in the voice of the 37-year-old housekeeper  from Sonsonate in western El Salvador.  </P> <P> "There are many people suffering what we are. . . . At least we have a roof  over our heads," Ramirez says quietly in Spanish as she sits in a one-bedroom  apartment shared by more than a dozen relatives. "I know a lot of people who  don't even have this. There are people living on the streets."  </P> <P> Ramirez, who asked that her real name not be published, to protect relatives in  El Salvador, came to Los Angeles after soldiers detained and tortured her for  six days in 1987. She says members of her family were targeted for repression  because military officials accused them of being "subversives" linked to  leftist guerrillas.  </P> <P> Like many of the 350,000 Salvadorans who have come to Southern California,  Ramirez lives in Pico-Union, a community just west of downtown Los Angeles.  Pico-Union is mostly a community of exiles, the product of a decade of  revolution and civil war that has ravaged their tiny country. Today, only San  Salvador, El Salvador's capital, has a larger Salvadoran population than L.A.  </P> <P> The community is a cross section of Salvadoran society. There are country  people like Ramirez but also city dwellers from San Salvador's working-class  barrios. Exiled guerrilla fighters have formed a local support network for the  revolutionary movement, and they coexist with several thousand former soldiers  and National Guardsmen who also have found refuge in Los Angeles from their  country's violence and economic difficulties. There also is a small sampling of  well-to-do businessmen.  </P> <P> Although exact figures are not available, Nina Lockard, a social services  coordinator at the Central American Refugee Center, calculates that about 60%  of the Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles are undocumented. Perhaps about 70%  are unemployed, she says, and probably living at or below the poverty line.  </P> <P> Despite the growth of the community, there are many Salvadorans who hope that  Los Angeles will not become their permanent home. Maria Hernandez, 32, says she  still dreams of the day she can return to El Salvador, which she left six years  ago, a victim of political repression.  </P> <P> Once a sociologist working for El Salvador's Ministry of Education, Hernandez  says she survived two assassination attempts after she published a study highly  critical of the Salvadoran government. Her desire to return one day to El  Salvador, however, is not shared by her 19-year-old daughter, Margie, who was  born in El Salvador but who has grown into adulthood in the United States.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty sure that I could go back if the situation improves so that my life  isn't in danger," says Hernandez, a caseworker at a Pico-Union legal aid  clinic, who also asked that her real name not be published. "But I'm also 90%  sure that my daughter won't go back. She says life is easier here because no  one is watching us or following us."  </P> <P> Hernandez now lives in suburban Azusa; raising children in the Pico-Union  barrio, she says, was difficult. She is currently studying for a master's  degree in political science, and Margie is a first-year student at Cal Poly  Pomona.  </P> <P> Although she is grateful that both Margie and her other daughter, Fatima, 12,  have adjusted well to life in Southern California, Hernandez says she worries  about the effect of television, "materialism" and other American institutions  on her family.  </P> <P> The same concern over American culture and traditional Salvadoran family values  is shared by Ramirez. She says she has done her best to make sure her teen-age  children avoid the problems of gang violence and drug abuse that have affected  other Salvadoran youths in Pico-Union. The Los Angeles Police Department says  the largest of the Salvadoran gangs, the 150-member Salvatrucha gang, deals  drugs in Pico-Union and has been growing and becoming more violent.  </P> <P> "In El Salvador, children listen to their parents," Ramirez says. "And there is  always someone home when your children come home after school. Here, our young  people seem to be lost to us."  </P> <P> Ramirez says raising her children would be easier if she could make more money.  If she could afford to pay more rent, for instance, they wouldn't have to live  in such crowded conditions: Before the manager of her building complained, 26  people were living in her apartment.  </P> <P> The problem, Ramirez says, is that only she and two of the other eight adults  living with her -- brothers, sisters and in-laws -- can find work. The others  don't have work permits because the Immigration Reform and Control Act granted  amnesty only to those illegal immigrants who came to the United States before  1982 -- effectively excluding the Salvadorans, most of whom began arriving in  the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Despite the law, Ramirez says she has plans to bring more of her relatives to  Los Angeles, where they will be safe from the violence of the Salvadoran  countryside. Recently, one of her brothers has undertaken three trips from  Tijuana to El Salvador and back to guide family members to California.  </P> <P> "We're used to living close to each other," she says of her family. "We can't  be all together right now, but we still have to try to help each other all we  can."  </P></p>

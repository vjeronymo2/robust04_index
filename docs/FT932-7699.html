			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Starmin offers enhanced scrip 50% higher than dividend STARMIN, the Guildford-based quarry products group, has joined the growing trend for proposing enhanced scrip dividends to ease the company's unrelieved advance corporation tax situation and conserve cash resources. The scrip offer is worth 30p per 100 shares, a 50 per cent improvement on the unchanged cash dividend of 0.3p including a recommended maintained final payment of 0.2p. Although Starmin now operates mainly in the UK the unrelieved ACT arose from the companies in the group when the Abdullah brothers bought into it in 1989 following their departure from Evered, and the operations of acquisitions. Mr Raschid Abdullah, chief executive, added that cash conservation was as important a reason as the ACT. 'Although smaller companies are returning to fashion raising funds is still difficult,' he said. In the 1992 year the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.06m, compared with profits of Pounds 1.94m. The maintenance of the dividend was based on the company's prospects, which the board viewed with a little more confidence than at the interim stage. In the current year there had been some signs of increased activity and a satisfactory result in the first three months. But the company warned that the recovery would be slow and difficult. The pre-tax figure was achieved after exceptional charges of Pounds 9.21m (Pounds 924,000) relating to reorganisation and restructuring costs less earlier provisions and property sale profits. Of the pre-exceptional profits of Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 3.38m) Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 3.35m) related to continuing operations. Turnover was static at Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 20m) and losses per share came out at 2.5p against earnings of 0.5p. Mr Abdullah said that the company had taken a cautious view of the year and was one of the reasons for the delay in publishing the results. At the annual meeting Mr Owen Rout is being replaced as chairman by Lord Parkinson, the present deputy. See Observer</p>

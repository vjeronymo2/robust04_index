			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big crops squeeze orange profits - The bitter fruits of aggressive 1980s replanting EXPECTATIONS OF near-record orange harvests in Florida and Brazil this year have sent prices paid to Florida fruit growers to their lowest levels since the 1950s. The harvest promises to be just the first in a series of bumper years, leaving a gloomy outlook for a price recovery in the sunshine state. The bountiful supply of oranges is also projected to raise the combined production of frozen concentrated orange juice in Florida and Brazil to a record, a fact not lost on New York's orange juice futures traders. Futures prices for frozen juice for March delivery fell to 16-year lows this week. The March contract has fallen from Dollars 1.80 a lb 18 months ago to a low of 67.40 cents Tuesday. The drop accelerated last week, traders say, when it became clear that the season for a crop-damaging freeze in Florida was nearly over. With large surpluses in the offing, both the US and Brazil are targeting Asian and EC countries for potential market expansion. The orange juice market is suffering from the after-effects of crop damage done to Florida orange groves during a succession of frosts and freezes during the 1980s. Growers compensated for tree losses with aggressive replanting and most of those new trees are just now maturing enough to yield fruit. The 1980s crop losses in Florida inspired a new orange industry in Brazil, which now claims the title as the world's largest producer of frozen concentrated orange juice. In 1986, in the midst of the crop damage, Florida had 43.5m orange trees. In 1992, the tree count had risen to 72.8m trees. Of that total, more than 30 per cent were 2 years old or less. 'Over time, this crop is only going to get larger,' says Steve Platt, senior commodities analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. 'It takes three years to get an orange tree to produce, and the older a tree gets, the higher the yields'. The Florida orange crop currently being harvested is expected to yield 188m boxes of fruit and the Brazilian crop, which should come on to the market several months from now, is estimated at 292.8m boxes, both the second-highest crops on record. A box is 40.8 kg, or about 90 lb. Florida's orange harvest is projected to hit 211m boxes three years from now, and 257m boxes in 10 years. Brazil's orange groves are also just getting into their stride, adding to production overload. Orange growers in Florida received 45 cents a lb for orange juice solids this week, down dramatically from the Dollars 1.48 they were grossing a year ago. Mary Hartney, spokesperson for Florida Citrus Mutual, Florida's largest association of citrus growers, says 'this is one of the worst seasons in memory for growers'. She says the industry standard for break-even in orange production is Dollars 1 a lb. So far the price slump has not prompted growers to abandon their crops, but Ms Hartney says another year of low prices could affect operations of the most highly geared growers. Brazilian growers are no better off. They are generally paid a moving average of the New York futures price for their fruit. Judith Ganes, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch, believes that if the futures price slide is severe enough, it may encourage Brazilian growers to limit their investment in the crop and trim tree yields. However, the overall crop impact would be minimal, she says. While frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices and prices paid to farmers for fruit have slumped, analysts say the world price of 95 cents a lb for solid frozen orange juice concentrate has been slow to fall, leaving consumers with little benefit from the crop surplus. Florida growers and fruit processors are looking toward expanding foreign markets to absorb the excess supply and stabilise orange prices. Ms Hartney says Japan and Germany are particularly promising markets, with per capita juice consumption in those countries less than a fifth of the American level. Japan relaxed import restrictions against imported orange juice in April, 1992, and since then it has doubled its juice consumption. Germany's imports are also expected to rise once the country recovers from its current economic slowdown, Ms Hartney says.</p>

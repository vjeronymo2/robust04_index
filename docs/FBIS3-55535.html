			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent O. Safiyulin; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Deputies in the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  faction are now holding their first meeting in the Russian  parliamentary center. In his brief opening speech, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy once again described his party as one of the best  in Russia. He said that the faction does not intend to enter  any blocs and that at present it is not interested in what kind  of republic Russia will become, presidential or parliamentary.  He also noted that the party stands for reconciliation,  liberty, and law, and that society should not now be divided  into communists, blues and greens -- everyone should be equal  before the law.    After this, he asked journalists to leave, saying that  thereafter, the faction's deputies would be tackling their own  problems and tasks, which by all appearances we will be learning  about in the next few days.</p>

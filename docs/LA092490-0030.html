			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CONCERTGEBOUW RETURNS UNDER RICCARDO CHAILLY;  </P> <P> CONCERT: AMSTERDAM ORCHESTRA MAKES ITS FIRST LOCAL APPEARANCE IN FIVE YEARS  UNDER THE BATON OF ITS NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR.  </P> <P> Friday was a festive night in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Celebrating the opening of the fall season at Segerstrom Hall and,  simultaneously, the beginning of its 37th year of concert sponsorship, the  Orange County Philharmonic Society presented the Concertgebouw Orchestra of  Amsterdam.  </P> <P> The mighty ensemble hadn't appeared locally since 1985, and a few things had  changed in the interim. The adjective Royal had been appended to the  Concertgebouw label in recognition of the orchestral centenary in 1988. More  important, Riccardo Chailly had succeeded Bernard Haitink as music director.  </P> <P> For some strange reason, official publicity materials pretend that Chailly --  an Italian despite his French name -- is "the first chief conductor of  non-Dutch origin" to hold the Amsterdam post. This myopic claim overlooks the  distinguished tenure of Eugen Jochum, an emphatically German maestro now  relegated to lowly guest status in the revisionist accounts provided by the  management.  </P> <P> Ultimately, nationalistic matters are unimportant. Only the playing counts.  Much of the playing for Chailly, on this occasion, proved disappointing.  </P> <P> Even in its pre-Royal days, the Concertgebouw was seldom regarded as a  high-precision instrument. One savored its rich timbre, its mellow expressive  scale and pervasive warmth. In doing so, one gladly overlooked certain lapses  in polish.  </P> <P> Under Chailly, the lapses linger. Unfortunately, they seem more problematic now  because the erstwhile richness, mellowness and warmth seem to have decreased.  </P> <P> It is dangerous to judge an orchestra on a single occasion under trying  conditions. For all we know, the Royal Dutch visitors may have been suffering  communal jet lag. Chailly may have been disoriented by the quirky acoustics of  the Orange County Hall, which he had encountered for the first time only an  hour before the concert began. Still, other itinerants have coped more  effectively with similar challenges.  </P> <P> In Schumann's Fourth Symphony, which opened the program loudly, the  Concertgebouw strings sounded tough, the brass rough and the winds wan. Chailly  concentrated on speed and passion, whipping up undeniable excitement but  slighting lyrical suavity in the process.  </P> <P> Matters improved, to a degree, after intermission when he confronted the  poignant expanses of Mahler's "Lied von der Erde." He did convey the essential  aura of endless yearning. He did savor the piquant accents that offset the  aching pathos. He did demonstrate a basic grasp of the over-ripe romantic  idiom. The orchestra -- long associated with that specific idiom -- responded  with reasonable security.  </P> <P> Still, Chailly painted in primary colors, even when Mahler asked for pastels.  One missed muted delicacy and the linear tension. One missed the textural  transparency and spacious majesty that separate a competent performance from a  compelling one.  </P> <P> Jard van Nes, the intelligent mezzo-soprano soloist, sang the Bethge texts with  firm tone and affecting simplicity. Although she mustered little rapture in the  high climaxes and little resonance in the crucial descending phrases, she  impressed with communicative honesty throughout.  </P> <P> The tenor in "Das Lied von der Erde" has a virtually impossible task. He should  summon the steely force of a Wagnerian superman one moment and the nimble  refinement of a Mozartean poet the next.  </P> <P> Gosta Winbergh is more a Tamino than a Siegfried. No matter. He is remarkably  resourceful and amazingly sensitive.  </P> <P> The Swedish tenor refused to strain for impact, even when the orchestra  threatened to blanket his slender but solid, invariably elegant tone. He never  flinched from the high tessitura. He offered object lessons in dynamic  flexibility, verbal point and sensual appeal. Not since Julius Patzak. . . .  </P> <P> The Orange County Philharmonic subscribers applauded enthusiastically, but only  in the right places. Mahler's eternal benediction ("Ewig . . . ewig . . . ")  was allowed to evaporate in magical silence. A rapt pause -- the ultimate  tribute -- preceded the inevitable cheers.  </P> <P> There may be hope.  </P></p>

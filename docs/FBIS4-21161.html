Jose Raul Mulino sent a four-page letter noting that the  U.S.  statements are general and subjective. He added that the  Panamanian Government has taken many actions to fight those  crimes.    In the document, Mulino says that Panama is not an economic  power and on many occasions it has had to establish it  priorities. Regarding the struggle against drug trafficking, our  cooperation has been expeditious and in good faith.    Mulino asked for a meeting at the highest level, with the  participation of the private sector linked to the financial  center, to discuss this problem.    The letter clearly states that the national government has  not eluded its responsibility.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> There may be some ambiguity whether EPA's test was whether (considering cost and other factors), the fuel controls were more reasonable than alternatives, or that alternatives were so drastic as to prevent EPA from concluding that they were reasonable. EPA did state that it determined that reasonable alternatives would not achieve enough reductions, and that it ``determined that remaining controls such as gas rationing, driving reductions, and source shutdowns are so drastic that the State may resort to fuel controls first.'' 54 FR at 26033. But EPA immediately thereafter characterized its judgement as being that ``State fuel regulation is a less drastic course than gas rationing and other unpopular controls.'' Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At the least, it seems that EPA believed that comparing the reasonableness of fuel controls to alternatives was a significant factor in determining whether the alternatives were themselves reasonable. EPA also explained that its judgment about what is too drastic ``is a complicated policy determination'' requiring the Administrator to weigh factors such as cost and popularity, and that such policy judgments need not be supported by the same technical record as, for example, determinations of as the magnitude or reductions an area needs for attainment. 54 FR at 26033. Also, EPA did not insist that the State fuel controls be sufficient to fill the shortfall to achieve attainment, or that all measures needed to achieve attainment actually be adopted in order to qualify for the section 211(c)(4)(C) exception. Most importantly, as the paragraph quoted above indicates, EPA gave significant deference to the State's determination regarding whether the fuel control was the most reasonable and practicable measure to achieve the NAAQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress's codification of EPA's interpretation of ``necessary'' in the fuel context confirms the validity of this interpretation in the fuels context. EPA is considering whether this approach should apply here, including deference to the OTC's view that no more ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the recommended measure are available that would be sufficient for purposes of attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the fuels precedent, EPA believes that the statutory structure, together with the legislative history, may further support giving substantial weight, or deference, to the OTC's recommendation that implementation of the LEV program throughout the OTR is necessary for attainment in the region. While EPA is to review the OTC's recommendations under section 184(c)(2)(B) ``to determine whether the control measures are necessary,'' under section 184(c)(4) EPA is to specify ``why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary'' if EPA disapproves or partially disapproves the recommendations. Section 184 nowhere mentions a parallel obligation to explain why the additional control measures are necessary in the case of approval or partial approval. EPA believes it could reasonably interpret these provisions to mean that EPA is to start with a presumption of approving the OTC's recommendations, unless it finds that the recommended measures are not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the legislative history could be read to support this view. As described above, the Baucus-Chafee Statement of Managers, in discussing EPA's role in reviewing an OTC recommendation, pointed out EPA's ``heavy burden'' to ``demonstrat[e] that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1 1990 Legislative History at 1004,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (emphasis supplied). As noted above, the Statement of Managers' discussion used identical language to Senator Lieberman's description in the Senate debate. Further, Senator Lieberman characterized the Senate bill as ``clearly stating'' that EPA must demonstrate that the additional control measure is not necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990 Legislative History at 1053,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be sure, EPA generally has an obligation to explain the basis for its decision, and the House Report did indicate that EPA's response ``should be buttressed by supporting material.'' H.R. Rep't. No. 101&hyph;490 at 256, reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History at 3280, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . But EPA's explicit statutory obligation to explain why a measure is `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  necessary'' together with the Senate's unequivocal interpretations in the legislative history may reasonably indicate that EPA should give substantial weight to the OTC's determination of necessity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is mindful that its factual analysis of the LEV program's necessity will be subject to substantial uncertainty within the nine month timetable provided for a decision. EPA expects this to be so both for the modeling information regarding its analysis of the magnitude or reductions needed as well as the reasonableness of the LEV program and alterative measures. Here, EPA is under a statutory obligation to reach a decision by November 10, 1994. Meeting this deadline may be particularly important in this case, because the OTC States are obligated under section 182(b)(1)(A) and section 182(c)(2) of the Act to submit for their ozone nonattainment areas, by November 15, 1994, demonstrations that their SIPs, as revised, will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the dates applicable to each area. These States presumably intend to rely on EPA's decision regarding the recommended LEV program in their attainment demonstrations to show that their SIPs will provide for timely attainment. Without knowing whether EPA will approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's LEV recommendation, the States would not know what magnitude of emissions reductions their other SIP measures must achieve. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Under these circumstances, and in light of the legislative history and statutory structure, it appears appropriate for EPA to at least resolve uncertainties in favor of approval, in deference to the OTC's determination of necessity. In other words, it appears appropriate for EPA to start with the position that it should approve the OTC's recommendation unless it has a sufficient factual basis to find that the LEV program is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  necessary. EPA requests comment on whether and the extent to which it should accord deference to the OTC's determination that the LEV program is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA notes that it generally has found SIPs inadequate and called for plan revisions after complete SIPs have been submitted or where a new situation arises creating the inadequacy. Here, an approval of the OTC recommendation within the nine month timetable would result in a finding under section 110(k)(5) of SIP inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) prior to submission of attainment demonstrations due November 15, 1994. EPA believes this is appropriate. The Act does not specify a deadline for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D); section 184 does not limit EPA to finding SIPs inadequate only after attainment demonstrations are submitted; and section 110(k)(5) specifically authorizes EPA to require SIP revisions ``to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section [184] and or section [176A].'' Indeed, States may need to rely on EPA's decision here in their attainment demonstrations. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

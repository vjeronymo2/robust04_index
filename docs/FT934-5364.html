			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques up 47% - Success of corporate strategy behind organic expansion Control Techniques, the Powys-based controls and drives producer, lifted pre-tax profits by 47 per cent, from Pounds 6.22m to a record Pounds 9.14m, in the 12 months to September 30. The outcome was struck on turnover of Pounds 105.3m, up 20 per cent from the previous Pounds 88m. The recommended final dividend is raised to 5.15p, taking the total for the year to 7.5p, against 6.85p. With earnings ahead from 9.8p to 15.3p per share, the distribution to shareholders is now covered twice by earnings, against 1.4 times in 1992. Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the directors had been 'mindful of the need to rebuild dividend cover to a level appropriate to a company such as Control Techniques which, to maintain its competitive edge, must invest significant sums in capital expenditure and research and development.' Mr Wheatley said the results were a direct reflection of the successful application of CT's corporate strategy - which focuses exclusively on drives and controls for electric motors - and this had produced a welcome improvement in organic growth. 'The strategy is to maintain CT's commitment to research and development, to standardise and centralise production in state-of-the art manu-facturing facilities in mid-Wales and to concentrate the marketing and sales effort on expanding the company's worldwide network of CT Drive Centres.' Worldwide, CT has 24 Drive Centres, small factories which take equipment from the Newtown manufacturing base and provide a tailored service to local customers. Six more will be opened this year as the company moves towards its ultimate target of some 50 units worldwide. Mr Wheatley said the rate of growth in orders had slowed somewhat in recent months and the board was not expecting any substantial improvement in economic conditions. The company had therefore been positioned to increase sales and profits even in this environment. COMMENT Rationalisation has played a part in CT's success this year - some 200 jobs have been cut worldwide. But there's more to the strategy than cost-cutting: 100 manufacturing jobs have been added in Wales and the overall worldwide headcount is only slightly down at about 1,300. CT is benefiting from its focused strategy, from the highly profitable Drive Centre development and from overseas expansion. The product substitution that has followed foreign acquisitions has increased output from Wales even though the US and German businesses - together accounting for Pounds 40m in sales - are not yet contributing to profits. But both are expected to contribute significantly this year, and in spite of market conditions, suggest a further rise in profits to perhaps Pounds 12m to Pounds 13m, putting the company on a reasonable prospective multiple of 16 to 17.</p>

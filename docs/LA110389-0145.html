			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JULIAN RUNS LA QUINTA PAST LOS AMIGOS  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago, Tom Julian of Garden Grove High School was one of the  top running backs and sprinters in Orange County. Two decades later, his  youngest son, Trent, is following in his father's footsteps.  </P> <P> Trent Julian rushed for 132 yards in 13 carries and caught six passes for 62  yards to lead La Quinta High School to a 37-3 victory over Los Amigos Thursday  night at Bolsa Grande High.  </P> <P> The victory moved La Quinta (5-4 overall, 4-2 in league play) a half game ahead  of Bolsa Grande, Kennedy and Rancho Alamitos in the race for second place in  the eight-team league. Los Amigos is 2-7, 1-5.  </P> <P> Julian utilized his exceptional cutting ability to repeatedly burn Los Amigos  for long gains, but he scored only once. La Quinta intercepted two passes and  recovered two fumbles, setting up an easy score in the second quarter and two  in the third to put the game away.  </P> <P> Julian was impressive considering torn cartilage in his right knee has reduced  his speed and forced him to miss La Quinta's opening three games.  </P> <P> "He's running at about 85% capacity," said Roger Takahashi, La Quinta's coach.  "If he was running with the speed he had this summer, he'd really be  something."  </P> <P> Julian injured the knee in La Quinta's night scrimmage before its season opener  against Westminster and didn't play until midway through La Quinta's league  opener against Santiago three weeks later.  </P> <P> "The doctors think he might have injured his knee a long time ago and then  aggravated it in the scrimmage," Takahashi said. "He's going to need  arthroscopic surgery after the season, or he might wait until after basketball  season."  </P> <P> Equally impressive for La Quinta was quarterback Richard Weaver. Weaver  completed 11 of 15 passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns. Weaver connected  with wide receiver Jason Cherms on a seven-yard scoring play and teamed with  tight end Todd Harvey on an 11-yard touchdown pass as La Quinta opened a 14-3  lead in the second quarter and never looked back.  </P> <P> The victory avenged a 13-10 loss to Los Amigos last season that kept La Quinta  from advancing to the playoffs.  </P></p>

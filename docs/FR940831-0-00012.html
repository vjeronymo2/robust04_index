			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On July 8, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;15&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8972 (59 FR 36930, July 20, 1994), applicable to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CT7 series turboprop engines, to require a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange outer diameter (OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore on a suspect population of propeller shafts for subsurface metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. That action was prompted by the determination that certain propeller shafts may have a metallurgical defect that could cause separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft. The FAA's investigation has revealed this population of propeller shafts may contain a metallurgical defect known as a pipe inclusion, which developed during manufacture of the shaft. This defect typically forms during the process of melting the ingot used to form the shaft and positions itself at either end of the ingot. During this phase of the manufacturing process cropping both ends of the ingot normally ensures complete removal of such defects. The FAA has determined, however, that for five heat lots of material, pipe inclusions may not have been completely removed from the material used to form the propeller shaft. The FAA has determined that suspect material was used to manufacture approximately 326 propeller shafts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received a report of a propeller separating from a SAAB Aircraft S340 series aircraft inflight following severe vibration. The FAA's investigation revealed that the propeller shaft separated due to a pipe inclusion defect positioned in a high stress location of the propeller shaft. That defect initiated a crack which propagated to failure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has determined that ultrasonic inspection equipment was assumed to be more available than has proven to be, based on input received by the manufacturer. The manufacturer reported that there are many operators that would experience difficulty gaining access to the ultrasonic inspection equipment in a timely manner given the current AD's compliance requirements, which could result in unscheduled grounding of aircraft. Therefore, the FAA is extending the compliance time for ultrasonic inspection of those propeller shafts first identified by borescope inspection in paragraph (b) of this AD to be suspect. In the current AD, paragraph (b) requires operators to ultrasonically inspect suspect propeller shafts identified by borescope inspection prior to further flight. This supersedure will extend the compliance time for ultrasonic inspection to the next shop visit following the borescope inspection, or October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. This compliance time is identical to the compliance time described in paragraph (a) of this AD, applicable to propeller shafts already suspected to have a metallurgical defect. By matching the compliance time of paragraph (b) of this AD to paragraph (a) of this AD, there is no reduction in the level of airworthiness of the inspection requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the FAA has revised the shop visit definition described in paragraph (c) of this AD to eliminate the separation of propeller criterion, which could lead to forced unscheduled ultrasonic inspections of the propeller shaft without ultrasonic inspection equipment available, and to specify the induction of the propeller gearbox into the overhaul shop rather than the engine, because it is not necessary to remove the engine to perform the inspections required by this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange OD fillet radius and inner diameter ID bore for detection of subsurface defects. In addition, Table 3 of this SB lists by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) a certain population of suspect propeller shafts to be identified by internal markings during a one-time borescope inspection. Those propeller shafts with markings identified as suspect in accordance with this SB must be ultrasonically inspected the next shop visit following the borescope inspection, or October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. Since the inspection procedures have not changed in Revision 3 of GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, inspections performed in accordance with previous revisions of this SB constitute acceptable alternate methods of compliance to the inspections required by this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, this AD supersedes AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;01 to require a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange OD fillet radius and ID bore on a suspect population of propeller shafts for subsurface metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

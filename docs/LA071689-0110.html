			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CULTURES IN CONFLICT BY URS BITTERLI (STANFORD UNIVERSITY  PRESS: $34.50; 215 PP.)  </P> <P> The work of a prominent Swiss cultural historian, "Cultures in Conflict" seeks  to transform the history of colonialism into cultural history by representing  the mental structures or world view of the actors on both sides, explorers and  indigenous peoples.  </P> <P> Drawing on the voluminous literature on voyages and colonization roughly from  the middle of the 16th through the 19th centuries, Urs Bitterli classifies the  types of encounters between Europeans and "others." His system proposes three  categories. The first type of encounter is "contact" -- what Europeans do when  they see natives and what natives do when they first see Europeans. Such a  model of mutual ignorance allows both (from the historians' point of view) to  make mistakes and arrive at misconceptions.  </P> <P> Bitterli mentions the creation story told by the Cherokee and their neighbors,  which grew up in response to cultural conflict: God created men by taking three  pieces of dough, molding them into a human shape and baking them in an oven.  The first man, incorrigibly impatient, demanded to be removed prematurely, and  was consequently undercooked and pale; from him are descended the white men.  The second figure, nicely browned, was the ancestor of the Indians. God's  delight in this figure made him forget the third, who remained in the oven and  burned. This figure was the ancestor of the black men.  </P> <P> This myth, Bitterli contends, is the result of the second type of cultural  encounter, "collision," in which the colonized feel that they have got the  short end of the stick and revolt. These revolts in turn are brutally  suppressed. An example is the Spanish colonization of Hispaniola (latter-day  Haiti and Dominican Republic).  </P> <P> The third type of contact is "relationship," examples of which are William Penn  and the English Quakers in Pennsylvania and the French Jesuit missionaries in  Canada. In this model, the Europeans study the natives carefully and manage to  live in relative peace with them.  </P> <P> One of the problems with Bitterli's classification system is that it does not  cover even all the encounters described in the book. It is unclear, for  example, into which category the Australian and South Pacific explorations  fall. Second, what does Bitterli's typology contribute to our understanding of  the works of writers like the Jesuit Father Le Jeune, who wrote extensively on  the Iroquois?  </P> <P> Third and most important, given the later history of colonization, many readers  will find it offensive to draw distinctions between the various types of  encounters in North America, for example. The peaceable efforts of the Quakers  and Jesuits were exceptions rather than the rule; the violent events in  Hispaniola have been called by historian Pierre Chaunu a "microcosm of the  entire history of America." A comprehensive account of colonialism, taking into  account the perceptions from either side, would be valuable. This, however,  Bitterli does not accomplish with his categories.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "Ordinary people have always and everywhere  understood me," announced former head of the RF Supreme Soviet  Ruslan Khasbulatov during his meeting with residents of the  Chechen village of Alkhan-Kala situated ten kilometers from  Groznyy.    As our Interfax correspondent reports, thousands of citizens  from nearby villages, elders, leaders of the clergy and local  councils attended. Amateur artists performed at the meeting.    Khasbulatov expressed his recognition for the support both  to  the village residents and citizens of Chechnya and Russia.    Khasbulatov received a gun and Astrakhan sheep-skin hat, a  papakha, from the village residents.    The day before one of the streets in the village of  Alkhan-Kala was called Imran, the name of Khasbulatov's father.  Leaders of the local council explained to our Interfax  correspondent that from 1934-37 Imran Khasbulatov headed the  local collective farm.    Due to the growth of Khasbulatov's popularity in Chechnya,  observers do not rule out the possibility that he could head the  forces in opposition to President Johar Dudayev. In particular,  the present leaders of the opposition welcomed the return of the  ex-speaker of the Russian parliament to his homeland as they  connect their hopes for political changes in the republic with  his name.</p>

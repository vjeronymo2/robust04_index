			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  speaking about Japanese automakers' plans to purchase auto  parts, said that these plans need the Japanese Government's  guarantee to make them effective. Kantor made the remarks in  testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and  Means Committee on 15 March. [passage omitted]    Concerning the remarks of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor,  the government said that in the automobile sector, the amounts  to be imported are decided entirely by the thinking of consumers  and automakers, and that the government's making a guarantee  would lead to the government's meddling in private sector  activities.    A government source stated that the recent remarks of U.S.  Trade Representative Kantor are aimed at securing some kind of  guarantee from the Japanese Government with respect to Japanese  automakers' plans to procure auto parts in a way similar to that  found in agreements concluded between private companies of Japan  and the United States and also between the governments of the  two countries last week regarding the facilitation of plant and  equipment investment to benefit a U.S. cellular phone company.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Socialist lieutenants await electoral fate: The sheer scale of the shift in political sentiment will mean a shake-up NO SOONER had Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, arrived at a Cambodian social evening in his Val d'Oise constituency last week than Mr Pierre Lellouche, his conservative opponent in this month's parliamentary elections, walked into the room. A photographer started taking pictures. The minister ordered him to hand over his film. The photographer refused. For Mr Strauss-Kahn, 43, this was only one of a string of humiliations in the current electoral campaign. Mr Lellouche, 42, a foreign affairs adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac, conservative mayor of Paris, has steadily been gaining ground. This week's polls suggest he will win the seat thereby depriving Mr Strauss-Kahn of his place in parliament. If he loses, Mr Strauss-Kahn would at least be in good company. Several prominent socialists risk defeat in this month's vote. Mr Michel Rocard, 62, former French prime minister and the architect of the 'big bang' post-electoral alliance with the ecologists, is in danger of losing his seat at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine near Paris, as is Mr Roland Dumas, 70, the influential foreign minister, at Sarlat in the Dordogne. Mr Georges Marchais, 72, the veteran communist leader, may forfeit the seat he has held for 20 years in Val-de-Marne. The chief cause of this shake-up is the sheer scale of the shift in political sentiment since the last legislative elections in 1988. The socialists now command the support of just 22 per cent of the electorate, according to the latest Sofres poll for Le Nouvel Observateur, against 38 per cent for the conservative RPR and UDF coalition. This means the socialists stand to lose more than half of their 270 seats in the National Assembly. However, the threat to Mr Strauss-Kahn, Mr Rocard, Mr Dumas and Mr Marchais is not simply the result of a swing from left to right. It is also the legacy of longer term structural changes in French politics - disaffection from the political establishment and the rise of new movements, notably environmentalism. Mr Strauss-Kahn's constituency in Val d'Oise, a 1950s new town which was expanded in the early 1960s to house the pieds noirs, the immigrants then fleeing to France from North Africa, looks like a classic socialist stronghold with its litany of social problems. Those problems have escalated as areas like Sarcelles, the urban hellhole within the constituency, have borne the brunt of the recent surges in unemployment, crime, drugs abuse and racial tension. Mr Strauss-Kahn, a former academic married to Ms Anne Sinclair, doyenne of France's television presenters, has appeared increasingly remote from his constituents as he has pursued his ambitions in the industry ministry. Mr Lellouche has been swift to exploit this scenario and to paint the ruling socialists as the cause of Sarcelles' problems, rather than in their old role as a source of solutions. The latest CSA poll for Le Parisien suggests Mr Lellouche will win the final vote on March 28 with 52 per cent, against 48 per cent for Mr Strauss-Kahn. Down in the Dordogne, Mr Dumas is also struggling against a strong conservative candidate. Mr Jean-Jacques de Peretti, the Gaullist mayor, has, like Mr Lellouche, profited from the socialists' plunging popularity. He has also benefited from the recent scandal over Mr Dumas's friendship with Ms Nahed Ojjeh, daughter of Mr Mustapha Tlass, the Syrian defence minister, and the revelation that her family foundation paid for a new Pounds 1m scanner in a Sarlat hos-pital. One of the few consolations for Mr Dumas and Mr Strauss-Kahn is that their campaigns are, at least, straightforward battles between left and right. Mr Rocard and Mr Marchais are not so fortunate. Their different electoral strategies have been complicated by the emergence of the ecologists as a third force in French politics and as a protest vote against the traditional left. There are two rounds of voting in French legislative elections. Candidates qualify for the second round if they win 12.5 per cent of the first vote. Mr Rocard and Mr Marchais are in constituencies where both the ecologist and conservative candidates are expected to join them in a three-way fight for the second round. Mr Marchais, who has presided over the fading fortunes of the French communists since 1972, risks being beaten in the second round by Mr Alan Lipietz, the ecologist, according to CSA. Mr Rocard's problem is that Ms Monique Le Saux, the ecologist candidate who is his former parliamentary adviser, stands to win 17 per cent of the second round. This means that the former prime minister's support would fall to 37 per cent, thereby allowing Mr Pierre Cardo, the conservative, to win the constituency with 47 per cent. Such a defeat could damage, but not destroy, Mr Rocard's chances in the 1995 presidential elections and would also dent the credibility of his call for a socialist coalition with the ecologists, although Ms Le Saux could, of course, be persuaded to stand down in the second round. In the meantime Mr Rocard seems remarkably sanguine. 'This is my 14th campaign,' he said this week. 'It's all rather routine.'</p>

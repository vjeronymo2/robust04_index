			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Wm Morrison rises WM MORRISON Supermark-ets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, reported a 25 per cent increase in annual profits as it surged through the current turbulence in the UK food retailing market. The company recorded one of the strongest sales performances in the sector as it raised sales from same-store space by 7.8 per cent, helping to lift pre-tax profits for the year to February 1 from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds 62.6m. However, trading margins suffered as a result of the company's insistence on keeping prices competitive, slipping from 6.3 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said: 'In this marketplace something has got to give.' Turnover expanded 23 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn as the company benefited from four store openings and a strong contribution from subsidiary companies. Six new stores will open this year taking the total to 59. The company also outlined an ambitious expansion programme for the following year with a further seven stores planned. This will largely be funded by the proceeds of its Pounds 98m rights issue last November. Net interest payable was reduced from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 3.78m. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 18.49p. Directors said that in the light of the results they would increase the dividend by more than envisaged at the time of the rights issue. A final of 1.6p brings the total to 2p (1.55p), an increase of 29 per cent. The shares responded strongly to the profits increase and a proposed 2-for-1 scrip issue, climbing by 15p to 328p. COMMENT Morrison's gritty no-nonsense approach to food retailing certainly chimes with the mood of the times and was rewarded with a strong gain in profits. Although eye-catching, the slippage in margin resulted from a planned squeeze on prices in order to remain fully competitive and is not in itself a cause for alarm. Indeed, the strategy seems to have worked well as turnover kicked ahead and the company gained impressive improvements in volume sales against a near-static industry average. This year, analysts suggest pre-tax profits may move ahead to Pounds 83m putting the shares on a prospective multiple of a shade over 14. The market is saying there is a sound future for the best-run regional grocer in spite of the ever-growing power of the leading groups. The share price is likely to perform resiliently but will be held in check by the adverse sentiment that still prevails towards the sector.</p>

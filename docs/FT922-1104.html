			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Lloyd's chiefs face fury of Names today TODAY'S annual general meeting of the Lloyd's insurance market promises to be full of fire and fury as its ruling council faces the anger of many of the hundreds of Names who face financial ruin as a result of the latest losses. The atmosphere will be tense, and it is likely that Mr David Coleridge, the chairman, will experience just as rough a ride as last year, when he fielded questions from Names for four hours. But in spite of the threats, leaders of groups of Names - the individuals who stake their wealth on the insurance market's fortunes - are expecting little of substance to emerge. Names facing losses are placing their hopes on legal action. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the leader of the Gooda Walker Names Action group  -the biggest group of loss-making Names - is expecting 'more heat than light'. He said: 'It will not be a calm environment. There will be too many people asking outrageous questions.' About 4,000 Names on seven syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, which went into liquidation last year, must pay Pounds 491m. The syndicates' losses are so great that officials only completed their accounting work yesterday. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which draws together representatives of all action groups, said he expected the meeting to be 'chaos'. Mr Clive Francis, a leader of two action groups, was scathing in his criticism of Mr Coleridge. He said: 'The council has now declared that Lloyd's is a matter of us and them. They have invited civil war and they are going to get it. Nothing much will be decided at the annual general meeting, except to see how much noise the glasshouse will take.' Some Names may raise questions about the Lloyd's Corporation's report and accounts, which is formally presented to the meeting. Detailed figures of the market's global results for 1989, its most recent underwriting year, will not be available until next week. But many Names leaders are placing more importance on the extraordinary general meeting next month, where the governing council will face votes of no confidence. In many ways this is just a scene-setter. Mr Valentine Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Names, said that the AGM was a curious process, as little actually happened apart from the vote on the report. He added: 'I would see tomorrow as a day of heat and light, and very gruelling for all concerned. I don't think it requires anything to be voted on.' Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, which represents Names on two badly hit syndicates, said he did not intend to ask questions because he ex-pected 'an anodyne response'. Ms Jenifer Grossman of the Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action group, said: 'We would like a bail-out but so many people have had their cash calls drawn and they've practically given up hope now.' Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, said: 'There will be rudeness and acrimony and bitterness, and that is totally unsatisfactory.' He added: 'I don't believe any good comes of that sort of attitude.' Warning of protracted legal conflict, Mr Benyon added: 'Busted Names will get their reward in the end because they will win their litigation, I expect. Settlement will have to come through the courts. That's a very sad thing but I can't see any alternative to it.' A Labour MP yesterday named four senior Lloyd's figures, including Mr Coleridge, in a parliamentary early day motion alleging 'corrupt insider dealing' on the market. The motion, tabled by Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, south Wales, noted that 'at least four past and present members of Lloyd's Council are running syndicates that have benefited massively from the LMX reinsurance system' and suggested 'this conflict of interest explains why Lloyd's Council took no action to curtail the reinsurance spiral'. Those named - who were 'estimated to have made re-insurance gains for their own syndicates worth Pounds 550m from the LMX spiral in the 1989 year of account' - included Mr Coleridge, Mr Murray Lawrence, Mr Brian Kellett and Mr Richard Hazell.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nestor Nunez from the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Colleague Alberto Pozo recently published an  editorial in BOHEMIA magazine, headlined "Gross or Net." In my  opinion, it unequivocally talks about certain ways to handle  economic enterprises. Sometimes we turn our backs on the truth  and opt for dreams or mirages. Pozo discusses in his  characteristic and direct language the issue of the profits that  the tourism sector earns for the country. He says there is talk  of $700 million in gross revenues in 1993, when the important  thing is to know the net figure actually earned and to ascertain  that it at least approaches the median that indicates efficient  and effective work.    I quote my colleague: There are examples of countries which  earn many dollars a year in this regard, yet they have spent  many more to earn them. Pozzo adds: This is nothing but a red  herring, so it is not a matter of concentrating on the big  figure. The important thing is to analyze it and learn if the  actual benefits, the clean and absolute benefits, of that  overall amount truly represent proof that all the necessary and  adequate things are being done in each case.    Pozo insists that if our tourism sector spends more than 60  cents seeking external resources for each $1 it earns, we cannot  talk about an efficient enterprise. An optimum benefit means  most of the products and services demanded by the sector should  be local. In addition, it would be necessary to analyze how  many employees we have per room in our hotels and how much money  we collect from renting the facilities. It is not the same to  attain $20,000 per room every year than to collect $40,000 per  unit, as it happens in other nations.    The author indicates that the change in structure which  resulted in the National Tourism Institute's disappearance  strives to abolish inefficiency. Alberto Pozo adds: A  40-percent occupancy rate cannot be considered efficient, much  less when capitalists believe a 40-percent occupancy rate means  the hotel is bankrupt. In fact, they close the hotel when it  reaches a 65-percent occupancy rate.    In other words, many issues must be considered when dealing  with an economic evaluation. If we only review one issue, we  may see what truly does not exist. This is something we  progressively assume, if we bear in mind that figures, number,  costs, and profits were not a cardinal concern for many people  until recently, when the belt was tightened to the limit. Then  it was time to begin counting cents to see what could exactly be  done with them.    If economic officials have to be precise and careful on  these  issues, I cannot but warn that the media must inform the people  about these problems with the same care so the people's  perception is as exact as possible. I believe Alberto Pozo, the  dean of journalism, is giving us all a clear example of what  must be done and how it should be done.</p>

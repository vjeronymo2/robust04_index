			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Arbitrator backs Burton An independent arbitrator has decided that Burton Group need not repay Pounds 1m to Dickson Concepts, which last year paid Pounds 60m for Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge store. The disagreement went to arbitration after Burton and Mr Dickson Poon, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, disagreed over the valuation of stock held and Harvey Nichols' depreciation policy. The two parties agreed beforehand that the decision of the arbitrators, which was taken last week, would be final.</p>

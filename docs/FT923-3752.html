			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bang &amp; Olufsen expects to be back in the black BANG &amp; OLUFSEN, the Danish manufacturer of television and audio equipment, cut a pre-tax loss of DKr136m last year to a loss of DKr30m (Dollars 5.57m) in the year to May 31 and forecast a return to profit in the current year. The net loss was reduced to DKr31m from DKr74m, while the operating result, before financial items, returned to a profit of DKr12m from a loss of DKr47m last year. Sales showed little change, moving up to DKr2.24bn from DKr2.18bn. The group said the DKr98m improvement in the pre-tax result was due to an improved cost structure and changes in the management and corporate organisation. The rise was achieved against a deteriorating market, which is not expected to improve. The outlook for the market for audio and video products is a further decline of 3-5 per cent over the coming year, said the group. But with costs under control, management strengthened, and new products ready, B &amp; O nevertheless expects an improvement in re-sults. After a loss per share of DKr25, down from DKr60 last year, no dividend will be paid, said the preliminary statement.</p>

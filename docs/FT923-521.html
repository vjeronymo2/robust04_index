			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Shaken Europe's pillar of strength: The EC's merger task force has risen to the challenge of cross-border regulation The lengthening shadows over the future of European integration have left most Brussels Eurocrats in a far from festive mood. But Mr Colin Overbury, head of the Commission's merger task force, is an exception. Not only does he have something to celebrate; he even has his own stock of sparkling wine, labelled Cuvee Merger Task Force. After two years in operation, Mr Overbury and his 50-strong staff have come a long way to win the confidence of previously sceptical European companies and national competition watchdogs. They have convinced them that they are up to the task of policing large and complex cross-border mergers. Though some of the task force's recommendations - the basis for merger decisions by the full Commission - have aroused controversy, it is widely praised for a businesslike approach which has combined speedy handling of cases with impartiality and open-mindedness. Gaining credibility has been crucial both to the effectiveness of the task force, and to Brussels' wider - and politically controversial - drive in the past few years to make a liberal competition policy a central pillar of the Community's economic development. Competition is one of the few areas where the Commission may act without specific authorisation from EC governments. But until a few years ago it used its powers timidly, issuing decisions which often seemed more to reflect dry legal theory than market realities. Under Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner since 1988, and Mr Peter Sutherland, his Irish predecessor, things have changed radically. Both men have sought to transform policy from a reactive safeguard into a positive force for creating and policing the emerging single market. As well as winning expanded powers over mergers from EC governments Sir Leon has cracked down on industrial subsidies, toughened scrutiny of state-owned industries and challenged entrenched national monopolies in energy and telecommunications. His activism has won respect, if not always friendship. It has also inspired countries such as Belgium and Italy, where competition law has been weak or non-existent, to introduce national controls on cartels and mergers. However, as the visibility and reach of EC policy have grown, so has debate about its direction and exercise. Critics in countries such as France claim it has already gone too far, while free-marketeers in Germany worry that Brussels is not tough and independent enough. This divergence underlines the delicate political balance on which the Commission's authority rests. Uniquely among anti-trust bodies, the Commission is charged with disciplining transgressors which are often not private companies but sovereign governments. Pressures to compromise arise not just because EC governments seek to influence individual commissioners in cases involving sensitive national interests. The Commission also cannot afford to antagonise too seriously governments on whose support and goodwill it depends to promote other areas of policy. Brussels' ability to stick to its pro-competition line will be called into question if national resistance to further EC integration - and the achievement of the single market - continues to grow. For the moment, the merger task force is counting on procedural efficiency and the quality of its legal and economic arguments to weather the storm. All 120 cases it has handled have been dealt with on time, and none of its recommendations has been rejected by the full Commission or challenged in the courts. Despite tight deadlines (see panel), Mr Overbury says the task force relies on thorough analysis of the economic impact of mergers rather than just on legal criteria. He encourages companies to discuss proposed deals with his staff and, if appropriate, to modify the terms before they are formally notified. This streamlined and pragmatic approach contrasts with the more long-winded and ponderous proceedings typical of other parts of DG IV, the Commission's competition directorate, and some national merger authorities. Indeed, some companies have deliberately structured deals so they fall within the task force's jurisdiction. But the fledgling policy is still feeling its way. This is partly because of technical imperfections in the EC merger regulation, which Mr Overbury concedes is 'full of warts, obviously the child of compromise at a very late stage.' For instance, Brussels still has difficulty deciding which joint ventures should be vetted by the task force under the merger regulation, and which by another arm of DG IV under Article 85 of the Rome Treaty, which employs different criteria. Some lawyers also complain that policy is unpredictable. Ms Diana Good, a Brussels-based partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, a London law firm, says the task force makes too many 'experimental' decisions, by which it refuses to be bound in the future. Legally the most controversial innovation was the task force's objection that the recent takeover of Perrier of France by Nestle of Switzerland would create duopoly - or shared dominance - of the French mineral water market. Most merger control experts agree that controlling duopolies is essential. However, many question whether the merger regulation entitles the Commission to do so, and whether it was proper to introduce the doctrine so abruptly. Some think Brussels should follow US anti-trust authorities by publishing guidelines setting out planned policy changes. Mr Overbury rejects guidelines, saying they could prove too constricting and send confusing signals to companies. But some lawyers think the Commission is also reluctant to seek the necessary authorisation from governments for fear of re-opening divisive arguments about the role of merger policy. Officials insist that debate is already settled. Though France and several southern countries originally wanted a merger policy which favoured employment and creating European champion companies, they say the principle that cases be judged solely by their effect on competition is no longer seriously contested. However, the solidity of the consensus has yet to be thoroughly tested, since the Commission has blocked only one deal - last year's planned takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Brussels' readiness then to brave French and Italian fury is cited by officials as proof of its determination and independence. Yet the decision also exposed the limits of the Commission's solidarity, splitting its 17 members and scraping through by a single vote. In other cases, the Commission's bark has seemed worse than its bite. For all its objections to duopolistic dominance in the Perrier case, its decision left Nestle and BSN of France controlling three - quarters of the French mineral water market and imposed what are widely considered minor conditions on the deal. Some lawyers think the task force's tight deadlines, which give third parties only 10 days to comment on deals, may allow some questionable mergers to slip through the net. Others believe the Commission is deliberately treading carefully, lest an unduly harsh line stifle an important force for EC economic integration and trigger political hostility. 'It's a fragile institutional situation,' says one. The case for caution has recently been reinforced by rising resentment in many countries towards meddling by Brussels. EC competition officials are openly relieved to have avoided any contentious proceedings involving France in the run-up to its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Sir Leon has sought to calm the waters by declaring his commitment to 'subsidiarity' - the doctrine that decisions should not be made centrally if they can be made nationally. In particular, he wants national courts to hear more EC competition cases. However, his enthusiasm is clearly tempered by reservations about how far national bodies can be relied on to do the job. Europe as a whole, he says, has yet to develop a 'competition culture' of the kind which has evolved in Germany. Precisely for this reason, some experts say, EC policy needs to be shielded more effectively from political meddling. The argument has been made most insistently by Dr Wolfgang Kartte, former head of the German cartel office, who has called for an independent European competition authority, separate from the Commission. Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission, has suggested that investigation of cases be entrusted to a special body, independent of the Commission's prosecuting arm, which would be obliged to publish its findings. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is also said to favour an independent competition agency on the grounds that it would insulate commissioners from a source of bruising political conflicts. Sir Leon, however, rejects all such proposals. Constitutionally, competition policy must always be accountable to a higher authority, he says. But to hive off policy to an independent agency, answerable to the Commission or the Council of Ministers, would be an 'open invitation' to those bodies to override the agency's every decision. His argument is given some substance by the position of France. Since the De Havilland affair, French ministers have seemed more favourable to the idea of an independent agency, in the apparent belief that its powers could be easily checked. In the last analysis, the strength of Sir Leon's case will continue to depend on his skill in winning arguments in the Commission. As one member of the task force puts it: 'He's our Gary Lineker. We give him the ball and he puts it in the net.' However, goal-scoring may become steadily harder if the Commission's increasingly defensive mood leads it to flinch from controversial decisions. Nor is there any guarantee that Sir Leon, whose term as competition commissioner is due to expire at the end of this year, will have a successor as politically adept, forceful or committed to free-market principles. Meanwhile, Sir Leon insists on being judged by results. 'No system is perfect, though the case has not been made for the changes which have been suggested,' he says. 'However, if the fundamental reason for change was that the Commission's record showed it wasn't behaving responsibly, the balance of arguments could shift.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN COMPETITION POLICY: KEEPING CONTROL OF CONCENTRATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main provisions of EC merger regulation:  -Applies to 'concentrations' which involve companies with combined   worldwide sales of Ecu 5bn and two or more companies with EC sales of   Ecu 250m  -Once notified by Brussels, deals are automatically suspended for three   weeks, or longer if necessary  -Merger task force has one month from notification to decide whether a   deal is 'compatible with the common market'  -If task force has 'serious doubts' about a deal, it launches a full   investigation. Commission then has four months to decide whether to   approve the deal, block it or insist on modifications  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

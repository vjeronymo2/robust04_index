			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sharelink Investment raising Pounds 5m to pay preference and debt SHARELINK Investment Services, the telephone-based stockbroker which is floating on the Stock Exchange at the end of this month, is raising almost Pounds 5m of new money to pay off Pounds 3.5m redeemable preference shares and Pounds 1.2m of borrowings. The information is contained in the pathfinder prospectus published yesterday. The group will be valued at more than Pounds 30m. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he wanted an ungeared balance sheet to enable him to invest in new services. Sharelink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is looking at expanding into insurance and banking. The annual remuneration for Mr Jones and Mr Kenneth Bull, finance director, is Pounds 125,000 and Pounds 80,000 respectively. Both directors are eligible for bonuses which last year came to Pounds 5,350 and Pounds 1,750 respectively. Sharelink's two biggest shareholders, Foreign Colonial Ventures and the British Coal pension fund, both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are expected to sell about half their shareholdings. Mr Jones, who started the business in 1987, is expected to sell a quarter of his 20 per cent holding, making him a millionaire just six years after he invested Pounds 4,000 in the bus-iness. He increased his holding after a management buy-out from the original institutional backers, BT and Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based stockbroker.</p>

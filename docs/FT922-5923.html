			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dartmoor seeks Pounds 8.05m as net asset value falls 25% DARTMOOR Investment Trust is raising Pounds 8.05m net via a rights issue and placing of debenture stock. The trust also announced a 25 per cent fall in net assets per share over the year to April 30. Dartmoor is part of the stable run by Ian Henderson Associates and invests mainly in income shares of split capital trusts. Income shares have been hit in recent months reflecting a belief that corporate dividend growth will be slow in the 1990s. In the 1-for-5 rights issue, 4m shares are on offer at 122p each with a warrant attached, entitling holders to subscribe for one new share at 118p over the next 10 years. In addition, the company is placing a further Pounds 3m nominal of the index-linked debenture at 114 1/2 p. As of April 30 the net asset value per share was 90.12p, down from 120.45p at end-April 1991. Asset values have increased in May and the rights issue will also have the effect of increasing the value to 97.58p. A maintained fourth interim dividend of 3.8p makes a total of 11.2p (10.8p) for the year. If the rights issue proceeds, the trust expects to be able to pay dividends of 11.6p in the current year. Earnings per share were 11.5p (13.85p).</p>

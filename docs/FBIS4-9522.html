			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have brought to the  brink of social poverty at least 1.5 million citizens by forcing  them to seek Red Cross humanitarian aid. One of the parameters  of the drastic overall impoverishment of the Yugoslavs, either  left jobless by the sanctions or with considerably lower  salaries, is the fact that 95 percent of parents of under-age  children are unable to provide school snacks. Regular check-ups  in Belgrade schools alone have shown that as many as 1,100  children suffer from undernourishment and aenemia, while many  cases of fainting from hunger have been recorded. This is why  the Red Cross of Belgrade last month began distributing meagre  snacks to all pupils in Belgrade which has the biggest number of  schools in the country.    Over 500,000 families, i.e. at least 1.5 million people,  have  so far registered for relief aid with the Yugoslav Red Cross.  This is a drastic rise in the number of socially threatened  citizens compared to two years ago, when the U.N.imposed  sanctions against Yugoslavia and when 62,583 families (or  142,608 people) had asked for humanitarian aid. Demands for  opening soup kitchens are arriving from all parts of the  country. Owing to the efforts of the International Conference  of the Red Cross (ICRC) the Yugoslav Red Cross managed to set up  some one hundred soup kitchens which distribute 4,500 meals each  day.    Today Yugoslavia has over one million unemployed, and those  who have work cannot secure the minimum living conditions for  their families. Monthly wages are barely sufficient for ten  days as the price of the consumer basket by far exceeds the  monthly earnings.    On January 24 the Yugoslav Government introduced a new  economic program of monetary reconstruction and economic  revival. In the two months of its implementation, the living  standards of the citizens gradually began growing and the  hyper-inflation, which had soared to world record highs, has  been stemmed. Despite this, the U.N. sanctions have put the  majority of Yugoslavs, even those who are still employed, in the  category needing humanitarian aid.</p>

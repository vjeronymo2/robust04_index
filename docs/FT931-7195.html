			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mayne Nickless holds steady MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security, medical and communications group, yesterday blamed subdued international trading conditions for a 0.2 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 48.5m (USDollars 33.4m) for the six months to January 3. The group said the result was 'steady,' and in line with forecasts in the annual report. But the interim dividend was reduced to 15 cents, franked to 30 per cent, from 17.5 cents, franked to 35 per cent. Mayne said earnings before interest and tax increased by 14.6 per cent to ADollars 85.6m. The improvement reflected better results from the transport and healthcare divisions following extensive rationalisation. The board said revenue improved by 11.1 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn, reflecting the acquisition of the Centropa Group of companies in Europe, the John Fawkner Hospital in Melbourne and Interlink in the UK. It said revenues were maintained in most operating divisions in spite of difficult trading conditions, confirming the underlying strength of the group's diversified operations. Mayne reported an equity-accounted loss of ADollars 12.3m on Optus, the telecommunications group established to compete with Australia's government-owned carrier. The board said it had capitalised an interest cost of ADollars 7.7m because of the nature of the investment. It said 'solid progress' had been made by Optus, and the investment would generate strong future returns. Mayne holds a 25 per cent stake of Optus, a joint venture with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, BellSouth of the US, the AMP Society, National Mutual and other Australian financial institutions. Mr Bill Bytheway, managing director, said a proposed flotation of Optus would probably not take place until the second half of 1994 because of forecast delays in a proposed ballot of telephone users. Mayne shares closed 22 cents lower at ADollars 6.97 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

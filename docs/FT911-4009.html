			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Clean sweep for new dust extractor - British Coal a lung disease contracted by inhaling dust - because of a new device that has just won the company its sixth Queen's Award for technology. Credit for developing the dust extractor goes to a team at the British Coal Technical Department (BCTD), headed by Dr Vic Ford, whom his colleagues describe as 'a dust expert'. Dr David Buchanan, director of research at BCTD, which employs around 500 people, explains how the extractor works. 'The actual coal cutting machine is like a bacon slicer - it carves off a couple of feet of coal at a time from the coal face. 'On that machine there is a rotating disc, with metallic picks that knock the coal off. What we've done is to drill holes round the outer part of the disc, or drum. 'Then we blow air through to the other side of the drum, using pressurized water. The dust sticks to the water droplets and is blown through to the other side of the drum, where the water hits a metal plate and drains to the bottom.' A beneficial side effect of the new drum is that the airflow it creates dilutes the methane that naturally occurs in coal mines and can ignite accidentally during mining. British Coal has been tackling dust for some time: it won a Queen's Award for a dust measurement device in the 1970s, and another for a dust filter in 1984. Although dust levels in British Coal mines are low by world standards, explains Dr David Buchanan, director of research at BCTD, it is important to keep pace with improvements in productivity - more work means more dust. The award-winning extractor has now been in use for around five years, and more than 150 have been produced each year for the last three years. The technology has been licensed to outside manufacturers. A small number of extractors have already been sold overseas. Funding to develop the extractor, which costs Pounds 7,500, was provided partly by British Coal Corporation, and partly by the European Steel and Coal Community. British Coal has previously won Queen's Awards for steering technology on coal cutting machinery, and for developing geological exploration technology.</p>

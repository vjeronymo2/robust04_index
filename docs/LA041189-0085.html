			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE VOLLEYBALL SQUAD COMES UP SHORT IN UPSET BID  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge men's volleyball Coach John Price is going to make an  audio tape. On that tape, he will record "We're a good team, but our passing  broke down."  </P> <P> The tape would have come in handy Monday night, when the Matadors lost to UCLA,  15-3, 12-15, 15-9, 14-16, 15-3, in a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn.  match at Northridge.  </P> <P> For the second time this season, Northridge stretched the nation's top-ranked  team to five games before losing. In February, Northridge lost at Stanford,  then the No. 1 team in the country.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to say," Price said. "Our passing breaks down, our hitting  breaks down and the guys try to do too much."  </P> <P> CSUN (8-19, 2-14 in conference play) trailed 9-7 in the fourth game after  dropping two of the first three games, but rallied to tie the match.  </P> <P> Bob Samuelson, who finished with a game-high 34 kills, had six kills as  Northridge rallied to tie at 14-14. Setter Tom Ribarich put Northridge ahead,  15-14, on an ace serve that barely cleared the net, and after six side outs,  the Matadors took the game on a Bruin error.  </P> <P> But any momentum the Matadors took into the fifth game was quickly doused when  UCLA (25-3, 14-1) jumped to a 6-0 lead. The Bruins readjusted their blocking  scheme on Samuelson and he failed to execute a spike during the run.  </P></p>

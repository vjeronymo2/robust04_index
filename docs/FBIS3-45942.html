Dawamat said his visit is intended to enhance relations  between China and Malaysia and to promote economic ties between  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China and Malaysia.    Xinjiang welcomes Malaysians to go there as tourists or  doing  business, he said, as the region is rich in natural resources  and has many Muslims, like Malaysia.    Mahathir said friendly relations between Malaysia and China  have been developing fast. Since his visit to China, there have  been more personnel exchanges. He hoped that more people from  Xinjiang will come to Malaysia. One potential area for business  cooperation may be petroleum, he suggested.    Dawamat is heading a Xinjiang delegation on a one-week visit  to Malaysia. They arrived yesterday.</p>

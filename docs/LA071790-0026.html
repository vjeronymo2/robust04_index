			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH MEDICAL COSTS ADD TO ILLS OF POOR, HEALTH SYSTEM  </P> <P> As a 25-year-old first-year graduate student in communications, Brigett  McDaniel was diagnosed two years ago as having sarcoidosis, a life-imperiling  disease that causes abnormal growths in various parts of the body.  </P> <P> One such growth was on one of her lungs. Although it was benign, doctors warned  her that it could turn malignant at any time. Yet McDaniel decided not to  undergo the recommended operation.  </P> <P> The reason was simple: She didn't have the money. Her husband, unemployed at  the time, carried no insurance, and McDaniel's insurance from school covered  only one-third of her bills.  </P> <P> "It was at this point that I stopped seeing the private physician," she told a  Senate subcommittee recently, "because his fee was between $250 to $400 per  visit, and I couldn't afford it."  </P> <P> Millions of Americans face the same predicament. While this nation boasts of  the world's highest quality medical care, studies show, it is financially out  of reach for a mounting number of families.  </P> <P> Health care in the United States is a story of poverty amid plenty.  </P> <P> Americans spent an extraordinary $540 billion on health care in 1988, the most  recent period for which government figures are available. That was more than  double what they had laid out just eight years ago and represented 11.1% of the  nation's entire economic output.  </P> <P> No other industrial nation spent such a large share of its wealth for health  care. And in no other industrial nation has health care spending been rising so  fast.  </P> <P> So expensive has medical care become that millions of Americans are denied it.  Experts have no way of pinpointing exact numbers of those without health  insurance, given the diversity and mobility of the population. But the Ford  Foundation estimates that between 31 million and 37 million Americans have no  private health insurance and do not get Medicaid benefits. Most of these people  do not have pockets deep enough to cover the cost of the health care they need.  </P> <P> And beyond the uninsured are countless millions of others who have had to  accept less than first-class medical care because their insurance provides  nothing better, according to the Ford Foundation, a private nonprofit  corporation that is active in and funds scientific, educational and charitable  programs.  </P> <P> Of the uninsured, about 24 million are employed workers or their spouses and  children. And, despite a popular belief that the indigent are covered by the  federal-state program known as Medicaid, there are 11 million Americans below  the poverty line who have no health insurance, Ford Foundation and federal  figures show.  </P> <P> From these roots spreads a thicket of additional problems. Big-city hospitals  are so crowded that critically ill people are sometimes denied admission  because there is no room to treat them. Thirteen of the 18 private hospitals in  Los Angeles County have dropped out of the county's trauma care system because  emergency room patients suffering severe trauma are frequently uninsured.  </P> <P> Black men in Harlem can expect to live a shorter life than the impoverished  citizens of Bangladesh. The U.S. infant mortality rate -- a prime indicator of  the nation's health care access -- exceeds 10 per 1,000. In a U.N. survey of 22  industrial nations, the United States ranked 20th, only slightly better than  Israel and Greece.  </P> <P> The well-to-do catch the ricochet. Because hospitals and doctors have no hope  of collecting from poor, uninsured patients, they compensate by charging more  to those who can pay. The rebound has become a significant cause of rising  health costs for those who can pay and for the companies that insure them.  </P> <P> The ailment has a cure. Karen Davis, chairman of the Health Policy and  Management Department at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, wrote recently  that society is facing a fork in the road.  </P> <P> "Either a basic societal commitment will be made to ensure access to health  care for all," she said, "or we risk a nation that is increasingly divided into  the cared-for and the neglected -- with the consequent toll in human suffering,  loss of life and economic productivity, and diminished social solidarity."  </P> <P> Such a commitment would cost money -- lots of money.  </P> <P> The Pepper Commission -- named for the late Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) --  whose members were appointed by Congress and former President Ronald Reagan,  recently called for an ambitious program to provide health insurance coverage  for all citizens. The price tag: $66 billion a year in federal funds and $20  billion in private financing. The commission ducked the obvious question; it  did not suggest how the public money should be generated.  </P> <P> A more modest proposal by the Ford Foundation last year would oblige employers  either to provide health insurance for their workers or to contribute to a  public fund for uninsured workers. The cost would be covered by $22 billion a  year from employers, $3 billion from employees and $2 billion from the federal  government. In addition, Medicaid coverage would be extended to the rest of the  uninsured poor at a cost of $3 billion a year.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has rejected both proposals as too costly. In Congress,  which would have to legislate any such programs, the issue is dormant.  </P> <P> Existing federal health insurance programs have proved a blessing for their  beneficiaries, but at enormous cost. Federal health-care programs already  consume more than $150 billion a year and account for $1 of every $8 that the  government spends.  </P> <P> Medicare alone, which insures the elderly, costs nearly $100 billion a year.  Without it and Social Security, the Ford Foundation says, almost half of all  elderly Americans would live in poverty; at present, only 12% do.  </P> <P> Medicaid, at a cost of $40 billion a year, provides a safety net for 22 million  poor people, according to Health Care Financing Administration figures. But  most states extend Medicaid coverage only to the minimum required by Washington  -- recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children and of the  Supplemental Security Income program for the blind and disabled poor. An intact  family with an employed worker -- regardless of how low the household income --  usually has trouble qualifying. In California, as in Illinois, such families  qualify only if the worker has recently lost a job.  </P> <P> In Washington, the record of the past decade is one of federal program cuts,  not expansions. Medicare and Medicaid benefits were largely untouched during  that period, although Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and doctors were  trimmed and states were forced to pay a greater share of Medicaid costs. But at  the urging of then-President Reagan, Congress made substantial cuts in smaller  programs to assist community-based health-care providers such as those that  popped up in rural areas and inner cities during the 1960s and 1970s.  </P> <P> "The result has been a marked slowdown in further improvements in . . . the  health of the poor and mounting evidence of a deterioration in access to  health-care services," Davis of Johns Hopkins wrote.  </P> <P> A 1986 report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the years from  1982 to 1986 "witnessed a reversal in the trends over several prior decades of  improving access to health services for low-income groups."  </P> <P> To discover how America's poor now receive their health care, a visit to  Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, operated by Fulton and DeKalb counties, is  instructive. On one recent afternoon, the long and cramped corridor in the  basement was lined two-deep with more than two dozen men, women and children,  some bleeding, some moaning, some sleeping. Some sat on the floor; others were  in wheelchairs and on gurneys. Many had been there for hours and would remain  for hours longer.  </P> <P> Gail Anderson, supervisor of the hospital's emergency room, said that about 800  persons a day are treated there. Many of them are poor people who go to the  hospital, where the service is free and relatively quick, for routine care.  "They know they've got ease of access to care at this hospital," Anderson  explained.  </P> <P> "Emergency rooms are not used just for emergencies today," said Anderson, whose  father is director of the Los Angeles County Hospital emergency room. "They're  used for convenience. This is true for any department, about 15% true  emergencies, maybe another 35% what I call urgencies and the rest are  conveniences."  </P> <P> Upstairs, Hamilton Holmes, the hospital's affable medical administrator, said  that the institution has grown so crowded that it has to turn patients away.  </P> <P> "We have a significant number of people who are making, say, $10,000 or $20,000  that just cannot afford to take out health insurance that come to Grady for  their medical care," Holmes said. "It's a significant problem to try to  maintain quality health care for people who are not paying anything."  </P> <P> It is a far graver problem for the poor themselves. For the Hoffman family of  Jennings, Mo., medical disaster turned into financial disaster last year.  </P> <P> Seven-year-old Eddy Hoffman, struck by lightning in his own back yard last  July, was left with severe burns over more than half of his body. He is now an  invalid requiring constant care and life-support systems at home.  </P> <P> His parents, Edward and Paige Hoffman, were both employed when their son was  crippled, he as the manager of his own vending machine company and she as a  part-time hairdresser and waitress. But they had no health insurance. A trust  fund set up by the Jennings police department paid almost $15,000 of Eddy's  bills. The Hoffmans expect never to be able to pay all the rest, which may  climb to more than $200,000.  </P> <P> Edward Hoffman, who had to give up his job so that he could spend more time  with his ailing son, now works only part time with another vending machine  company. Paige Hoffman quit working entirely.  </P> <P> "We still have been unable to afford health insurance," Paige Hoffman told a  Senate subcommittee recently. "When and if we are able to afford it, it's  doubtful that we'll ever be able to insure Eddy."  </P> <P> For the Baretta family of Oak Grove, Mo., financial disaster struck in the form  of an illness, not an accident.  </P> <P> Neal Baretta, now 39, lost his job as an auto worker soon after his 3-month-old  son, Jason, was diagnosed as epileptic 11 years ago. And with his job, Neal  Baretta lost his health insurance.  </P> <P> "We went out and tried to find an insurance company that would cover my son for  his disability," Baretta said before the same subcommittee. "They told us no  way."  </P> <P> In the years that followed, Jason accumulated medical bills of about $40,000.  Fortunately for Baretta, most of this gigantic sum was paid by a Missouri  program that helps low-income families with medical emergencies.  </P> <P> Now Baretta and his wife work full time, but neither employer provides health  insurance. For $240 a month, they have purchased a private policy that covers  them and their daughter. But they cannot find an insurer willing to cover Jason  -- at any cost.  </P> <P> So now the family tries to keep Jason sheltered, for fear that he will suffer  some injury that could seriously hurt him and financially destroy the family.  </P> <P> "Jason is 11 now," said Baretta, "and he wants to do what 11-year-old boys  would like to do -- play baseball, play football, soccer, ride a skateboard. He  can't because he doesn't have any insurance. How do you tell an 11-year-old boy  that he can't do normal things?"  </P> <P> What has happened to the Hoffmans and the Barettas is happening nationally to  groups that cannot afford proper health care. Consider, for example, the  collective health of the nation's blacks.  </P> <P> Mortality rates are significantly higher for middle-aged blacks than whites.  Mac W. Otten, an epidemiologist at the national Centers for Disease Control in  Atlanta, determined that income disparities between blacks and whites accounted  for 38% of the difference. Other factors included blacks' higher incidence of  high blood pressure, smoking, obesity and diabetes.  </P> <P> Colin McCord and Harold P. Freeman, doctors at Harlem Hospital in New York,  recently analyzed 1979 and 1980 death certificates at the hospital, which is  located in a neighborhood where 96% of the residents are black and 41% live  below the poverty line.  </P> <P> "Black men in Harlem," they concluded, "were less likely to reach the age of 65  than men in Bangladesh." Most fatal diseases, including heart disease,  cirrhosis of the liver, cancer and drugs, struck blacks at an earlier age than  whites, they found.  </P> <P> "Harlem is extreme, but it is not an isolated phenomenon," the doctors wrote in  the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Today's system of paying for health care gets bad marks nationally. In a recent  Los Angeles Times poll, 55% of the respondents called for "fundamental  overhauling" of the system. Nearly one in four said that they had denied  themselves health care treatment for fear that they could not afford it. Almost  half said that they could not afford care if they became critically ill.  </P> <P> The weight of public opinion has not been lost on federal policy-makers.  President Bush has appointed an interagency task force to study proposals for  improving health care. Constance J. Horner, undersecretary of health and human  services, leads a team studying what she called "every conceivable option."  </P> <P> But Horner made clear in a recent interview that, at least in President Bush's  view, not every option is conceivable. The task force, she said, has ruled out  universal health insurance provided by the government for those who are  otherwise uninsured. Nor, she said, will it approve mandatory employer-provided  health insurance.  </P> <P> "This Administration is not well disposed towards national health insurance  proposals," Horner said. "We want to find ways that are both humane and  economical."  </P> <P> Others have advanced more sweeping proposals. The American Medical Assn.  recently called for a costly package that would require businesses to provide  medical insurance to all workers, expand health care for the poor and limit  malpractice lawsuits.  </P> <P> Some of the nation's largest corporations, including Ford Motor Corp., American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Eastman Kodak, have joined with some of the  largest labor unions to create the National Leadership Coalition for Health  Care Reform. Organized labor long has called for national health insurance and  some corporate leaders, watching worriedly as their health-care benefit  packages have consumed an increasing share of their profits, have joined  labor's call for greater federal involvement in health care.  </P> <P> "There is a greater degree of concern now than ever before that there is a need  for radical change in the nation's health care system," said Bert Seidman, the  AFL-CIO's health policy director.  </P> <P> Edna del Weinel, head of Family Care Center, a 1960s-era store-front community  clinic that treats a predominantly working-class clientele in St. Louis, is  more direct and more pessimistic.  </P> <P> "We have not had a way to bring our society face to face with the fact that all  citizens have a right to primary health care," she said, her voice carrying the  timbre of hammer on nail. "There isn't the will at the top to bring anything  about for the health of poor, working people. What kind of country do we have?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> DRIVING UP HEALTH CARE COSTS  </P> <P> Total Spending:  </P> <P> 1980: $270  </P> <P> 1988: $580  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sources of Increase:  </P> <P> Increased use of medical services: $102 billion (33%)  </P> <P> General inflation: $133 billionn (43%)  </P> <P> Additional inflation in health-care sector: $74 billion (24%)  </P> <P> Source: Health Care Financing Administration  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO PAYS FOR HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> PRIVATE  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> 1980: $90.7  </P> <P> 1987: $200.6  </P> <P> Private business:  </P> <P> 1980: 68.1  </P> <P> 1987: 134.6  </P> <P> Philanthropy:  </P> <P> 1980: 1.6  </P> <P> 1987: 3.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> PUBLIC  </P> <P> Federal:  </P> <P> 1980: 41.7  </P> <P> 1987: 78.5  </P> <P> State and Local:  </P> <P> 1980: 34.1  </P> <P> 1987: 66.2  </P></p>

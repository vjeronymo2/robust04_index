			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Observer: Well read Denmark's new Social Democratic prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is taking no chances. Mindful of the fate of his predecessor, Poul Schluter, who resigned last month after having been caught out being a little too economical with the truth, Rasmussen has apparently decided that his civil servants should not be allowed to drop him in it. To whit he has ordered 30 copies of the Yes, Minister, and Yes, Prime Minister books from the English Bookshop in Copenhagen. It can be safely assumed that Sir Humphrey and Machiavelli will continue to rule during what Rasmussen claims will be his 'decade of decency'.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Court reforms could cut costs The cost of going to court and the time taken to deal with civil cases in England and Wales could be cut sharply by wide-ranging reforms being considered under a government review. The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that Lord Justice Woolf, who is heading the inquiry, has proposed that civil actions should be made simpler, cost ceilings imposed, and control of civil cases taken from lawyers so that people can represent themselves more easily. He has also backed firm timetables for cases to be heard. The radical changes would allow potential litigants to know in advance what chances of success their actions would have, what they would cost, and how long they were likely to last. The changes were 'long overdue', said Mr Gareth Williams, former chairman of the Bar. The legal process had shifted from being 'servant to master', because of 'cost, length and uncertainty'. Lord Woolf was put in charge of the review by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor. His report is expected in about two years, but proposals could be put into effect quickly since in most cases they would not require changes to the law. Under Lord Woolf's proposals, if the courts were put in control of the civil system legal aid could be given to more people as the cost of each case would be cheaper. Courts would decide which legal route each case would take and which timetable would apply. New 'procedural judges' could take charge of High Court and County Court cases at an early stage. Important and complicated cases would be handled by these courts; others would be settled by arbitration where possible. Most cases could be settled in a year under the reforms. One way to save time would be to cut down on the volume of documents disclosed before trials.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DECAPITATED CAT FOUND AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> A mutilated cat was found dead, its head and paws severed, in front of an  Irvine elementary school Monday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said they found the decapitated animal and body parts strewn about the  grounds of Greentree Elementary School. Police Sgt. Jeff Kermode said officers  were sent to the campus after a 2:40 p.m. call from the school's administrator.  </P> <P> "We were told that a decapitated cat head was placed on a sprinkler head at the  school," Kermode said.  </P> <P> In nearby Tustin, residents have become alarmed by at least 67 cat killings  since last winter.  </P> <P> In Tustin, county and federal officials believe that the cats have been killed  by coyotes. But members of TRAK -- Tustin Residents Against Animal Killers --  insist that the pets were taken deliberately by humans, possibly by Satan  worshipers for ritual sacrifice.  </P> <P> David Eick, 22, a bus driver for a day-care center near Greentree Elementary,  said the animal was discovered in the afternoon by students leaving the school.  </P> <P> "When I went to pick up some students in my bus, I found them all staring at  the remains of the cat," Eick said. He said one second-grader told him that he  was afraid because he believed that the dead cat, which was black and white,  was similar to his family's pet cat.  </P></p>

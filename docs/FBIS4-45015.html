			<p>CSO     [Text] Jammu, May 10 (UNI).    The Israel government has offered its expertise and  technical  know-how for sealing the border and high mountain passes along  the line of control (LOC) in the Kashmir valley.    Highly-placed defence sources said here today that a  proposal  to this effect was lying with the Indian government and a final  decision was likely to be taken after the Prime Minister, Mr.  P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned from his visit to the United States.    The sources said the proposal had already been studied by de  fence experts and the home ministry was likely to make a final  draft for putting up before the Union cabinet.    A team of Israeli defence experts was also likely to visit  India in this regard in the near future, the sources said.    The proposal envisages sealing in patches nearly 600 km of  border stretch along the tough terrain of the valley.    The Israelis have offered to install electronic wiring  system  with alarm and beeper signals which would detect human movement.    The sources said the electronic signal system would be put  on  ground along the line of control and whenever there was an  infiltration bid by the militants, the alarm would go off giving  indications and quick reaction time to the security forces to  deal with the intruders.    They said if the proposal comes through and is put into  action before the month of June, it would prove to be a "death  blow" to the inter services intelligence [ISI] plans for massive  infiltration along the LOC.    If an agreement is made, it would be the first defence  tie-up  between India and Israel after both countries established  diplomatic relations.    The sources said intelligence and army had received quite a  few authentic reports that the ISI was planning to send in only  foreign mercenaries during the summer season.    The sources said three regular battalions of Afghan  mujahideens were being raised by ISI at Muzafarabad in  Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They were being provided with the  latest weaponry for infiltration    The sources said they were waiting across the border along  the LOC looking for the right moment to slip into the Indian  side with a large cache of arms. The decision to send in Afghan  veterans for fighting security forces in Kashmir had two reasons.    One, the ISI is finding it difficult to motivate the local  Kashmiri youth to come across the border and join the militant  ranks. The second is that the ISI feels that the level of  violence needs to be stepped up and for that the Afghan  mujahideens, who had a reputation for being ruthless, would take  over the leadership of militants and go in for massive  destruction of life and property.</p>

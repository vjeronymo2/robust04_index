			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Carbon tax raises power sales hope THE UK electricity industry would suffer less than other sectors of the energy industry from the European Community's proposed carbon tax, according to a confidential report prepared for the Electricity Association, the industry's trade group. The tax might even result in electricity increasing its market share. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics, the research group, suggests that the tax would reduce total energy demand in the UK by 7 per cent between 1990 and 2000. Even so, electricity demand would fall only 5 per cent because large segments of industry would switch to electricity from other power sources. The big loser would be coal, where consumption is forecast to fall 19 per cent by 2000 and 42 per cent by 2005. Gas consumption would also decline because cuts by domestic and industrial users would more than offset increased use of gas by power generators. The EC is proposing a tax equivalent to Dollars 3 a barrel of oil, rising by Dollars 1 annual stages to Dollars 10. The tax would be based partly on the carbon content of fuel and partly on the energy content. The Cambridge report was commissioned by the Electricity Association to help it to prepare a submission to the government. Comments were due by the end of last week. On the sensitive question of how the tax would affect profits, the report says that about Pounds 400m is in the balance. If the electricity industry absorbed all the increased cost of the tax, total profits would be reduced by that amount. It was therefore a question of how much of the cost the industry would be able to pass on to the consumer. Last year the electricity companies as a whole made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2bn. The tax would reduce UK carbon emissions by about 9 per cent by 2000, the report says, helped by an easing of demand and a switch to cleaner fuels. Most of the reduction would come from the power generation industry. Transport, the other principal source of pollution, would barely reduce emissions at all because of the lack of alternatives to petrol. The report says that the measure would yield enough revenue to allow the government to cut value added tax from 17.5 per cent to 16 per cent. It concludes that the macroeconomic effect of the tax would be small provided that the revenues are fully recycled. Although the Cambridge report provides some encouragement to the electricity industry, it is unlikely to sway its general opposition to the tax. National Power, the largest power generator, has told the government that the tax might be damaging to economic growth.</p>

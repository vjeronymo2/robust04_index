			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / As They Say In Europe: Wyatt Erm rides again GEORGIE Soros and the Hedge Fund gang rode into town a week ago to release seven innocent governments from Sheriff Buba's clutches. The boys destroyed the Ems county jail and told the inmates they were free. But they just stood there. 'Dutch' Gilder even built himself a tiny cell all of his own. Ed Balladur shouted that nothing had changed. Buba's notorious deputy, Rip van Kinkel, said he would have the whole lot back inside on January 1. The inmates had lost their chains but gained a brand new set of resentments. Unwilling to stumble into the great wide world, they muttered imprecations against those responsible for making them responsible. The French had coined the phraseology of the 'Anglo-Saxon plot' but it was in Spain that it became the official view as state television hammered the message home. Generally the broadcast media had a bad monetary crisis. German television stations, for example, took hours to grasp the significance of the failure to cut the discount rate. And German newspapers seemed out of touch - as usual. They showed little interest in the activities of their Bundesbank until the crisis was on its last legs. Last Saturday, when the ERM was plainly in a terminal state, the Frankfurter Allgemeine led on the Christchurch by-election in which British Conservatives fared so badly. But eventually atavism took over, and suppurating national resentments burst out from the smooth skein of words usually applied by liberal-minded editors. Which gave me something I have longed for: a French review of the German press. The news agency AFP wrote: 'The Die Welt daily newspaper sneered at what it termed 'The grotesque international pleading to the Bundesbank'.' There you have two national attitudes for the price of one. It also revealed a gulf in attitudes towards what the French call the 'process of European construction' and the Germans call nothing at all. When Edward Mortimer told of his journey along the linguistic fault-line of western Europe in the Weekend FT last week, I spied the shadow of John Major at his side. As Mortimer travelled through Belgium, Alsace and Switzerland, the British prime minister was pointing out his beloved monetary fault-line. To the left lay those who keep their houses in sparkling order. To the right the Latin layabouts who expect to don the policies of others and prosper as a result. That, at least, is a Germanic view of the situation. The French wrongly believe that it is the British who are so very different from themselves. In fact the past week has shown that normal opinion, in its raw form, in Germany is little different from that in Britain. Was it the Evening Standard or the Hamburger Abendblatt which cheerily said that the EC timetable for economic and monetary union was now 'waste paper?' It was the latter. As a result of the debacle it was not, in the German view, the prisoners who were freed by the collapse of the ERM, but the jailer. The Bundesbank 'no longer had to make constant allowances for weak partners in the currency grid', wrote a Berlin paper. The concept of 'strength' has played a perverse role in the whole saga. Neither the French economy nor the franc are 'weaker' than their German counterparts. The franc is less 'attractive', that is all. And that is because the French economy suffers few of the weaknesses of the German, with the result that it does not need applications of a 'drop dead' monetary policy from a sado-masochistic cosmetic surgeon such as the Bundesbank. What France does possess is a rich tapestry of paranoia fashioned by skilled craftsmen over the ages. Some nations take their troubles in their stride or remain blissfully ignorant of what is going on. But the French this week cast the blame far and wide - Soros (of course), the British and the Americans. I should have expected this but was still surprised when Le Meridional wrote: 'The time has come to identify the beneficiaries and maybe the real actors in this disguised implosion of the EMS. And already behind a disunited Europe which has to rethink all its community mechanisms there naturally appears the shadow of GATT.' The exchange rate system has not, in fact, been wrecked by the free trade cowboys. In the real world the currencies of the ERM now fluctuate within a 4 per cent band, which is stable enough. The revolt on the markets was against high interest rates, not exchange rates. In France, on our family holiday next week, I shall receive only 10 centimes more for each Pounds 1 than before the Anglo-Saxons tried to wreck the French franc. Damn. The plot failed.

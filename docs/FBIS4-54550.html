			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov by Adam </F> Cerny; place and date not given: "The Developments in Bosnia  Make Us Anxious"]    [Text] LIDOVE NOVINY asked the Bulgarian foreign minister,  who will hold talks in the Czech Republic today, several  questions.    [Cerny] Bulgaria is located in the immediate neighborhood of  the Balkan conflict, and because of historical correlations, it  is also concerned with the problem of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Could you  characterize the attitude of your country regarding these two  topical issues?    [Daskalov] The conflict in former Yugoslavia is the most  complex and the most tragic conflict in Europe since the end of  World War II. The broad spectrum of the reasons for its  emergence and the belated activation of the international  community further complicate the search for a quick solution.    The events in former Yugoslavia are projected onto our  country in more than one respect. The war is close, which means  a potential threat to the security of Bulgaria. The damages to  our economy caused by honoring the UN Security Council sanctions  against Yugoslavia are tremendous. They have surpassed $3.6  billion since the sanctions were declared. It causes great  difficulties for Bulgarian foreign trade, telecommunications,  and transport connections with Central and Western Europe....    It is of vital interest to Bulgaria that the military  actions  in Bosnia-Herzegovina are terminated and a permanent peace  solution is found. As early as the beginning of the conflict,  we said we would not take part in any form of military  operations, including peacekeeping operations, in the territory  of former Yugoslavia, and we appealed to other Balkan countries  to keep their distance too. In our opinion, a way out of the  conflict can only be found by the joint efforts of the  international community: the UN, NATO, the United States, and  Russia.    The most recent development of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina makes us anxious but, at the same time, it  points out the safest route to the termination of the conflict,  which is negotiations. Therefore, we welcome the proposal for a  summit of the representatives of the United States, Russia, and  the European Union [EU] dedicated to these issues. The summit  would confirm the readiness of these countries to engage in the  search for a way out of the crisis.    Our country has been demonstrating by all its deeds over the  past two years that it does not have any territorial claims  against its neighbors. Bulgaria was the first country in the  entire world -- already on 15 January 1992 -- to recognize the  independence of the just-emerged Macedonia. We are interested  in having the statehood of Macedonia confirmed, in an even more  determined support for this state from the international  community. This process and the presence of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] are important steps in preventing the spread  of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina outside its present  framework.    [Cerny] Traditionally, Bulgaria has always had close  relations with the Russian state. How do you perceive Russia's  present position and the new exertion of its influence in the  Balkans and also its attempts at reviving the pan-Slavic ideas?    [Daskalov] I have already answered this question to a  certain  degree; we welcome the constructive endeavors of Russian  diplomacy coordinated with the United States and the EU that  contribute to finding a peaceful way out of the conflict and  that is just to all parties involved. As far as the  contribution and deeds leading towards peace and stability are  concerned, I believe we can all be satisfied.    I would prefer not to comment on the new phenomena in the  domestic political life in Russia. I would only observe that we  bear witness to its multifarious tendencies. The development of  the processes in Russia should be assessed from the vantage  point of the progress in the democratic and economic reforms,  but also from the point of view of the complex changes in  Europe. The integrating and democratizing Europe, whose  indivisible part are the Central and East European states, can  provide a natural support for the democratic development in  Russia.    Your question concerning the revival of pan-Slavism is  interesting already in the fact that the notion of pan-Slavism  emerged for the first time precisely on Czech soil.  Nevertheless, in the course of almost one and a half centuries,  with constantly changing conditions -- sometimes more, sometimes  less favorable -- it has never achieved substantial progress or  scope. It is, from this vantage point, a form of utopia.    It would be a mistake if we took a nihilistic approach and  denied the contribution of the Slavic peoples to the European  culture only because certain extremist politicians utilize it as  their motto.</p>

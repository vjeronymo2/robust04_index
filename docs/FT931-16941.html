			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Observer: Pecking order Who gets what in the new year honours list has always been a bit of a mystery especially when it comes to honouring Britain's captains of finance and commerce. Indeed, this year's crop of Ks will have done little to disabuse those who feel that contributions to Tory party coffers remain far more important than success on the business pitch. Admittedly, the latest bunch seemed more deserving than some. TI's Christopher Lewinton, Kingfisher's Geoffrey Mulcahy, HSBC's Willie Purves and LWT's Christopher Bland are above average business leaders. Meanwhile, Harry Djanogly and Raymond Johnstone, are of the old school of successful businessmen who regard charity and public service just as important as making money. However, if 'Chips' Keswick of Hambros deserves a knighthood for 'services to banking', surely Brian Pitman, the long serving chief executive of Lloyds Bank - Britain's most successful big bank - also deserves the same sort of recognition. He has done more than most to revolutionise the efficiency of British banking.</p>

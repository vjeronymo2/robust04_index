			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese vice  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen briefed Russian  intellectuals here today on China's reforms.    Speaking at Moscow State University this afternoon, Qian  said  that 16 years ago China shifted the focus of work of state onto  economic development, beginning a new period of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics through reforms and  opening to the outside world.    The reform in China, first changed the previous single  public  ownership system but practiced multi-ownership one with the  public ownership as the main part, he said.    Then, the reform broke the planned economy system, giving  full play to market mechanisms in economic development.  Thirdly, it formed a situation of opening China to the outside  world in various spheres, the Chinese vice premier noted.    Pursuing the process of reform and opening up, China has at  the same time fought crimes, strengthened democracy and the  legal system and strengthened clean government, he added.    He stressed that the all-round reform steps have resulted in  historically significant changes in the country.    China needs both internal stability and a long-term stable  and peaceful external environment for its socialist  modernization drive, and is willing to continue to exchange  experience in reforms with Russia, he said.</p>

Son Won-tae said: "When I think about the great President  Kim  Il-song devoting his whole life to the country and the nation, I  can hardly restrain thankful tears rolling down my cheeks. Our  people are a happy and proud people because they have the great  leader."    Yim Chun-su said: "The magnificent view of Pyongyang with  the  beautiful Taedong River flowing through it represents the  ever-prospering looks of the motherland."    Pak Sang-chin said: "Those who are studying hard at the  grand  and richly decorated grand people's study house present quite a  contrast to those at libraries in the United States who give  themselves airs, seeking a gay life."    Kim Sun-cha said: "I was deeply impressed by the noble  spiritual world of the people who are eager to exalt their  country and nation. I keenly felt once more that when our nation  unites and achieves national reunification, our motherland will  prosper endlessly in the van of the world."</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Glitz in short supply at tunnel launch Europe's most prestigious engineering project this century, built at a cost of Pounds 10bn, began its commercial life on a distinctly unglamorous note. Among the cargoes carried by the 14 trucks on the first Channel tunnel shuttle to leave Folkestone, Kent, were washing powder for Italy, steel coil for Switzerland and bulb trays for the Netherlands. Trucks on the returning shuttle were loaded with glass and industrial bleach. The reaction of French lorry drivers making their first trip through the 32-mile long tunnel would have been better if the hot meal they had been promised had materialised. Dutch drivers re-routed from the longer, more leisurely Rotterdam to Hull sea crossing, complained that they would miss the disco. Mr Roy Clementson, the first British driver to manoeuvre his truck on to the 800-metre open-sided freight shuttle, welcomed the speed and convenience of the 35-minute crossing. It is 'just like being on the tube,' he said. Mr Julien Heuze, among the first of the French drivers, agreed it was 'impressive and, unlike the ferries, not too crowded'. Unlike car passengers, who will stay with their vehicles, lorry drivers travel in a 'club car' similar to a standard railway carriage. Once the catering arrangements have been sorted out, they will be served a free hot meal at their seats. If the drivers enjoyed the experience, Eurotunnel's long-suffering shareholders and bankers will have been even more pleased that some revenues were finally coming in, even if the first half-dozen shuttleloads yesterday travelled free. Eurotunnel is starting with a limited service of one shuttle an hour in each direction, rising to two an hour next month, mainly for invited account customers. In the first few weeks hauliers will not be charged the full fare. In July Eurotunnel hopes to start a full price, turn-up-and-go service. Freight tariffs are negotiated individually depending on the volumes shipped and the type of cargo. Mr Christian Zbylut, Eurotunnel freight director, said individual tariffs were confidential, 'but you cannot assume we are lower than the ferries. Some quotes will be more, some less.' For hauliers shipping only the occasional load, a single fare for a 40-tonne truck would be Pounds 390, higher than the Pounds 315 Stena Sealink said it would charge on its ferries. However, one truck driver who turned up yesterday negotiated a rate lower than the quoted Pounds 390. Eurotunnel said it had signed commercial agreements with 1,200 freight hauliers representing more than 85 per cent of the cross-Channel market.</p>

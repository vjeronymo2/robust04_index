			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Textile rentals and currency gains boost Johnson Cleaners to Pounds 18.2m Johnson Group Cleaners, the largest dry cleaning group in the UK and US, announced a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits helped by currency gains and steady growth in its textile rental operation. Mr Terry Greer, chairman, retained his usual cautious outlook in spite of the increase, with warnings that the outcome for the current year was far from certain. Trading had declined in the first few weeks. 'People are still nervous, waiting for the tax increases in April to hit their pay packets,' Mr Greer said. Business had also suffered from harsh winter weather in both the US and UK. Such concerns had not been apparent in the 12 months to December 25, when Johnson achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 15.1m) on sales 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 165.2m. The advance was achieved after interest charges were halved to Pounds 814,000 and was also helped by a 15 per cent improvement in the average dollar/sterling exchange rate. The strongest profits advance came from textile rental, with a 15 per cent jump at the operating level to Pounds 10.1m on sales 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 45.1m. The profits increase included a better than expected Pounds 505,000 contribution from Imperial and Queen Laundries, the textile rental business acquired in January. This division improved profits both in the US and UK. Mr Greer said this was partly due to a greater focus on the more hygienically stringent food processing industry and partly due to 'early signs of increased demand'. The dry cleaning division remained difficult in both markets, with franchising in the US continuing to make losses. Operating profits were largely flat at Pounds 8.9m on sales 9 per cent higher at Pounds 120m. Johnson Group also announced plans for a capital reconstruction aimed at improving the marketability of the shares. The company proposes to subdivide the 25p shares and consolidate them into ordinary shares of 10p each. The final dividend was increased by 7 per cent to 20p, for a total pay-out 5 per cent higher at 27p. Earnings per share were 62.01p (49.4p) basic or 59.23p (48p) fully diluted. COMMENT There is a risk with Johnson Group of endlessly repeating the same story. Yet there is little to add while discretionary spending remains stubbornly depressed. Johnson does extremely well to hold dry cleaning profits and even better to build a textile rental division through the ravages of recession. When the eventual upturn comes - and only then - Johnson is expected to show substantial improvements. Forecasts of Pounds 19m for this year put the shares on a prospective p/e of about 17. While this may be up with events in the short term, those punting on longer term growth are unlikely to be disappointed.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Uneasy activists scatter from rally with the fringe on top - How the week has been dominated by gossip and a very real political vacuum IT WAS the noises off that counted. From the stage of Blackpool's Empress Ballroom the party faithful were calmed with populist rhetoric. But it was the hubbub from the wings which told the story of this week's Conservative conference. The activists arrived bewildered by the government's incompetence, angered by its failure to tackle crime and enraged by the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. They left with few solid commitments, but half-persuaded at least that their voices had been heard. They will never cheer Mr John Major with the passion once reserved for Lady Thatcher. But most have decided at last that particular segment of the past cannot be revisited. She stole the headlines this week but not the party. Nor, in spite of the question mark which hangs over Mr Major's leadership, do the activists lust for another execution. But on the fringe (these days as important at Conservative conferences as it used to be at Labour ones) and in the faded splendour of the Imperial Hotel, it was a different story. It was here that his colleagues pondered quietly and not-so-quietly whether Mr Major's premiership could be rescued. Here, the right and left claimed to be filling the ideological vacuum at the top. Here were the subtle manouevrings of politicians who are not quite sure if, and until when, their leader would survive. The conventional wisdom was that the right wing won the day. The broadest smiles were on the faces of Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Michael Howard and Mr Peter Lilley. The 'bastards' appeared to exult in the label pinned on them a few months ago by the prime minister. They had a point. The perception of most in the cabinet is that on issues such as law and order and family values a much tougher stance catches the public mood. Bashing Brussels provided an easy safety valve for the party's depression. But the shift should not be exaggerated. The Tory party at conference is always well to the right of its own government. With one or two notable exceptions, ministers - and Mr Major - prefer to pander to their supporters than to forgo that precious conference ovation. But this is still a centrist Conservative government. Mr Douglas Hurd has not been transformed into a Euro-sceptic nor Mr Kenneth Clarke into a free-market ideologue. In spite of his unexpectedly cheap jibes at the bureaucrats of Brussels, Mr David Hunt remains an apostle of the social market. Mr Hurd, one of the few in the government able to lead rather than be led by the Tory party faithful, offered an eloquent critique of the Maoist revolution sought by some of his rightwing colleagues. Mr Major is still not 'one of us'. The vacuum was revealed in the alternative ideologies presented on the fringe - Mr Portillo offered the most convincing from the right - and the gossip at the glittering parties hosted by Lord Archer. Mr Major's call for a return to the values of the 1950s will not fill it. Village greens, warm beer and neat rows of terraces appeal to the sentimentality of the Conservative party. Yesterday's speech was the one that Tory prime ministers make when they are in trouble. Lady Thatcher made one like it in the late 1980s. But none of his colleagues were pretending it was a prescription for purposeful government. For a range of reasons there is no enthusiasm in the cabinet for a change of leader. The 'bastards' do not yet have a credible candidate. Mr Clarke is not at all convinced that the party would survive another assassination. Many hope genuinely that Mr Major will rebuild his authority. But no-one is sure. His friends are impatient with Mr Major's failure to mobilise the power of the premiership. His enemies are prepared to give him only conditional support. They will not push him under Westminster's No 11 bus, but they are far from certain it will not knock him down anyway. This week Mr Major won some time. It is possible that the history books will record it as a turning point. But possible is the operative word. The next few months, in the phrase of one senior minister, will be a 'bloody winter'. Mr Major has cemented the alliance with the Ulster Unionists which might double his Commons majority on issues of confidence. But ministers are filled with foreboding that the habit of rebellion has become deeply ingrained on the Tory backbenches. The Budget will provide plenty of excuses for disloyalty. So too will the British Rail privatisation and the European elections. The prime minister has won a breathing space. He cannot afford to waste it.</p>

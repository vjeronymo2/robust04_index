			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REST BETS;  </P> <P> SOMETHING COZY, SOMETHING WILD  </P> <P> In the mood for a cozy snack? Not in the mood to start making reservations? One  of the most romantic restaurants in town has just opened the perfect place.  </P> <P> It's called the Four Oaks Fireside, and it's the woodsy room downstairs at the  elegant Four Oaks restaurant. The menu is small, simple and very sophisticated.  There are terrines of foie gras, tartares of tuna or rillettes of smoked salmon  and duck. There are wickedly rich soups. There's a full bar -- and there are  extravagant desserts such as rum-glazed pineapple with coconut ice cream or  profiteroles with honey ice cream and hot chocolate sauce.  </P> <P> The point is to provide a place where you can drop in on the spur of the  moment. Unfortunately the idea will probably prove so popular that before long  you won't be able to get in without reservations.  </P> <P> The Four Oaks Fireside, 2181 N. Beverly Glen, Los Angeles. (213) 470-2265. Open  daily from 6-10 p.m. Appetizers $6.50-$14; desserts $6-$6.50RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

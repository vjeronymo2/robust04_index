			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy and officials of the port city of Norfolk, Va., prepared a red  carpet welcome for the first visit by Soviet warships to the United States in  14 years. A Soviet cruiser, a destroyer and an oiler will dock at U.S. Atlantic  Fleet headquarters this morning for a four-day good will visit. It will be only  the second Soviet naval port call in the United States since World War II and  the first since a Boston visit in 1975. At that time, U.S. Navy ships also  visited Leningrad.  </P></p>

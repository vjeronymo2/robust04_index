			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / OFT urged to reopen Eurocopy inquiry MR Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, yesterday called on the Office of Fair Trading to reopen its inquiry into Eurocopy, the photocopier distribution company which was cleared last month of allegations that it was unsuitable to hold consumer-credit licences. An investigation into the sales practices of some Eurocopy subsidiaries began last year. Mr Griffiths said he had written to the OFT after receiving many complaints about the copier group in the past 10 days. He was speaking at the launch of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, a lobby group set up to combat what it sees as misleading contracts and selling practices in the photocopier leasing industry. Mr Michael Armitage, Eurocopy finance director, suggested that the OFT's decision had, in effect, turned Eurocopy into a model for the industry. He said the group had taken steps to reform its sales practices before the OFT inquiry. However, the OFT is believed to have written to Eurocopy saying that its decision should not be seen in such a light, that several assurances about future practices had been received from Eurocopy and that the company must report to the OFT regularly the level of complaints it receives from customers. Mr Griffiths said the campaign would lobby for legislation to change the Consumer Credit Act, which covers only agreements worth less than Pounds 15,000, and protects individuals rather than companies.</p>

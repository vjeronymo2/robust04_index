			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Compromise proposed on EC investment services THE CREATION of a single EC market in securities trading moved a step closer yesterday with the release of a new compromise proposal on the investment services directive. Spurred on by the recent accord on capital adequacy standards for EC banks and securities firms, the Portuguese - who hold the EC presidency until next week - have suggested a way to bridge the gap between feuding French and British camps on the key issue of how quickly off-market share transactions should be made public. Finance ministers will be asked to consider the Portuguese plan when they meet on Monday in Luxembourg. Britain and Germany are against immediate or rapid disclosure of trades, which would leave their market-makers exposed whenever a large trade went through the system. France and the southern countries are broadly in favour of more transparency which would have a less drastic effect on their order-driven markets. The Portuguese plan would involve a rolling system averaging out information about prices and volume over six hours and delaying publication for two more hours. 'This will ensure that market anonymity is respected and market liquidity looked after,' said a European Commission official. Transparency is the most important of several issues which have been holding up the investment services directive since 1990, despite several rounds of intensive ministerial and expert negotiations. The aim is to allow investment companies to trade throughout the EC after 1992. 'If we sort this one out the rest more or less clicks into place,' said the same Commission official. Earlier arguments about whether banks should be allowed direct access to stock markets - a proposal resisted by Spain and Portugal - have now been reduced to a debate over when direct access should be granted. But there is still a question mark over how France will react to the Portuguese proposals. At Monday's meeting finance ministers are expected to reach a formal common position on the capital adequacy directive, the broad lines of which were agreed two weeks ago. Negotiations over the last fortnight are said to have ironed out the outstanding technical difficulties.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / W Midlands businesses report faltering outlook Economic recovery in the west Midlands has reached a plateau and confidence about immediate prospects for corporate profitability has faltered, according to a survey of business performance carried out by chambers of commerce. But the proportion of companies recruiting more staff has increased and, for the services sector, there have been increasing difficulties in finding skilled manual labour. The West Midlands Regional Group of Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey, published today, shows that the rise in domestic orders experienced in the first quarter of the year was not repeated in the second. In June, 42 per cent of the 455 manufacturing companies covered in the survey reported home orders higher than three months before. But in March 46 per cent of companies reported fatter order books, up from 37 per cent in December 1993. In the services sector, the same pattern emerged. Of the 187 companies taking part in the survey, 47 per cent reported increased orders in June against 57 per cent in March and 38 per cent in December. But there is a disparity of performance in overseas markets. The proportion of manufacturing companies reporting higher export orders rose to 36 per cent from 34 per cent but the proportion of service companies was down from 40 per cent to 26 per cent. The survey suggests that companies are far more cautious about the immediate future than cabinet ministers. In June, 44 per cent of manufacturing companies and 46 per cent of service companies were expecting higher profits over the next year, but in March the proportions were, respectively 47 per cent and 50 per cent. Further evidence that tax rises and the fear of higher mortgage rates have slowed down the recovery in the housing market emerged yesterday with the publication of a national survey of estate agents. The survey by the National Association of Estate Agents showed that 43 per cent of its members had reported less business during June, compared with 22 per cent reporting more business.</p>

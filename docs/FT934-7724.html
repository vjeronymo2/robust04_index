			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news boosts base rate hopes AN UNEXPECTEDLY large fall in domestic inflation in October gave a significant boost to base rate optimism in the UK stock market yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index moved strongly ahead, brushing off unimpressive UK retail sales progress, leaving the market to face its next hurdle this morning when it must respond to the outcome of the Nafta vote in the US Congress. A nervous start on Wall Street left London to close off the day's best levels, with the FT-SE Index finally 22.5 up at 3,120. Reports that a leading US investment bank had sharply downgraded its ratings on the Hong Kong stock market also upset London. The news that domestic inflation had fallen to an annualised 1.4 per cent in October, from 1.8 per cent in the previous month, contrasted with market expectations that the rate would be either unchanged or even slightly higher. A base rate cut of at least half a point - several analysts are going for a full point reduction - moved right to the top of the stock market agenda following the inflation announcement. Led by a strong premium on the December stock index future, shares jumped sharply and took the Footsie to a day's high of 3,126.1. The peak was held until Wall Street opened up sharply lower before steadying during UK trading hours. Interest rate optimism had already been encouraged by a rate cut in Belgium, although with markets closed yesterday in Germany, London analysts were taking a cautious view of the chances of a move by the Bundesbank at today's policy meeting. The market's renewed optimism was reflected in further recovery in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which gained 15.7 point to 3,436.7. Seaq volume, again boosted by a large trading programme, remained high at 662.2m shares compared with 654.8m on Tuesday, when retail business returned to more average levels with a value total of Pounds 1.32bn. The focus turned towards the property shares, which have much to gain from further cuts in domestic interest rates, and to the bank stocks which will see their bad debts reduced as interest rate pressures recede. But some store shares lagged behind the market, restrained by disappointment with the very modest 0.1 per cenmt gain in retail sales in October - sector analysts had looked for a rise of at least 0.3 per cent. The poor retail sales number cast a shadow elsewhere in the market, since it suggests that economic recovery is still lagging. Company trading statements continued to unsettle the stock market yesterday, with Courtaulds joining the list of leading British companies to receive rough treatment on the stock market this week. Some traders warned that the sharp rise in share prices at mid-session had brought out significant selling orders from the bears which undoubtedly continue to roam through the market. The opening of equity trading this morning could well present traders with a difficult picture as they struggle to respond to factors in other global centres. Wall Street's performance in the wake of the NAFTA debate will dominate early trading in London but dealers will also be watching the Hong Kong market with some apprehension.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Chairman of Linx resigns THE CHAIRMAN of Linx Printing Technologies, the maker of continuous ink-jet printing equipment, has resigned after the company's poor full-year results, making way for Mr Michael Moore, non-executive chairman of Tomkins, the conglomerate. Mr Moore was appointed as a non-executive director of Linx before the company's flotation last October. The shares, which floated at 130p, have been around yesterday's closing price of 94p in recent weeks. They peaked at 220p in March, fell from about 180p to 120p after a profits warning in May and the resignation of Mr John Shead, the sales and marketing director. This spring, both Linx and its UK rival Domino Printing Sciences warned of poor trading because of the recession and the market's maturity. Linx also admitted to what Mr Harris called 'structural problems on the marketing side'. Linx full-year results in July showed pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 down by 13 per cent to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.5m).</p>

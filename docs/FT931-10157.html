			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith urges west to help east MR JOHN SMITH yesterday called on the west to launch a concerted effort to address the economic problems of the new eastern European democracies and the developing world, Ivo Dawnay writes. Calling for a new Marshall plan for eastern Europe, the Labour leader used a speech in Athens to question the austerity measures being imposed on the new democracies by international banks and institutions. In his debut as chairman of the Socialist International's economic committee, he argued that the G7 group of industrialised western powers needed a statesman to galvanise assistance to the east. He also called on the European Community to reach a compromise with the US to ensure that a rapid agreement was reached on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

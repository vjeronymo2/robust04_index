			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leo Tindemans, chairman of the European </F> People's Party, by Dirk Vanoverbeke; place and date not given:  "Seven Questions for Leo Tindemans"]    [Text] [Vanoverbeke] Employment and the economic situation  are subjects of concern for Europe. What do you think of the  Commission's white paper on competition and growth? What  concrete proposals does your party have in order to combat  unemployment at the European level?    [Tindemans] I fully support the Commission's white paper.  The action plan based upon it and approved by the European  Council on 11 December 1993 in Brussels must be implemented as  soon as possible as a matter of priority. The plan is not  perfect, no plan ever is, but its implementation would make the  European Union (EU) a large region able to stand up to American  and Asian competition. The EU would become the best equipped  region, setting standards in telecommunications, information,  and transport. It would provide investors and businessmen with  excellent working conditions. The encouragement for small- and  medium-sized companies should be welcomed. The idea of an  infrastructure and public works plan should not be rejected, but  special attention and constant monitoring by European and  national authorities is required.    [Vanoverbeke] Social Europe seems to leave much to be  desired. What can be done about that?    [Tindemans] An answer in theory to the question is  relatively  simple: Europe (except for Great Britain) has approved a social  charter. The EU is going to have to take some social measures.  The present conflict with Belgian frontier-zone workers in the  Netherlands is one example. But I heard Jacques Delors state  that the principle of subsidiarity also applies to the social  sector. The difficulty lies in knowing when it must be  respected. The social debates at the European Parliament were  usually the scene of great confusion. But social matters must  not be excluded from the EU's competences. The speech by  Jacques Delors on 28 May is a good indicator.    Maastricht also creates possibilities which have not yet  been  fully examined. In the area of education, for example. And we  must be sure that education in Belgium is among the very best.    [Vanoverbeke] When we see the inability of the international  community to take effective action in the former Yugoslavia,  European common foreign and security policy seems to have got  off to a bad start. How can we make it more credible?    [Tindemans] Monetary (financial) policy, foreign, and  defense  policy remain the most sensitive activities of a sovereign  state, even if it is a EU member. The situation in the former  Yugoslavia is an example of this. The only advantage compared  to 1914 is that Russia, Austria, France, Great Britain, and  Turkey are not at war but are talking. But, unfortunately,  there has been no progress on the ethnic front.    It was decided at Maastricht to draw up a common foreign and  security policy.    This does not yet exist, it is invoked as an excuse, and it  will be conducted following the rule of unanimity. Which means  that not much will be done. On the other hand, if such a policy  proves impossible, we can already predict the birth of small  coalitions, heralding a return to the politics of the past. Can  we not imagine old alliances forming around the negotiating  table which date back to the First or Second World War? Is that  what we want?    [Vanoverbeke] Are you satisfied with the relations between  the European Parliament (EP), the Council and the European  Commission (EC)? What proposal would you make for the 1996  intergovernmental conference, when the Twelve have to review the  functioning of the institutions?    The relations between the Council, the EC and the EP are not  good. The so-called interinstitutional dialogue is a farce. We  saw that yet again during the enlargement debate. I welcome the  proposal to have the intergovernmental conference on  institutional reform prepared by three presidents: The  president of the Council, of the EC and of the EP. These three  would be forced to listen to the institution they head. We  would not be obliged to consult the "wise men" who, in the  present circumstances, would inevitably be dependent upon their  governments. The result of their discussions would necessarily  be weak.    On 4 May in Strasbourg, I was able to cite four letters from  the German chancellor, and the Belgian, Netherlands, and  Luxembourg prime ministers. They were in favor of setting up a  working party consisting of members of the Council, EP, and EC  to be charged with drawing up reform proposals to be submitted  to the 1996 conference. I also approve this proposal.    The basic philosophy behind the Treaty of Rome was inspired  in outlining the role of the EC and the EP. But enlargement has  brought a need for increasing democratization. What is the  future EP's task, role, and competence to be? How is the EC to  be reformed? It has too many members. I have very clear  answers to these questions, but negotiations have not yet begun.  In any event, the EP cannot be excluded from the 1996  conference which could be either the crowning glory or the end  of the Europe of the founding fathers.    [Vanoverbeke] The EU sees itself as a grouping of nations  with a common commitment to democracy. How should we respond to  the present rise of extremists?    [Tindemans] The treaties are perfectly clear about this: The  EU is a grouping of democratic nations. Each member state must  therefore ensure that their democracy remains healthy. This  question is now very pertinent in Italy. But the spirit of the  times cannot be governed by laws or regulations. On the  contrary, they are usually dictated by it. Combating  unemployment, ensuring a high standard of education,  contributing to a housing policy, dealing with racism and  xenophobia, ensuring the internal security of one's own country  and of Europe: These are a whole series of proposals which can  help create a genuine climate of tolerance and balance. They  must permit the rebirth of good sense, at home and elsewhere.    [Vanoverbeke] Do you still believe the plan for economic and  monetary union (EMU) to be feasible, given the developing  economic situation? Should the convergence criteria or the  timetable for EMU be reviewed?    [Tindemans] I still believe in EMU. I was pleased to learn  that the European Council ratified the Maastricht decisions in  December 1993 in Brussels. Doubt in this area would have  reawakened international speculation. In principle, we must  stick to the criteria and timetable adopted in Maastricht if we  want confidence to remain intact. It is within this framework  that governments and experts must act "for the best."    [Vanoverbeke] The European elections are often seen as a  test  at national level. Does not this trend generate a certain  ambiguity, threatening to overshadow the interests of Europe?    [Tindemans] We cannot condemn strongly enough this politics  of opportunism which consists of presenting the European  elections as the ideal occasion to wreak vengeance upon the  national government.    In Europe, we must implement the white paper, achieve  monetary union, and draw up a common foreign and security  policy. All of which extends far beyond the context of Belgian  politics. Those who seek to confuse the European dream and  reality with mere domestic concerns are betraying the most  inspiring idea of our century: That of leaving behind us  hatred, jealousy, and war between hereditary enemies to prepare,  together, a new chapter in European history.</p>

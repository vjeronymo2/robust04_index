			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 12 April  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1.

He says that investing money abroad is a sign  of weak belief and that the faithful should invest their funds  in their own countries and thus help reduce unemployment and  increase production. The mufti's comments are in response to  reports that the investments of Arabs and Muslims abroad total  $670 billion, of which Egyptians invested $60 billion.  <H5>  STATEMENT DEFENDS AL-AZHAR IMAM AS AUTHORITY ON RELIGION </H5>   On page 1, 'AQIDATI carries a 70-word report on a statement  issued by the Islamic Research Council replying to the  criticisms leveled against al-Azhar and stressing that the  al-Azhar imam is the grand imam and ultimate authority on  religious affairs. On page 2, the newspaper carries the 1,400  words text of the statement.  <H5>  SENTENCES PASSED FOR CRITICISM OF MUFTI </H5>   An 80-word report on page 2 says that the Cairo Criminal  Court has sentenced in absentia Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, head of the  Shari'ah Department at the Islamic Studies College of al-Azhar  University; Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, a teacher at Qatar University;  and AL-NUR editor 'Ali Faruq, for criticizing the mufti's edicts  on bank transactions and the importing of alcoholic drinks.  They were each given six-month suspended jail sentences and  fined 200 pounds.  <H5>  SEMINAR ON ISLAM'S VIEW OF WORK AND PRODUCTIVITY </H5>   A 2,000-word report on page 4 details the proceedings of a  seminar held at al-Kharijah town in al-Wadid al-Jadid as part of  the 'AQIDATI religious convoys that tour the country to explain  the true tenets of Islam. Most of the seminar dealt with  Islam's view of work and productivity, and ample Koranic quotes  are given indicating that Islam advocates work. Saying that the  issue of work and productivity is topical, Dr. Sabri  'Abd-al-Ra'uf, dean of the Shari'ah Department at the al-Azhar  Medical College, says that "Islam does not rely on slogans or  prayers but on useful work to achieve the fruit of production."  He then notes that "work and productivity should be based on  studies, awareness, and full expertise. This is why it is our  duty to refer to those who possess the message. God Almighty  says "If ye realize this not, ask of those who possess the  message." Islam rejects pursuing our lives without plan or  purpose. We see ideas that are alien to our youths tending to  turn them into idle hands and tempt some of them to devote  themselves to prayers alone and to abandon work and  productivity. Every youngster then turns into a mufti and  speaks in the name of religion, but religion is not responsible  for these youths, who do not understand the meaning of religion,  the cause of religion. Religion does not accept these ideas."  Questions on proper ways to pray, care for orphans, a wife's  duty to a drunken husband, and the way of dealing with people in  workplaces are then answered by the experts panel.  <H5>  WRITER RAPS WEST FOR HONORING RUSHDIE </H5>   A 400-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All  Frankness" column on page 6 comments on the Austrian  Government's decision to honor Salman Rushdie, British author of  "The Satanic Verses." After saying that Europe continues its  blatant hostility to Islam and recalling how Rushdie was  received by President Clinton in the White House, the writer  adds that "The U.S. President would have had a different stand  had Rushdie criticized Christianity or Judaism." He then says  that the issue now is not Rushdie but the thousands of  charlatans and mercenaries who regard this renegade as their  ideal and are daily attacking Islam. Predicting that attacks on  Islam and its sources, the Koran and the prophet's sayings, will  increase following the honoring of this renegade, he asks  whether "the Islamic countries will be content with merely  reiterating the expressions of condemnation and denunciation?  Or will they take more positive steps to protect their  religious sanctities and its shari'ah from these mercenaries?"    AL-AZHAR SHAYKH EXPLAINS RIGHTS AND DUTIES    A 900-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh  Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq on 'AQIDATI's page 7 deals with the  interpretation of man's rights and duties under secular and  religious laws. He starts by viewing the secular laws'  interpretation of human rights and public freedoms, arguing that  this interpretation means that human rights are more or less  personal rights that are designed to protect the human being.  He then presents Islam's view which indicates that man has both  rights and duties. He adds that religion "indicates that the  relationship between the ruler and the ruled makes it the duty  of the ruler to be fair and to manage the affairs of the ruled  in a legitimate way. It also makes it the duty of the ruled to  obey the ruler as long as he obeys God and his prophet. The  congregation has the right to have its interests cared for. The  principle that religion is not compulsory gives every individual  the right to his own creed. It is the duty of the state and  society not to interfere with this freedom unless it is abused  or threatens the Islamic society's safety, security, and strong  structure."  <H5>  WRITER ON SUPPORT FOR DETAINEES' FAMILIES </H5>   A 400-word comment by Majdi Salim on page 10 comments on the  testimony of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi that he saw  a lawyer handing a 250,000-pound check to a terrorist leader to  spend on the families of terrorist detainees and prisoners. He  argues that this should not be criticized, as the families have  to be taken care of, otherwise the new generation will be angry  with society. After citing a similar example from the 1960's, he  concludes that "the state has rejected the notion of collective  punishment. We should adhere to this, so that we can encircle  terrorism and eliminate this phenomenon, which is alien to our  society."  <H5>  HEAD OF KOSOVO'S ISLAMIC SHAYKHDOM INTERVIEWED </H5>   A 1,200-word report on an interview with Rajab Boya, head of  the Islamic shaykhdom of Kosovo, appears on 'AQIDATI's page 20.  After reviewing the number of Muslims and the areas they live  in, he details the Serbs' persecution of Kosovo's Muslims and  the measures taken against them. He then gives his view that  the turn of Kosovo's Muslims will come once the Serbs have  finished with Bosnia and that he expects this massacre to be  worse than the Bosnian one.  <H5>  WRITER URGES SCHOLARS TO UNITE TO FACE ISLAM'S ENEMIES </H5>   A 500-word column by Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf on page 24  comments on the sentence passed by a Cairo court on two  university teachers and AL-NUR's editor. The writer says he  feels regret and sorrow at this ruling, which is not the first  nor will it be the last as long as there are societies, media,  different views, and even mistakes. He adds that his sorrow  does not stem from the ruling itself but from the fact that  differences between scholars have reached the courts. He says  that scholars' differences should be confined to their circles  and within objective limits, otherwise they would threaten  educational and propagation work. Another point he notes that  is that differences between scholars and labelling them either  "the regime's scholars" or "scholars outside authority" have  somewhat blocked these scholars from the arena and left it  vacant for those who advocate extremist ideas. He then adds  that letting "the scholars' differences reach the level of  conflict and quarrels have opened the door wide for the enemies  of Islam to promote polarization and attempt to sow sedition and  deepen the dispute between these scholars." He calls on the  scholars to put aside their differences and face the dangers  posed to Islam from outside the land of Islam, as well as from  inside.</p>

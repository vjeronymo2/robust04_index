			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "The Armenian Trade Minister </F> Was Sent to a Detention Center, But He Returned to His Office"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Trade Minister Tigran Grigoryan,  who was arrested last week, was released two days later, but he  has no intention of making out that nothing happened.    In conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent he described  how he was arrested.    "A few minutes before the start of a collegium session an  unfamiliar man entered my work office and, referring to the fact  that he had suffered at the time of the Chernobyl tragedy,  demanded that I issue a license to trade in alcoholic beverages.  I did not even have time to tell him to whom and where it is  necessary to apply in such cases, before a second stranger burst  into the room and placed a pile of dollars on the table. `This  is a bribe,' he explained, and left equally suddenly. Without  touching the money, I at once asked my assistant over the  intercom to detain the rogues, but militia personnel had already  entered the office and ordered me not to move. You would have  to be very naive not to see an obvious provocation in what  happened. There can be no doubt that the `cooperators' were  agents of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But I still cannot  understand who needed to make precisely myself the hero of such  a comedy or why. I am simply obliged to see this matter through  to the end, and I expect answers to all my questions."    It would, of course, be a great exaggeration to allege that  ministers are jailed in Armenia almost every week. At the same  time the official authorities make no comment at all on such  happenings, even the most recent. In the conversation with  IZVESTIYA's correspondent the trade minister found it hard to  explain why the government, of which he is a member, did not  issue an appropriate statement right after his arrest and still  continues to maintain silence.    Meanwhile, as Armenia's general prosecutor declared, the  minister was arrested without his approval, and there are no  grounds for charging Tigran Grigoryan. An investigation is  still continuing, however, and this alone will be able to dot  all the "i's." But for the time being people will go on  whispering for a long time behind the back of the minister, who  has been defamed before the whole world.</p>

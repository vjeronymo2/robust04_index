			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No alternative to real policy Sir, Michael Cassell's article on Britain's success in attracting inward investment ('A challenge to pole position', October 13) promotes the idea that attracting inward investment should be an end in itself. As a recent Chatham House study demonstrated, Britain's success in attracting investment extends well beyond the obvious examples of American and Japanese companies, and this attraction shows little sign of waning. Such investment is generally beneficial and should be welcomed, but it is not a panacea. Forty-one foreign companies among the top 100 British exporters have done little to eliminate trade deficits or to alleviate unemployment. The British government should concentrate on macroeconomic and commercial policies instead of using inward investment as a surrogate for industrial policy.

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Skoda finds Volkswagen less than reliable: The Czech government is asking the German carmaker to honour its promises Volkswagen's joint venture with Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer, had been hailed as a shining example of east-west co-operation in the post-communist era. Now it has become a source of embarrassment and friction between the Czech government and the German vehicles group. Today, at a meeting in Ingolstadt, near the Czech border with Germany, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Industry minister, will remind Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, that the Czech government is still the majority shareholder in the venture and should be treated accordingly. He will ask for details of VW's plans for Skoda, where the German group has a 31 per cent stake, which is due to be raised to 70 per cent by the end of 1995, with an option to buy the rest later. The meeting has been called after months of controversy culminating in a fierce public exchange over VW's decision to cut its projected investment in the venture from DM7bn (Pounds 2.75bn) to DM3.7bn and to scrap plans to build a new engine plant. This follows an earlier row over the cancellation by VW in September of a DM1.4bn investment financing package for Skoda only hours before it was to be signed in London. The Czech government, which holds a 69 per cent stake in the venture, says VW failed to inform it in advance about these moves. Prague accepts that VW, which faces big losses this year, may have good reason for scaling down its plans for Skoda, but officials say they must be consulted, and that VW must honour the joint venture agreement signed in 1991, over which there is a dispute about what is legally binding. Prague officials say that the government is meeting its obligations to cover any restitution claims against Skoda and its pre-1991 debts. VW for its part, promised to produce an improved version of the popular Skoda Favorit model, build a new engine plant, and develop a new car. 'We want to see these promises materialised. I don't consider (the engine plant) to be fully out,' says Mr Dlouhy. The difficulty for the government is that many of VW's promises of future investments in Skoda are not part of the original contract, but were made separately to ministers of the previous government. Ironically, VW was chosen in preference to Renault for the venture primarily on the strength of its investment plans, though these will now be considerably less than expected. But what has hurt Czech pride most is that rather than Skoda becoming a major car producer in its own right - fully developing and building its own models - it could turn out to be little more than an assembly plant run from Germany. The government is also concerned that VW's moves to cut back its investment will affect the value of Skoda's shares, making it more difficult to find buyers for the final 30 per cent should VW not take up its option. 'We need to show Skoda is in good shape if we want to get a good price. For that we need a secure investment programme by VW. By cutting their investment by half they undermine the implicit future price of these shares,' says a Prague official. Under growing public pressure and criticism of VW in the Czech press, the government has to show it is fighting for Czech interests. Officials dismiss as unrealistic suggestions that the government should find an alternative investor, but they say the government as majority shareholder could force management changes at Skoda, and decide how the annual dividend is used. Most of all it will press to be kept better informed about VW's intentions. 'After all, unlike in Catalonia (VW's troubled Seat plant), we are still the majority shareholder. We have the right to know (what VW is doing),' says one official. Seat's future, Page 26</p>

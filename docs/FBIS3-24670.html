			<p>SUMMARY                                  While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has won fairly broad  domestic support for his refusal to accept U.S. demands to  establish objective criteria to measure Japan's import  performance at the failed 11 February U.S.-Japan summit, comments  by Japanese political and business leaders and by the Japanese  media have contained a strong undercurrent of concern about the  long-term impact of the failure of the framework negotiations.  These concerns appear to center around the further rise of the  yen, possible U.S. sanctions against Japan, and the potential  danger that increased trade friction may damage the political and  security relationship between the two countries.  To help contain  such future developments, the Japanese Government appears to be  planning to draw up a variety of measures to increase imports and  relax regulations governing the Japanese market in certain areas.  The scope of these measures, however, is still uncertain and they  may face resistance from entrenched interests in the Japanese  bureaucracy.                          END SUMMARY     Prime Minister Hosokawa's refusal to accept U.S. demands to  establish objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance  won support across a broad political spectrum in Japan.  Senior  members of Hosokawa's increasingly fractious coalition backed the  prime minister solidly on the issue in comments made over the  past few days.  In  comments on a 13 February TV Asahi panel  discussion, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who has  recently reportedly clashed with the prime minister on a variety  of issues, including tax reform, defended Hosokawa's stance and  stated that acceptance of targets would have been "totally  impossible."  He added that any policy under which the government  would have agreed to set targets for the private sector would  have "threatened the very foundation of the nation's economic  system."  Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi  Kumagai made similar comments during a 12 February FNN Television  round table discussion, and Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of one  of the key parties in the coalition and one of the leading  figures behind Hosokawa's government, endorsed the prime  minister's stance in an interview in the 14 February Yomiuri  Shimbun.  Ozawa stated that it was "proper" for Hosokawa to  reject the targets because Japan had grown more independent of  the United States and must now "act with responsibility as a  mature nation."     Ambivalent LDP Stance     The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has also supported  Hosokawa's stance on targets, confining their somewhat ambivalent  and muted criticism of his performance at the summit to other  issues.  For example:     -- In a statement on the summit, LDP President Yohei Kono  described Japan's rejection of U.S. demands for establishing  objective criteria as "natural," according to a 12 February Kyodo  report.  Kono reportedly focused his criticism of Hosokawa on  what he described as the government's overreliance on the  bureaucracy to handle the trade negotiations.  He also rebuked  the prime minister for criticizing the way the LDP conducted  negotiations with the United States in the past.     -- Similarly, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a senior  LDP leader, reportedly stated during a lecture on 14 February  that he opposed the setting of numerical targets, but warned that  the United States might take "retaliatory action" against Japan  because of the failure of the summit (Kyodo, 14 February).     -- During a round table discussion on NHK Television on 13  February, Kabun Muto, foreign minister at the time the framework  accords were drawn up in July 1993, praised Hosokawa's for  rejecting objective criteria in almost unequivocal terms.  Muto  implied that the LDP, if still in power, would have done the same  thing, stating that the party had, while in power, maintained  that it would not "accept any measure that would lead to managed  trade."   Muto added that "it was good that the talks broke off  in failure" in view of the U.S. insistence on setting objective  criteria.     -- During the same discussion program, another LDP member,  Masajuro Shiokawa, criticized the government for not dealing with  U.S. demands for the establishment of objective criteria rapidly  enough, commenting that it had "known from the beginning" about  the demand.  He added that the government would have been in a  stronger position had it been able to come up with an effective  "counterproposal" to U.S. demands.     Business and Media Reaction     The Japanese business community and the Japanese media also  generally supported Hosokawa's stance on objective criteria.  Many business leaders, particularly those whose industries were  involved in the framework talks, applauded Hosokawa's stand,  arguing, as they have in the past, that such targets would have  represented an unwarranted interference with the private sector.  For example,  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Japan's leading business  organization, described the breakdown of the trade talks as  "unavoidable" and praised the government for sticking to "its  policy of rejecting the U.S. managed-trade approach" (Kyodo, 11  February).  According to the 13 February Mainichi Shimbun,  similar statements came from the leaders of major  telecommunications firms and from the chairman of the Marine and  Fire Insurance Association of Japan.  In addition, editorials in  every major Japanese daily newspaper praised the Prime Minister's  stance on objective criteria.  A typical comment came from  Japan's leading economic newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, which  described rejection of objective criteria as "common sense" and  stated that the targets demanded by Washington would have led to  "managed trade."     Despite the business community's support for Hosokawa's rejection  of objective criteria, some business leaders, particularly in  export-oriented industries, appear to be concerned about the  potential impact of the failure of the trade talks on Japanese  business.  The 16 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Ryuzaburo  Kaku, the chairman of Canon, Inc., as warning that unless  measures were taken to reduce the trade surplus, the continued  appreciation of the yen would "deal a fatal blow to Japan's  manufacturing industries."  Similarly, the 13 February Mainichi  Shimbun reported that the automobile industry, while pleased that  the government had rejected the establishment of objective  criteria, was worried that it might come under increasing  pressure to work out "voluntary" plans to purchase more foreign  products as the government searched for ways to break the impasse  with the United States.     Impact of Summit Failure     The comments of various Japanese political, government, and  business leaders suggest that, despite their general support for  Hosokawa's rejection of numerical targets, they have at least  three major concerns as a result of the failure of the summit:  that the United States might attempt to drive the yen  significantly higher on world money markets, weakening Japanese  competitiveness and slowing Japan's recovery from its current  recession; that the United States might impose sanctions on Japan  in retaliation for its refusal to accept the concept of objective  criteria; and that tenser relations with the United States might  weaken the security relationship between the United States and  Japan.     Yen Rise     The sharp rise of the yen in the wake of the breakdown of the  framework talks appears to have aroused particular concern among  political, government, and business leaders and may be pushing  some of them to consider measures to address Japan's large  current account surplus.  Ichiro Ozawa warned during a 15  February press conference that the appreciation of the yen would  cause Japan's economy to "suffer profound damage," according to  the 15 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun.  He added that the two  countries should "hold talks as soon as possible to discuss ways  to settle the framework talks."   At a 15 February news  conference,  Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo [the Japanese  Trade Union Confederation], reportedly described the appreciation  of the yen as a "serious" situation and a "crisis".  According to  the 15 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, he said he would press the  government to draw up an "action program" of measures to  liberalize the Japanese market, expand domestic demand, and  reduce the trade surplus in order to "reconcile Japan and the  United States as soon as possible."  The 16 February Nihon Keizai  Shimbun reported that a number of Japanese business leaders are  also worried about the rise of the yen and believe that Japan  should attempt to defuse tensions with the United States by  taking unilateral measures to reduce its trade surplus.     Possible Sanctions     A second area of concern is that the United States might impose  sanctions on Japan.  While many Japanese political and government  leaders have warned that Japan might lodge a complaint with GATT  should this happen, their comments suggest they wish to avoid a  confrontation in this area.  For example, in comments on NHK  Television on 13 February, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura speculated that the U.S. Congress and the American  public might press the Clinton administration to impose sanctions  on Japan, but added that he hoped Washington would be "prudent  and reasonable" and "stay away from unilateral measures.  When  pressed by his interviewer, he said Japan might consider turning  to GATT if the United States invoked sanctions.  The 13 February  Mainichi Shimbun reported that some parts of the automobile  industry were concerned that the U.S. Government and Congress  might push for sanctions, which in turn would result in more  pressure on the auto industry to import more foreign products.     Political, Security Relationship     A third area of concern has been the potential impact of  increased trade frictions on the political and security  relationship between Japan and the United States.  In an  interview in the 14 February Yomiuri Shimbun, Ichiro Ozawa stated  that he was most concerned not about the future of the framework  talks, but about the possibility that the "relationship of trust  between Japan and the United States" might disintegrate.  He  added that Japan was still not in a position to adequately handle  a range of responsibilities in the international security arena.  This point of view has also received some play in media  commentary on the summit.  For example, in an article in the 14  February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a member of the paper's editorial  staff warned that if the "relationship of trust between the two  countries in security matters is undermined, this would certainly  bring chaos to the Japanese financial and capital markets and  unsettle the Japanese economy."     Government Course of Action     For the time being, the Japanese Government appears to be hoping  to limit the possibility and scope of U.S. retaliation and the  damage to bilateral relations by taking a variety of steps to  increase imports and relax regulations governing the Japanese  market in selected areas.  Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated on  several occasions since the end of the summit that he plans to  encourage such efforts.  He told a news conference at the Madison  Hotel in Washington on 12 February, for example, that Japan  "should work voluntarily to achieve what it can" to make  procedures on its insurance and government procurement markets  clearer and promote "industrial cooperation" between Japanese and  U.S. auto companies (NHK Television, 12 February).  He also told  reporters upon his return to Tokyo that he planned to quickly  begin to examine measures Japan could take to reduce its trade  surplus, according to a 13 February NHK Television report.     Faced with the sharp rise of the yen and the threat of U.S.  sanctions, Hosokawa has followed through on these promises  quickly.  On 15 February, he reportedly ordered his cabinet to  draw up "emergency plans" to cut Japan's trade surplus with the  United States (Kyodo, 15 February). On 17 February, he reportedly  met with senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), Ministry of Finance, and Foreign Ministry officials  involved in the framework negotiations to discuss measures to  improve foreign access to the Japanese market (Kyodo, 17  February).  He also reportedly announced that he had appointed  the MITI Minister, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Posts and  Telecommunications Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary to a  special task force to draw up market opening measures beginning  the week of 21 February.     The exact nature of the measures the government will take appears  to still be vague.  According to the 15 February Nihon Keizai  Shimbun, among proposals under consideration are steps to further  relax government procurement procedures and the introduction of  an insurance brokerage system and a public hearing system which  would allow foreign insurance companies to voice their  grievances.  According to a 17 February Kyodo report, other  possibilities include measures to tighten antitrust policies and  relax government procurement procedures.     There appears to be fairly broad support among Japanese political  leaders for such steps.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, head of one of the parties in the coalition government,  stated on two different television programs on 13 February that  Japan must take steps on its own to reduce its trade surplus.  At  one of these, an NHK Television roundtable discussion of the  summit, he stated that although Japan could not accept numerical  targets, "it is still responsible for redressing its huge trade  surplus by liberalizing and expanding its own markets."  He added  that Japan should take such steps because of the importance of  its bilateral relations with the United States. MITI Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai made similar statements during a FNN Television  round table on 12 February and Ichiro Ozawa, in an interview in  the 14 February Yomiuri Shimbun, stated Japan should take steps  to deregulate its economy as part of its effort to reduce trade  friction with the United States.     The Japanese media also have given broad support to this  approach.  Post-summit editorials in all of the major newspapers-  -Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, and  Mainichi Shimbun--called on the government to take steps to  reduce the trade surplus, open Japanese markets, and deregulate  the economy.   Outlook     Over the coming weeks, the Japanese Government will probably take  a number of steps to try to convince Washington that Japan is  attempting to reduce its trade surplus and open its markets.  In  view of the solid consensus within Japan against targets, these  measures will probably not include the objective criteria  Washington is seeking, however.  Moreover, any substantial  measures will probably meet with strong resistance from the  Japanese bureaucracy.  With Hosokawa's coalition increasingly  fraught by internal divisions over a variety of policy issues, it  is unclear whether the government will be able to focus  sufficiently on these measures or muster the strength to force  the bureaucracy to draw up more than cosmetic measures to address  the trade surplus.   If the yen continues to rise, however, the  Japanese business community may prove increasingly willing to  take steps on its own to increase imports.  Many export-oriented  industries may come to see such steps as preferable to a  continued appreciation of the yen, which would hurt the  competitiveness of their exports.     (AUTHOR:  BOUNDS.

"If a contact between youth and student organizations in the  North and the South were made, it would be possible to discuss  wide-range issues of common concern including the convocation of  a national conference and a August 15 Grand Reunification  Festival of students proposed by the South Korean federation of  general student councils at its second-term inaugural ceremony  some time ago," he added.</p>

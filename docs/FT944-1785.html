			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Russia signs energy charter Russia has overcome long-standing reservations and joined 45 other nations in signing a European Energy Charter designed as the single most important instrument for stimulating the integration of former eastern bloc economies into the world market. However, the US declined to sign the treaty in Lisbon on Saturday, mainly because it considers the charter fails to guarantee adequate protection for investors and falls below standards already obtained by the US in bilateral and other multilateral investment agreements. The treaty provides free and equal access to energy markets among the signatories.</p>

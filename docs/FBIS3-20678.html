			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sl.P.: "Peaceful Change of Borders?"] </F>   [Text] Dr. Nikola Koljevic, member of the presidency of the  republic of Srpska, stated yesterday in an interview with the  Zagreb weekly GLOBUS that "I think the resolution of the events  in the republic of Serbian Krajina is to follow soon as  intensive efforts are being made to correct overall Serbian-  Croatian relations. And there are several ways to achieve the  resolution. If Serbian and Croatian peoples were to act with  maturity, they could achieve a historical agreement."    According to Dr. Koljevic, based on this "historical  agreement" it would be possible to begin peaceful changes of  borders.    "Alternately, it might also be possible to reach the  agreement to give some kind of a very high political autonomy to  the Serbs in Krajina, guaranteed by the Republic of Croatia. In  any event, it would take a long time for people to accept this.  I believe that economic activities will revive with time to  contribute to a more rational resolution of problems."</p>

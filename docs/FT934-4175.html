			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Another piece to fit the Jigsaw - A womenswear chain turns its attention to men Something strange happened in early November: a new menswear shop was opened and there was not a polo mallet in sight. Jigsaw, a chic womenswear chain which has long been a favourite of many a fashion-orientated working woman, has moved into menswear. With 28 women's shops already flourishing, the team behind Jigsaw decided the time had come to provide for the aspiring male the chic and well-priced clothing purveyed to his sisters. To those who have wearied of the cliche of the polo mallet - it seems to be taken for granted that this aspiring sport imparts a virile, lady-killer image on cotton-knits and moleskins - Jigsaw's marketing imagery makes a refreshing change. Jigsaw's hero is more likely to be found in an East End boxing gym. He might have borrowed the squire's sporting fabrics - moleskins, Harris tweeds, waxed cottons - but the styling recalls Michael Caine's Alfie rather than one of the Hipwood brothers astride a polo pony. The relatively inexpensive clothes are aimed at young, urban professionals. It arose from the constant requests by female customers for a range to suit their husbands and male friends. Now that Paul Smith has turned his designing talents to womenswear and Agnes B has turned hers to men, the distinction between menswear and womenswear designers has broken down. On offer are ink, peat or sage Harris tweed, three-button jackets at Pounds 135, navy, indigo or parchment chunky cable knitwear (Pounds 40-70), moleskin jeans (Pounds 45), plain cotton shirts (all under Pounds 50) and waxed leather pea jackets (Pounds 422). The mood is city roughwear and it is not over-designed. John Pawson, a 45-year-old architect known for his unremittingly restrained taste, was chosen to test-run the collection. He loathes 'dressing like an architect,' although he has turned the white shirt into a professional shibboleth. His first reaction was, frankly, disappointment: 'Tailoring that looks good on a drawing board or a dummy rather than worn,' he said. Take the Harris tweed jackets, he said. Is there a point in buying one - even if inexpensive - if it is clumsily executed? Is not Savile Row, Daks or Oxfam a better buy, depending on your budget? Wearing the moleskin jeans, he mischievously asked: 'Isn't this what you see those foreigners in - you know, those polo players?' He thought the knitwear well-designed and good value. Stroking his chest in a cable-knit Aran, he added: 'I could very happily walk home in this,' and, inspecting a plain white shirt, he acknowledged that 'for the price, this is pretty good.' No mean tribute from Mr White Shirt himself. While the tailoring is disappointing - a much greater sharpness is required  -the knitwear is first-rate. Basics, such as t-shirts and trousers, are so-so and the leathers and suedes are excellent, especially the waxed leather pea jacket and the reefer. Jigsaw has managed to keep its prices down because it does almost everything itself, from owning factories and making the clothes to running the shops and selling. The crucial balance between value and quality is maintained by cutting out the middleman, overseeing production and ensuring prompt delivery. Four newly-acquired factories (for tailoring, leather, knitwear and denim) are stocked with the latest technology, such as autojigs and jet pocket machines. Jigsaw can test prototypes on its own machines and the design team can experiment with the latest fashions in its own prints and fabrics. A substantial part of its business is based on reacting within a week or so to the latest trends from Paris, Milan or New York. Its factories are independently accountable and must run at a profit and not be subsidised by the retail side. For that reason, extra capacity (approximately 20 per cent) is leased out. Jigsaw is owned by John Robinson, its managing-director. Chris Bailey, the production director, has a half-share in the factories. The company has an annual turnover of Pounds 23m and is entirely self-financed - not least because British banks are usually reluctant to finance fashion projects. Like its competitor, Paul Smith, it is proud of its financial self-sufficiency. The price/quality ratio in the Jigsaw women's range is a key ingredient in its success. It has built up an impressive bank of loyal customers, for which much praise must be given to the helpful shop assistants who wrap even a modest T-shirt in tissue paper, according it the respect of a designer suit. Jigsaw was, rightly, short-listed for a British Fashion Award this year and although it failed to win one, it is some indication of the esteem in which it is held by the British fashion world. The problem with the new venture is that menswear, particularly outerwear, such as jackets and suits, requires much higher standards of construction, cut and finish. Men are less inclined to buy on a fashion whim. They tend to demand longevity and, if buying a classic clothing item, such as a Harris tweed jacket, expect it to look more than competently executed. Chris Bailey assures me that he is well aware of this deficiency and that the standard will be vastly superior once the men's tailoring factory opens in the new year. At the other end of the scale, the reputation for service, quality, choice and dependability earned by The Gap and Marks &amp; Spencer for modern basics, manufactured by the million and styled as neutrally as possible, will make it hard for Jigsaw to win part of that market for cotton polo-neck skirts, T-shirts, chinos and jeans. Their understandably limited range cannot offer a wide choice in colour, size and leg lengths, for example. In this environment, can Jigsaw prove that polo-free men's leisurewear can sell? Jigsaw, 9-11 Floral Street, London WC2. Early next year a men and women's store is due to open in Leadenhall Market in the City of London.</p>

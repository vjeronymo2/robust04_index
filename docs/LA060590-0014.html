			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> STILL TREATING THE DEBATE ON CANCER;  </P> <P> THE CANCER INDUSTRY: UNRAVELLING THE POLITICS BY RALPH W. MOSS PARAGON HOUSE  $21.95, 461 PAGES  </P> <P> In the end, nearly all disputes are theological. The reasons we give for what  we believe are rationalizations we make up after we've decided. Reason and  logic make our beliefs look respectable.  </P> <P> Ralph W. Moss is a science writer who has spent 15 years studying cancer  research and treatment. He believes that the conventional treatments --  surgery, radiation and chemotherapy -- largely do not work and that  unconventional treatments -- Laetrile, diet and vitamins, for example -- are  promising approaches that have been dismissed by the medical establishment.  </P> <P> The fact that this debate never ends is yet further proof of people's  willingness to believe nonsense (not that there is any shortage of such  evidence). Laetrile has been tested. And tested. And tested. And tested. The  National Cancer Institute did a major nationwide study in the early 1980s and  concluded that Laetrile is "ineffective as a treatment for cancer."  </P> <P> Yet the true believers, Moss among them, will not give up. The National Cancer  Institute did not use real Laetrile, they say. The study was just a way to  discredit Laetrile.  </P> <P> "More laetrile is being used in the late '80s than it was a decade before,"  Moss writes. He seems to think that this demonstrates that Laetrile works  rather than recognizing what it does demonstrate: that desperate people will  try anything.  </P> <P> To be sure, the war on cancer (like the war on drugs and the war on poverty)  has gotten essentially nowhere. The incidence of cancer continues to increase,  and mortality rates remain high. More than a million Americans are diagnosed  with cancer yearly, and more than 500,000 die of the disease every year. So  far, cancer treatment is not one of orthodox medicine's success stories.  </P> <P> But I do not understand why otherwise sensible people conclude that the answer  lies with unorthodox medicine -- particularly when the data show otherwise.  </P> <P> Moss argues that the medical establishment suppresses data that does not agree  with its view and harasses or jails health-care providers who try to do things  differently. "Scientific theories are suppressed, medical records seized,  clinics shut down, and innovative clinicians thrown in prison," he writes.  </P> <P> But he never adequately explains why this great conspiracy exists or how it is  maintained. His book is chockablock with alleged skulduggery by the medical  establishment. Does he really believe that doctors don't want to cure cancer?  That they want to see their patients suffer and die? That they blindly turn  their backs on promising treatments in order to preserve their erroneous view  of disease?  </P> <P> Why is it that only a tiny number of doctors (I'm sure I'll hear from them and  their adherents) continue to believe in the claptrap that Moss is spewing? The  great weight of evidence and informed scientific opinion rejects this book out  of hand.  </P> <P> The Laetrilists, dietitians, vitamin advocates and believers in the power of  positive thinking will respond by pointing to Galileo, a single individual who  stood up to and defeated the weight of scientific opinion. The majority of  scientists can be -- and are -- wrong, they will say.  </P> <P> Until effective cures for cancer are found, this dispute cannot be resolved.  The orthodox view will continue to dismiss alternate treatments as quackery.  The unorthodox view will continue to dismiss the medical establishment as  narrow-minded dogmatists. As in most disputes, neither side can persuade the  other.  </P> <P> Moss' personal history exemplifies the problem. He used to be assistant  director of public relations for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in  New York, a very orthodox institution. But he was fired because of his views  about Laetrile.  </P> <P> He says he was dismissed because he refused to participate in falsifying  evidence. Sloan-Kettering undoubtedly says that his judgment is faulty and that  he ceased to be an effective spokesman for cancer research. Take your pick.  </P> <P> In this century, medicine has scored tremendous successes in treating and  curing communicable diseases -- the first time in history that doctors have  actually been able to intervene and help their patients, not just hold their  hands.  </P> <P> Cancer has proved much more intractable. There is no cancer equivalent to  antibiotics. But the approach of orthodox medicine is sound, and it should not  be abandoned in the desperate search to find a cure for cancer.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "The Escape Factory: The Story of MIS-X" by Lloyd  R. Shoemaker (St. Martin's Press).  </P></p>

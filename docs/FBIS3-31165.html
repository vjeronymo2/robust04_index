He assessed the Armed Forces' activity in 1993 as  satisfactory, saying that a package of bills required for the  Armed Forces' reform had been advanced to the parliament last  year, and it would be extended with a bill of the status of  draftees and of military hired on contract. The integrated  strategy of national security and the national military doctrine  were articulated, documents which were being currently adjusted  in order to have them harmonized with the mechanisms of the  Partnership for Peace, General Spiroiu said. The new leading  structures of the Army were endorsed by the Higher Defence  Council and became effective on November 1, 1993. The staffs  and general staff were established, the military education is  being restructured and so are the defence industry and logistic  sector, to keep up with the current requirements, the defence  minister said.    Referring to the Partnership for Peace, the defence minister  said the signing of the master document, although expressing  Romania's will, did not generate any advantage in point of the  Partnership for Peace. But it was a clear proof that "we have  chosen the rapprochement with the North-Atlantic Alliance, and,  after more stages are covered, the program is expected to be  rounded off with another program of joint activities, followed  by concrete links with the Joint Command of Europe and the NATO  Headquarters in Brussels.    As regarded the Romanian Armed Forces' relations with  Russia,  the defence minister said that serious reasons caused the  postponement of the visit by the defence minister of the Russian  Federation, which was not "an evidence" of cooling military  relations with Russia.    General Spiroiu also announced he would visit Spain in early  March, when he would also sign a bilateral military agreement as  part of the Romanian strategy of expansion of the relations with  the Armed Forces of the North-Atlantic Alliance.</p>

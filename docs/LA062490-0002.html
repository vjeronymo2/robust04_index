			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'd like to thank cable's Family Channel for the syndicated repeats of  "Scarecrow and Mrs. King." I was a devoted fan when it aired on CBS (1983-87)  and I can tell you that even after an absence of three years, I'm more devoted  to the series than ever. I'm hoping the Family Channel does not drop this show  any time soon.  </P> <P> Jean Kim, Torrance  </P></p>

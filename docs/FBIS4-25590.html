			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Liu: "Healthier Futures Trade Seen"] </F>   [Text] China's recent move to rectify the futures market  will create a favourable atmosphere for developing big,  standardized exchanges, said a senior futures expert.    Chen Gongyan, vice-president of the Beijing Commodities  Exchange, one of the country's major futures exchanges, said the  adjustment will eliminate some regional and small futures  exchanges that don't meet the government's standards.    Member companies of these exchanges will then seek to secure  positions on big exchanges, he said.    Meanwhile, Chen said, since futures brokerages are  prohibited  from doing business on exchanges outside the mainland, more  investment will flow into domestic trading centres.    In addition, the rectification is also spurring big  exchanges  to intensify efforts to standardize their management and  operations, he said.    "The aim of the rectification is not to nip the young  industry in the bud, but to ensure a healthy and stable  development and a clear market for the industry," Chen said.    With futures companies and exchanges sprouting up across the  country, China began rectifying futures companies last year and  exchanges this year.    Before being allowed to resume business, companies and  exchanges must pass government examinations on topics such as  assets and transaction volume.    Chen said the Beijing Commodities Exchange is benefiting  from  heavy business resulting from the rectification.    Since the end of May, its daily transaction value has  averaged 1.3 billion yuan ($149 million), compared with about  300 million ($34.5 million) in March and 200 million ($23  million) in April, Chen said.    "We are taking all possible measures to support the  correction," he said.    However, since many exchanges are at a loss without detailed  guidelines, Chen hopes the government will publicly clarify its  policies.    "We should rely more on laws and regulations, instead of  administrative policies, to supervise the market," he said.    Sources said China is speeding up the drafting of its first  futures trading law, which would provide a legal framework for  governing the new industry.</p>

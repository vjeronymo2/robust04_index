			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Prune fuchsias, pelargoniums and geraniums now for fuller plants with more  flowers.  </P> <P> Protect newly planted annuals from the onslaught of snails and slugs. Be  generous and make regular applications of bait throughout the flower bed.  </P> <P> If the weather in your area permits, get your vegetables in as soon as possible  and extend your harvest by planting at two- to three-week intervals.  </P> <P> Consider planting tuberous begonias soon. Their large, colorful flowers will  dazzle you this summer.  </P> <P> Keep a lookout for aphids on your roses and keep them in check.  </P> <P> Prune wisteria heavily after it finishes blooming this spring.  </P> <P> If you have a notion to move any azaleas or camellias, now is the time. Dig  them up and replant in a new spot in richly prepared soil and keep thoroughly  watered.  </P></p>

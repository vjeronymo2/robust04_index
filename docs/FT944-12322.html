			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / One-day strike at TGWU adds to its worries Staff of the TGWU general union are holding a one-day strike tomorrow in pursuit of an 8 per cent pay claim, adding further burdens to an increasingly divided and anxious leadership. The union's executive has offered a wage deal worth between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Further disruption with the closure of union offices is planned unless the union agrees to increase its offer to its 900 employees. 'We regret the fact that for the first time ever the T&amp;G's staff will be taking strike action,' said Mr Danny Bryan, the staff's negotiator. 'It reflects the anger among staff that the union has not properly recognised the contribution made by them during the last few difficult years.' The union has gone through sweeping rationalisation with the closure of regional offices, a 15 per cent drop in staff levels, and the introduction of computerised technology. 'There is a lack of security in the union. Staff are frustrated and concerned,' added Mr Bryan. 'We recognise the union has limited resources but it can do better with its offer.' In reply Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, pointed out yesterday that the pay offer was not only higher than the inflation rate but better than the range of recent settlements negotiated by the union for its members. 'Pay and conditions in the union are comparable and in many cases better than those found in similar organisations,' he said. There are no plans for a resumption of pay talks. The discontent is symptomatic of deeper troubles worrying Mr Morris and his executive. Potentially the most serious problem stems from allegations of fraud and corruption being investigated by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's legal officer, in the Merseyside divisional office. Mr Morris has been taking a tough stand on the matter, warning union officials the TGWU is involved in a 'struggle for democracy and decency' which is 'as serious as any external challenge' the union has faced over the past 15 years. Officials have been dismissed amid allegations that about Pounds 500,000 of members' money has been diverted for political purposes on Merseyside over recent years. Some of the disaffected hard left are even suggesting irregularities took place during Mr Morris's own election as general secretary two years ago on the left ticket, something Mr Morris denies. The controversy comes as the union struggles to cope with falling membership. Since 1979 membership has more than halved, a much greater decline than in most other big unions. The TGWU has found it hard to grow through strategic partnerships with other unions. Negotiations on a possible merger with its main rival, the GMB general union, have been postponed, while doubts remain over the wisdom of taking on the burdens of the ailing construction union Ucatt. The TGWU's finances may be less troubling than in the mid-1980s but its check-off campaign has brought a loss of income as the union has not been able to sign up all its members to have their subscriptions paid by their employer. Next month the union's headquarters are due to move out of Transport House opposite Conservative Central Office. The prime London site is to be refurbished while the union business is conducted from offices in Victoria. That departure is supposed to be temporary but it could turn out to be a symbol of the eroding fortunes of the once mighty union.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> More changing times: Television cameras recorded the proceedings in Britain's  House of Commons for the first time Tuesday as legislators returned to work  from their summer break. But the taping by the eight remote-controlled cameras  was a dress rehearsal that will be seen only by legislators and TV program  planners. Regular TV viewers won't get to see the lawmakers in action until the  Nov. 21 opening of a new session of Parliament. The House of Lords, the  unelected chamber of Parliament, has permitted the televising of its  proceedings since January, 1985, and viewers have occasionally glimpsed a lord  or two soundly asleep in his chair. The often rowdy Commons had until now  always refused to admit TV cameras. If there is a noisy disruption in the  Commons either among legislators on the floor of the House or among  demonstrators in the public gallery, the camera operators have strict orders to  ignore it and focus only on Speaker Bernard Weatherill.

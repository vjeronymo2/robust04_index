			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CUSTOMERS ASKED FOR CLUES IN ARSON FIRE  </P> <P> The Fire Department, seeking more leads in a $2-million arson, is trying to  find customers who were in the Thrifty Drug Store at Katella Avenue and Euclid  Street shortly before it burned to the ground.  </P> <P> A fire erupted in the store about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, and raged for more than  three hours before being brought under control about 1 a.m. Wednesday. The  store was destroyed and four adjoining small stores were damaged by smoke and  water. Total property loss was estimated at from $1.5 million to $2 million.  </P> <P> Fire officials announced Wednesday that the blaze had been deliberately set in  a paper-goods area of the store.  </P> <P> Fire Capt. Bill Dumas, an arson investigator for the department, said Friday  that some employees and customers who were in the store already have provided a  few clues to a possible suspect in the arson. But Dumas said more information  is needed.  </P> <P> "We're asking the news media if they can help us locate a few more customers  who were in the store," Dumas said. "We hope to locate people who were in the  store between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night. We're asking them to call  the Fire Department."  </P> <P> Persons who were in the store during that time are asked to call either Dumas  at (714) 741-5626 or the battalion chief at (714) 741-5680.  </P> <P> Dumas said the department hopes to obtain enough information to release a  composite description of the suspect next week.

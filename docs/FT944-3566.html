			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / More dialogue planned for spending round The Treasury hopes to improve the system of negotiating the annual public spending round by stepping up its early contacts with the spending ministries, Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said yesterday. He told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that negotiations, particularly in the preliminary stages of the round, were rather like a 'choreographed Victorian minuet', with some meetings 'a bit like those between North Korea and South Korea'. He said it would be more helpful if there was greater dialogue between ministers and officials from the Treasury, and spending ministers and their officials, before the round started in earnest in September. He hoped to introduce 'away days or listening days' for ministers and officials from both sides. Mr Aitken had to answer charges levelled by Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory MPs, that the government's achievements in controlling public spending were more apparent than real. He rejected suggestions that the government had failed in its objectives because the control total of departmental spending was expected to increase in real terms in the 1994-95 financial year compared with plans in last year's Budget for a fall. Mr Aitken stressed that the increase reflected lower than expected inflation in the current financial year, which resulted in spending plans fixed in cash terms showing real increases. To change these plans during the year to take account of low inflation would 'cause chaos' for managers in areas such as the health service. Mr Aitken was also downbeat on the prospects for cutting a swathe through the burgeoning social security budget. Reforms such as changes to unemployment benefit, statutory sick pay, invalidity benefit and housing benefit would have a positive effect in the long term, he said. But cutting social security was not like cutting defence. About 90 per cent of non-cyclical social security spending was entitlement-driven while 44 per cent comprised pensions and income support for the elderly, which was covered by manifesto commitments.</p>

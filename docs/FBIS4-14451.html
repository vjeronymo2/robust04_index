			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- If the government does not  take action soon to finance the TV and radio broadcasting  network, the volume of broadcasting will be reduced by four  times, says a message of the Central Committee of the Trade  Union of Communication Workers, sent to President Yeltsin and  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.    The message said that communication workers, who are  ensuring  the functioning of the system, received only 7.5 billion roubles  in payment of this year's debt, which amounts to 209 billion.  This makes less than four per cent. The Russian Ministry of  Finance plans to provide financing in the current year only for  25 per cent of TV and radio programmes. The Chita radio  broadcasting station has already been stopped because of the  absence of money. Radio broadcasting stations in  Blagoveshchensk and some other Russian cities may also be closed  down soon.    According to the message, "the president should have a final  say in settling this important problem." Communication workers,  who are practically working gratis, stated that they would not  be held responsible for the reduction of the volume of TV and  radio broadcasting.</p>

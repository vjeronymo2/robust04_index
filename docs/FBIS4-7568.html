			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- President Lech Walesa on  Thursday refused to sign into law the act on wage controls  passed by parliament on March 18 and expected to come into force  on April 1.    In a letter to Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy the president said  he wished the Sejm reconsider the law which, he wrote, posed a  threat to the continuation of market reforms in Poland and could  pave the way for a return to centralistic and bureaucratic  management of the economy.    The law envisaged financial penalties for enterprises which  increased wages of their employees above the limit set by the  government. The penalties would amount to a tax equal to 150  percent of the excess in wages.    The law would have applied to state and communal firms, but  it also gave the government some control over pay in the private  sector in a situation of "particular threat to the financial  balance of the state."    The law was a controversial issue even before its adoption,  winning only the support of the government coalition parties  (the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance).  They argued that a complete departure from all wage controls  was not feasible in the present Polish situation and that the  law was much less rigorous than the act it was to replace, the  much-hated excess wage tax. Also, they pointed out that wage  controls were not a Communist invention but a tough but  necessary policy tool.    The law was strongly opposed by other parliamentary factions  and the Solidarity trade union, as well as by the right wing  parties not represented in parliament. The latter were  particularly critical of the powers vested in the government to  control wages in the private sector in emergency situations.    Reacting to the news of the presidential veto Thursday,  leaders of those parties supported Walesa's decision. Piotr  Marciniak of the left-wing Union of Labour (UP) also backed the  veto, but pointed out that it was an element in Walesa's  struggle against the ruling coalition.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak issued a statement saying he  wanted the Poles to enjoy Easter holidays in peace and therefore  would not comment on the presidential veto.    The Sejm will discuss the veto at a session scheduled for  April 7. In order to overrule the veto, supporters of the law  have to muster a two thirds majority.</p>

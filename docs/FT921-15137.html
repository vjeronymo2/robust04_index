			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Bell tolls for change: Lloyd's reforms will not meet everyone's hopes Expectations are running high that a task force set up by Lloyd's of London will recommend far-reaching changes to the insurance market in the wake of its first losses for more than 20 years. 'I hope to God that it isn't a damp squib,' says one insider at the Corporation of Lloyd's, which provides the market's regulatory and back-up services. 'Enormous attention is being focused on this.' On Wednesday, the task force is scheduled to publish the most comprehensive proposals for reform of the market's antiquated business structure in recent years. And while it may fall short of recommending a complete overhaul of Lloyd's, it should nevertheless call for radical reforms. One task force member said this week that emphasis in the report is on market-driven change, adding: 'You could see a completely different Lloyd's in the next 10 years.' The report has been prepared by a 14-man group - chaired by Mr David Rowland, the chief executive of Sedgwick, the insurance broker - composed of senior underwriters, brokers and executives at Lloyd's and advised by the management consultancy company, McKinsey. The task force was set up last January by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, as part of efforts to find ways to reduce costs, secure the market's future capital base and reverse the long-term decline of its share of specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance. But Lloyd's immediate commercial difficulties and the acute problems of many of its Names - the individuals whose personal wealth provides the market's capital base - have given extra urgency to the task force's work and increased the political significance of what began as a relatively low-key exercise. Last June the market reported overall losses of Pounds 510m. Reflecting the results of 1988, these losses resulted from a combination of catastrophes such as the explosion aboard Piper Alpha, the North Sea oil rig and rising US asbestosis and pollution claims. The damage was concentrated among a sizeable minority of Names, with as many as a quarter losing Pounds 50,000 each according to a survey by Chatset, the independent research firm. Two more years of losses are anticipated - Lloyd's expects its results for 1989 and 1990, which it will report over the next 18 months, to be worse than those for 1988. Last year, just over 4,000 Names resigned from Lloyd's, shaving more than Pounds 1bn from the market's capital base. Many of the 22,500 Names who remain in the market are making their membership conditional on the adoption of reforms by Lloyd's and a quick return to profitability. Last November a poll conducted by Mori, the opinion research organisation, showed that as many as three in five Names might leave if Lloyd's is not firmly back in the black in 1992, when these results are reported in three years' time. Many Names are opposed to retaining the principle of unlimited liability, whereby they are bound to meet their insurance losses even at the cost of personal bankruptcy. But the report's recommendations are likely to fall short of some Names' hopes. Those facing big losses from past years can expect only limited help. 'You can't wish away past losses,' said one broker close to the task force this week. 'The cost of bailing out badly hit Names could be prohibitive.' Any attempt to make a limit on liability apply retroactively (that is, to business already written) could also be fraught with practical and legal problems. The task force also has relatively little room for manoeuvre to tackle the heritage of long-tail liabilities (in which claims sometimes arise many years after the original policy was written). The report concentrates on three areas: the capital structure of Lloyd's; the market's costs, declining competitiveness and the low levels of professionalism of many underwriters; and the adequacy of the system of self-regulation introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982. The thrust of any changes will be to make Lloyd's a more attractive investment for the individual Names who, it is acknowledged, will continue to provide the market's capital for the foreseeable future. 'The primacy of Names' interests is absolutely vital,' said the broker. 'If Names aren't confident about supplying capital to the market we are not doing our job properly. The market has been running for itself not for its capital.' Among the recommendations could be: Maintaining the system of unlimited liability alongside the introduction of a cap limiting the scale of 'excessive losses' for Names. Particularly large losses for individual Names would be borne by the market as a whole and financed by a levy on all Names. The cap would have to be set relatively high to keep its cost down and allay fears that this system of 'mutualisation', or shared losses, could damage the market's profitability as a whole. Demanding more favourable tax treatment from the government for the reserves established by Names to pay for future losses. In common with the UK insurance industry in general, Lloyd's does not have the same facility for establishing tax-deductible reserves as its competitors in a number of other European countries - a long-standing complaint. Finding ways of channelling Names' capital to the more profitable areas of the market, helping good agencies and syndicates to prosper and hastening the demise of the least successful and efficient. One step would be make the accounts of Lloyd's syndicates more open by a move away from the present system of accounting - in which syndicates account for the results of a given year after a time lag of three years - towards a one-year accounting system. Another could involve the development of a system whereby Names could buy and sell their participations on individual syndicates. Giving more freedom to syndicates and the agencies that manage them to generate more business themselves. At present their freedom to contract business without the involvement of a Lloyd's broker is sharply circumscribed. More broadly, Lloyd's ability to market itself is limited by the dual responsibility for both regulation and marketing of the Lloyd's Corporation. Changes in both areas would be relatively free from controversy and are likely. Examining ways of strengthening the role of members' agents so that they can 'police' the market, thus playing a role similar to that of institutional investors in the stock market. In this respect the task force has been encouraged by the stronger role played by members' agents in the latter half of 1991. In several cases, agents made the supply of Names to syndicates dependent on the introduction of changes to improve efficiency, such as a reduction of underwriters' salaries and the appointment of new managers. When these did not materialise, Names were directed elsewhere, starving the syndicates of capital and making their closure inevitable. Two further developments appear to be moving in the task force's favour. First, rationalisation has been proceeding apace among agencies and syndicates, producing leaner and fitter businesses. Second, there are now clear signs that insurance rates - partially reflecting shrinkage in capacity - are beginning to rise in most areas of the market, improving prospects that business written in 1992 will be profitable. The political climate also favours change. Lloyd's is under pressure to implement any firm recommendations by the task force - a contrast to the late 1960s when many proposals of the Cromer Report, the fruit of one effort to change Lloyd's business practices, went unheeded. Overall the reforms, backed up by some positive trends in the market, should help stimulate some recovery at Lloyd's. The problem is that this may not assuage the anger of many Names facing losses. One disgruntled Name, who confronts hundreds of thousands of pounds of personal losses, laments: 'Our main worry is that the whole focus is on the future and that they will not deal with the problems of the past. They may let the old Names sink.'</p>

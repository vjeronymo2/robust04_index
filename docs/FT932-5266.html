			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GBE for market via Downiebrae AN ENGLISH company mak-ing tobacco processing equipment since 1849 and with sales to more than 76 countries, is coming to the stock market through a reverse takeover of Downiebrae, the shell company suspended last month at 77p. GBE International, which emerged from a management buy-out from AMF International of the US in 1986, will take over management of Downiebrae, which has two small engineering companies and a pile of cash. Downiebrae is issuing 36.67m new shares to pay for GBE, valuing the company at Pounds 22m. Most of this will repay GBE's venture capitalist backers and management and the GBE employee trust will retain the balance. Some 24.98m of the shares are being placed at 60p and 7.78m are being offered in a 4-for-9 rights issue, also at 60p. Beeson Gregory is broker and has underwritten the placing and the rights issue. Mr Robert Newman, a London-based businessman who owns the women's health club The Sanctuary and bought a 29.9 per cent stake in Downiebrae in February this year, will not be selling his stake. After dilution this stake will fall to less than than 10 per cent, making him the second largest shareholder after Mr Gerald Edwards, chairman of GBE. Mr Newman will relinquish his position as chief executive but will continue to seek acquisition opportunities as a consultant to Downiebrae. He said he did not have day to day management skills and that GBE's management could not be improved. He would be in a better position to seek further acquisitions as a consultant. In the year to December 1992, GBE made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.25m on sales of Pounds 34.7m. The company derives most of its sales from process engineering. Mr Newman owned a 29.9 per cent stake in Downibrae until 1988 when he sold to Mr Jacques Gaston Murray. He bought it back in February, saying it was an ideal vehicle for doing acquisitions. The enlarged group will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 31m.</p>

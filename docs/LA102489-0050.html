			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> TEACHERS VOTING ON DISTRICT'S LATEST OFFER  </P> <P> Teachers will finish voting on the school district's latest offer on Wednesday,  capping four months of intense contract negotiations.  </P> <P> The results of the three-day advisory vote held at each of the city's 30  schools will be released when both parties meet on Thursday. If teachers vote  against the proposed contract, the school district will ask for a state  mediator.  </P> <P> Negotiators for the Irvine Teachers Assn. recommended last week that the  district's 1,000 teachers reject the offer.  </P> <P> "I think that they will support ITA wholeheartedly," union president Barbara  Dresel said. "There will be a firm 'no' vote on the latest proposal by the  school district. We are not that far off, but we are willing to take this as  far as needed."  </P> <P> If not approved this week, the following issues will be turned over to the  state negotiator:  </P> <P> * The proposal states that the three-year contract will include no reopener,  but teachers want the option to renegotiate.  </P> <P> * The district is offering a 6% raise for the next three years, with a 1% bonus  this year. Teachers are asking for a 6% raise and 1% bonus this year, a 7%  raise and 1% bonus next year, and a 6% raise the following year.  </P> <P> * The teachers want certain medical benefits extended to teachers hired before  1986, who do not now receive them. Teachers would help fund those benefits  themselves.  </P> <P> * The teachers want to phase out use of teachers for playground supervision at  grammar schools. Santa Ana Unified School District did so several years ago,  hiring playground supervisors.  </P> <P> * Union negotiators oppose a proposed schedule which would let all schools out  at 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. one day each week, and make up the time the other four  days. The union wants individual schools to make that choice. JOE BEL BRUNO  </P></p>

It has now been revealed how Democrat MP Somkhit Nuanphian  knew so much about a proclaimed U.S. blacklist of Thai  politicians suspected of involvement in the drug trade.    "He told me he got that information when he worked for the  KGB," said Democrat Thanin Chaisamut, referring to the Central  Intelligence Agency's rival in the former Soviet empire.    Thanin appeared serious.    Asked if Somkhit remained a Soviet spy, Thanin replied, "Not  any more. The Soviet Union has crumbled."    Somkhit triggered the Opposition's outburst when he followed  up on Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's statement that many  Thai politicians were blacklisted due to suspicion that they  were involved in narcotics smuggling. During a tumultuous House  debate, opposition MPs demanded Somkhit, who was not in the  chamber, to reveal names and disclose the source of his  information.    Thanin said he tried to avoid Somkhit.    "I don't walk with him any longer. There's nothing except  that I'm afraid I'll be caught in the cross-fire if somebody  tries to silence him," Thanin said.</p>

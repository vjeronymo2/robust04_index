			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic  Party (ODS) Executive Council, in a resolution adopted at its  meeting today, confirmed its will to redress property wrongs  inflicted on Jews who did not receive their property because of  political changes in February 1948 and whose property currently  belongs to the state, ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky told  journalists.    The Executive Council supports the adoption of a law to  right  the injustices inflicted on Jewish people, Strasky said.    He said that the Executive Council discussed a proposal by  the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL) concerning the restitution of church property,  currently in the state's possession.    The Council had asked ODS ministers and deputies to take a  positive stand on such a bill provided an agreement on a  limitation or restriction of restitutions of land and forests  was achieved and that is was agreed that this bill would be the  final one redressing property wrongs inflicted on the Church,  Strasky said.</p>

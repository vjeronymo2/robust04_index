			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: House of Fraser at Pounds 34.5m - Flotation could put minimum Pounds 450m price tag on stores group House of Fraser, the 56-store department store chain which is preparing for flotation, lifted pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 34.5m in the year to January 29, the pathfinder prospectus revealed yesterday. The result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 3.7m on property disposals and interest charges of Pounds 6.8m. Total sales increased from Pounds 694m to Pounds 722m, and like-for-like sales were up 8.6 per cent. Earnings per share were 10.1p (4.2p). Before exceptionals they were 11.1p, leading analysts to expect that the company could be valued at a minimum Pounds 450m. The offer price will be announced on March 17. Mr Brian McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings who was tempted from retirement last year to become House of Fraser's chairman, said the improvement had convinced him of the chain's potential. 'Most of my critical preconceptions proved to be wrong and ill-judged,' he said. He said the group, which trades under 17 different names including Dickins &amp; Jones, Army &amp; Navy, Rackhams, and Binns, planned a Pounds 50m refurbishment programme. It was revamping its product range, grouping its stores into three categories depending on size. It also planned to match the merchandise in each store more closely with local customer profiles. The Egyptian Fayed brothers, who bought the group for almost Pounds 600m in 1985, are selling the entire chain with the exception of its former flagship, Harrods. Of the 229.6m shares, a quarter are being offered to the public, subject to clawback by institutions. Analysts believe House of Fraser is looking at an offer price of between 180p and 220p per share, valuing the company at between Pounds 410m and Pounds 500m, depending on market movements, and the effectiveness of the group's marketing campaign. On the stores sector historic multiple of about 19, the price would be 211p, valuing the company at Pounds 484m, but many analysts expect the price to be slightly lower, at about 200p. Mr McGowan said net debt at the end of January was Pounds 93m, putting gearing at 37.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (3): Born with a silver spoon in its mouth - Profile of Quantum Electronics Manufacturing QUANTUM Electronics Manufacturing was born with an industrial silver spoon in its mouth. Formed in January last year after a management buyout from Mitel Telecom, it inherited a purpose-built electronics plant in South Wales, the latest manufacturing equipment and a skilled and dedicated workforce used to high quality customer-driven manufacturing techniques. The buyout, backed with Pounds 1.2m investment from 3i, the Welsh Development Agency, Mitel and the Bank of Wales, was organised by a group of managers who had successfully reorganised Mitel Telecom's operations in Portskewett, South Wales, following its acquisition by BT. The Mitel reorganisation released space for the plant, considerable equipment and other resources. Initially in March 1990 the managers, led by Dr Terry Summers, the plant's materials director, won the backing of Mitel to establish a sub-contract manufacturing operation using the plant's surplus resources. The new manufacturing operation concentrated on low volume high technology contracts emphasising responsiveness to its customers. But the business required more capital investment and management time than Mitel could spare, so the management buy-out was organised and approved at the start of last year. Since then Quantum's workforce has grown from 39 to more than 60, turnover is running at an annual rate of Pounds 4m and, despite the recession, the young company is already trading profitably. 'We are growing by the day,' says Dr Summers, who is now Quantum's managing director. Recently 3i, Mitel and British Coal Enterprise backed a Pounds 200,000 capital increase to support further growth. Its customers include National Transcommunications, Inmos, the chip manufacturer, Research Machines, Encrypta, Thermocouple Instruments and Rediffusion Simulation. Altogether the company has between 15 and 20 customers who mostly require low to medium volume contract manufacturing using leading edge technology, sophisticated test equipment and advanced computer based manufacturing systems organised on a cellular basis. Like many other smaller players in the contract manufacturing business Quantum is a niche player, mostly serving customers in the business, industrial and professional sectors. None of its customers manufactures the assemblies which Quantum makes. 'We are their manufacturing department,' says Summers. Although Quantum does not design for its customers it does like its project engineers to be involved at the design stage to help ensure that the design is compatible with high quality and low cost automated manufacturing. It also prefers to buy the components because Dr Summers says this gives Quantum more control over quality and its customers are usually happy because 'more and more they are getting out of manufacturing'. Production is organised on a cellular rather than production line basis and capabilities include conventional hand assembly, automated assembly using plated-through-hole (PTH) components, surface mount technology (SMT), mixed technology and electro-mechanical assemblies. Most contracts are in the 1,000-3,000 board range with values of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m although Quantum does some high tech, low volume work with contracts valued at as little as Pounds 100,000. Where Dr Summers believes Quantum scores over some of its larger rivals is in being able to provide customers with a highly flexible personalised service using leading edge technology such as SMT 'normally only associated with bigger companies'. It can also handle extremely complex products. 'Quantum's roots in an international electronics corporation gives us a unique insight into the needs of the industry,' Dr Summers declares in the company's sales literature. 'Our track record in the application of the most advanced manufacturing techniques will give you the competitive edge you need.' He also believes Quantum's niche business is more secure and less risky than that of many of the larger players. He argues, for example, that because volumes are low there is little incentive for customers to consider going offshore with their business. 'They need people in the UK,' he says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Another approach has been observed in the Senate of  the Republic to the question of the formation of an ad hoc  government. The subject was raised on 1 March in camera. The  contested 18 January elected senators and those of the Alliance  for Parliamentary Cohesion are allegedly determined to fill the  vacuum at the executive level, according to Senator Amos Andre.    [Begin recording] [Andre in Creole] We senators of the  Republic, as a power and a state institution -- coguardians of  the national sovereignty -- are working relentlessly to offer  the country a government, a government issued from the country's  Constitution and laws.    [Reporter Jean] The country's Constitution and laws --  Articles 148 and 149, while the president of this office speaks  of Article 111?    [Andre] I do not want to go into Articles 148, 149, and 111.  We are simply working on a solution based on the Constitution.    [Jean] Will this solution take into account President  Aristide's position, which you have restored, as well as the  position of the international community, which Sen. Sansaricq  has recent visited?    [Andre] When we make a decision within the scope of the  Constitution as the Senate of the Republic, it is not because it  would please this person or that person, it is simply that it is  a legal decision. Another aspect of the question -- since we  are in a context of crisis, where political interests are at  stake -- is that some political compromises must be made on both  sides in order to find a solution to the crisis.

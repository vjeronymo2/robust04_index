			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Marusic: "Federation Hanging in the </F> Balance"]    [Text] Mostar (from VJESNIK's staff correspondent) -- At  present, the key question in relations between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and Bosniaks is the election of the  president and prime minister. The question has not been solved  even after the latest round of negotiations in Sarajevo,  although both sides presented legal and political arguments in  favor of their representative, Bosniak or Croat, respectively.  Since the matter will not be resolved even after the 30-day  deadline for the elections stipulated by the Constitution, this  could cut deeply into future negotiations and significantly  influence the (non)implementation of the Washington Agreement,  that is, of what was agreed in Sarajevo. Regardless of that,  Kresimir Zubak and Haris Silajdzic both said the Sarajevo  negotiations had been "extremely constructive and positive."  <H5>  The Question of Outvoting </H5>   The reason behind Zubak's and Silajdzic's optimism is, first  of all, the successful negotiations on the organization of the  future federal government. It was agreed that, in the period  that follows, the reconstructed government shall act both as the  Bosniak and the federal government and that it will be composed  of 12 department ministers and another three members, one of  whom would be the president of the Federation (although they  still have not agreed on which departments would be run by  Croats and which by Bosniaks). Furthermore, the heads of both  delegations said that they were well satisfied with the progress  of the negotiations about economic and humanitarian questions.  However, it would be difficult to speak about progress in  Croat-Bosniak relations until the most important problems that  are crucial for the future federation are solved.    As for the "crucial" arguments about the election of the  president and the prime minister, reliable sources report that,  in spite of diplomatic words like "constructiveness," with  regard to some problems, the Bosniak-Muslim side will not  relinquish principles that in no way promote the spirit of the  Washington Agreement. Quite the contrary, they keep saying that  the Bosniaks are "the most populous" nation and that "most  victims in this war have been Bosniaks." If such is the case,  it will be very difficult to reach a mutually satisfactory  solution and form (any kind of) federation. Perhaps this is a  bit too pessimistic a statement, but insisting on the fact that  one nation is in the majority (while the Washington agreement  speaks only about equal, constituent, and sovereign nations) is  evidence of a stubborn streak in sticking to views which are  usually present with regard to a civic, that is, unitary  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Muslim-Bosniak leaders have  advocated all the time and which has been the bone of contention  in relations between the two nations. Therefore, it does not  make much sense to repeat something like that after Washington.  The question of outvoting, which was thought to be history  after adopting the Constitution of the Federation, seems to have  reappeared and is reaching its desired goal, which was one of  the main causes of the Croat-Muslim conflict.  <H5>  President for Life </H5>   Moreover, concern over the (too) slow implementation of the  agreement is amplified by the fact that the Bosniak-Muslim side  is relentless in waging a media war, and Sarajevo Radio and the  Mostar "War Studio" are cases in point. The specially  established UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commission had many  complaints with regard to that. In the eyes of the  Bosniak-Muslim media, Alija Izetbegovic is still the (only  possible) president (of the federation as well), and he gets  most support from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Its corps and  brigades simply compete in giving public support to Izetbegovic,  who could enjoy a full five years of the presidency with a  one-year mandate only. Evidently, there is a preponderance of  his followers among the Sarajevo leadership and, as opposed to  the "reconcilable" Silajdzic, Izetbegovic wants both leading  positions in the future Federation, probably thinking that they  can form a federation "with themselves." It is high time that  Sarajevo realized that their political partners are legally  elected representatives of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  that they must reach a democratic agreement on everything. For,  if there is a lack of will to do this (and the Bosniaks have not  proven themselves prepared for this so far), the entire project  of the joint Federation may fall through, which can lead to  (another) situation that is difficult to solve, especially as  the third side (the Bosnian Serbs) are again militarily active  on all the fronts trying to cause complete chaos in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

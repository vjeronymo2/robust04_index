			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / People: Richardson steams on at Port of London Trade must be picking up at the Port of London Authority. For the first time in its history it has hired a retired admiral to be its chief harbour master. Admittedly, Bruce Richardson, 52, is only a rear admiral. But he belongs to a fast-dwindling breed. Ten years ago the Royal Navy had 34 rear admirals. Currently, there are 24 and the number is falling by around one a year, in line with the shrinkage in the size of Britain's Royal Navy. Richardson, below, who takes over from Captain Gordon Varney, spent 32 years with the Royal Navy, mostly at sea. However, it was during one of his first shore jobs - as Britain's naval attache in Moscow - that he first hit the headlines. He was ordered to leave the Soviet Union in 1982 as a retaliatory move after Captain Anatoli Zatov, the Soviet Naval attache, had been expelled from London. In 1985 his diplomatic and linguistic skills were recognised when he was put in charge of Nato's Standing Naval Force Atlantic - a multinational fleet of nine warships. By 47 he was a rear admiral and his last command was the First Flotilla comprising 47 destroyers/frigates and 11,000 men. By contrast, he will have a much smaller fleet at his disposal in his new command. But size does not reflect the importance of the job - maintaining the health of 150 km of the River Thames and overseeing the safety of 25,000 shipping movements a year. The Pounds 45,000 a year job also has a ceremonial side, since the Royal Nore, which the Queen uses when travelling on the river, comes within his new fleet of patrol craft, barges, driftwood collectors, and salvage vessels. John Gracie, 50, has been appointed the new chief executive of Oldham Training and Enterprise Council. Gracie, the former chief executive of Qualitec, in St Helens, will be the third chief executive of the Tec, which was set up in 1991. He succeeds Lynne Clough, 36, who has been the acting chief executive, and who did not wish to be considered for the post on a permanent basis.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY MILLIONAIRES GATHER AT FAIR TO SHARE THEIR GOOD FORTUNES  </P> <P> Victor Khouri's dream came true in many ways when his quick-pick Lotto numbers  were the winners in a California state lottery drawing last year.  </P> <P> Khouri, a San Diego bookbinder, said he had a premonition that he would win  because he had dreamed on his birthday exactly one month earlier that he would  do so.  </P> <P> "I have been pretty lucky; that was my lucky day," Khouri said of the Jan. 27,  1988, drawing in which he and two others won $1.46 million each.  </P> <P> Khouri was one of a group of San Diego County lottery millionaires who gathered  at the Del Mar Fair on Saturday to share experiences and dreams of hitting the  "big one" with fairgoers.  </P> <P> The get-together was sponsored by the state lottery's San Diego district  office, which has an informational booth at the fair.  </P> <P> Despite the financial security, many of the winners on hand said their life had  not changed much.  </P> <P> "It really hasn't," said Sharon Sniffin, who won $1.78 million in November,  1988.  </P> <P> Though she purchased a new Mustang convertible for her daughter Katherine, 15,  the Santee resident said the winnings -- distributed in annual payments over 20  years -- will be invested and used to pay for her two daughters' college  educations. She still works as an office manager for California Carpets.  </P> <P> Sniffin's daughter got the car because "She deserved it, she picked the  numbers," Sniffin said.  </P> <P> "We were sitting at home on a lazy day, and I said I was going to buy some  tickets, and she was concentrating on her book -- didn't really want to be  bothered -- and rattled off some numbers."  </P> <P> The most difficult thing, Sniffin said, was waiting to find out how many others  would share in the $7.01-million jackpot. Four winners, including Sniffin and  Jamul resident John M. Hanks, split the prize.  </P> <P> "If we had won the whole amount, we'd have probably gone hog wild," Sniffin  said.  </P> <P> The most recent San Diego Big Spin winner, Stephen Jacobson of La Mesa, said he  had an inkling that he might become a millionaire. His best friend had told him  he would win $1 million, and at a party given him by co-workers, he cut out a  million-dollar slice of cake shaped like the Big Spin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'People Tell Me I'm Lucky'  </P> <P> Jacobson, 26, a claim specialist with the San Diego district attorney's office,  won $1 million on the Big Spin on June 10. He had previously won $1,000 in a  lotto scratch-off game. A year ago, he won a cruise.  </P> <P> "People tell me I'm lucky," Jacobson said.  </P> <P> He will receive $40,000 annually for the next 20 years. A few fairgoers  Saturday recognized Jacobson from the airing of the Big Spin television show.  </P> <P> "It was definitely an experience," he said. "The ball fell out of one  million-dollar slot into another one. I was jumping up and down when it  stopped."  </P></p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Argentina to pay overdue interest ARGENTINA'S bank creditors will receive Dollars 700m (Pounds 454.5m) in cash and Dollars 9bn in bonds by the end of next month in the last stage of the restructuring accord between the government and international banks, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. The payment will settle overdue interest dating back into the 1980s. Problems in reconciling the ownership of the interest payments - caused by active secondary market trading of the underlying loans and of the interest payments themselves - led to a delay in the release of the bonds and cash. Peru and its foreign bank creditors have scheduled a meeting for November 2 in New York to discuss debt restructuring. Bankers said prospects were good that lawsuits against the government - in particular a suit by Chemical Bank over a Dollars 20m loan to the now-defunct Compania Peruana de Vapores repudiated in 1985 by President Alan Garcia's government - could be resolved by November.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> $422,000 TO INJURED STUNT MAN  </P> <P> A High Court judge awarded $422,000 in damages to a stunt man who claimed his  career was ended by injuries caused in a fall during the filming of the movie  "Superman IV."  </P> <P> London Cannon Films Ltd. admitted liability. But John Lees, 47, said the award  does not make up for the injuries he suffered when harness wires snapped and he  fell 25 feet.  </P> <P> "My career as a stunt man is over," said Lees, whose heels and left ankle were  broken. He was unable under British law to specify to the court how much he  wanted in damages. His lawyer told the court that Lees has undergone surgery  and physiotherapy but is permanently disabled.  </P></p>

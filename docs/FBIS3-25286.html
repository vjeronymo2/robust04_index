The former  Army or security services officers will be joined by a further  30 Israeli recruits at the end of the month to "train  specialists in urban guerrilla warfare," according to Israeli  newspaper YEDI'OT AHARONOT.    Aged between 21 and 27, the mercenaries have been lured to  the West African troublespot by wages of between 2,000 and 2,500  dollars a month. Their job description is "advisers" whose role  will be to "protect democracy."    The Congo has entered the second week of a fragile peace  following a ceasefire between armed factions supporting Lissouba  and main opposition leader Bernard Kolelas at the end of January.    The Israeli mercenaries were recruited on the strength of a  50-million-dollar military accord between the Israeli arms firm  Levdan and the Congo Government.    YEDI'OT AHARONOT has named Levdan chairman Reserve General  Ze'ev Zakharin, 45, who trained the pro-Israeli militia in  southern Lebanon, and two of his aides, reserve colonels  Yisra'el Ramot and Hayim Boru, as the chief recruiting officers.  Eli, a 26-year-old former commando, told the daily that Boru,  his one-time superior in Lebanon, contacted him two months ago.  "We agreed to meet in a Tel Aviv cafe where he explained the  details of the mission after offering a salary of 2,000 dollars  a month. Living conditions are very tough in the Congo." "The  mercenaries live under canvas under military discipline, but  Colonel Boru told us we could make a lot of money," Eli added.    Volunteers signed a one-year contract before being  vaccinated  against a range of tropical diseases, YEDI'OT AHARONOT said.  One clause in the contract obliges the mercenaries to keep  quiet about Levdan's activities.    Last week YEDI'OT AHARONOT reported that opponents of  Lissouba had contacted Israeli officers and businessmen trying  to recruit 500 soldiers to mount a coup in Brazzaville. The  opponents described themselves as the "Liberal Party" and  promised to grant oil and mining concessions to Israel once they  seized power.    Bloody clashes, in which more than 200 were killed, erupted  between Congo's Government and opposition factions last year  after October elections in which the president's supporters won  a majority in parliament. The Congo renewed diplomatic  relations with Israel in 1991 and the Levdan contract is  considered by the government in Jerusalem as one of the biggest  military assistance deals of recent years.</p>

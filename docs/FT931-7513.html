			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Un ballo in maschera - Opera Verdi's Ballo in maschera and Wagner's Tristan und Isolde are in the current repertory of Welsh National Opera. Both operas, composed at the same time, have a soprano-tenor pair of illicit lovers whose second-act love duet - long, structurally varied, shaped to reach an ecstatic climax - forms the work's peak. Some years ago an Italian critic was moved to claim Ballo as the 'Italian Tristan': this Welsh National Verdi revival, and its close proximity to the company's brand-new Wagner production, comes helpfully to hand in fixing both the aptness and the useful limits of the comparison. In common with the new Tristan, the latest WNO Ballo casting has thrown up a particularly strong principal pair - on Monday in the New Theatre, Cardiff, their healthy, freely produced voices and forthright delivery fanned the love music to a bright glow. The Australian Lisa Gasteen, who came to prominence as the 1991 'Cardiff Singer of the World', is a young Verdian of wonderfully rich potential: her spinto soprano has amplitude, a special soft velour in lower ranges and a finespun radiance higher up, and her line is long-breathed. Richard Margison, the Canadian Gustavus, sings with appealing, well-nourished tenor tone lacking only suavity and finesse in the application. Neither singer achieves a fully idiomatic purchase on the Italian words  - this fault, mirrored throughout the Anglo-Saxon cast, tended to blur the exactly graded phases of emotional outpouring in the love music. But the slancio of the singing, supported and encouraged by Carlo Rizzi's sensitive conducting (nervously intense yet never overweight in orchestral mass, alert to dramatic colour and tone, only occasionally rushed), certainly answers many of the opera's most pressing demands. This, in turn, makes the revival well worth tracking down. The 1982 production, by the late Goran Jarvefelt, was always one of the company's most distinguished Verdi stagings, a 'Swedish' Ballo that draws depth, resonance and a subtle, vivid theatricality from the setting. In its latest appearance, supervised by Malcolm Hunter, there seems to be some coarsening of detail. Not all the other main singers were on form on Monday - the press but not the public were informed of the throat infections that audibly burdened Donald Maxwell's Anckarstrom and Rebecca Evans's Oscar. Anne-Marie Owens's fortune-teller was impressively firm and forceful. Sponsored by 3M; two more Cardiff performances, then to Bristol, Liverpool, Southampton, Oxford, Swansea and Birmingham. (We omitted to mention on Monday that the Royal Opera's 'Turandot' is sponsored by UBS/Phillips &amp; Drew)</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ampolex profits dented by fall in oil prices Ampolex, the Sydney-based oil and gas group, yesterday revealed after-tax profits of ADollars 55.3m (Dollars 40.9m) in the year to end-June, down from ADollars 80.6m the previous year, writes Nikki Tait. Profits before tax and abnormals were 1 per cent lower at ADollars 114.7m. The group said that it had registered record levels of oil and gas production, but that benefits of this were offset by a 22 per cent decline in crude oil prices and a significantly higher tax bill. At Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas company primarily involved in development of the North West Shelf gas project, operating profits after tax more than halved to ADollars 36.4m in the six months to end-June. The comparable 1992-93 figure of ADollars 72.5m was boosted by an abnormal gain of ADollars 20.6m.</p>

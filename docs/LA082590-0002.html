			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-CIGARETTE DECISIONS AND SMOKING BANS  </P> <P> The Braude law has little to do with smoking in restaurants.  </P> <P> It is easy to find restaurants with little or no smoking. The Braudes of the  world didn't do that with their regulations. People did it all by their little  selves.  </P> <P> The Braude rule is about the degree to which governments more and more  micro-manage businesses and the lives of people.  </P> <P> Look in Braude's jacket pocket. I'll bet you'll find his draft of a law  regulating which side of the street smokers may walk on. His restrictions  belong in the ashtray.  </P> <P> JOHN C. HASSETT  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

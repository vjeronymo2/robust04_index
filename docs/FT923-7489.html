			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Guard small investors' access to new issues Sir, Your report ('Stock Exchange to relax rules on flotations', August 10) raises a number of worrying points for the private investor. The situation resembles the mid-1980s when the Exchange altered its placing rules to cater for small companies chafing at the costs of making a new issue via a public offer. Many private investors who had been enthusiastic supporters of small new issues were denied access to placings. They complained that they would become less interested in the new issue market as a result of these changes to the placing rules. Your report has an uncomfortable feeling of deja vu. It seems that, in current poor market conditions, the private investor is taking the blame for a lack of market demand. When times change, will this be used to cut the private investor off further from the new issue market? It is unfair to blame the failure of recent new issues on private investors' lack of interest. Private investors did not cause the GPA issue to be withdrawn. Instead, it was lack of institutional interest on both sides of the Atlantic. Can anyone sensibly argue that private investors are wrong to be wary in the current climate? Recent surveys by Mori for ProShare showed that, in June, 43 per cent of private investors felt it was not a good time to invest in equities; that figure increased to 52 per cent by the end of July. Among the sectors viewed unfavourably were publishing, consumer durables and household goods - sectors in which several recent new issues have failed. In the longer term, private investors will maintain a worthwhile role in the new issue market - if they are allowed to do so. As a category, they are a source of initial demand, a provider of liquidity and a continuing source of two-way business. Research shows that new issues play an important role in attracting private investors to the market. Any move which cuts off this form of entry for the private investor, however well-intentioned in the short term, cannot but damage both attempts to ensure wide share ownership and the functioning of the market as a whole. The Stock Exchange response appears to be a short-term and pragmatic solution to a temporary problem. We hope that this is what it remains. On behalf of private investors, we urge the Exchange to reaffirm its long-term commitment to the offer for sale as the preferred method of marketing new issues.

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Joint manoeuvres aid the defence: A look at the motives behind yesterday's merger of US companies Lockheed and Martin Marietta Mr Dan Tellep, chairman of Lockheed, the US aerospace company, was adamant recently that defence companies would have to take the opportunities which came their way in their search for consolidation. 'Everyone is looking at everyone else, we have to be flexible,' he said. At about the same time, Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of another aerospace contractor, Martin Marietta, observed that 'huge cost savings are achievable (from rationalisation)'. In a New York hotel room on Monday night they put those ideas into action in a merger between the two companies which will create the world's largest defence business. The deal reflects the philosophies of the two men. Faced with a tough climate in the defence industry - US equipment spending has fallen by two-thirds in real terms over 10 years - both have been leading the consolidation of the sector. Both are clear that the best way to survive the savage cutback of US equipment procurement is to be as lean, mean and as large as possible. The new company, Lockheed Martin, will certainly be big and well placed to take on competitors. It will have sales of Dollars 23.5bn, making it only slightly smaller than aircraft manufacturer Boeing. And after paying tax, interest and dividends, the combined company will generate Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn in cash over the next five years to spend on investments or acquisitions. The company will make the F-16 and advanced stealth F-22 fighters; the C-130 Hercules transporter; the Trident II, Hellfire II, Patriot and Titan missiles and space launchers; military satellites and a wide variety of avionics and airborne electronics equipment. Yet for all the impressive array of products, there is comparatively little overlap between the two merged companies. Lockheed has traditionally been an airframe manufacturer, while Martin Marietta has concentrated on electronics systems and missiles. In an ideal world the cost savings would have been greater if each had merged with a company in its own field, but that is unlikely to worry either chairman. Both companies have already seen the need for consolidation in their own specialities. Lockheed helped to rationalise the combat aircraft business when it bought General Dynamics' F-16 fighter plant last year. Now with fewer possible mergers around, Mr Tellep stresses the art of the possible when looking for partners. In an industry where aggressive bids are rare, the need is to find companies which can make mergers work, rather than where the overlap is greatest. Similarly, Martin Marietta added to its space businesses when it bought operations from General Dynamics and conglomerate General Electric. However, Mr Augustine thinks that there are plenty of overheads and duplicated costs which can be cut out from defence companies even when the overlap between their operations is small. Only in the two companies' space and missiles businesses is there scope for large-scale synergy. Apart from integrating space and missiles, the merged company's first priority will be to cut central costs. Perhaps chillingly for those who work there, the new company has already listed the opportunities for consolidation: the two headquarters (there will be just one at Martin's site in Bethesda near Washington DC); central functions such procurement, property, information services and treasury; the 50m square feet of manufacturing and office space; and the Dollars 750m of joint annual research and development spending and Dollars 500m of capital investment. Lower costs are one rationale for merger, but the chemistry between the top managers in the two companies also helped bring about the deal. Mr Tellep is the quieter, watchful strategist who complements Mr Augustine's extrovert wit and wisdom. Each has already matched canny purchases with tough cost cutting and has kept shareholders happy. At 62 Mr Tellep is the senior figure who will slip naturally into the chair, yet will also retire early enough to give Mr Augustine, who is 58, a good crack of the whip. Besides, the US defence industry is currently like a game of musical chairs where the number of spare seats is rapidly diminishing. Martin Marietta tried and failed to buy aircraft-maker Grumman earlier this year when it was snapped up by the Californian aerospace company Northrop. There is a growing feeling that if companies do not find acceptable partners soon, they may be too late. This is despite the strong rise in the price of defence company shares since the process of rationalisation in the US defence industry began three years ago. Some felt that following the Northrop Grumman deal, mergers would slow because share prices had risen too much. It may be no coincidence that yesterday's deal will be financed by an exchange of shares rather than as a cash bid - cutting out any bid premium which might otherwise have been paid. Other defence companies feeling that they are too small to survive will not feel any more comfortable as a result of this deal. The tightening ratchet of rising share prices and reducing merger options has moved up another notch. There were, then, strong financial and management incentives behind the merger. Still, for all that the deal has a sharply defensive air. It might have been more natural for Lockheed to have merged with Boeing or McDonnell Douglas, as they are in the airframe business too. Yet both are larger than Lockheed and it would have been difficult for Mr Tellep to cut a deal on equal terms. Similarly, Martin Marietta has more in common with missile-makers Hughes or Raytheon, but Mr Augustine would have found it hard to strike a deal with General Motors, Hughes' owner, that would have enhanced his position. Thus there is a sense in which yesterday's deal was the result of threats faced by the companies rather than the opportunities ahead. The most obvious threat is the squeeze on defence spending. Equipment purchases are likely to fall further in the next few years and, according to Bankers Trust, a US bank, the number employed in the US defence industry will fall from 800,000 to 500,000 by 1997. Yet much of the retrenchment has already been completed, and defence contractors are now generating strong cash flows. A newer threat came from the US deputy defence secretary, Mr John Deutch, last week, when he called into question a whole array of next-generation weapons. They included the hitherto-sacred Dollars 71bn F-22 air superiority fighter programme, in which Lockheed has a two-thirds stake, and the Comanche helicopter, which has electronics supplied by Martin Marietta. If any of these programmes are cancelled or delayed substantially, the defence squeeze may force many more companies from the field. There is also the financial threat from the stock market. So far cost-cutting defence companies have been favourites with institutional investors. But the strong cash flow they have generated may also attract corporate raiders keen to sell off bits and pocket the growing cash mountains. Whatever the prime motives, there is little doubt that the US defence business will emerge with fewer stronger players from the current bout of mergers. That should give manufacturers in Europe pause for thought. With mega-deals between the largest US contractors happening two or three years before most pundits predicted, European companies have even less time than thought to rationalise their operations if they are to remain competitive. However, the political barriers to European consolidation will remain. And squabbles in coming months over national workshares on projects such as the Future Large Aircraft and Eurofighter 2000 will make the European industry resemble a three-ring circus set against the leaner US fighting machine. .TX .- --------------------------------------- Turnover in defence business 1993                    (Dollars bn) --------------------------------------- Lockheed                  10.06 McDonnell Douglas          9.40 Martin Marietta            7.55 Northrop Grumman           6.95 British Aerospace         6.06 GM Hughes                  6.05 Thomson CSF                5.00 estimate Raytheon                   4.79 GEC-Marconi                4.21 DASA                       3.40 Aerospatiale               3.30  -------------------------------------- Source: Lehman Brothers  --------------------------------------</p>

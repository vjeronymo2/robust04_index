			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill rights to fund land purchases Higgs &amp; Hill yesterday joined the growing band of builders to announce share issues to pay for housing land purchases. The company plans to raise Pounds 22.2m by offering shareholders one new share at 105p for every two already held. It has agreed to buy 78.6 acres of land, more than half in south-west England, for Pounds 22.5m. The land on 13 sites is sufficient to build about 930 homes, said Mr John Theakston, chief executive. More than four fifths of the land, 67.2 acres, is being acquired from English China Clays for Pounds 19.3m. English China Clays has previously announced its withdrawal from housebuilding and is in the process of demerging its building materials business. Higgs &amp; Hill's share price yesterday fell by 10p to 122p. The land has been acquired at a price of about Pounds 24,000 a plot, compared with an average house price of Pounds 82,000, producing an estimated gross margin of 18 per cent before selling expenses, said Mr Theakston. At the end of last year, the company owned 1,200 plots with planning permission at an average cost in the balance sheet of Pounds 23,000 each. The number of plots will now increase to more than 2,000. This will enable the company, which previously has operated mainly in south-east England, to increase the number of homes it builds annually from 332 last year to 650 by the end of next year. The purchase of three of the sites would depend upon revised planning approvals being granted. English China Clays had agreed to carry out off site works on a fourth site. Under the terms of the deal, Pounds 13.7m would be paid to English China Clays immediately; Pounds 3.7m on award of planning and completion of works with the final Pounds 1.9m to be paid by December 16 next year. Higgs &amp; Hill said that at the end of April it had net cash of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m, but expected to move to modest borrowings by the end of this year to meet the cost of establishing a new division in the south-west and other land purchases. COMMENT The timing of the cash call is not the best given the sharp rise in housing land prices and the recent pressure on housebuilding stocks. The market therefore was duly suspicious of the value to be gained from buying sites which in the case of English China Clays have been on the market for more than a year. On the other hand, Higgs &amp; Hill management is highly regarded and profits of Pounds 12.5m in 1996 would leave the group on a prospective p/e of under 10 on an ex-rights price of 123p. The rights therefore, should be supported, but the market is getting fatigued by the volume of shares being issued by housebuilders.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Move into retail behind UniChem's 55% rise THE ESTABLISHMENT of a chain of chemists' shops helped UniChem, traditionally a pharmaceuticals wholesaler, to increase pre-tax profits by 55 per cent in the first half of the year. The group made Pounds 15m (Pounds 9.68m) before tax on sales of Pounds 500.4m (Pounds 452.2m). Mr Jeff Harris, who moved up from finance director to chief executive earlier this year, said that sales growth would have been nearly 20 per cent without a change in the arrangement for selling Glaxo's drugs. UniChem now receives an agent's fee rather than owning the drugs being traded. The retail division, which hardly existed in the first half of last year, contributed Pounds 33m to turnover and about Pounds 2m to profit. The main building block was the Pounds 27m acquisition of the 92-shop E Moss business in December. By the end of June the group had 132 shops and a further 34 had been added since, through the Pounds 14.5m purchase of Scott and another Scottish buy this week. The Moss acquisition was accompanied by a Pounds 35.1m 1-for-4 rights issue. As a result UniChem's earnings per share rose less quickly - by 20 per cent to 7.2p fully diluted (6.5p to 7.6p undiluted). The group is still dominated by wholesaling where operating profits rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 13m. The margin improved from 2.1 to 2.4 per cent. While gearing was zero at the half-way stage, it would be between 15 and 20 per cent by the end of the year, with the Scott acquisition falling in the second half. The group sold its nappy manufacturing business incurring an extraordinary loss of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.03m for the abandoned bid for Macarthy). The interim dividend goes up from 1.65p to 1.9p. COMMENT These results were ahead of expectations and the group's share price gained 5p to close at 210p, even though it will not benefit from the lower pound and has limited recovery potential. Not that UniChem's virtues can be ignored just yet. The UK drugs market seems to be growing at about 10 per cent a year, fuelled by an older population and the increasing sophistication of treatments. And UniChem can continue to improve margins, through automation and the growing contribution of higher-margin activities. One of these is the over-the-counter lines, cosmetics for instance, which will be helped by more healthy consumer spending. A full-year profit of Pounds 30m to Pounds 31m, compared with Pounds 21.4m, gives a prospective multiple of about 14, in line with the market. As the recession deepened, it deserved a premium, now it seems rightly to be at a cross-over point as attention switches to cyclical recovery stocks. But with the air still thick with reasons for caution, it is worth holding for its reliable qualities.</p>

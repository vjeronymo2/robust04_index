			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYING ON HEARTSTRINGS;  </P> <P> RESONATING BODIES BY LYNNE ALEXANDER (ATHENEUM: $18.95; 230 PP.; 0-698-12039-7)  </P> <P> Lynne Alexander, herself once a professional harpsichordist, has taken two  characters (a talking cello and an aging English musician at the end of his  long career), given them alternating chapters in which to tell the stories of  their lives, and has thereby created something very like a piece of music  itself in this wonderfully skilled, delightfully ambitious, and quietly moving  novel (Alexander's second, following the widely praised "Safe Houses."  </P> <P> Nicholas Jordan is the musician, an internationally acclaimed baroque  revivalist now 72 years old, troubled by ill health, and still tormented by his  recent decision to retire from performing ("For the first time in his life, he  had taken a safe, slow tempo in the Bach D Major. It was his cue to leave"). As  the novel takes place, the uneasy Nicholas sits in the audience in the Salon  d'Apollon at Versailles, listening to a concert in which his protege and chosen  successor performs -- doing so on the instrument that he has given her, the  very instrument that he himself has possessed, performed on, and lived with for  50 years.  </P> <P> And what an instrument it is -- or she is -- speaking to Nicholas as the  concert proceeds, and listening to his thoughts in return. She's not really a  cello at all, but, as she tells us, "I am Rose, Viola da Gamba, of the family  Viols, noble in size and shape. Like the cello, I am held between the legs: da  gamba. Unlike the cello, however, which often has a metal tail on which it  leans (causing unsightly damage to wooden floors), I rest on nothing but the  inner calves, and to these I transmit my full sonority."  </P> <P> Rose's story alone (hold the miracle of her voice for later) is a thing  beguiling. It's a story unobtrusively told by Alexander -- from Rose's  beginning in 1670 in the Paris workshop of Christophe Bernard. He created her,  the most lovely of the seven-string viols, as a wedding gift for his wife; she,  however, died in childbirth before Rose's completion. Beautiful, modest,  touched from the start by love and by her awareness of mortality, Rose made her  way through the next two centuries, had a piece composed in her honor (the lost  "Apotheosis of the Bernard Viol"), was played by the loathsome and  puritanically repressed Cornelius Graswinkel, was painted by Vermeer and owned  by the pudgy and passionless Roger North in England. She found her way to the  French court where she was played at Versailles by the brilliant Marin Marais,  later by the demonic genius Antoine Forqueray -- all of this (and more) in a  life's journey that was to see her barely survive the fiery cataclysm of the  French Revolution, find her (out of fashion) moldering first in a museum and  then in a pawn shop in Paris. Her discovery there by Arnold Dolmetsch would  lead at last (after still more confusion, adulteration, and abuse) to her being  bought at an auction in London by one Harry Jordan for his passionately  desiring 12-year-old son Nicholas.  </P> <P> And who was this strange, only child of odd parents (his father was to  disappear forever soon after buying the viol), with his single-minded passion  to have, and play, Rose? He was, to put it plainly, her lover and savior, as  she was his. His love for her ("his Rose, who . . . responded to the lightest  touch. How he loved her, her smooth surface, the hollow depths of her, the  delicate contours of her body") was equal only to hers for him ("Mount me, hold  me, string me, tune me") -- and between the two of them, these resonating  bodies would be created, again and again, through great passion, the wonder of  enormous beauty, not to mention huge renown and material success ("Imagine,"  says Rose at one point, "Forqueray at the top of the hit parade").  </P> <P> And what is the real question the novel takes up? Alexander's graceful  learnedness, subtlety, and range -- as well as her humor and shrewdly  penetrating eye -- allow questions galore to come up, but at the heart of it  all lies a tale about the human cost of the life lived for beauty. The past of  Nicholas Jordan, after all -- as he realizes while sitting uneasily in that  concert at Versailles -- was in many ways a lost and even a destructive one in  his half-century devotion to Rose. "He had put mother, father, students,  lovers, wife and child second to her in his affections. . . . He . . . had cut  himself off from human intercourse in order to become one with her."  </P> <P> The heart of the novel, of course, lies in Nicholas Jordan's effort to make a  meaningful peace with the long trail of failure and success that now lies  behind him -- and with the death he knows to be approaching. But what raises  this story toweringly above the commonplace is the unmatchable character of the  wonderful Rose, who offers counsel, perception, wisdom, and corrective advice  throughout, and whose unflappable and enchanting voice will be a high treasure  for lovers both of music and of words. Nicholas will die, while Rose will go  on, played by others, and yet even so she can still give comfort for what has  been, and can advise Nicholas to "Be grateful for the adventure and say  goodbye." "I am uniqueness and beauty personified in an age of uniformity and  ugliness," she reminds him, and, in words that can thrill as meaningfully and  deeply as any others in this unpretentiously profound and quietly daring  masterpiece of intelligent, thinking fiction: "Close your eyes and let me  caress you for the last time. Listen to my voice, which resembles the human in  all its inflexions . . .; clean and piercing in the treble, caressing in the  tenor, ravishing and golden in the bass."  </P></p>

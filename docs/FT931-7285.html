			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / People: Chilver pitches in Lord Chilver describes kaolin as the 'supreme white mat-erial'; he has been involved with mining the aluminium silicon compound through his 20-year association with English China Clays. Now, in his new role as chairman of RJB Mining, he will come increasingly into contact with one of the better known black substances. RJB already runs 11 opencast coal sites and one deep mine. The company is planning a stock market flotation, which is likely to value it at more than Pounds 100m, and would like to buy some of the pits which British Coal wants to close. It is also likely to be a bidder for at least some parts of BC when it is privatised. Introducing a company he heads to the stock market will be a new experience for Lord Chilver, and that challenge, he says, was part of the appeal of the RJB job. He has, however, considerable experience at the top of quoted companies, having been a director at English China Clays since 1973 and chairman since 1989. He has been a non-executive director of Imperial Chemical Industries since 1990. Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says Lord Chilver was an obvious choice. 'He is an engineering specialist, having graduated in it and written about it. As chairman of ECC, he is also used to big holes in the ground.' RJB was the subject of a Pounds 106.5m management buy-out last year from AF Budge, the private construction company headed by Tony Budge, the brother of Richard, which went into receivership in December. ***** Foreign &amp; Colonial Eurotrust is reinforcing the continental European representation on its board with the appointments of Detlef Bierbaum, a partner of Cologne private banking house Sal Oppenheim, and Pedro Schwartz, professor of economics at Madrid University. 'This is an active board, with a good input on strategy, and with plenty of experience in the securities business. They are not sitting ducks,' says Stephen White, manager of Eurotrust and a director of F&amp;C Management. F&amp;C's Eurotrust has assets of Pounds 112m, and, as one of the top performers in its sector, stands at a discount of just 2 per cent. Bierbaum, 50, replaces Wolfgang Meissner, 62, who was at the same bank and who is retiring in order to devote more time to his recently reacquired family engineering business near Chemnitz in east Germany. While F&amp;C has established a joint venture with Bayerische Hypo Bank, it says it also has a long-standing dealing relationship with Sal Oppenheim, and has had one of its bankers on the board continuously since the trust was set up in 1972. Schwartz, formerly chief economist at brokers Iberagentes, is the first director from a southern European country. An alumnus of the LSE, the anglophile professor, who has two sons at Winchester, is a member of the economics team of the Bank of Spain, and was a liberal MP for 15 years. Philip Tose, chairman of Hong Kong-based Peregrine Investments, has been made a director of Drayton Far Eastern Trust, a month after going on the board of the trust's managers Invesco MIM, in which Peregrine has built a 24.7 per cent stake. The slightly larger trust Drayton Asia is the subject of a bid from EFM Dragon Trust. Invesco says Tose's role is as 'an investment professional, with very specific expertise on the Hong Kong region'. Peter Knapton, managing director of Invesco's UK wholesale business, also goes on to the board. Geoffrey Bowling, an Invesco director who is retiring from the group, and Nicholas Johnson, who resigned from Invesco at Christmas, both step down.</p>

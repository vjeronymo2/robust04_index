			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, June 1 (AFP) -- A missile fired by north  Yemeni forces slammed into Aden, the capital of southern Yemen,  early Wednesday, triggering a huge fire near the airport,  correspondents reported.    South Yemeni anti-aircraft units had earlier opened fire in  an attempt to intercept the missile.    Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene but there  were no immediate reports of causalities.    Yemen erupted into open civil war between northern and  southern forces on May 5 as their political leaders had failed  to agree on governing the country.</p>

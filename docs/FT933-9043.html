			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / People: Arjo Wiggins Appleton Arjo Wiggins Appleton has appointed the distinguished, if media shy, Italian industrialist Gabriele Galateri to its board as a non-executive director, replacing Pierre Dufournier, who has retired. Galateri is managing director of IFIL, a diversified holding company which is part of the Agnelli group. Scion of an eminent Turin family, Galateri is thought to be marked out for high office at Fiat, particularly in the light of changes that may occur in the wake of the corruption scandal sweeping Italy. The chairman of IFIL is Umberto Agnelli who is expected to take over at Fiat when his brother, Giovanni Agnelli, steps down next year. Galateri is a non-executive director of Saint-Louis, which has a 39.6 per cent stake in AWA. IFIL has recently increased its stake in Saint-Louis to 15.6 per cent. The structure of AWA's board has come in for criticism, as it was felt that the minority French shareholders wielded excessive power. But AWA took steps to redress the balance earlier this year, with the appointment of two British non-executives.</p>

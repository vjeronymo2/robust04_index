			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Base rate hopes feature in thin trade A FLOW of corporate devel-opments, together with revived optimism on the interest rate front, pushed share prices ahead yesterday while doing nothing to inspire investment activity. The FT-SE Index gained nearly 18 points but trading volume, after excluding a handful of specific stocks, was among the lowest daily totals for the year. Lacking a definitive lead from either Tokyo or New York, the London equity market returned in somewhat lethargic form from the extended holiday weekend in the UK. The domestic backcloth was uncertain, with a survey of UK construction industry employers claiming that the industry downturn had deepened but a report from the Institute of Directors indicating some revival in business confidence. The latest Financial Times survey of economic forecasts suggested that the progress of the economy may oblige Mr John Major's government to postpone any UK general election until October. Equities drew comfort from a firmer performance by sterling, which raised hopes that the expected improvement in the UK inflation rate to be disclosed next week may open the way for another half-point reduction in base rates. The City of London, primed recently by the prime minister and the UK Treasury, expects a sharp fall in the April retail price index (RPI), to be announced on May 17, perhaps to around 6.3 per cent annually from 8.2 per cent in March. Shares opened lower but turned higher as interest rate optimism was reflected in a firm opening in the Footsie futures contract. The brighter mood was encouraged by the placing of a substantial holding of shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, by the Rothschild interests, and by activity among brewing and pharmaceutical issues. Futures markets helped equities throughout the session, but it was soon clear that trading volume remained limited to the special situation stocks. Turnover of 144m shares in Saatchi, largely representing double counting of the share placing by Rothschild interests, made up about one-third of the day's total Seaq volume of 431.2m shares. The London market took further encouragement when Wall Street opened the new session steadily, calmed by President Bush's return to work. At its final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 17.8 points at 2,540.5. Equity strategists suggested that the stock market may now have settled into a trading range with a ceiling, for the present, at around FT-SE 2,550, and saw yesterday's performance as a sparsely traded rally. The next two weeks will bring a heavy list of UK corporate news, headed tomorrow by first-quarter results from British Petroleum, as well as a spate of data on the UK economy. While the market was concentrating yesterday on prospects for the April RPI figures, not all analysts accepted that these may provide the trigger for cuts in base rates. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London investment bank, remains somewhat cautious towards UK equities in the short term, commented BZW's Mr Richard Kersley, although the firm expects falling inflation to provide the spur for an advance later in the year. For the present, he believes that further improvement in equities appears likely to be 'stock specific', with the broad range of stocks finding it difficult to make further progress after the spectacular advance achieved over the first quarter of the year.</p>

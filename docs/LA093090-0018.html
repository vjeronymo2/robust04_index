			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOBSTERS AND MAGNATES  </P> <P> Writing on gangster films in the Sept. 23 issue, both Patrick Goldstein and  Peter Rainer attempt to establish a link between gangsterism and free  enterprise. They make this appalling comparison by conveniently blanking out  the meaning of the word free.  </P> <P> Capitalism involves the voluntary exchange of goods between people. Any form of  coercion -- by government or individual -- is the negation of free enterprise.  The gangster's stock in trade is coercion at its most brutal.  </P> <P> Al Capone told speak-easy owners to either buy his beer or have their kneecaps  busted and their barrooms blown to pieces. This was hardly a voluntary exchange  of goods. And when Vito Corleone puts a loaded gun to somebody's head and makes  him "an offer he can't refuse," he's not acting as an apostle of Adam Smith.  </P> <P> The next time Rainer and Goldstein ask for a raise, Times management should  take a negotiating tip from the Godfather and place a severed horse head in  their beds. Maybe then they'll appreciate the difference between gangsterism  and the free market.  </P> <P> RUSSELL DVONCH  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

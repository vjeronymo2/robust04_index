			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Ever widening social circles - From Henley to Cowes, Brenda Polan considers how high society's season survives in a chilly climate ACCORDING to The Tatler, a British society magazine, the first event of the social season is the Grand National steeplechase. But after this year's debacle, the omens for the 1993 calendar of race meetings, regattas, flower festivals, balls and chilly picnics did not, at the start of April, look good. Yet, succeeding events have gone as planned, affected only by some poor weather, a slight decline in numbers - and a willingness by the women to wear last year's frock. Too many, perhaps. In the past fortnight, two of London's foremost suppliers of clothes to the smart set have put up the shutters. First to go was couturier Victor Edelstein, maker of beautiful ball gowns and cocktail dresses; he declared that, because his market had shrunk so much, he would soon be unable to pay his workroom staff. Courtauld, the textiles manufacturer, withdrew financing for Arabella Pollen's own-label collection. Pollen is the darling of the younger, leggier sort of racegoer. The company still wants her as a consultant but feels there is, at present, no profit in the kind of clothes British society women wear. Other British couturiers are rumoured to be under pressure as their customers bow to a new mood of sobriety. 'People,' says Ewa Lewis - meaning right-thinking, sensitive, sensible, affluent-to-rich people - 'do not want to be seen to be spending. There is a certain guilt about enjoying oneself when so many people, from the miners to one's friends who have been hit by (the) Lloyd's (underwriting disaster), are suffering the effects of the recession.' Lewis should know. She is the social editor of The Tatler. Last year she described the crowd at the Royal Ascot race meeting as low-key, anonymous and battle-dressed. 'Everyone,' she summed up, 'looked as though they shouldn't be there.' Furtive might be the word she refrained from using. After all, drinking champagne, eating lobster and making large bets while the economy crumbles is not so different from fiddling while Rome smoulders. But although the mood of some taking part in the season might be subdued, the onlookers have never been so entranced. The media's romance with what it deems the upper classes grows ever more passionate. Page after page of most tabloid newspapers - and several soi-disant 'qualities' - is filled with the marital entanglements, misdemeanours, commercial enterprises and sartorial preferences of the titled. The rich and famous were always with us. The phenomenon of the impoverished, obscure and obscurely-titled as objects of curiosity, envy and even adulation is a late-1980s' development which, far from fading in the commonsense 1990s, seems to be gathering pace. Thus Eve Pollard, editor of the Sunday Express, squeals with delight when, in her role as the BBC's fashion commentator at Royal Ascot, she manages to identify a frock-wearer with a title; for Pollard, titles have a miraculously beautifying effect on the ugliest of frocks. Thus the once-august Sunday Times devotes resources (which might, on other newspapers, fund whole features departments) to in-depth analyses of the sins and solecisms of an archaic elite which would far rather (except when it has a country hotel to promote) be left alone. Nor is it simply a matter of bread and media circuses; nor even, for the deferential British, a matter of deriving comfort from the orderliness of an enduring social hierarchy. It is a cocktail of aspiration, ambition and envy. Many may read, watch and dream; some try to gain entry. New millionaires can buy their way in; beautiful or clever women have done it via marriage. Provided a newcomer is prepared to learn the unwritten, unspoken rules and abide by them, there has always been room. Today, says Lewis, there is more room. Society is readier to embrace the outsider than ever before. Gone is the day when a grandee of the old guard could insist that cabinet minister Michael Heseltine could not be called a gentleman since he had needed to buy his own furniture. In the 1990s, the regulators of society - the people who send the invitations, issue the badges and allot the seats - are more likely to judge by worth than bloodline. 'Nouveau riche,' says Lewis, 'is a phrase that is fading from currency. In fact, only an outsider would use it.' The revival of the debutante phenomenon is an illuminating example of a class's survival mechanisms at work. On one level, it is a revival of an old practice: that of the indigent but aristocratic selling their services as sponsors of the rich but proletarian. (You could not be presented at court without a sponsor who belonged there already). On another level, it brings marriageable young women of means into the cash-strapped social circle. Presentation at court is not bought so easily these days (although to be launched on the season is an effective substitute). Today, the monarch and her family take part in the season only so far as their personal preferences dictate - mainly, if there are horses (or dear friends) involved. The nature of most events changed so radically in the 1980s that many of the old guard felt elbowed out of places and occasions which, as familiar to them as nanny's knee, had suddenly become strange. The two new factors at work were charity and commercialism. There was a sense, even in the 1980s, that hedonism could not be its own reward; conscience should take a cut, too. So, for every event there was a charity committee, a raffle and a justifying cheque. Simultaneously, businesses realised that their names could borrow cachet from association with upper-class pursuits and that clients could be thrilled and impressed by a day at Windsor Great Park, Goodwood, Cowes or Henley. Those who took their clients to Wimbledon did not get it quite right. But even when the event is right and the sponsor has a monopoly, the result, says Lewis, is a distortion. 'The Cartier International polo match is corporate entertainment with a capital C; regardless of the fact that many of the old polo brigade will actually be lunching not in the chic Cartier tent but in the rather grotty and unglamorous HPA (Hurlingham Polo Association) tent.' Long before the recession zapped entertainment budgets, the gloss was fading from the concept as over-wooed clients became jaded and cynical about the extent to which they were a part of the proceedings rather than its subsidy. But questions as to whether the season can survive its loss of sponsorship and the personal losses of its participants do not arise. The season is entrenched as a way of life and the means, marriage-wise, to secure the future of a resilient class. It is the coveted goal of the most energetic and resourceful of outsiders - and a splendid spectacle for everyone else.</p>

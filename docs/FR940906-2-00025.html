The Center is envisioned to be the source for primarily plutonium-related information for the public and especially for the State of Texas. The Center will support the collection, review and interpretation of technical literature, sponsoring and coordinating additional studies and research, engaging in the study of the environmental effects of plutonium, high explosives and other nuclear or hazardous materials generated from nuclear weapons dismantlement, and characterization of local environmental transport and accumulation of plutonium, and public outreach. It will not engage in physical, chemical, or metallurgical studies of plutonium. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Juan Williams, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office, Contracts and Procurement Division, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185&hyph;5400. Telephone: (505) 845&hyph;5865. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Energy has determined that restriction to the State of Texas is appropriate based on the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The participant, the State of Texas, is the unit of government having the direct responsibility and appropriate jurisdiction to protect the welfare, health and safety of its citizens. No other entity, other than the Federal Government, has the direct responsibility to protect the environment and the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the State of Texas. Therefore, DOE in the public interest will make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to the State of Texas. Further, due to the fact that (1) Texas has the primary and direct responsibility for the health, welfare, and safety of its citizens, and (2) the Pantex Plant, is conducting nuclear weapons dismantlement, which is an activity within Texas' jurisdiction, DOE is therefore precluded from providing support to another entity. This award will be in the best interests of the Government and the public and is considered vital and timely with respect to the continuing mission of nuclear weapons dismantlement at Pantex. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, based upon the above, the award of a cooperative agreement to the State of Texas, on a noncompetitive basis, appropriately satisfies the criteria specified in Paragraphs (C) and (H) of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i). DOE has determined that: (1) The applicant is a unit of government and the activity supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction; and, (2) such award is in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This initiative was contained in the President's FY 95 amended Congressional budget request and will be supported by Surplus Fissile Materials Control and Disposition funds. The cooperative agreement will be awarded for an initial period of five (5) years. At maturity, the total annual budget is estimated to be approximately $10 million for the Center. The cooperative agreement will be administered by the Albuquerque Operations Office. This agreement will not become effective for at least 14 days after publication of this notice to allow for public comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Albuquerque, NM on August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard A.

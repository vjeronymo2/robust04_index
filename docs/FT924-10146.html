			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 60m sewerage treatment scheme The tunnelling company of TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has been awarded a subcontract to design and construct an undersea tunnel to carry an outfall for South West Water's Penzance and St Ives sewerage and sewage treatment scheme, phase 1, which is worth about Pounds 60m. The 2.6km rock tunnel will run from Gwithian on Cornwall's north coast to outside St Ives bay. The tunnelling contract also includes the installation of four diffusers at the seaward end of the tunnel. Treated waste water will reach the tunnel outfall through a new 8km pipe between Hayle and Gwithian. Work on sinking the tunnel shaft has commenced and construction is scheduled for completion in late 1994. The tunnel is an important element of the Penzance and St Ives scheme which is being constructed by the Trafalgar House Water Projects Consortium, comprising Trafalgar House Construction and John Brown Engineering. The scheme involves diverting crude sewage outfalls in the Penzance area and redirecting the flows to Hayle for treatment prior to discharge through the tunnel outfall.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Salomon drops Lloyd's plan Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, yesterday announced the withdrawal of its plans to launch a new Lloyd's investment company, underlining the limit of institutional interest in the insurance market. Salomon and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the US insurance brokers, sought Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) for London Market Investors from US and other investors to back between 40 and 50 syndicates. Yet despite the success of more than a dozen Lloyd's investment trusts - which have raised more than Pounds 830m for Lloyd's - Salomon was unable to persuade US investors. 'We had a lot of investors sitting on the fence looking at the deal but we could not get them to move quickly enough,' said Mr Marty Dolan, vice-president of Salomon's corporate finance in London. 'The further away from Lloyd's you go the more scepticism there is,' added Mr Dolan, who said many US investors were a 'little sceptical'. By contrast Salomon had experienced less difficulty in persuading British institutions, which would have supplied a quarter of the capital. The withdrawal of the Salomon scheme and the comparative success of UK-based schemes marks a sharp reversal from the pattern of Lloyd's corporate capital efforts earlier this year, when US banks made most of the early running in Lloyd's efforts to raise corporate capital. While 11 UK investment trusts and companies are trading on the London Stock Exchange, the other mainly US-based vehicle, Lutine Capital Corporation, has yet to finalise its plans. And two other US companies - Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's largest broker, and JP Morgan, the investment bank, both prominent supporters of Lloyd's early efforts - have failed to deliver investment schemes. Marsh and Morgan backed unsuccessful Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy chairman of Lloyd's, to link his Merrett Group with corporate capital. Following the failure of plans to form a consortium arrangement with Travelers Insurance, Merrett Group withdrew from underwriting activities last month, and yesterday completed the sale of another of its underwriting syndicates - number 179 - to the rival Catlin Underwriting Agencies.</p>

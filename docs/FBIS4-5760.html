			<p>CSO     [Text] Mitsui and Co. has formed a partnership with Saint  Onge, a medium-sized marketing consulting firm of York City,  Pennsylvania. Saint Onge is strong in the building of  computer-based marketing systems and leads in marketing systems  aimed at the multimedia age such as television shopping. Mitsui  will offer Saint Onge's technology when assisting Japanese firms  in marketing their products in the United States as well as  introducing their technology in Japan in expanding its contract  distribution businesses.    Businesses are in the process of shoring up their  competitiveness through the reengineering process. They are  taking such action as revising distribution methods so as to  expedite marketing procedures by making them more responsive to  customer needs, and reducing costs by outsourcing material  requirements and consolidating operating units. Mitsui decided  to form the partnership with Saint Onge because it sensed a  renewed concern by industry for marketing systems.    Mitsui will offer consulting services to Japanese firms  locating in the United States relative to factory site shipping  systems and the location of distribution points. It will also  provide specific services in the areas of basic facility and  information systems design, selection of necessary equipment,  and training of personnel. Mitsui will also provide similar  services in Japan and is considering launching related,  innovative business services. As an example, it is considering  the establishment of in-house delivery services and to offer  contract delivery services to manufacturers and retailers  requiring frequent, small-lot deliveries.    Integrated trading companies are constantly seeking out new  sources of products and materials as well as purchasers of such  items and possess the capability to market such items. Mitsui  aims to reinforce such functions and expand its marketing rights  through the recent tie up.    Although Saint Onge is medium-sized, it is strong on a  technical basis with about 70 percent of its 80 employees  comprised of technicians. Recently, it has engaged in  merchandise distribution services associated with television  shopping networks and Mitsui believes it can use such know-how  in the Japanese markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava June 13 (CTK) -- Ludovit Cernak,  former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) and currently  leader of the government coalition National Democratic Party  (NDS) and parliament deputy chairman, favours national  reconciliation between followers and opponents of an independent  Slovak state.    In an interview with the daily SMENA today, Cernak says that  "an absolute blindness towards the demands of national  minorities cannot correspond with the real interests of the  Slovak nation." Since Slovakia has gained its independence and  thus implemented its statehood, it should be a good father and  mother for all its citizens. Only when internal stability is  achieved will Slovakia be able to join the European and world  communities. We cannot continue to divide ourselves into those  who were for Slovakia's independence and those who were against  it. The process of national reconciliation should begin and  everyone should be included into the process of building the  Slovak statehood," Cernak says.    Referring to his past activities as a SNS founding member,  Cernak says: "When (former Slovak premier and chairman of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Vladimir) Meciar came  to me and spoke about our possible cooperation I told him that  he would not be successful with his federalistic statements. It  was during this talk that the word 'confederation' was used for  the first time and I then admitted the possibility of  confederation as a possible compromise between my views and  Meciar's," Cernak says.    However, the SNS has become excessively radical and personal  interests have ever more prevailed over the interests embedded  in its manifesto, Cernak says, adding that in the long run, with  the help of Meciar who actually corrupted the SNS, the radical  wing in the party gained an upper hand.    "I think the fact that the radical wing has managed, after  our withdrawal, to topple the moderate one will eventually lead  to the party's suicide," says Cernak who was dismissed as SNS  chairman and expelled from the party at its congress in February  after which he and his followers established the NDS.    The NDS seeks to gain voters with the idea of national  reconciliation while at the same time remaining a national-  orientated party, Cernak says. He says the NDS's programme is  close to that of right-centre parties', adding that the question  of whether NDS leaders will accept the Christian Democratic  Movement's (KDH) offer to run on its slate in the autumn  parliamentary elections, or whether it will resume talks with  the Democratic Union (DU) headed by Premier Jozef Moravcik,  would be decided soon.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / A nation warmed to take the cockle to its heart Enjoy a bouillabaisse? You barbarian] What about the rights of the innocent cockles and mussels plucked from sand and rock, thrown mercilessly into boiling water, solely for the gastronomic satisfaction of humans? This is the charge levelled against shellfish eaters by Animal Concern, a vegetarian organisation that recently petitioned William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, to outlaw all types of shell fishing. Britain is showing every sign of becoming the most animal-loony nation in the world. The Jains of India sweep the path before them, and wear cloths over their mouths, lest they inadvertently harm insects. But they are an extreme religious sect; and live for the glory of God. Care for animals in Britain is taken to extremes by a vociferous fringe who discredit those whose concern for animals is reasonable and genuine. Hunt saboteurs in their doomsday garb fail to convey the impression of having a deep regard for animals, or the countryside. Peculiar public reactions followed the latest death of a keeper, mauled in John Aspinall's zoo. Animal 'experts' were summoned to examine the offending Siberian tiger, and pronounced it 'not wicked'. But how could the world's most powerful terrestrial carnivore be wicked if, frustrated by incarceration, it occasionally wanted a dietary change? The public reproaches heaped on this animal would not have been applauded by the deceased keeper; he had made a pact that the animal should not be punished if he were mauled. We have a contradictory attitude to wildness in animals. We crave to see it, touch it, but we simultaneously veer in the direction of sanitising it. So people increasingly keep dangerous animals such as cross-bred wolf-husky dogs as pets and then are surprised when, as happened recently, one attacks its owner's child. What we want on the fireside rug is a reminder of the animals we are banishing at an alarming rate from the great outside. Britain is one of the world's most urban societies, and its inhabitants are also great lovers of animals. This is no accident. People feel the need to reconnect with the unpredictable, mysterious, non-neurotic world of nature and wildlife. This repressed nostalgia for wild environments has surfaced conspicuously in the cries for a restored Great Caledonian Forest in the Cairngorms. Enthusiasts talk wildly about bears, wolves, even genetically-recreated aurochs, or aboriginal cattle, which will roam together. The forest will be shady, capercallies gliding between the great pines; humans will play a part as mushroom-gatherers harvesting the fruits of the forest floor. The appeal of this lost world moves modern man who has to make do with the cat on the mat. But alienation from real processes in the animal world is almost complete. Gross overstocking of Canada geese in the London parks produced a communal wringing of hands, but confusion about a sensible culling policy. Shooting the surplus birds, which were making mud-pie of the lakesides, was held to be cruel, even though dispatch by a rifle shot is far kinder than the fate which awaits most animals in the wild. Similarly, public anxiety about the rate at which native British red squirrels were being displaced by 'foreign' grey squirrels led to an effective system of trapping the greys. But now people are worrying about what happens to the unfortunate grey squirrels that fall into the traps. They are killed of course. What else? Culling deer in public parks was highly unpopular until supernumerary browsers started grazing on people's garden shrubs. Our society tries to eliminate cruelty but, through lack of understanding, creates more. Cruelty to animals is the prolongation of pain, not the swift taking of life. A hue and cry arose recently about the transport of farm animals to overseas slaughterhouses. Yet the closure of hundreds of abattoirs in Britain because of trivial hygiene failures and over-zealous EC sanitation rules has increased the transport of farm animals. At the same time on-farm slaughter, unless performed by an expensive vet, has been outlawed. Traditionally, farmers killed their own livestock for eating. The sheep was led into the barn, and its nose got deep into the corn before the farmer, who may have assisted in its birth as a lamb, approached with the stun-gun and killed it instantly. Now, by EC law, a sheep must be herded into a truck, driven perhaps 100 miles to a slaughterhouse, pushed down the ramp into the odour of blood and death, and fixed on to some ghastly assembly-line for the final meeting with powerful electric nodes. In the name of welfare, we have legislated for something far worse, which costs more. The call of the wild is in us all. The hunter-gatherer instinct is also a strong one. On Brittany's summer shore at low tide hundreds of people pick, rake, and probe for things to put in the bouillabaisse. The whole family goes. It is neither unecological nor unsustainable. The scene was the same hundreds of years ago. The idea that to pull a whelk from its rock is cruel would be regarded in France with incredulity. Such a perversion of values could happen only in Britain. The nation of great animal lovers no longer dares to reason against its sentimentality.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: R Westgarth 'better than satisfactory' In 1991 Richardsons Westgarth, the steel stockholding and processing group, saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 1.76m, but described the result as 'better than satisfactory'. Indeed, in the light of the above, the 11 per cent increase in turnover (which indicated that in terms of tonnage sold the group lifted its share in a competitive market) and the strong balance sheet, directors recommended raising the final dividend to 1.7p (1.55p) for a total of 2.9p (2.75p). Group turnover amounted to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 40.8m). Tax took an abnormally low Pounds 234,000 (Pounds 602,000) after a Pounds 340,000 credit in respect of advance corporation tax already written off. Consequently earnings only slipped to 5.88p (6.19p) per share.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: German metal groups decline MANNESMANN and Metallgesellschaft, two leading German diversified engineering and metals groups, yesterday reported a fall in earnings reflecting a slowdown in world economic growth and weakness in some key markets. Both companies, among the most acquisitive on the German business scene during the last few years, have been preparing shareholders for a downturn in profits as a result of worsening trading conditions in recent months. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at Metallgesellschaft, which has activities in metals, engineering and chemicals, told shareholders at the annual meeting that group pre-tax earnings fell 28 per cent in the first half of the year ending September 30. He said the company did not expect 'to meet its profit targets fully'. Mr Schimmelbusch, who has pioneered a move by Metallgesellschaft into the environmental technology field, told the meeting that the international growth slowdown, lower raw material prices, and the fall in the dollar were all factors behind the profits fall. Mannesmann, which has a stake in Britain's TI group, reported 1990 group net profits of DM464m (Dollars 269.7), down from DM505m in 1989. This represented a lower figure than indicated in February, when the company expected to match 1989 results. Mannesmann said it was proposing a DM9 dividend for 1990, unchanged from the 1989 payout made up of a DM8 dividend with a DM1 bonus. Operating profits last year fell slightly to DM1bn from DM1.05bn in 1989. Mannesmann parent company net profits rose to DM355m from DM287m.</p>

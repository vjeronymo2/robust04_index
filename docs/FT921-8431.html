			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Italy sees need for an exports revival - Competitive pressures biting even in areas of traditional strength THE revival of Italy's fortunes as a leading exporter has become a matter of urgency. This has been underlined by a two-day conference on the country's foreign trade, organised by the trade ministry and the Institute for Foreign Trade last week. The conference and its accompanying papers portrayed a picture of declining competitiveness against a background of growing international competition in those sectors where Italy had been traditionally strong, such as footwear, machine tools and textiles. It also emphasised the significance of export earnings in an economy lacking in natural resources and heavily dependent on imported energy. This is particularly so at a time when the balance of payments is deteriorating because of lower tourist earnings, greater spending by Italians abroad, fewer emigrant remittances, high-technology payments, the increasing cost of foreign debt and a hunger for imports. This week provisional balance of payments figures for 1991 were released showing a swing from a L 15,156bn (Pounds 7bn) surplus to a L 8,571bn deficit in a year. This has meant that it is no longer enough for Italy, with a traditional trade deficit, to maintain its share of world trade. That share has even increased over the last decade from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent, although there has been a shift in trade volumes from developing countries, notably the oil producers, to the EC and other leading industrialised nations. The EC now absorbs 58 per cent of exports and Italy has done well in boosting its share of the German market. By contrast, Italy's penetration of the North American market has remained stationary and little advantage has been taken of the Asian newly-industrialised countries. The most disturbing trend has been a decline in the balance of trade in manufactured goods. From a high of L 26,195bn in 1986 the balance has now dropped to L 18,573bn. Conference papers argued the trend had begun in the early eighties but was concealed at first by relatively cheap raw material prices, especially energy. This has been combined with a pattern of export growth in the late eighties which has been consistently behind the increases in the export markets where Italian companies are trying to sell. There was little disagreement at the conference over where Italy's problems lay. These could be summed up as follows: Italy had lost its long-held comparative price advantage through rises in wage, social security and general production costs in the eighties. Small labour-intensive companies, the backbone of the country's export performance, had concentrated on consumer sectors where the newly-industrialised countries in Asia, of late in Latin America and more recently in eastern Europe had begun to compete. Small scale family-run businesses which constituted the bulk of Italian industry were ill-equipped to confront the internationalisation in the global economy where there was increasing need for sustained sophisticated marketing and after sales service. The large companies, both public and private, had failed to invest sufficiently abroad in joint ventures and concentrated too much production domestically. Faced with increased competition abroad, exporters had reverted to the continued relative protection of the domestic market and were now suffering from recession. Small companies had traditionally financed ex-ports out of cash flow and at a time of recession and high interests lacked export finance which anyway favoured large companies. Too much export finance had been politically motivated to favour government-to-government deals in areas of high risk. Insufficient attention had been paid to moving out of mature sectors and into more profitable high-technology areas such as information technology. The fear of Japanese competition had led Italian industry to turn its back on Japanese investment and the lessons to be learned from Japan's economic strength. As a result Italy was now importing Japanese goods produced in other EC countries. The conference was less coherent in providing strategies for the future. There was general agreement that Italian companies had to become more international in outlook, creating more overseas joint ventures and investment. This in turn would entail improved financial back-up from the banking system and greater concentration among small companies either in the form of co-operative ventures or through mergers. If Italy was still to compete in such sectors as clothing, footwear and textiles, companies had to do so on the basis of quality, innovation and technology rather than price. Behind all this lay two broader and incomplete debates. The first was whether the Italian government, like the French, should earmark and actively promote new strategic sectors. With a large public sector and the state heavily involved in two thirds of the most technologically advanced companies, there is a clear temptation to pursue the French path. However, with a huge public sector deficit this course risks conflicting with the declared need to accelerate privatisation. This touched on the second element of incomplete debate - the relationship between the public and private sector in Italy and the role played by politics in economic decision-making. And with an election pending in April, it is unlikely that this controversial issue will be clarified until later in the year, if then.</p>

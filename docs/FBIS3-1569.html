Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao,  Rong Yiren, and other leading comrades, as well as more than 200  prominent figures from Beijing's intellectual circles, joyfully  gathered at the Eastern Main Hall to celebrate the jubilant  occasion.    The Eastern Main Hall was graced by red lanterns, was  permeated with the fragrance of narcissus, and was filled with a  jubilant atmosphere. Jiang Zemin, other comrades, and prominent  figures from the capital's literary, art, science and  technology, education, theoretical, and journalistic circles --  who were seated around round tables -- exchanged Spring Festival  greetings while enjoying fine tea and chatting cheerfully.    Amid the smiling faces, Hu Jintao stepped up to the podium  and, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended his  festival greetings and cordial regards to the comrades and  friends in the hall and to comrades and friends of the country's  intellectual circles. He thanked everyone for making  outstanding contributions to the country's reform, opening up,  and socialist modernization.    Hu Jintao said that he hoped everyone, under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, would  further unite and work even harder to take a new step forward,  score new achievements, and make new contributions to the  development of socialist literature, arts, sciences, technology,  education, theories, and journalism. He expressed his hope that  the great motherland will become more dynamic and prosperous,  wealthier, and stronger.    The soiree was preceded by the song "The Moon of the 15th of  the Month." Artists attending the soiree performed vocal solos,  instrumental solos, instrumental ensembles, Beijing opera songs,  vocal duets, and a magic show, winning sustained applause.    Jiang Zemin and other comrades, while viewing the  performances, chatted with scientists, educators, and artists at  their respective tables, and cordially inquired about their work  and lives. While listening to the pipa [Chinese musical  instrument] solo "The Lantern and the Moon Shine on Each Other,"  Jiang Zemin said, "The pipa is our national art; we should  promote our national arts." While the "Song of the Guerrillas"  was being played, Jiang Zemin said, "This is an immortal work."    The one hour, 40-minute soiree ended amid the song "Singing  the Motherland." Hu Jintao wished everyone a happy Spring  Festival, good health, family happiness, and a successful career.    Leading comrades also attending the soiree, included Li  Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wen Jiabao, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Guangying,  Buhe, Song Jian, Luo Gan, Wang Zhaoguo, Zhao Puchu, Hu Sheng,  and Qian Zhengying.</p>

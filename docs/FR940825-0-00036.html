			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This commenter also suggests a different approach to the solution of the problem, one consisting of developing a service bulletin that recommends the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of inspection openings over a certain period of time, say five years, after opening and recovering a wing. The commenter notes that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many older aircraft with larger surfaces with fewer inspection openings than that which would be required by this AD. The FAA does not concur. The Univair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aircraft Corporation considered an extended time allowance after recovering the wing for installing inspection openings, but decided against it because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are two many variables in establishing a fleetwide implementation program. One must account for other factors to determine the appropriate time period to start an inspection program, including age and condition of the structure at the time of recover, operational and environmental conditions that the aircraft is subjected to, and the possible damage to the wing panels caused by the intrusion of insects or rodents. All of these factors led the FAA to implement the inspection opening installation requirements in conjunction with a one-time inspection as proposed by the service bulletin in order to assure that the wing panels are airworthy from a corrosion standpoint upon completion of this AD. The installation openings provide a means for continuing routine inspections in the future. While older airplanes with larger wing surfaces may have fewer inspection openings than that which is specified in this AD, the FAA looked at the unique structural configuration of the wing panels for the affected airplane models in approving the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate holder's findings on the number and placement of the openings. The AD is unchanged as a result of the above comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Univair Aircraft Corporation has revised SB No. 29 to the Revision A level. This revision specifies a different screw used to secure the cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plate on airplanes with metal skinned wings. The FAA has determined that Univair SB No. 29, Revision A, dated June 7, 1994, should be incorporated into the final rule. Airplane owners/operators that have complied with the original version of this service bulletin will not have to re-accomplish these actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the incorporation of the referenced service bulletin revision and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that the service bulletin change and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance time for this AD is in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance is the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described by this AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that corrosion is detected and corrected on all affected airplanes within a reasonable period of time without inadvertently grounding any airplane, a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead of hours TIS is utilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

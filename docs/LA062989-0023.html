			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> The palimony trial of actor William Hurt came to an end Tuesday with testimony  from his former wife who said he once told her he was "finished with marriage."  Mary Beth Hurt's remarks on the closing day of the non-jury trial backed up  earlier statements by her ex-husband who claimed he never planned to wed again  after the couple's 11-year marriage ended in divorce in December, 1982. Hurt is  being sued for palimony in state Supreme Court in Manhattan by Sandra Jennings,  his former girlfriend and the mother of their 6-year-old son, Alexander.  Administrative Judge Jacqueline Silbermann, who heard the six-day trial without  a jury, now will rule on the case after lawyers submit written summations.  Jennings is trying to prove she and Hurt had a common-law marriage when they  lived briefly together in South Carolina and is seeking half of Hurt's  estimated $10 million. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Airline bars foie gras - Travel Update First-class passengers on a Canadian airline will have to live with lobster and filet mignon now that pate de foie gras is being dropped from the menu, an animal rights group said. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a Washington-based organisation, said Air Canada had confirmed that it planned to stop serving the expensive pate in May. To produce the French delicacy, ducks and geese are force-fed so their livers expand to several times their normal size, PETA said. 'Many birds die in the process as their internal organs fuse together or explode from the crude feeding procedure.' English actor Sir John Gielgud has lent his name to the fight against the pate. The animal group has asked airlines around the world to halt foie gras service, and Air Canada is the first to act.</p>

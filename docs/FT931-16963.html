			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: A Guinness for Pounds 339 - Different times, same names. Jane Fuller on 1893's stock market KIDNAPPED by time bandits and transported back 100 years, an FT reader would at least find a little comfort and some reminders of home in the pages of the newspaper. Familiar names such as Lloyds Bank, Guinness, Coats and Vickers were listed companies, although they and their sectors tended to be buried by information about the money, foreign, rails and mining markets. In some ways, the FT turned pink in a calm news period. Caution reigned after such alarms as the near demise of Barings merchant bank; the bursting of foreign mining bubbles; and the premature excitement over electricity which led to another collapse. Even the good news was less exciting than in the late 1880s when several brewers took heart from the debut of Guinness and came to the market to raise money to build and buy public houses. 'It was very expensive to build a gin palace in those days,' according to one market analyst. Guinness, it should be noted, was an exception as its expansion was already linked to the worldwide distribution of its brand - lubricated by the demand of Irish emigrees. Then, as now, a cautious mood among investors was good news for some sectors: 'The public has preferred sound stocks to speculative or gambling counters.' Not surprisingly it was a good year for gilts or 'consols'. After some year-end profit-taking, they ended close to their 12-month high. Home rails had settled down as nice little yielders and stock prices had shown stability, if not excitement. Several of the banks offered a very good return. As the table shows, dividend rates were running at 9 to 20 per cent. Investors were benefiting indirectly from industrial expansion, which had so far been funded largely without recourse to the stock market. The role played by the stock market in funding British industrial growth has provoked some debate among scholars, providing an academic equivalent of current arguments about the relationship between the City and industry. The paucity of quoted industrial stocks is taken by some as evidence of laggardliness on the part of the City. But later in the 1890s and early 1900s, there was a wave of corporate activity. One aspect was a number of mega-mergers. Another was company flotations. But before that, the market was to be awoken from its deep sleep by a more familiar round of speculation: gold mining in South Africa.</p>

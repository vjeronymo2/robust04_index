			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Cost of spying 9% less than expected The government yesterday revealed for the first time the full cost and extent of Britain's secret world of spies and electronic eavesdropping. The news was unexpectedly good for taxpayers, who will pay about 9 per cent less than anticipated this year, and bad for the spooks, whose numbers are falling fast as a result of the end of the cold war. For decades, governments have refused to reveal the cost and extent of MI5, the domestic intelligence service, MI6, the secret intelligence service, and GCHQ, the radio and telephone monitoring complex at Cheltenham. The figures see the light of day for the first time in Downing Street's estimates, tabled in the Commons, of the cost of running the Cabinet Office, the Privy Council and parliament in 1994-95. The estimates show that the staff of the three services is forecast to fall from 10,766 at the end of the 1993-94 financial year to 10,516 at the end of 1994-95, at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in superannuation payments. In spite of the fall in numbers, the services' running costs will rise from Pounds 430m to Pounds 450m - a 4.5 per cent increase, which is comfortably in excess of the pay freeze imposed by the government on most other public servants. Nevertheless, the overall cost of spying is forecast to fall from Pounds 975m to Pounds 881m, mainly as a result of a fall in the cost of supplying MI5 and MI6 with new offices. The main saving will on Thames House, the palatial London building being converted into MI5's headquarters, which is now expected to cost Pounds 245m instead of Pounds 266m. Embarrassingly, the intelligence services seem to have got their sums wrong: the estimates reveal that the original estimate was 'inflated due to the use of incorrect deflators'. MI6 is costing less than expected too. Work on its London headquarters at Vauxhall Cross will cost Pounds 84m instead of Pounds 93m because of a fall in construction prices. In a written parliamentary answer accompanying the estimates, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said costs were expected to fall by a further 5 per cent in 1996/97. The release of the estimates fulfils a promise given by Mr Major in November that the costs of running the three intelligence services would be brought under the Cabinet Office. Until yesterday, the costs were split between the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, and the Cabinet Office, which kept its share of the cost a secret. The decision to publish is in line with the government's commitment to reduce secrecy after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the lessening of tension throughout Europe. However, the spooks have not entirely discarded the cloak of darkness. The estimates warn that projects have been excluded 'where revealing the nature and scale of expenditure could prejudice national security, inhibit the operational effectiveness of the relevant service, or prejudice the safety of staff'.</p>

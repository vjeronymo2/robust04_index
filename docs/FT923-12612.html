			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Executive ousted from TV network MR Francis Baron, chief executive of the European Television Networks (ETN), the former satellite television division of WH Smith, has been ousted from his job. Mr Baron had been responsible since 1984 for WH Smith's foray into television until last year, when the cable and satellite channels were sold to Capital Cities/ABC of the US, and Canal Plus and Compagnie Generale des Eaux. There have been disagreements about the direction of the company, with important decisions being delayed. It is believed that Mr Baron called a shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to try to resolve the deadlock. One issue is likely to have been Mr Baron's fight to win equal access to television sporting rights. There was also a difference of approach on strategy. Mr Baron has pioneered the creation of a pan-European network of sports channels. Canal Plus, the subscription television channel, has tended to expand by setting up separate ventures in individual nations. Mr Richard Spinner, an executive of Capital Cities/ABC, and senior vice-president and managing director of CC/ABC's European operations, has taken over as chief executive of ETN.</p>

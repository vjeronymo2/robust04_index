			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for BAe Continued fears that British Aerospace may announce provisions of around Pounds 200m with its next set of results, due to problems at its turbo props division, once again made it the day's worst performer in FT-SE 100 Index. Sentiment was also weakened by switching from BAe into Rolls-Royce. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite, a long time bull, denied that he had turned a seller of BAe, which yesterday tumbled 23 to 391p. Late reports suggested that India had signed a long- awaited Dollars 1.9bn order for 66 of BAe's Hawk aircraft, but there was no confirmation.</p>

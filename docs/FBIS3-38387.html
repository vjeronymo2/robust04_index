			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jyri Raivio: "Finland and the EU Reached </F> Agreement on Approach to Agriculture--Permanent Support  Negotiated First, Details Still Open"]    [Text] Finland's foreign minister, Pertti Salolainen  (Conservative Party), has reached an agreement with the EU  [European Union] on the approach to be taken regarding Finnish  agriculture, which is the most complicated issue to be solved  during the negotiations.    During his visit to Brussels on Monday [10 January],  Salolainen met with, among others, Hans van den Broek, who is  the EU Commission member in charge of membership negotiations.  During the ensuing discussions, it was agreed that the first  issue to be resolved would be the question of the permanent  support Finland could receive, either from the EU or from its  own appropriations. After the issue of permanent support has  been resolved, a study will be conducted on how the solution  reached will affect the Finnish food-processing industry. After  that, attention will be focused on negotiations regarding  transition periods, special arrangements in connection with such  periods, and product quotas.    This sequence of events deviates from that which the EU  Commission expressed as its view on agriculture, which caused  quite a stir in Finland. According to Finland's negotiator on  agricultural issues, Esa Harmala, who accompanied Salolainen on  his visit with van den Broek, the most central issue emerging  from the commission's documents is not permanent support but the  manner in which Finnish producer prices should reach EU producer  price levels. In Harmala's view, this kind of progression has  been "confusing." But the decision was made to first negotiate  about permanent support, which, in Finland, could be paid due to  unfavorable conditions or environmental factors. Salolainen  referred to the consensus reached in this matter as "some kind  of a breakthrough." However, he emphasized that agreeing on the  marching order does not indicate agreement on the actual issues  at hand.    As far as these are concerned, it appears that they must be  resolved using Salolainen's "crisis scenario," or, in other  words, by working late into the night, racing against the  deadline. Salolainen's visit to Brussels was not only due to the  membership negotiations, but he was also there as the new  chairman for EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which is  the other party in the European Economic Area, EEA. The  discussions were focused, however, on the membership issue,  regarding which Salolainen also talked with Sir Leon Brittan,  who is the EU commissioner in charge of foreign economic ties,  and with the ambassador, Alexandros Saphiriou, of the new  chairmanship country, Greece.</p>

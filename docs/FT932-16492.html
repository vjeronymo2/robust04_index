			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Bank of Japan chief predicts a slow recovery THE Japanese economy is unlikely to recover until late this year, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, told regional branch managers gathered yesterday to discuss a recent strengthening of some economic indicators and the unexpected surge in stock prices. Mr Mieno's comments came as the bank intervened in the Tokyo foreign exchange market to halt the yen's sudden rise, which business groups have warned may threaten economic recovery by putting extra pressure on vulnerable export industries such as the electronics and car sectors. A continuing weakness in capital spending in manufacturing industry was reflected in a 26.2 per cent fall in orders of machine tools during February, including a 36.2 per cent year-on-year plunge in orders from car makers. The Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association said exports for the month were down 5.7 per cent. Japanese companies are being forced to reduce capital spending as many industries are still attempting to trim excess production capacity. Pointing to this trend and to weak consumer demand, Mr Mieno said final demand is unlikely to recover until the second half of the fiscal year which began this month. He suggested that recent optimistic reports by private sector economists are premature, as there is no certainty that a small increase in domestic car sales and industrial production will be sustainable in coming months. The regional branch managers have apparently brought generally gloomy economic news with them to Tokyo, as private construction orders have fallen sharply, putting added importance on a government economic package to be finalised this month. Concerned by fluctuations in the yen, the Bank of Japan intervened when the Japanese currency hit a high of Y113.30 to the dollar during trading in Tokyo yesterday - it closed at Y113.83. The bank was repeating its attempt of Friday to blunt the rapid rise in the yen over the past two weeks. Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have suggested that finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will discuss the currency markets at a meeting in Tokyo on April 14.</p>

(1) The Administrator does not approve the test procedures for establishing the evaporative and/or refueling emission deterioration factors for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer shall submit the procedures as required in &sect;86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) prior to the Administrator's selection of the test fleet under &sect;86.098&hyph;24(b) (1), and if such procedures will involve testing of durability data vehicles selected by the Administrator or elected by the manufacturer under &sect;86.098&hyph;24(c)(1), prior to initiation of such testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(2) through (g) [Reserved].

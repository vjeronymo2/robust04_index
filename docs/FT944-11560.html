			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unions say GEC will keep shipyards open Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has pledged that if his bid for VSEL succeeds, both GEC's Yarrow and VSEL's Barrow-in-Furness shipyards would be kept open, according to one of the officials formulating the trades unions' stance on the rival bids. The undertaking was made by Lord Weinstock at a meeting with union officials on Thursday evening. Mr Duncan Lapish, national secretary of the white-collar Apex section of the General Municipal Boilermakers Union, said Lord Weinstock also said that a successful GEC bid would safeguard jobs at its electronics systems producer Marconi. Mr Lapish said he did not doubt Lord Weinstock's undertaking that the Barrow and Yarrow yards and Marconi would remain in operation if his bid won. 'I have no reason to doubt his sincerity on that; Lord Weinstock usually means what he says.' However, Mr Lapish added: 'He said all these three would be safe but he didn't say at what size.' Thursday's meeting, about which GEC yesterday declined to comment, was between Lord Weinstock and the GEC National Joint Consultative Council, composed of national officers of unions with members employed by GEC. It was the first of a series of meetings at which the unions are gathering information on the strategies behind GEC's and BAe's rival bids for VSEL. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions will then decide whether it has a preference between the two, and whether to press for Monopolies and Mergers Commission intervention. CSEU officials are to meet BAe executives on Tuesday to probe their plans. The unions also hope to meet VSEL management soon. Mr Lapish said they wanted to know why VSEL had not wished to fight to remain independent. The manoeuvring to take over VSEL, against a background of shrinking defence orders, has provoked anxiety among VSEL's 6,000 employees at Barrow in West Cumbria and GEC's 3,000 at Yarrow on the Clyde. Before GEC confirmed it was bidding for VSEL, Barrow union leaders had made their hostility to GEC plain to VSEL management. The Barrow officials are awaiting a meeting with GEC.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK promises to aid Kurds BRITAIN promised continued support and protection to the Iraqi Kurds yesterday when Mr John Major, the prime minister, received one of the two main Kurdish leaders at 10, Downing Street. Mr Massoud Barzani had two main requests on behalf of his people, who currently enjoy de facto autonomy (thanks to the withdrawal of Iraqi government forces from the area after last April's intervention by US, British, French and Dutch troops and aircraft) but are being denied all supplies from the government-held area. One was for economic development aid, to enable them to rebuild their infrastructure and escape dependence on emergency relief. The other was for an assurance of continued military protection (from allied aircraft across the border in Turkey) until a political solution could be reached. The current agreement under which allied forces are stationed in south-eastern Turkey expires at the end of June.</p>

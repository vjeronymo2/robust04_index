Parliament has finally decided to turn the "hare"  [Belarusian  currency unit] into a lion, in other words to designate the  Belorusian ruble as the only means of payment on the Republic's  territory until the actual unification of the monetary systems.  But Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich upset the applecart the day  before by initialing a draft decree establishing new status for  the settlement notes [raschetnyy bilet] of the National Bank of  Belorusia. Journalists were asked to leave the Supreme Soviet  hall before the latest decisive speech by the head of the  government. Nevertheless, IZVESTIYA has acquired a transcript  of Vyacheslav Kebich's speech.    The prime minister started by saying that he had accused  Kovalin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, and  Kazmin, Russian deputy minister of finance, of attempting to  wreck the unification. According to Kebich, they have made  amendments to the documents which had been coordinated by  experts and distorted their meaning. As a result, fundamental  differences have appeared in the sides' positions on the  following questions: the rate of exchange of Belorusian cash  rubles for Russian rubles, the equalization of the price of  deliveries of output between subjects of economic activity, the  unification of the budgets, and the status of the National Bank  of Belorusia. According to the head of the Belorusian  Government, the first two differences can be resolved easily,  but the political aspects (that is specifically how the  proposals on the single budget and the abolition of the National  Bank of Belorusia are viewed) are unacceptable to the Republic.  Despite this, Kebich stated with characteristic optimism that  the monetary union would be signed in the near future, by 1  April to be precise.    It is interesting that the Russian parliament provides the  main hopes for the Belorusian supporters of the unification.  The prime minister, who spoke very warmly about it, literally  stated the following: "Sittings of all factions of the State  Duma are being held now, at this very moment, about immediately  signing this treaty." And he went on to say: "The unification  must be signed and a president elected, otherwise the people  will simply not understand what we are doing." The reference to  popular opinion sounds fairly amusing from the lips of the prime  minister, since nowadays it is no secret to anyone that he has a  personal interest in this game. Kebich is calculating that the  first positive results of the unification will enable him to  occupy the presidential post. And if he is not making a show of  this in public, then he expressed himself fairly definitely at  the closed sitting.    While the prime minister was persuading Belorusian  parliamentarians that the monetary systems should be unified,  the Russians were being persuaded by a delegation of the  procommunist People's Movement of Belorusia. The actual fact of  its trip to Moscow cannot fail to cause surprise: On what  grounds is a sociopolitical organization conducting talks with  the supreme legislative organ of another country? Inasmuch as  no one has officially authorized the Belorusian Communists to  carry out this action, it is logical to assume that the trip  took place thanks to close ties at party level.    The results of this visit, as well as the arrival of  Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Finance  Committee, and the unequivocal support he expressed for the  agreement on the unification of the monetary systems has  strengthened the Belorusian Government, which had been on the  point of becoming dispirited.    Meanwhile, another view of the problem exists outside of the  government. Leonid Kozik, chairman of the Belorusian Supreme  Soviet Commission for Economic Reform, told journalists that the  unification process will be drawn out over a fairly long period  of time. National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich  expressed himself even more definitely, calling on the  population to "stop waiting," because "this business would just  fizzle out."    Nevertheless, the Belorusian Government has the chance to  sign the agreement; but at what price? The answer to this  question was provided in the agreement on the amalgamation of  "Beltransgaz," the state enterprise for the transportation and  deliveries of gas, with Russia's "Gazprom" Joint-Stock  Association, which was submitted to the Supreme Soviet for  ratification. Under the agreement, the value of the property of  the Belorusian enterprise has been estimated at 1,000,217,000  rubles (that is approximately how much it now costs to build one  multiapartment housing block). According to independent experts'  estimates, "Beltransgaz" is worth at least $5 billion. Thus,  one of the political groupings intends to pay for its prosperity  with a state asset. Not only that, the government press is  already very actively discussing the idea of giving up  sovereignty.    One way or another, it is already clear that the stories  about the unification of the monetary systems, like the ones  about the friendly union of fraternal peoples which will give  rise to a land of milk and honey, are not well founded. The  reality is that it is each man for himself today, and if the  unification does nevertheless take place, there is no point in  expecting gifts from Russia. And the question of whether an  entrance fee proves its worth remains a big one.</p>

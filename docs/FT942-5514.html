			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / US jobs point to solid economic growth US economic expansion remains robust, but the pace of growth is not accelerating, official figures indicated yesterday. The Labour Department said the jobless rate fell to 6.0 per cent last month from 6.4 per cent in April, a much steeper decline than financial markets expected. Officials said this probably overstated the strength of the economy, partly because of recent changes in the way unem-ployment data are collected. Figures for payroll employment - based on a different and generally more reliable series - pointed to a slight deceleration in economic growth. Non-farm employment rose by 191,000 to 112.8m in May, considerably weaker than the consensus projection of an increase of about 285,000. The increase would have been only 120,000 but for an artificial boost caused by the return of striking members of the Teamsters' union. Job creation in May was sharply lower than in March and April, when payrolls increased by a revised 379,000 and 358,000 respectively. Jobs gains last month were overwhelmingly concentrated in service industries. Manufacturing employment fell slightly and construction employment expanded only modestly after impressive gains in March and April. Ms Katharine Abraham, a senior Labour Department official, said the labour market had improved last month but warned that the scale of the jobless decline might be misleading. 'Whenever unusually large movements occur in a single month, the magnitude of those changes often turns out to have been overstated once additional data become available,' she said. On a longer view, the figures confirm the strength of US economic expansion. Roughly 1.2m jobs have been created since January, a faster pace than last year, when the economy grew by 3 per cent. Many economists believe the jobless rate is now close to the level historically associated with upward pressure on wage and price inflation.</p>

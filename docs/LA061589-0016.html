			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: TORTUOUS JOURNEY TO A MAGIC KINGDOM  </P> <P> I went to Walt Disney World the other day. What impressed me the most was the  fun the parents were having taking their children there for a once-in-lifetime  thrill.  </P> <P> I watched the beginning of the trip as I sat in the terminal waiting for the  plane to depart for Orlando.  </P> <P> A mother was yelling at her 4-year-old son, "If you hit your sister once more,  I am going to check you in at the baggage counter."  </P> <P> To my left a father was shaking his boy. "Didn't I tell you to stay in your  seat? I think I'll take you home right now."  </P> <P> Obviously the child knew it was an empty threat because so much money had been  invested in the trip already. So he sat on the floor.  </P> <P> We boarded the plane. I counted 2.5 children for every adult. Two kids were  hanging over my seat. One had a kazoo, the other a magic wand. The parents were  unconcerned about what their offspring were doing to the other passengers.  Their only worry was that the children would find the chocolate chip cookies  stored in the hand luggage.  </P> <P> The father said, "If you touch that bag I'm going to tell Mickey Mouse what a  rotten kid you really are."  </P> <P> That did it. The tears spilled all over me. It's tough, I thought, to go to  Disney World with the threat that you will be ignored by Mickey Mouse.  </P> <P> As the plane flew on, I thought about all the love and planning that father had  spent on this family excursion, only to have it climaxed by his decision to  bad-mouth his kid to every Walt Disney character in the book.  </P> <P> Down the aisle came a 7-year-old, returning from the bathroom. He didn't seem  to be in a hurry, so his mother shouted, "Get back here this instant, or you  won't see the Magic Mountain until you are 80."  </P> <P> He weighed this statement very carefully, and then it seemed to him that it was  just another example of his mother losing complete control of herself, as she  did every time they got on an airplane.  </P> <P> At that moment a small girl ran down the middle of the plane, sucking her thumb  and dragging a wooden duck. The father was chasing her. "For that you get no  cotton candy, and you can't have your picture taken with the Seven Dwarfs."  </P> <P> I thought to myself, "I can see what attraction Disney World holds for parents,  but I just don't understand what's in it for the kids. The whole trip is one  giant threat."  </P> <P> At the hotel, the scenario was repeated. One 5-year-old child was warned that  if he didn't straighten up and fly right, he would be chewed up by the  porpoises at Sea World. Another was informed that he was going to spend the  entire trip locked in his hotel room with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  </P> <P> A third, who lay on his stomach by the bell captain's desk, was told by his  mother that all his souvenirs would be confiscated by the hotel manager and  thrown into the parking lot.  </P> <P> Not since Dostoevsky had I witnessed so much crime and punishment as I did on  the way to Disney World. It seemed as though all the children were ruining the  wonderful trip their parents had prepared exclusively for them.  </P> <P> The plane ride back was another story. The adults were too exhausted to  threaten anybody. They had yelled at their kids for four days and now they were  so hoarse that they couldn't speak.  </P> <P> The children were marching up and down the aisles wearing their Mickey Mouse  hats and holding Donald Duck quackers in their mouths. Occasionally, a parent  would raise a hand weakly and try to say something, but the words wouldn't come  out. Many who had vowed dire punishment on the way down didn't even have the  strength to fasten their seat belts.  </P></p>

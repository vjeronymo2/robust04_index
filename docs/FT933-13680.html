			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Brazil bounces back - At a glance Brazil was the best-performing emerging market in Latin America in the second quarter, according to the quarterly monitor of emerging markets from Fund Research. The market rose 24.8 per cent in US dollar terms in the three months to July 1, and has risen 49.1 per cent in the year to date. The strong performance in spite of high inflation is attributed to political stabilisation and signs of economic recovery. In Europe, Turkey dominated emerging markets, rising 58.7 per cent in the second quarter. Global emerging market funds ran a close second to Asian funds in the last quarter, outstripping Latin America and Europe by a considerable margin, Fund Research says.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Buccaneers, but not pirates Sir, The emotive language of your article, 'Boards of utilities likened to pirates' (August 25) calls for an immediate response. Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, chairman of TR High Income Trust, casts a wide net when describing directors of all water companies as giving themselves huge increases in pay and pillaging their companies. Let me set the record straight so far as Southern Water - a company in which TR High Income Trust wisely seeks to invest - is concerned. The majority of Southern Water's directors were recruited from the private sector. The prospectus for the sale of our shares in 1989 clearly stated that directors' salaries would be brought up to levels commensurate with those in the private sector. Some five years on, our advice from independent consultants is that these levels are still to be achieved. We do not just control a monopoly. We operate a water business within a highly complex regulatory framework and remain accountable to a myriad price, quality and environmental regulators. We are responsible for managing a capital investment programme of some Pounds 2bn to bring up to the latest UK and EU standards our Victorian infrastructure legacy which, until recently, was neglected by politicians of all complexions. At the same time, we have formed or acquired some 20 trading companies which are exposed to the full rigours of competition in the market place. Through these successful businesses we have, each year, added value for our shareholders and created employment during a period of recession. Fifty per cent of our total board costs are met by these non-regulated businesses. Buccaneers we may be in developing new businesses, but pirating our core business - never. W J W Courtney, chairman, Southern Water, Southern House, Yeoman Road, Worthing, W Sussex BN13 3NX</p>

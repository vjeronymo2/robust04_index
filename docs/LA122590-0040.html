			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Norville News: Ready for more upheaval on the "Today" show? The talk around NBC  News these days is that "Today's" national correspondent, Katie Couric, will  take over as the show's co-host when Deborah Norville goes on maternity leave  next spring.  </P> <P> "She's no substitute -- she's the successor," one NBC News source told TV  Guide. "Deborah's a bright woman but she doesn't come across that way on  camera. She comes across as plastic. Katie's real." For the record, Don Browne,  executive vice president of NBC News, denied that Norville is on the outs. BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

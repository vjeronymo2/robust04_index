			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charge helps Boosey &amp; Hawkes to Pounds 1.5m A fall in interest payments helped Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and music publisher, to report higher interim profits yesterday. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June were ahead at Pounds 1.5m, against Pounds 1.41m. At the operating level, however, profits eased from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.34m. Group turnover was 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 29.4m). Almost Pounds 2m of the increase was contributed by Karl Hofner, the German stringed instrument maker acquired for Pounds 390,000 last January. Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the increase in total turnover 'demonstrates that we are starting to recover from the effect of recession.' The flatness of the operating profits mainly reflected the lack of contribution from Hofner, exchange rates, and the effects of a change in royalties distribution. Group margins were still recovering, Mr Holland said. The company had been going for volume in order to keep its factories busy and reduce stocks. 'Now we will be going for margins,' he added. The instrument division, which accounts for almost 80 per cent of sales, saw strong growth in the US and some parts of Europe. But sales to Japan - about 20 per cent of the group's market - remained flat. The group is not expecting profits from Hofner to come on stream until next year. Stringed instrument making is being consolidated from three sites to one site in southern Germany. The publishing division, which includes Rakhmaninov, Britten and Stravinsky on its books, increased its market share. Royalties were flat, but are expected to improve in the second half. Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 21m to Pounds 20.3m, and would have been down a further Pounds 1.2m but for the Hofner acquisition. Interest payable fell from Pounds 999,000 to Pounds 839,000. Earnings per share rose from 3.7p to 4.16p. The interim dividend is raised to 1.32p (1.2p).</p>

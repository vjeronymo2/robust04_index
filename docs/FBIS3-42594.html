			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Komov, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management, by  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Gavrilyuk: "Land Can  Be Sold... if Roskomzem Permits It"; date and place not given]    [Text] At the end of last year, there occurred an  event which was remarkable, if not to say outstanding. We are  talking about the president's Edict "On a State Land Registry  and the Registration of Documents on the Rights To Own Real  Estate" and, following that, the government-issued Statute "On  the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the Sale of Land  Parcels and Other Land Transactions."    A land registry is the pride of any country. In the former  USSR, it arose over a long period of time and with difficulty  and its basis was the rated appraisal of the land's fertility.  Today, however, all these efforts have proven to be of little  use. Nikolay Komov, the chairman of Roskomzem [Russian  Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management],  expressed his opinion on this matter quite definitively: "The  state is the property and the property is the registry."    So, the former system could not ensure the rights of an  owner  to the land -- there was no actual owner. And if the leadership  demanded that a birch grove appear on the registry instead of a  clearly existing field, then the land managers did what was  desired, in any event, on paper.    I will not conceal the fact that it was strange to hear this  from the head of Russian land management. But it is precisely  such revalations which are giving rise to a certain optimism --  now, if the leadership were to demand that a ravine be called a  plain, the Russian Federation [RF] Committee on Land Resources  and Land Management, we would hope, would not permit this. And  1.7 million hectares of Russian land will be described and,  consequently, appraised accurately and impartially. The only  cause for concern is the fact that, now, the appraisal of the  land's fertility is going, as it were, on the back burner.    Meanwhile, the specialists' opinions on the matter of the  Statute "On the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the  Sale of Land Parcels and Other Land Transactions" have been  sharply divided.    For example, the experts from Minselkhoz [Ministry of  Agriculture] believe that a number of statutes, adopted  government decrees and ones currently in preparation on matters  involving the buying and selling of land substantially infringe  on the rights of citizens and lay a foundation for turning the  RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management into the  largest land speculator in the country. The document may  stimulate a surge of bribery and, in the final tally, discredit  the idea of a land market, in particular, because local land  committees, along with the functions of monitoring land use,  have received the right to buy land and to resell it. And the  mechanism for holding the competitions and auctions is also  adding problems. For example, "when there are buyers who have a  preferential right to purchase a land parcel," a closed auction  is held and only in the remaining instances can a seller sell a  parcel independently or at a public auction.    Since the document does not distinguish lands by categories,  this means that any transaction involving the sale of land,  including even a vacation parcel, will require authorization  from the organs of the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land  Management. The granted right to sell land, the Ministry of  Agriculture's experts conclude, is giving rise in Russia to "one  more area of corruption" and is curtailing the rights of  individual types of owners.    Such harsh assessments make it necessary to turn for a  commentary to the chairman of the RF Committee on Land Resources  and Land Management, Nikolay Komov.    [Gavrilyuk] The edict on the land registry and the  government  statute on the holding of competitions and auctions for the sale  of land parcels went into effect simultaneously. What kind of  connection is there between these documents?    [Komov] The president instructed the government to prepare,  in all, around 10 documents and it is impossible to consider any  of them separately. I would call all this a mechanism for the  implementation of the president's edict on the regulation of  land relations. And the government statute is, if it can be put  this way, just a fragment. It will not, for all practical  purposes, pertain to lands under agricultural cultivation.  Worthless land falls into its domain. Indeed, just as before:  the head of an administration decided to give someone a land  parcel -- and no one can prevent him from doing this, to build  for free a house or a cottage. Now, however, the land will be  shown off at auctions. They are already being prepared in the  Krasnogorsk, Odintsovsk and Podolsk rayons of Moscow Oblast.  Quite a bit of money will go into the treasury. Even now, in  some rayons, a plot of land with a cottage being built on it  costs several million rubles [R]. Just in Moscow, we are  receiving around R40 billion for the right to lease.    [Gavrilyuk] What is the special feature of the Edict "On a  State Land Registry and the Registration of Documents on the  Rights To Own Real Estate"?    [Komov] This is an historic document, first of all, because  now relations between a citizen, a legal person and lands will  be regulated by the Civil Code. It has already been prepared for  consideration in the State Duma. The land has been declared real  property and, likewise, everything located on it. Prior to the  emergence of this edict, land parcels were registered in the  land committees and structures in the housing and municipal  services organs and everything was broken up, which made it  impossible to determine the true value of the land parcel: some  got the land and others got the structures on it. Now both have  been declared real property and will be appraised together.    We will register not just the land, but also everything  which  has been built on it. For example, in Moscow, the amount of the  land tax is being raised by tens of factors. In the near future,  a presidential commission on real property matters will be  established.    [Gavrilyuk] And who will appraise this real property?    [Komov] We have two alternatives. First, a special agency  for  appraising both the land and the structures on it, that is, the  real property, will be established. Second, the currently  existing technical inventory bureaus will work for us under  contract or will transfer into the system of the RF Committee on  Land Resources and Land Management. Now, however, in many  territories, outright deception of the peasants is occurring,  since no one knows the true value of the land and it is being  purchased at times for next to nothing.    [Gavrilyuk] What will the appraisal mechanism be like?    [Komov] A person who wishes to find out the value of his  land  should turn to us, to the committee, where he will find out the  approximate value of the land and the approximate registry for  the entire country, but soon it will be precise.    The president has already approved a sample copy of a  certificate of the right to own land, there will be 80 million  of them and all the landowners will receive them in the first  half of 1994. Only this document gives the owner of the land  parcel the right to lease it out, to mortgage it, to exchange it  or to sell it.    And so, now, many kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock  companies are buying up from the pensioners their land shares.  But what can be bought up when their owners do not have the  document for the right to own these shares? Such transactions  will not be valid.    [Gavrilyuk] Yet, all the same, when will the Russian Land  Registry be ready?    [Komov] We are introducing it in 1994-1995, but the  registration process is very lengthy and, in essence, it is  constant.    [Gavrilyuk] Why is real property linked with the registry?    [Komov] Because not only in our country, but throughout the  entire world, no other mechanism has been devised: when land is  registered, everything on it is also appraised. And later,  supposedly, a data base will be created so we can know what is  on the land and under the land; otherwise, it will be absolutely  impossible to manage the entire infrastructure.    [Gavrilyuk] Let us return, however, to the statute on public  and closed auctions. What is the difference here?    [Komov] Whereas, with public auctions, everything is clear,  who is profiting and who is paying more, when closed auctions  are held, there are certain special features. To illustrate, I  will cite an example.    In Moscow, quite a few gasoline service stations are being  opened now. But look -- a third of them, if not half, are not  operating -- there is no gasoline. So now, in order to obtain  land to lease for that same gas station, the person wishing to  open it has to produce during a closed auction a quota,  certified in the Ministry of Economics, which certifies that the  gasoline service station will be supplied with gasoline, oil and  everything needed for normal operation.</p>

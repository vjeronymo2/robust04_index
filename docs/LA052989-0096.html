			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN EXPANSION ANNOUNCED  </P> <P> A $23-million Chapman College building expansion plan was announced Sunday  during commencement exercises at the pastoral campus in Orange.  </P> <P> George L. Argyros, chairman of Chapman's board of trustees, said three  multistory buildings have been approved: a student residence hall, an academic  hall and a campus center.  </P> <P> The first of the buildings planned is the campus center, at an estimated cost  of $8.5 million. It will have dining facilities for 1,200 resident students and  1,200 commuters, faculty and staff. That building might also house social and  meeting rooms -- mostly for students, he said.  </P> <P> Dr. James L. Doti, acting president of Chapman, said successful development of  faculty and of endowments in the past decade have built the foundation for the  expansion.  </P> <P> The college has secured $8.5 million in gifts and pledges and is hoping for $10  million more in this category, Doti said. He said the college is seeking an  additional $4.5 million from other sources.  </P></p>

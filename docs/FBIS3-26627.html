To safeguard the lives, security and  legitimate rights and privileges of staffers and workers in all  sorts of enterprises, the State Council recently adopted the  draft "Law on Labor," to be submitted to the National People's  Congress, and made explicit stipulations on establishing  workers' union organizations in foreign-funded enterprises. At  the same time, Guangdong Province, where there is the greatest  number of foreign-funded enterprises, is preparing to enact  specialized legislation to ensure the legitimate rights and  interests of workers and staffers in foreign-funded enterprises.    In the 150,000 foreign-funded enterprises -- whether  cooperative, joint venture, or solely foreign-owned -- the  capital-labor relations in most have been comparatively normal  and harmonious, but a small number of foreign-funded enterprises  lack safety installations and workers' welfare provisions, while  paying no attention to workers' safety; they arbitrarily prolong  working hours, are in arrears with or make deductions from  workers' wages, arbitrarily fire workers and staffers, and even  violate workers' personal rights and interests, including body  searches upon leaving the factory after a day's work. Workers  and staffers in related enterprises expressed their resentment  and protest through work slow-downs, strikes, visits to  supervising departments, or letters of complaint to the  authorities.    This being the case, labor disputes in foreign-funded  enterprises in various places have increased markedly in recent  years. According to incomplete statistics, there were 50 cases  of labor disputes in Xiamen's foreign-funded enterprises in  1991, and 460 such cases in 1993. There were some 250 work  stoppages in Shenzhen's foreign-funded enterprises in 1992, and  some 4,000 complaints lodged, involving scores of thousands of  workers and staffers; there were an even greater number of such  incidents last year. The Shanghai municipal labor arbitration  organization handled soem 70 labor disputes at foreign-funded  enterprises in 1991, twice the number of such cases in 1989 and  1990 put together; in 1992 and 1993, the number of such cases  exceeded 100 each year.    Owing to insufficient safety installations, accidents have  been frequent in many foreign-funded enterprises, and some fires  broke out. The fire at a Hong Kong-funded technical toy factory  in Shenzhen resulted in a tragedy involving 84 deaths and some  40 casualties. Statistics showed that of the 206 major fires  that took place in China last year, foreign-funded enterprises  accounted for one-tenth.    Workers and staffers involved in labor disputes at  foreign-funded enterprises were mostly laborers from rural  areas. When they first worked at these enterprises, they had  very little knowledge about what labor rights and privileges  they should enjoy, so when they entered the factory, they did  not sign contracts with those representing capital; they had a  very weak sense of and capability for self-protection, and often  were placed in the position of the weak. These peasant laborers  who worked at foreign-funded enterprises valued their work  opportunities, and generally were able to "endure" irrational  things. When the state of affairs evolved into work slow-downs  or strikes, it only proved that the working environment,  conditions and treatment at some foreign-funded enterprises were  so poor that they had gone quite beyond the workers' capacity to  endure.    Labor disputes took place primarily in some medium-sized and  small enterprises funded by Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen  which required little investment, but reaped high profits.  These businessmen cherished hopes of repaying of their  principal in a short period and of making money. This being the  case, the factories' internal environment was very poor, lacking  proper ventilation, dust-proofing, antitoxic safeguards,  fire-proofing and noise-proofing, while constantly sparking  serious accidents. At the same time, the work day could be  extremely long. In many factories, workers and staffers had to  work 10-12 hours on an average day; sometimes they had to work  nonstop for 16 hours to get some particular job done on  schedule. The payment for work at some foreign-funded  enterprises was on the low side, with wage levels that were not  up to the original stipulation. Sometimes, the level could be  even lower than the minimum wage standards of local enterprises.  At other times, foreign businessmen would arbitrarily keep the  payment of wages in arrears. Welfare provisions were poor, too.  Dormitories were dirty and disorderly; workers did not enjoy  medical insurance and were not allowed compensation for injuries  resulting from accidents in the workplace. What was more  unbearable was that the managerial methods of some  foreign-funded enterprises could be rough. Aside from being  penalized when staffers and workers violated rules and  regulations, cases of workers being confined, beaten, or cursed  at sometimes took place.    Mainland workers' unions believed that foreign-funded  enterprises made contributions to national economic development,  but the rank and file of workers and staffers in such  enterprises rendered meritorious services that should not be  nullified, either. Their legitimate rights and privileges  should be protected. From the angle of the development of  foreign-funded enterprises themselves, the harmony and stability  of labor-capital relations is the basic factor in enterprises'  advance toward a sound cycle and their striving for economic  results. This being the case, foreign businessmen should not be  eager for quick success and instant benefits, still more should  they refrain from forgetting all moral principles at the sight  of profits. From the angle of the rights and privileges of  workers and staffers, the state must complete and perfect the  law on labor as quickly as possible. The far-too-general  existing decrees and regulations on labor lack feasibility in  actual operation, nor are they capable of checking law-breaking  behavior. This being the case, a complete and perfect "Law on  Labor" is in great demand. On this basis, the labor insurance  system will be established to protect rights and privileges in  the workplace.    To the mainland authorities, the completion and perfection  of  labor decrees and regulations, and the appropriate handling of  labor disputes according to the law have a bearing on the  confidence of investors from beyond our borders. In the wake of  presenting the "Law on Labor," it is necessary to augment  monitoring and examination, and to establish specialized  supervision organizations. At present, some provinces and cities  fear lest whatever they do should affect foreign investment.  Thus they have provided 101 kinds of preferential treatment to  foreign businessmen, paying great attention to allowing  preferential treatment, but saying very little about  administration according to the law. They have closed their  eyes to many factory workshops failing to meet the requirements  of the rules and regulations on safety and fire precaution  measures. Thus the hidden danger of accidents has been left  unresolved. From a long-range point of view, only by combining  in an organic way the import of foreign investment with the  completion and perfection of administration through the legal  system will it be possible genuinely to push forward the  healthy, stable, and sustained development of foreign-funded  enterprises.</p>

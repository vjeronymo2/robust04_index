			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah has issued a statement on the crime  involving the kidnapping of Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani. The  statement said: With the dawning of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and  while the Muslims were celebrating the feast of sacrifice,  official international and Zionist terrorism was chasing the  Lebanese inside their villages and homes within the view and  hearing of the world public and was committing against them acts  of piracy and kidnapping. This proves the criminal nature of  the Jews, who do not hesitate to commit the ugliest crimes,  violate the most sacred values, kill women and children, and  kidnap peaceful civilians.    Today the Zionist entity committed a new crime added to its  list of abominable crimes and aggressive acts, including the  acts of kidnapping and piracy with which its history is replete.    The statement added: This ugly crime is the clearest picture  and the most eloquent expression of the official terrorism  exercised by the Zionist entity backed by the global arrogant  forces, above all the United States.    The crime was committed after an official decision was  issued  by the enemy government, which pursues terrorism as a firm  policy in dealing with the peoples of this region. This proves  the criminal nature of the Zionist entity and the occupying  Jews, who are supported by the global arrogant forces.    The statement continued: This crime has proved that there is  no place in Lebanon safe from the Zionist danger, which is  threatening everyone. This means we must consider all of  Lebanon as a confrontational area in which our people must  maintain constant resistance against the Jewish threat.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - Nick Straker Nick Straker, stockbroker with Morgan Stanley: 'I go to work very early and often dress in the dark. So I choose plain shirts which won't clash with whatever tie I've picked up. My suits, which are tailor-made, are mostly plain and single-breasted. I avoid City fads like really baggy suits or bright pink shirts, though there is now an interesting trend towards pale yellow. I like long shirts with plenty of tuck-in and room under the arms. Double cuffs look smart, with plain collars - working for an American firm I consciously don't adopt the preppy, button-down look. I shop for myself but I also like mail order. I discovered Boden do extra long fittings and I have arms like a gibbon. Their shirts are high-quality traditional and I enjoy receiving parcels. My wife occasionally buys me a shirt. She is more adventurous.'</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Calling a halt to traffic chaos - Worth Watching Anyone in a UK company from the director to the messenger can now check the traffic before setting out with Trafficmaster, which enables drivers to learn the location of traffic jams. Trafficmaster, sold by Cray Systems, of Fleet, Hampshire, uses infra-red sensors installed on motorway bridges to measure the speed of travelling vehicles. Once a jam is spotted the sensors send a radio signal to the computer centre, from where it is relayed to companies taking the service. There the data are displayed in colour on a 386-based PC running under Windows. The data can be networked, so that anyone on the corporate network has access to traffic news. The information is updated every three minutes. Cray Systems: UK, 0252 625121.</p>

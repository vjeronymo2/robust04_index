			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi asserted today that Israel has  been grossly violating the agreement with the PLO and curtailing  the freedom of action of the Palestinian institutions in East  Jerusalem. This gross violation creates facts on the ground  prior to the discussions about the permanent arrangement,  'Ashrawi said. In a news conference she called today, Hanan  'Ashrawi declared that the Independent Palestinian Committee for  Civil Rights headed by her will be the comptroller of the  autonomy and the Palestinian state. 'Ashrawi will fill this role  after she received the approval of Yasir 'Arafat and the  Palestine National Council. Our correspondent Avi Lifshitz  reports:    [Begin recording] [Lifshitz] Following the media and  parliamentary uproar in Israel over Shim'on Peres' letter on the  issue of Jerusalem, it is interesting to see how things look  from the other side. 'Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader in the  territories and the former spokesperson of the negotiating team  with Israel, believes that the measures taken by Rabin to  curtail the activities of the Palestinian institutions in East  Jerusalem constitute a violation of the agreement with the PLO.    ['Ashrawi, in English] I think that Israel is violating the  agreement by trying to deal unilaterally with postponed issues.  I think these are illegal. By law, Jerusalem, East Jerusalem,  is part of the occupied territories. No amount of unilateral  annexation, or manipulation, or distortion of the law by Israel  is going to change that fact.    [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] It further  came out in the news conference that 'Ashrawi will be the Myriam  Ben-Porat of the Palestinian autonomy. She presented the  Independent Palestinian Committee for Civil Rights which will be  the comptroller of the newly-established Palestinian Authority  and, according to her, also of the future Palestinian state.  This, with the approval of 'Arafat and the endorsement of the  PLO institutions and the Palestinian Authority. This committee  will not confine its work only to the boundaries of the  autonomy, she said.    ['Ashrawi, in English] We are not restricted to one phase,  like Gaza-Jericho, or one geographic location. We will deal  with Palestinian issues throughout the Palestinian territories.    [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] We will  operate everywhere, including Judaea and Samaria, 'Ashrawi said.  The new body has the right to investigate irregularities,  access information, and monitor processes in the making.  Already, it has approached senior PLO officials and managed to  solve the problem of the property of absentees in Jericho.    By heading the audit committee -- which, incidentally, will  reside in East Jerusalem -- 'Ashrawi is probably saying that she  has disqualified herself from being a member of any executive  council of the autonomy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town Jun 3 SAPA -- A controversial 4-million  rand tourist development at Cape Point was given the go-ahead by  the Regional Services Council [RSC] after a special on-site  meeting Thursday [2 June]. The move was welcomed by Cape Point  chief nature conservation officer Mr Howard Langley, but was  slammed by green pressure groups. RSC councillors were met at  Cape Point Thursday by protesters.    RSC chairman Mr Piet Loubser said the executive committee's  decision had been unanimous. "The professional (environmental)  people we've had to advise us have done a fine job and the new  development will have less impact on the natural environment  than the present facilities."    The R4 million development, which could be completed within  a  year, includes a sunken restaurant below the parking area with  rockeries and indigenous plants on its roof, and a funicular  rail system to replace the buses to the Cape Point view site.    "Everything humanly possible would be done to ensure there  was no damage to the environment," Mr Loubser said.    Protesters bore banners and placards reading "no  environmental impact assessment. No public participation. No  unilateral decision!", "Our Point, our decision", "Will the  people benefit", "1990 proposals -- what happened?", "Cape Point  is our heritage" and "Cape Point real estate" over-written with  "sold".</p>

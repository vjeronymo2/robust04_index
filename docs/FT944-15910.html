			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Books: Cautionary tales of true blue politics THE MAJOR EFFECT edited by Dennis Kavanagh and Anthony Seldon Macmillan Pounds 20, 500 pages CONSERVATIVE CENTURY: THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SINCE 1900 edited by Anthony Seldon and Stuart Ball Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 842 pages John Major has been British Prime Minister for nearly four years - longer than Eden, Home, Callaghan and Heath. Despite recent opinion polls, and the assumption between the lines of these two books - that the Tory Party has been in office so long that it is bound to fall in the next general election  -I would not bet against Major his producing an all-time record. The case for him is not easily acceptable to students and practitioners of politics. It is the case for weak government: incompetent, contradictory, but generally keeping the show on the road. Harold Wilson, with whose prime ministerial performance Major's has so much in common, described it thus: 'The best style of government is like rowing  - the ideal solution is to get the boat along as quickly as possible without turning it over.' Meanwhile, Wilson might have added, life goes on. So it is with Major who began by saying that Britain was at the heart of Europe, that the Maastricht treaty was 'game, set and match to Britain' and retreated into trying to hold his party together. One could say the same about British membership of the exchange rate mechanism: Major as chancellor took Britain in, Major as prime minister defended staying, and Major still as prime minister took Britain out. None of that is particularly to denigrate Major: Britain is clearly a hard country to govern, as Wilson discovered. Perhaps it is governed too much, not too little. It is also quite hard to write contemporary history. How contemporary is contemporary if it is to be considered history, and when do journalists shade into historians? The editors and writers of The Major Effect have made a decent attempt. Their aim was to examine how much or how little has changed in the British political system since the departure of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Yet there must be some reservations about their achievements. One is a tendency to look over the shoulder at the last opinion poll and forward to the next in case it produces a shift. There can be no assured judgments from writers like those. There are also some follies. Thus William Wallace writes in his essay on foreign policy that under the ownership of Conrad Black The Spectator 'revived to become the leading political weekly of the right'. One wonders about the size of the competition. The most intellectually distinguished piece is by Peter Jay, the economics editor of the BBC, on the economy; yet, as Jay admits, it has little to do with the theme of the book: it is a restatement of his own opposition to fixed exchange rates. Still, this must be one of the few published essays to pay tribute to Norman Lamont as chancellor. Jay thinks that Lamont was too loyal to Major in going along with ERM membership in the first place: he was Cardinal Wolsey to Henry VIII. Moreover, it was Lamont who introduced the unified budget - one of the biggest changes of the Major period and indeed in postwar budgeting. This week Lamont fought back. The most interesting piece is on law and the constitution by Simon Lee, Professor of Jurisprudence at Queen's University, Belfast. Lee points out that the courts and judicial reviews are gradually surpassing parliament in their political importance. There is, too, the challenge from Brussels and the European Parliament, with which Westminster has yet to come to terms. Both books are a little too kind to the Conservative Party to be considered wholly objective. The much longer Conservative Century draws its title from the number of elections the party has won in the last 95 years. One is reminded of looking at the results of the Boat Race: at a certain period Cambridge seemed dominant, then relentlessly Oxford began to catch up. More seriously, the book fails to distinguish between conservatism with a small and large 'c'. It is perfectly possible to regard Labour as more conservative than the Tories, which may explain the present threat from Tony Blair. Moreover, the writers take little account of chance and political cock-ups. The sequence of electoral victories might have been quite different (say) if Attlee had held on in 1951 when the economic boom could have come to Labour's rescue, if Harold Wilson had delayed a bit in 1970, and if Edward Heath had not gone to the country in February 1974. Above all, it fails to point out that the continued electoral success of the Conservative Party has partly depended on the existence of two oppositions. This was as true at the beginning of the century as it is now. Why Labour and Liberals do not learn from this is another matter. The Tories have usually had the edge on propaganda, but even there they do not always win. As Richard Cockett describes, in 1929 - well before Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - the party employed JH Benson's, well known for its advertisements for Guinness. They came up with the very conservative slogan 'Safety First': the Tories lost.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / All change in foreign exchanges: The nature of international currency dealing has altered Who pushed sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism last year and brought chaos to the currency markets? Most people point the finger at young dealers in commercial banks - the boys in red braces - trading millions of pounds per second. But the world's central banks are coming up with a different answer. Their evidence suggests the men in grey suits - investment fund and pension fund managers - make the really big decisions in currency markets. And there are signs that these investors - backed by massive funds and portfolios - are changing the nature of currency dealing in a way that may pose problems for governments and banks. Until 10 years ago, foreign exchange dealing was dominated by large numbers of commercial banks and big corporations, trading currencies mainly for their own books. But in the late 1980s, the foreign exchange business attracted investment institutions with huge portfolios. The deregulation of the world's financial markets encouraged these funds to broaden their activities across the globe. Some invested directly in the currency market, believing that exchange rate movements made currencies as profitable as other financial instruments. Others bought currencies to hedge the exposure of their underlying foreign assets. Overall, the flows generated by investment institutions are far greater than those that the banks are prepared to risk. A currency dealing room in a big London bank will have tens of million of pounds with which to operate on any one day. But a big investment fund could push a billion dollars through the market. The impact of larger flows on the currency market was highlighted by a report by the Bank for International Settlements - the central bankers' bank  -this week. It said turnover in foreign exchange increased 42 per cent between 1989 and 1992 to an estimated Dollars 880bn (Pounds 620bn) per business day in April of last year. Much of that increase is not matched by a similar expansion of world trade. More specifically, the BIS says that non-bank trade in the currency market has grown. 'Transactions with other market participants have expanded more rapidly than those between dealers,' the report says. There are signs that these huge flows are changing the nature of foreign exchange dealing. There has been a greater concentration of business in London, the main currency trading centre, because it can provide the huge pools of liquidity that investors seek. London increased its share of the world's FX turnover from 25 per cent in 1989 to nearly 30 per cent in 1992. According to the BIS, there are now more dollars and D-Marks traded in London than in the US or Germany. There is a growing concentration of business among a decreasing number of banks. Only the biggest banks can convince customers they have the financial muscle to carry the liquidity and credit risk involved in large-scale trading. The Bank of England reported last year that the 10 most active banks in the City of London had 43 per cent of turnover, up from 36 per cent in 1986. The US dollar is losing some of its dominance as a reserve currency to the D-Mark. The D-Mark has overtaken the yen as the second most widely traded currency, being involved in 38 per cent of all currency deals. Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London says: 'The growing use of the D-Mark reflects the internationalisation of investment opportunities and the greater importance of European bond markets.' Do these developments matter? There are grounds for thinking they will present new challenges to businessmen, politicians and central bankers. Mr David Clark, European Treasurer at HSBC Holdings in London, believes new participants will find it increasingly difficult to get into the market. 'I expect to see smaller market participants trying to deal in newly convertible currencies like the Hungarian forint,' he says. London's growing dominance may also make it difficult for banks to develop foreign exchange operations in any other European centre. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says this should concern politicians thinking of putting a European central bank outside London. 'The BIS report shows that London did extraordinarily well even though it was outside the ERM for part of the three-year period,' he says. 'The decision to put the European central bank somewhere other than London would be a nonsense given the primacy of the UK capital in foreign exchange.' But for central bankers wishing to control exchange rates through intervention, the sheer size of the market must be the biggest concern. Mr MacKinnon says: 'If domestic economic policies are wrong - as they have been in Europe recently - the currency markets play a useful role in forcing central banks to adapt their policies.'

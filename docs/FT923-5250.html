			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Loads of time and money - David Fishlock on the huge efforts needed to create better engines 'WE only deal with two things really - materials and air,' said Phil Ruffles, Rolls-Royce's director of engineering, in an interview earlier this year. But the cost of research and development to get those two things right for a new aero-engine can be, typically, Pounds 500m spread over a decade or more from design concept to full certification. Up to six years is spent preparing the ground for engine development by the acquisition of the technology - new materials and manufacturing technology - needed to demonstrate the design performance. Engine development takes five years, with the heaviest costs falling in years two to four. Once the go-ahead is given for engine development, the risk must be low. It can be devastatingly costly for the engine-maker if his engine should start to fail in unexpected ways - say, a new material begins to break up. But by getting his material and air-flow perfectly balanced a designer can achieve minor miracles. For example, he can run a superalloy turbine blade at a temperature 300 degrees C above its melting point for thousands of hours - provided he keeps a film of air flowing across its surface. Ceramics offer the opportunity to leap hundreds of degrees higher still in temperature. But ceramics differ fundamentally from metals - for example, in the ways they fail. New ways must be learned both to compensate for their weaknesses in tensile strength and to manufacture parts without compromising their good properties, including high specific strength and stiffness. The inducements for the designer include a lighter engine and lower running costs. The engineer sees two broad ways of harnessing the advantages of ceramics: as monolithics, from which, say, a new turbine blade might be shaped; and as composites, in which the ceramic is buried in an energy-absorbing matrix of polymer or metal. Composites using polymer matrices are already widely employed by designers of both engines and airframes. No engine designer has yet introduced either monolithics or composites in rotating parts. Rolls-Royce is experimenting with small, uncooled turbine blades of ceramic for helicopter engines. Looking ahead, this company forecasts that by the year 2010 ceramics will account for 20-30 per cent of engine weight. If ceramics could be applied to the Trent engine for a 300-seat, 4,700 nautical mile range airliner, to push up engine temperature by 500 degC, the life cycle saving to the airline could be Pounds 3.5m per engine, says James Angus, Rolls-Royce's manager of design systems and technology. The airframe designer is also deeply concerned with the interplay between materials and air. Some aircraft designers contend that the last big challenge for aero dynamics, at least in subsonic flight, is better control of the turbulence generated within two or three millimetres of the skin, and a big reduction in drag. Where turbine blade designers have been blowing air through fine orifices to insulate metal from combustion gases, airframe designers have experimented with sucking the turbulent air through the skin, through fine holes. The first suction system for a big aircraft was demonstrated by Boeing in 1990, as part of a laminar flow research programme funded by NASA and the US Air Force. Holes only 0.002 inch in diameter were drilled by laser in a titanium panel built into the upper left wing surface of a Boeing 757. The laminar flow created by sucking air in through these holes extended across two-thirds of the wing. But NASA estimates that another five years of R&amp;D may be needed before such a system can be sold. In the mid-1980s when the Ministry of Defence's chief scientific adviser was asked where Britain stood in developing 'stealth' materials and techniques to make equipment invisible to enemy sensors, he replied sardonically that the defence chiefs were busy filing the corners from their ships. Smart materials - materials which respond or adapt to their environment the way, say, a chameleon can camouflage itself - are a major R&amp;D target today. For example, pieso-electric materials embedded in airframes or flight control surfaces could be another way of reducing drag. One idea is to fit the fins of a guided missile with pieso-electric elements which can be made to twist by applying a voltage. A computer might then continuously control their shape in flight. Alternatively, control could be exercised through varying pressures on pieso electric surfaces, fed back as a changing voltage to the flight control computer. Likewise, to make an aircraft or missile invisible to enemy sensors, there are possibilities emerging for active surface coatings that respond to radiation falling upon them, so as to persuade, say, the radar that it is not there.

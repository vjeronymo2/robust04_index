			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Clinton seeks harmony after rift President Bill Clinton has assured Mr John Major that he wants to draw a line under the rift in Anglo-US relations caused by a row over Northern Ireland and sharp differences in their approach to the Bosnian war. In spite of an undiplomatic attack on the US administration's Bosnia policy yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, Downing Street expects Mr Major to be given a friendly reception when he visits Washington at the end of this month. Mr Clinton plans a return trip to London in early June before the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the Normandy landings during the second world war. British and US officials said that during recent telephone conversations Mr Clinton had sought to reassure Mr Major about the strength of what used to be called the special relationship. The officials confirmed that, contrary to denials from Downing Street, Mr Clinton had warned Mr Major of serious damage to the Nato alliance if Britain had sought to veto the threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. But once Mr Major backed the plan Mr Clinton made it clear that he was anxious to repair the recent damage to the relationship between the White House and Downing Street. The president told Mr Major that his decision to override British objections to a visit to New York by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, should not be interpreted as a deliberate personal slight. Mr Clinton disowned reports in some US and British newspapers that he had been totally unconcerned that the decision to give Mr Adams a visa might be interpreted as a slight against the British prime minister. Instead he blamed freelance briefings by US officials. The stance adopted by the US president has been greeted with intense relief by prime ministerial aides. Mr Major is conscious that Britain's declining influence in Washington threatens further damage to his political authority. There remains a possibility that differences over Bosnia could flare up again before Mr Major travels to Washington. Mr Rifkind's attack on the US over its refusal to contribute troops to the United Nations force in Bosnia was indicative of tensions that remain. The help given by the Conservatives to the Republicans during the presidential election and investigations by the Home Office into Mr Clinton's stay in Britain in the 1960s mean also that the relationship between the two men will never be particularly warm. But the British side is now convinced that Mr Clinton is ready to make a conscious effort to emphasise that good transatlantic relations have been restored.</p>

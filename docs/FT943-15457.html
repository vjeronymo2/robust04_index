			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Japanese LDP leaders offer to quit party posts Two leading members of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) offered to resign senior party posts yesterday in a move expected to accelerate the realignment of Japan's fractured political system. The former prime minister, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, and the former foreign minister, Mr Michio Watanabe, offered their resignations as senior party advisers following their decision to defy the party's leadership instructions to vote for the Social Democratic party's (SDP) leader, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, as prime minister in last week's vote in the Diet. Mr Nakasone and Mr Watanabe voted for the former prime minister, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who left the LDP and stood unsuccessfully against Mr Murayama. Last week the LDP secretary-general, Mr Yoshio Mori, called the defectors' actions a 'breach of trust' and said the party would consider punitive action. The former ministers' decision is expected to be followed by a further shift in political allegiances. In the vote last week which resulted in the formation of a coalition government of the LDP, the SDP and the smaller Sakigake party, 32 LDP members and 10 Socialists defied their party leaderships and failed to vote for Mr Murayama. Two LDP members immediately resigned from the party. They were joined on Wednesday by one Socialist and two more LDP rebels who resigned to sit as independents. Meanwhile, on Thursday eight parties from the former ruling coalition joined forces to counter the SDP/LDP alliance. The group, called the Reform Promotion Council, was formed at the instigation of another former prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. It aims to create a 200-seat bloc in the 504-seat lower house of the Diet, and is hoping to attract more defectors from the LDP and SDP. The group plans to field joint candidates in the next elections, due to be held under a new system of single-member constituencies combined with proportional representation.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / First shots fired in council elections: Tories stress prudence - Labour fears for democracy / MPs worried about poor interest BOTH MAIN parties launched their local government elections campaigns yesterday with the Tories emphasising authorities as 'enablers' rather than providers of services. Labour responded with a warning that local democracy was threatened. Both main parties were united in asserting that they were confident of running vigorous campaigns, although the elections follow so soon after a fiercely fought general poll. Privately, however, MPs in both parties admit that motivating not only their supporters but also the electorate is likely to be difficult. The elections, on May 7, are taking place for all seats in the 53 district councils in Scotland and for a third of seats in 155 of the district councils in England and Wales. There are no elections in London or for county councils. Launching the campaign, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister, said that only the Tories could stop councils being 'captured by service providers' and achieve services local communities wanted at prices they could afford. Labour, Mr Howard added, was 'in no position' to claim any interest in the quality of services, as the party's leading figures were 'grubbing around for the votes of public-service unions' in the leadership election. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, rejected the charge and said that the government's drive towards centralisation and privatisation in local services would intensify. In the campaign, Labour plans to emphasises the role of local councils as a check on central government. Producing illustrative figures for the council tax, which will replace the poll tax next year, Mr Gould warned that the new system would mean people in the south facing higher bills than under the poll tax. Both Labour and the Tories emphasised that in some cases only a handful of votes could change the political control of a council. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said the party would be looking for some gains in controlling councils rather than at a particular total for the number of seats overall. Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, underlined the objective of consolidating a strong position from when those seats were last contested in 1988. In terms of gains, Labour will be looking to areas where it did well in parliamentary seats. The Tories pointed out that in some places where the Liberal Democrats had failed to take long-standing target seats in the Westminster elections, their local authority base might be more vulnerable than before.</p>

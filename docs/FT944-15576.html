			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Warning on Post Office sell-off Consumers stand to lose from privatisation of the Post Office unless lessons are learnt from past utility sell-offs, a watchdog said yesterday. The government-funded National Consumer Council said it could not support current plans for Post Office privatisation without more safeguards on pricing and services. Unless tight price controls are set, the mistakes made in the privatisation of electricity could be repeated, leading to excess profits for the industry at consumers' expense, it said.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM DELAYED TILL JANUARY  </P> <P> Although city officials had hoped to begin a new recycling program this month,  delays in permit hearings for a processing plant that will handle the refuse  have pushed back the start date to the beginning of January.  </P> <P> Under the program, approved earlier this year, all refuse from the city will be  taken to a plant in Stanton, where recyclable materials will be separated from  the garbage using magnetic and weight-sensitive machinery.  </P> <P> The city's 10-year contract with CR Transfer Inc. guarantees that at least 25%  of the garbage collected in the city will be recycled, without residents having  to separate plastics, glass or newspapers out of their trash bins.  </P> <P> Until the plant is ready to accept the city's refuse, Newport Beach will  continue its curbside newspaper pickup.  </P></p>

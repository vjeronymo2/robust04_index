			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities and are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in prices. Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified as either trading securities or held-to-maturity securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement No. 115 requires unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities to be included in earnings in the current period. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings; however, they are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For individual securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, an entity must determine whether a decline in the security's fair value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is determined to be permanent, that is, it is probable that the entity will not be able to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the realized loss is accounted for in earnings of the current period. The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the separate component of equity. Subsequent decreases are also included in the separate component of equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All trading securities are reported as current assets in the balance sheet and individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities are classified as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate. Cash flows from the purchase, sale, or maturity of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities are classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All REA borrowers must adopt the accounting, reporting, and disclosure requirements set forth in Statement No. 115 as of the statement's implementation date. Unrealized holding gains or losses for trading securities shall be recorded in either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate. Unrealized holding gains or losses for available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of stockholder's equity in Account 215.1, Unrealized Gains and Losses_Debt and Equity Securities. A contra account of the investment account shall be debited or credited accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective Date and Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement No. 115 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. At the beginning of the entity's fiscal year, the entity must classify its debt and equity securities on the basis of the entity's current intent.

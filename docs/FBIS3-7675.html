			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] THE Council of Economic Ministers yesterday  approved another round of customs tariff reform for electronic  and electrical goods, mechanical goods, optical products and  machinery with the aim of improving local production efficiency  in the long run.    Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the reforms, which  take effect today, feature both lower tariff rates for 417 items  of goods under those categories and lesser tax rates to be  applied to those goods.    The average tax rate for those products has been reduced by  half from 28 percent to only 14 percent and 39 different tax  rates for those 417 items have been reduced to only six rates to  make taxation easier.    The reduction of the number of rates has been made through  reclassifying those products according to their nature --  namely, finished products, semi-finished products and raw  materials.    The minister said total imports of the 417 items last year  reached 120 billion baht or 11 percent of the country's total  imports.    The reforms would deprive the Government of 6.4 billion baht  in tax collection a year, he said, adding that this would be  compensated by benefits to local industries in the long run.    Export-oriented industries in particular would benefit from  the scheme as their production costs would become more  competitive in the international market while other producers in  the country would have to improve efficiency to compete with  cheaper imports.    The details of the rate adjustments are as follows:    -- Imports of 78 items of electronic goods including  capacitors, resistors, diodes and transistors will be subject to  a new tax rate of 1 percent against 0-35 percent in the past.    -- Imports of 37 items of machinery such as movie cameras,  machinery used together with boilers, and construction  machinery, engines, fans, air and oil filters for automobiles,  and high voltage regulators will be subject to a new rate of 5  percent instead of 5-40 percent.    -- Imports of 94 items of semi-finished products including  ball bearings, electric motors, switches, fuses, plugs and  relays, cathode tubes, optic fibre and cable and camera lenses  will be subject to a new rate of 10 percent instead of 1-35  percent.    -- Imports of 208 items of finished products such as copying  machines, cash dispensers, coin sorting machines, hair dryers,  telephone sets, light bulbs, batteries, movie projectors, slide  projectors, camera flashes, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens,  microphones, loudspeakers, tape and video tape (recorded) and  disc players will be subject to a new tax rate of 20 and 30  percent instead of 0-60 percent.</p>

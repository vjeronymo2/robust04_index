			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will ask the United States and South  Korea to take concerted steps with Japan to bring North Korea's  past developments in the nuclear field to light, a government  source disclosed on 20 June. The government has decided to do  so in response to the prospect of the resumption of high-level  U.S.-DPRK talks and the DPRK's proposal to hold North-South  summit talks. The government intends to speedily set  itineraries for Prime Minister Hata to visit South Korea and  Foreign Minister Kakizawa to visit the United States. They will  seek to shape a consensus with the United States and South Korea  in dealing with the issue of the past developments in North  Korea's nuclear program.    With regard to the DPRK nuclear issue, the United States has  set as a condition of the resumption of the stalled U.S.-North  Korean high-level talks the DPRK's acceptance of special  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to  determine whether Pyongyang has in the past diverted plutonium  to build nuclear weapons. During his meeting with former U.S.  President Carter, North Korean President Kim Il-song said that  as conditions for resuming the stalled U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks, the DPRK will allow IAEA inspectors to remain  at the North's nuclear facilities and that North Korea will  return completely to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    In response, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci  indicated that the U.S. Government would accept the proposal put  forward by the DPRK president for resuming the high-level talks,  saying, "If North Korea is found to have promised to freeze  major elements of its nuclear program when we pursue another  round of high-level talks between the United States and North  Korea, this would be a constructive step." In this way, the  United States has softened its preconditions for resuming the  stalled U.S.-DPRK high-level talks.    The IAEA has said that following North Korea's complete  removal of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor, it is  be unable to verify developments in the DPRK's nuclear program.  The same government source said, "The U.S. Government intends  to leave the issue of verifying past developments of North  Korea's nuclear program to the North-South summit talks, in  anticipation of the impossibility of verifying them."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Only Way Out"] </F>   [Text] There is a military maxim, much quoted in  discussions of the Balkans today: "Never reinforce failure."  The greatest failure of Western policy in Bosnia, however, has  not been a military one. It has been an elementary failure of  understanding about the very nature of the war itself. So  terrible has the slaughter been -- 200,000 people killed, two  million driven from their homes, and the hospital wards of  Gorazde reduced to a mess of rubble and blood -- that the  outside world has simply recoiled in horror, convinced that no  rational understanding of such actions can be possible.    Starting from the assumption that they could take no view on  the political rights and wrongs of the war, the Western  governments insisted that they would deal only with its  "humanitarian" aspects. Then a UN military involvement was  tacked on to the humanitarian aid effort and then the policy of  "safe areas" was added on to that, leading eventually to a  direct military confrontation with the Serbs. Now Nato has  dramatically increased its commitment to defend the safe area of  Gorazde, raising the military stakes still higher.    But while the nature of our involvement has gradually  changed, there has been no change in our fundamental  misunderstanding of the war. The basic idea remains that we  must treat all parties as equal, with equally valid claims, and  bring about "a negotiated settlement" (i.e., a carve-up of  Bosnia) in which as many as possible of those conflicting claims  are satisfied.    Several failures of understanding are involved here. They  include these three repeated by British ministers throughout the  war: that the Bosnian government is "a warring faction"; that  the Serb forces are fighting against "the Muslims"; and that the  war is just "a civil war."    The Bosnian government is not a faction; it is the elected  government of a sovereign state. The independence and  sovereignty of Bosnia (which Britain has recognised) were voted  for by an absolute majority of Bosnian citizens. The government  contains Serbs and Croats, neither it nor its army can be  described simply as "the Muslims." And the war itself is not  just a civil war, but a war of territorial conquest planned,  directed and supplied by Serbia, a neighbouring state.    Anyone who understands these matters can see which side of  the conflict deserves our political support. It is not  necessary to become steeped in Balkan politics, or to fall prey  to emotional moralism. It is sufficient to bear in mind the  basic political principles which we ourselves value: legality,  sovereignty and democracy. We would take offence if American  politicians started calling the British Army in Northern Ireland  a "warring faction"; Bosnians feel similarly offended when our  politicians dismiss their own legal government with that phrase.    The Bosnian government has a just cause; but is it,  nevertheless, a hopeless one? Here again the facts are shrouded  in a fog of misunderstanding. It is simply assumed that the  defeat of the Bosnian army is inevitable, and that the Serb  forces will always fictate "the facts on the ground."    The history of the war suggests otherwise. From the moment  the Bosnian government began properly to organise its forces,  the Serb advance was largely checked, and in some areas pushed  back. Only the UN-imposed arms embargo prevented the Bosnian  army from regaining more territory. Though they still enjoy a  huge superiority in weapons, the Serb forces suffer now from  dwindling numbers and poor morale; recruitment to the Bosnian  army continues to rise, and it now outnumbers the Serbs by more  than two to one. There is nothing invincible about the Serb army  in Bosnia.    The defeat of this Serb force is both possible and  politically desirable. Yet it does not automatically follow  that we should wage war against it ourselves. No British  government can be expected to risk the lives of thousands of  British troops in a foreign war unless it believes that vital  British interests are at stake. Neither the government nor the  public believe that about Bosnia, and although we would not be  unaffected by the long-term consequences of a Serb victory  (further instability in the Balkans, and precedents for  aggression elsewhere), it cannot be argued that our national  interests are immediately involved.    All the more reason, then, why we should rethink our policy  now. Instead of becoming more and more involved in a war we do  not want to fight, we should step back and stop obstructing the  one body which has both the will and the right to fight it: the  army of the legitimate Bosnian government. The arms embargo can  and should be lifted. Since its legal status is doubtful (it  conflicts with the basic right of self-defence, and it was  imposed on a state, Yugoslavia, which no longer exists), we need  only announce that we will not regard it as applying to Bosnia  until a new Security Council resolution specifically says that  it does. The deliveries could begin tomorrow.    At the same time, we should remove all our own ground troops  from Bosnia. They are not sufficient to fight a war, and can  only become hostages or targets for reprisals. This does not  mean, however, that all aid deliveries would have to cease.  Deliveries of every kind could continue through the Croat and  Bosnian-held territories, but their security would be the  responsibility of the Bosnian government's own forces.    Whether we then give the Bosnians support from the air would  be a matter for further judgment, both military and political.  So long as we could do this at low risk to our pilots, a case  could be made for such a limited intervention, not least to  redress the imbalance which our own previous intervention (the  arms embargo) had created.    We might still end up dropping bombs on Serb tanks. But we  would be doing so not to reinforce a failed policy --  establishing "safe areas" in a sea of "warring factions" -- but  to enable a legitimate government to win a war. The British  people might then understand what we were doing, and why.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco seeks SE listing ahead of flotation JAPAN Tobacco, the government-owned tobacco group, has applied for listing on the Tokyo stock exchange ahead of a partial flotation scheduled for early next year. Japan Tobacco was due to be floated last year, along with East Japan Rail. The issues were postponed following a period of prolonged weakness for the Tokyo stock market. Japan Tobacco controls 83 per cent of the Y3,000bn (Dollars 28bn) domestic tobacco market. For the year to March, its pre-tax profits dipped 11.1 per cent to Y100.4bn on sales little changed at Y2,761.7bn. Mr Shigeru Mizuno, president of Japan Tobacco, said the company was looking to expand its exports and to diversify. In the initial listing, 33 per cent of the company's outstanding shares will be offered. Ahead of the listing, one-third of the tranche will be auctioned as a means of making an orderly secondary market. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the ministry would monitor developments on the stock market following JT's listing application. He denied the government was about to sell its remaining shares in Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Taking a look in the rear-view mirror 'This reindustrialisation programme - the replacing of obsolete plants and equipment with state-of-the-art facilities and the retraining of workers - is, in its scope and complexity, without parallel in the history of American industry. 'We have been able over recent years to transform GM into a 21st Century corporation so that we can be expected to grow even stronger and more profitable in the years ahead.' - 1987 Annual Report. 'Nearly a decade ago GM began the most massive programme of facilities modernisation and rebuilding ever undertaken by any corporation . . .A current goal is to become the low-cost domestic producer and increase the corporation's north American factory utilisation rate to 100 per cent by 1992.' - 1988 Annual Report.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bajaj Auto aims to maintain its dominance - The Indian scooter maker is capitalising on economic liberalisation Few Indian industrialists have stayed as close to their business as Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto, the country's largest maker of scooters and motorcycles. While other business leaders have often allowed themselves to be swept up by the social and political whirl of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta or Madras, Mr Bajaj has lived next to his factory in Pune since 1965, an industrial city three hours' drive from Bombay. Like his workers, he sent his three children to the local school. Born into a wealthy business family, brought up in Bombay and the holder of an MBA from Harvard University, Mr Bajaj would have been forgiven for deciding against life on the factory site. But he says he could not have built Bajaj Auto into a world-class company any other way. It is not an idle boast. Bajaj is one of the few large Indian companies which competes successfully with the world's best. Among manufacturers of two-wheelers, it ranks fourth, behind Honda, Suzuki and Kawasaki of Japan and ahead of Piaggio of Italy, which belongs to Fiat. Bajaj held its domination of the Indian market even though Piaggio and the Japanese makers entered the country as long ago as the early 1980s. Most recently its market share has been rising - to 49 per cent in the year to March 1994. With a market capitalisation equivalent to Dollars 1.4bn, Bajaj Auto is a popular stock with foreign fund managers, who will have a further opportunity to buy the shares when the company launches a Dollars 200m Euro-equity issue later this year. Bajaj is the biggest profit-earner in the Indian vehicle industry and posted a 180 per cent increase in net returns to Rs1.45bn (Dollars 46.2m) on sales which rose 27 per cent to Rs16.8bn. Mr Bajaj says that the company is well-placed to take advantage of the economic liberalisation which started three years ago. He argues it is important for the government to create conditions under which some Indian companies can become multinationals. Mr Bajaj last year joined a meeting of leading businessmen called the Bombay Club, which lobbied for industry-friendly economic policies but which was accused of being protectionist. Mr Bajaj rejects the allegation, saying government should support the entry of foreign investors but should also encourage domestic companies. 'Some Indian companies must become world-beaters,' he says. Bajaj is free of the messy diversifications which encumber many leading industrial groups. Under the 'licence raj', the system of industrial control which is now being dismantled, socialist-inclined governments placed ceilings on the investments any one company could make in an industry, in a futile effort to curb large-scale private enterprise. Groups chased growth by expanding into several industries at a time - often with poor results. But Bajaj stayed with making motorcycles. 'We stuck to our knitting,' says Mr Bajaj. 'and we always will.' Bajaj, which started manufacturing two-wheelers in 1961 under licence from Piaggio, made 900,000 last year and plans to produce around 1.8m vehicles by the year 2000. Its models, including scooters, motorcycles and three-wheeled auto-rickshaws, can be seen in almost every city and town in India. They are cheap - costing Rs17,000 to Rs20,000 for the most popular models - inexpensive to run and easy to repair. Mr Bajaj says: 'Indians are more interested in economy than in performance.' Cost control remains of paramount importance to Mr Bajaj. Price is the main weapon in battle with Japanese makers, both in India and, increasingly, abroad in developing countries. Exports, now less than 5 per cent of sales, are planned to rise to 15 per cent, with big gains expected in China, Vietnam and Mexico. Mr Bajaj says the company he most admires is Honda. But he says Bajaj Auto is now too big a rival for Honda or any other Japanese maker to consider a partnership. Bajaj last year held talks with Piaggio over a joint venture in India and worldwide collaboration with a possible exchange of equity. But these failed, so Bajaj is on its own in two-wheelers. The company's main aim in the next two years is to up-grade its models, including introducing new engines which will conform with tough new pollution laws which India is introducing in 1996. The only diversification Mr Bajaj will consider is the production of other kinds of vehicles. In 1987, he tried and failed to buy control of Ashok Leyland, the lorry producer. Recently he has revealed plans to manufacture cars. But he is not interested in the modest moves made by other Indian groups to manufacture 10,000 or 20,000 vehicles a year in partnership with foreign collaborators. These cars are aimed at the top end of the market. Mr Bajaj wants to produce cars for the ordinary man - 50,000 to 100,000 cars a year in high-volume, low-cost manufacturing. His model would compete with the Maruti 800, India's most popular car which sells for less than Rs200,000. Mr Bajaj has yet to set a timetable for his project or identify a foreign partner.</p>

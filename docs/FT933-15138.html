			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Row hampers talks on Ulster SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to try again to cajole unionist and nationalist leaders back into 'round-table' talks - in spite of a yawning gap that has emerged between the British and Irish governments. The row over Northern Ireland's future that erupted on Thursday may signal the end of a common approach between the two governments. As if conceding that talks will not re-start in the autumn, as envisaged by the UK, the Irish government is floating the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has gone further. He has raised the idea of 'joint sovereignty' in Ulster. He was slapped down on Thursday by Sir Patrick. Mr Spring had broken the 'cardinal principle' that agreement must be reached by consent. The squall reflects shifts in thinking both in London and Dublin. The British government has become more overtly unionist. More importantly, the prime minister departed from the usual script - that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population wished to remain - to say he was behind the union. The shift may be partly because of the Conservatives' increased reliance on the votes of Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster. More probably, it is just that the frustration of failing to re-start talks has provoked frank opinions. Irish officials believe unionists must not be allowed to make the running. But Mr Spring is also keen to make a mark for his Irish Labour party, the junior partner in the Irish government coalition. There is a desire to build on the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement which gave Dublin a token say in the affairs of the north. What will happen next? The most optimistic scenario is that unionists will be so encouraged by the UK's apparently hardened line that they will re-enter talks, dropping their insistance that the Irish government has first to modify its constitutional claim on the north. Perversely, a row between the British and Irish governments may soothe unionist fears about their constitutional future. More realistically, however, the Irish government's remarks will only further delay the resumption of talks. So Mr Spring's remarks could become self-fulfilling and the only way ahead would be for the two governments to come together and map out a future for Northern Ireland. The lesson he and Mr Reynolds have learned is that finding agreement between the two governments is as hard as finding a deal between the province's politicians.</p>

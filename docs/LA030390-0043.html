			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL: WIN SOME, LOSE SOME  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge played 841 men's basketball games in the 32 seasons it  competed at the NCAA Division II level, winning 420 and losing 421.  </P> <P> Coach Pete Cassidy, who has a career record of 284-223, won 115 CCAA games and  lost 113 over a span of 19 seasons.  </P> <P> Since 1985, the last season it earned a berth in the Division II playoffs, CSUN  is 66-68 overall.  </P> <P> Tentatively speaking: The 1989-90 basketball schedule that Northridge listed  inside the back cover of its media guide was tentative at best.  </P> <P> The Matadors will not play road games at Wyoming, Xavier and Dayton nor will  they play a home game against Virginia Commonwealth as previously reported.  However, CSUN will play host to Lamar.  </P> <P> Hit list: Northridge has reportedly expressed interest in recruiting Glendale  College basketball players Bruce Heicke, Justin Lord and Gary Fowler.  </P> <P> Conspicuous by his absence from that list is Dave Swanson, a 6-foot-5 sophomore  who scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the Vaqueros' 71-63 win  Wednesday over defending state champion Cerritos.  </P> <P> Swanson, a gifted leaper with a nice outside shot, transferred to Glendale from  . . . Northridge.  </P> <P> Two-liners: It has not taken long for Cal Lutheran's multitalented Brenda Lee  to adjust from playing basketball to softball. On Thursday, a day after scoring  a team-high 12 points in CLU's basketball playoff loss to Biola, Lee blasted a  grand slam for the Regal softball team against Cal State Dominguez Hills . . .  </P> <P> Denny Vigo, CSUN's sophomore third baseman, hit four home runs in three games  last week, giving him six this season. He had three in 187 at-bats last season  . . .  </P> <P> You won't find the Glendale College men's basketball team playing zone defense  because Coach Brian Beauchemin says it "sets you up for getting burned too many  ways." Adds Beauchemin, "The game is different now with the three-point shot  and so many players who can run the floor and do so many things."  </P> <P> Best of a bad situation: The play of Occidental center Chris Anderson was one  of the few bright spots in a disappointing basketball season for the Tigers,  who finished 10-14 overall and 6-6 in the Southern California Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> Anderson, a senior, was selected to the second-team NCAA Division III All-West  region team.  </P> <P> Occidental's fifth-place finish was its worst in five years.  </P> <P> Piping hot: Moorpark basketball Coach Al Nordquist says he would advise Golden  West, his team's opponent tonight in the state junior college basketball  tournament's round of 16, to go out to defend Raider point guard Sam Crawford  when he's on the perimeter.  </P> <P> "He's been shooting the lights out from three-point range," Nordquist said.  "They had better get out on his butt. But then, if they do go out, he'll  probably just go around them."  </P> <P> Such has been the dilemma for Moorpark opponents all season. Exactly how hot  Crawford has been of late Nordquist isn't quite sure.  </P> <P> "I've never been good with statistics like that," he said. "I just know the  generalities and I can tell you this -- he's been cookin.' "  </P></p>

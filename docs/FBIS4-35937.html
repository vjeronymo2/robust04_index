			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, who is currently in New York, has rejected the  separatist and apostate gang's announcement of a so-called new  government in Aden, describing it as illegitimate and  unrecognized. He also described it as a violation and  circumvention of the UN Security Council.    In a telephone conversation held with him from Doha by the  Qatari News Agency editor-in-chief, the Presidential Council  member stressed that all the Yemeni people support unity and do  not approve of what is being done by the secessionist elements  in Aden. He said the separatists obstructed all positive  initiatives designed to overcome our country's current crisis.  He explained: When we announced a cease-fire on the eve of  the blessed 'Id al-Adha, they issued the declaration of  secession. Now, when a UN Security Council resolution has been  issued calling for peace and stability in our country, they  declare the formation of a secessionist government.    The Presidential Council member reiterated that our country  welcomes the UN Security Council resolution and deals with it on  condition that all those concerned cooperate with the  implementation of the resolution. He said the resolution  proceeds from the principles and the charter of the United  Nations, for it calls for respecting the unity and sovereignty  of the entire territory of the Republic of Yemen. He explained  that our country's approval of the UN Security Council  resolution is not considered a change in its policy. He  explained: We welcomed the resolution after we found that it  does not contravene the Republic of Yemen's unity and  sovereignty over its entire territory. Consequently, the  resolution has been dealt with. He stressed that as a UN  member, our country could not have prevented the UN Security  Council from debating any issue. He explained that the UN  Security Council will be submitted to the Presidential Council,  given that the executive authority in the Republic of Yemen is  made up of the Presidential Council and the Council of Ministers.    The Presidential Council member welcomed the appointment of  Lakhdar Ibrahim as a representative of the UN secretary general  to lead the fact-finding committee. He described Ibrahimi as an  esteemed Arab personality worthy of this mission.</p>

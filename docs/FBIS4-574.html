			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There has been a major shake up in the top ranks of  the Sierra Leonean Army. Among the 14 senior officers who have  been sacked is the head of the Army, and it comes at a time when  the military is finding itself stretched in its drive against  the RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels. This month, the  RUF has staged attacks in northern Sierra Leone for the first  time in their three-year-old rebellion. From Freetown, Victor  Sylver telexed this report.    The Defense Department in Freetown has sent the head of the  Army, Major General Jusu Gottoh, and 13 top military officers on  compulsory retirement. A spokesman from the Defense Department  said the decision had been taken in the best interest of the  Army and the country. He did not elaborate further. Apart from  Gen. Gottoh, Brigadier (Modibo Lyman), and Brigadier Joy Toure,  a former brigade commander and current head of the Army's  training center, have also been retired. Four colonels and five  lieutenant colonels, including the commanding officer of the 2d  Battalion based in Makeni, as well as a major and a captain are  also on the list.    Although the official reason given for the move is that it  is  in the best interests of the Army and state, speculation is rife  that the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] Government  is impatient with the pace of the war and with the apparent  success of the rebels. Ordinary Sierra Leoneans are sometimes  taken by surprise to note an escalation in rebel activities just  when they were beginning to be optimistic that the war would  soon come to an end. It would seem that recent action taken by  the rebels to hold a section of the Bo-Kenema Highway, and moves  to do the same on the Masingbe Matotaka-Kono Highway has finally  sapped the government's patience.    The first promise made by the men of the 29 April Revolution  when they came to power two years ago was to bring the rebel war  to a speedy conclusion. The man now charged with this  responsibility is Colonel (Kelly Conte), who is the new head of  the Army. Sierra Leoneans are eagerly watching to see if he can  perform the long-awaited miracle.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Hans Blix, general director of the International  Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA], continues his visit to Moscow.  Today he met Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister for atomic  energy. Problems of ensuring the safety of weapons-grade  uranium and plutonium released during the dismantling of nuclear  warheads were discussed. Other topics under discussion included  the safety of storing radioactive elements and joint projects to  ensure safety at atomic power stations.    In a conversation with journalists Hans Blix highly  appraised  the prospects for the best Russian atomic technological  processes in the world markets, first and foremost in the area  of state-of-the-art reactor technology, and the production of  isotopes and of enriched uranium.    The IAEA general director also gave new details concerning  the North Korean nuclear problem. The agency extended to the  DPRK technical assistance in the area of development of atomic  power engineering for peaceful purposes only, checking the  activities which have been officially notified and the relevant  nuclear facilities and materials.    The IAEA began to suspect Pyongyang of concealing certain  data and of supplying incomplete and inaccurate data. In an  attempt to have the situation clarified, the IAEA demanded that  two new facilities should be made available for inspection. The  conflict began when Pyongyang refused.    So far it is difficult, on the basis of the current data, to  speculate how close North Korea is to making nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Forty-seven years ago,  hundreds of people were slaughtered in Taiwan during an uprising  against the Chiang Kai-shek government, and thousands more  around the island were believed arrested and killed in the  crackdown that followed. Today, the nation was quietly  commemorating the tragedy in spite of the hurt deep in the minds  of many people.    In Taipei Monday morning, more than 300 relatives of those  who lost their lives at the massacre, better known as "2-28  Incident," attended a memorial concert sponsored by Soochow  University along with ranking government officials and scholars.    Chang Hsiao-tsu, president of the university, said the  concert was intended "to commemorate the victims regardless of  their age, sex and birthplace."    "The hosting of the concert," Chang said, "is aimed to allow  us an occasion to review the historical tragedy so as to avoid  the recurrence of similar incidents." It was the second such  concert held by the university.    The 1947 uprising was sparked after a government official  beat a woman selling untaxed cigarettes. Angry crowds later  stormed government offices as native Taiwanese erupted in a fury  against what they saw as an oppressive Chiang Kai-shek regime.    Chiang responded by sending troops from the mainland, which  the nationalists still ruled, to Taiwan, which had just reverted  to Chinese control after 50 years of rule by Japan. It is still  unclear as to how many people were killed during the initial  uprising and the subsequent period of "white terror." The  incident had been a taboo topic of conversation until a few  years ago, but with Taiwan's increasing democratization has  become a much-debated subject. A report by a special task force  of the Executive Yuan put the number of victims at around  18,000-28,000.    Chen Wei-chao, president of National Taiwan University,  likened the incident to an untended gash. "The cut was so deep  and wide that the wound could hardly be healed, even though  nearly five decades have elapsed," said Chen, also a noted  surgeon.    The government has apologized for the incident, and is  building monuments and mapping out relief measures to compensate  the victims, but "the spiritual wounds are hard to heal," Chen  said.    In the southern city of Kaohsiung, [word indistinct] Wu  Tun-yi chaired a memorial service in front of a monument to the  victims. He said he hopes the wounds can be gradually healed and  thus pave the way for a more harmonious society.    Wang [words indistinct] president of the Kaohsiung  association on the victims of 2-28 Incident, said he was pleased  [words indistinct] here paying great [word indistinct] and  concern to the relatives of the victims, but he is still hoping  the government will [words indistinct] a national holiday.    Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui also attended a concert  held  to commemorate the 2-28 Incident at Taipei's National Concert  Hall Monday evening. Li said he hopes through music, the  historic wounds can be cleansed and then lingering hatred  dispersed.</p>

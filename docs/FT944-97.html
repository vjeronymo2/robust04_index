			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: French fears French markets were supposed to pick up this year, as they benefited from economic recovery and low inflation and interest rates. But the CAC-40 has underperformed the DAX by 7 per cent and the FT-SE 100 by 9 per cent. French 10-year bonds were yielding less than German bunds in January, but now yield 60 basis points more. This week the franc hit a 13-month low against the D-Mark. In theory, the markets should, at last, stage their recovery during 1995. The economy is making reasonable progress, with industrial production up about 2 per cent. Inflation, at only 1.6 per cent, does not appear an immediate problem, particularly as capacity utilisation is limited to 83 per cent. But prospects, at least for early in the year, are not propitious. French markets, like those in Spain and Italy, are overshadowed by the threat of a rise in German interest rates. For the franc fort policy to be defended, any increase in Germany would need a compensatory rise in France. That could stifle French economic growth at a time when there is no inflationary threat and hit the equities market which has already discounted strong earnings expansion. In any case, the markets are unlikely to move forward until April because of the presidential elections. The decision by Mr Jacques Delors, the franc fort's strongest supporter, not to run for office has contributed markedly to the markets' turbulence. Mr Edouard Balladur, the most likely future president, is viewed as economically sound. But the fear is that populist Euro-sceptical candidates could force him to make concessions during the campaign that might undermine European economic convergence. The markets are unlikely to stage a rally until after the elections unless Mr Balladur's lead in the opinion polls strengthens further.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts: Frankfurt, the end of an aria - The cultural crisis that has devastated the financial heart of Germany To the outsider, Frankfurt betrays little sign of cultural malaise. Its annual music festival has just staged four world premieres. Recent celebrations marking the city's 1,200th anniversary featured the Metropolitan Opera and a succession of international orchestras. Next month, the Frankfurt Opera will perform Wagner's Ring, the most challenging work in the repertory. Like the Frankfurt skyline, these events conjure an image of confidence and prosperity. Behind the image, however, lies a devastated city. The vibrant, progressive culture of Frankfurt in the 1980s is now history - a victim of recession, reunification costs and political paralysis. Formerly one of Germany's richest cities, Frankfurt is now its most indebted. It can no longer afford to support its own cultural life, and has imposed the biggest cutbacks ever known in postwar Germany. It may have won the race to house a future European central bank, but it has lost its place in the vanguard of the arts. Only a year ago, civic leaders were hopeful that damage to the arts could be limited if budget cuts were evenly spread. That view turns out to have been short-sighted. Instead of stabilising, the city's finances have worsened, and political pressure on cultural spending has increased. Within 18 months the arts budget has shrunk by 13 per cent. This has had little impact on the wage-bill - civic employees cannot be made jobless against their will - but it has decimated morale and creative output. The Frankfurt Festival, the most important event in the musical calendar, is being axed. For the past 13 years, it has commissioned new and experimental work, and given an international platform to local talent. This month's premieres are the last. The Alte Oper, the main concert venue, is privatising box office and technical services, and curtailing its own promotions. In future, it will focus on popular concerts, touring orchestras and self-financing events like the Met visit. Local choral and instrumental groups, which until recently formed the backbone of the programme, are being marginalised. The Frankfurt Opera's 1994-95 programme is limited to 100 performances - half the 1986 total. Several productions, including The Ring, have been borrowed from elsewhere, and the company will suffer the indignity of vacating its theatre at Christmas to make way for a touring musical. It may have to suspend all activity for the second half of next year - a tough prescription for a city which has traditionally counted itself one of Germany's musical centres. The artistic director, Sylvain Cambreling, has threatened to resign if the situation does not improve. Although performing arts companies are the worst affected, the visual arts have also suffered. In January, museums were forced to introduce admission charges. Special exhibitions must now be self-financing. As a result, the museums for modern art, handicrafts and architecture have suffered a 30 to 50 per cent drop in visitors. 'This reduces the legitimacy of museums in the eyes of politicians,' says Hellmut Seemann, managing director of the Schirn Kunsthalle, where the budget has been cut by 27 per cent. 'They can now argue that no one is interested, making it easier for them to carry on cutting. What is going on is a tragedy. We need to build a cultural policy not from the viewpoint of the finance ministry, but with an eye for the long-term benefit to society.' Frankfurt has suffered more than other German cities for a variety of reasons. It has a smaller population than Hamburg or Cologne, and more low-paid foreigners. There are huge social problems, with drugs and unemployment high on the list. The better-paid white-collar workers - the biggest cultural consumers - live and pay their taxes outside Frankfurt in the state of Hesse. But unlike other German states with big regional centres, Hesse pays nothing to support Frankfurt's theatres and museums - a cause of much bitterness. Frankfurt also had further to fall. Thanks to the visionary policies of the former Social Democratic culture commissioner, Hilmar Hoffmann, it enjoyed a period of artistic regeneration on the back of the 1980s economic boom. Hoffmann helped to create the Museumsufer - a row of museums along the banks of the river Main. The Alte Oper, built from the ashes of the war-bombed opera house, transformed concert life when it opened in 1981. At the 'new' opera house, the radical policies of Michael Gielen won worldwide acclaim. The boom encouraged a free-spending mentality. At one point, there was even talk of dropping all charges for theatre tickets. The recession brought Frankfurt down to earth - but the authorities have done little to cushion the fall. Weakened by instability, the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has resorted to piecemeal cost-cutting, instead of formulating a coherent policy. Hoffmann's successor, Linda Reisch, has not provided the leadership necessary to fight the arts' corner. This has helped fuel a divisive debate about the city's responsibilities. Those advocating self-support for the arts are currently in the ascendant. 'When money is short, we need to be more businesslike, to cover our costs,' says Rudolf Sailer, manager of the Alte Oper. 'We need artists who are well known and have credit with the public. You can't always be crying 'more for culture'.' Such a view runs contrary to Frankfurt's traditions. 'It also offers no hope for the future,' says Dieter Rexroth, outgoing director of the Frankfurt Festival. 'The purpose of subsidy is to support events which are not commercially viable, but have a special purpose and value to the community. If you subject the arts to the same cost-cutting measures as a factory, you stunt your creative roots - you'll end up with the same circus of touring orchestras as every other city. That's not culture.' The debate is especially relevant to the Frankfurt Opera, for which the financial squeeze is only one of several blows it has received since Gielen left in 1987. The company was devastated by the fire which destroyed the opera house shortly after Gielen's successor, Gary Bertini, took office. Bertini never won the company's confidence, and his early departure cost DM2m in unfulfilled contractual obligations, plus a lot of damaging publicity. The company's image has been further weakened in recent months by a dispute between Cambreling (who arrived last year) and the administrative director, Martin Steinhoff, over how to combat a 30 per cent cut in subsidy. Cambreling, formerly Gerard Mortier's music director at the Monnaie in Brussels, had no warning of the cut when he agreed to come to Frankfurt. By general consent he has put together an interesting programme and raised standards. But he sees little point in staying if the company gives only 50 performances a year - as planned for 1995 - and reduces the size of chorus and orchestra. Cambreling accuses Steinhoff of favouring the Frankfurt Ballet and acting as a message-boy for the city government. For his part, Steinhoff says Cambreling has failed to confront reality. At present, the company spends an average DM100,000 per performance on guest singers, on top of the fixed costs of a permanent company. According to Steinhoff, the choice lies between changing over to a 'festival' system like the Chatelet in Paris - bringing in guests for limited-series productions and doing away with permanent overheads; or building an ensemble of salaried singers on the old German Stadttheater principle - meaning fewer stars, lower artistic standards, but regular performances. 'At present we have a mixture which is not financially viable. We need to forge a pact, because it would be the final blow for Frankfurt if Cambreling resigned.'</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: New chairman for P-E Intl P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computing group which includes Mr David Bellamy's environmental consultancy among its subsidiaries, has appointed a new executive chairman and assured shareholders that it will pay an unchanged dividend of 6.2p in spite of a poor trading performance. The new chairman is Mr George Cox, 51, co-founder and former managing director of Butler Cox, a London-based consultancy bought by Computer Sciences Corporation of the US last year. Mr Hugh Lang, who will be 60 later this year, has decided to retire after 30 years with P-E to give more time to other interests including the chairmanship of Brammar, the industrial distribution and rental services group. The announcement came earlier than was originally anticipated as expectation of poor results drove P-E's share price down to a low of 103p compared with its 1991-92 high of 195p. Profits were down by a third at the interim stage and Mr Lang warned that the second six months would also be disappointing, although sales had picked up since the new year. Mr Cox intends to continue to reduce fixed costs - perhaps through innovative remuneration schemes - while seeking new sources of recurring revenue through longer term relationships with clients. He thought the consultancy business could significantly improve its marketing skills. 'At Butler Cox we were among the best at marketing ourselves and we were terrible,' he said.</p>

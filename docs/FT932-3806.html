			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Russians anxious to avoid troop role in Bosnia RUSSIA yesterday declined to make a firm commitment to contribute troops for the protection of the six Moslem enclaves designated in Bosnia, though it said it was in principle in favour of such a move. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said during a meeting of the 34-nation Nato Co-operation Council, grouping the western allies and the former Soviet and east European states, that Russia wanted a clearer definition of the mandate for the deployment of Russian troops in Bosnia before it could take such a decision. Mr Kozyrev said in an interview with American television that before Russia could send troops to Bosnia, 'we need a much clearer definition of the mandate from the Security Council. . . a definition of what these troops would do.' Russia already has troops serving under the United Nations banner in Croatia, but is clearly digging in its heels on sending troops to Bosnia because of the opposition of powerful conservative political forces and the Russian military to what they consider essentially an anti-Serb measure. The reluctance of the Russians, which comes on top of the US's refusal to offer ground troops for the protection of the Moslem safe areas, must be considered a serious setback to international efforts to ensure the defence of the enclaves. However, Thursday's decision by the Nato Council to provide warplanes to counter any attacks on UN troops protecting the safe areas at least partially offsets the adverse consequences of the lack of a sufficient number of ground troops. The absence of firm ground troop offers from some of the most important western and eastern nations did not prevent the Co-operation Council from fully endorsing the joint action programme adopted by the US, Russia, France, the UK and Spain in Washington last month, under which the safe areas are being set up. It also fully endorsed the decision by the Nato Council taken 24 hours earlier to provide protective air power in case of attack against UN forces in Bosnia in the performance of their mandate. At the opening of the meeting, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, warned of the dangers Europe faced from ethnic violence after the Cold War. 'The war in the former Yugoslavia has shown a growing gap between our hopeful vision of a new security order and the tragic reality of ethnic violence,' he said.</p>

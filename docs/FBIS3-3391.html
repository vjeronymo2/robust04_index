Last year, China's total investment accounted for nearly 50  percent of the country's national income, and the investment  structure was irrational. Then, just how big an investment  scale is appropriate? The deputies said we should follow the  principle proposed by experts in this field -- that is, the  proportion of a nation's investment should be decided based on  the nation's economic development stage, the level of its  economic development, and its current economic development  conditions. If the investment scale is too small, it is  difficult for its economy to develop rapidly. If the investment  scale is too large, its industrial production will inevitably  grow at a high speed, directly resulting in excessive currency  issuance and acute shortage of funds, consequently prompting  sharp increases in the prices of capital goods and retail  prices. The scale of investment has a direct effect on whether  a basic balance can be maintained between the total supply and  the total demand -- we must never underestimate its effect.    In investing, another problem warrants our attention -- that  is, we should properly handle the amounts of investments. The  deputies were of the opinion that good steel should be used for  making the knife's edge -- we should use more funds for  developing the "bottleneck" industries, such as the  transportation, communications, energy, and raw and processed  materials industries, which have impeded the country's economic  development; and should not invest a lot of money in building  luxury houses and recreational facilities and in real estate  development. In other words, we should refrain from doing  things that are not in line with the country's current economic  development level and the people's living standards. The  deputies said: We should do things according to economic law and  set our eyes on the overall situation and long-term objectives.  We must invest more where we need to and resolutely curtail  investment where we need not to invest large amounts -- we must  not put the cart before the horse.</p>

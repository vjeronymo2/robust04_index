			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Raid on Miramar shares may herald takeover war A TAKEOVER battle for Miramar Hotel and Investment between some of Hong Kong's biggest property market participants appeared likely last night when Henderson Investment told the Hong Kong stock exchange it had acquired an interest in the company. Henderson's raid on Miramar came as Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific, Beijing's stock market listed vehicle in the colony, raised the value of their offer for the company by HKDollars 550m to HKDollars 9.25bn (USDollars 1.19bn) in an attempt to placate a disgruntled Miramar board. Miramar is seen by property analysts in Hong Kong as being one of the best companies with access to the colony's tightly held property market. The company has extensive land holdings on the Kowloon peninsula which are seen by analysts as ideal for redevelopment. It owns the 500-room Miramar Hotel in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon's main tourist district, as well as 900,000 sq ft of office space. Analysts believe either or both properties could be redeveloped to increase lettable space and to tap the growing market for strata titled (joint ownership) office space. It was unclear last night how much of Miramar Henderson Investment had acquired. Talk in Hong Kong's stock market put the interest above 30 per cent. If so, this would indicate that Miramar's two substantial shareholders had accepted Henderson's offer. Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific were forced to raise their offer for Miramar shares by HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 16.5 a share, and by HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 9.50 for the company's warrants. The two came under pressure to raise their bid - which was announced on June 10 - after a senior executive of Miramar rejected the offer claiming it was 'unfriendly' and asserted the company was worth HKDollars 20 a share. Additionally, the company's share price has consistently traded above the offer price. Miramar, which was suspend-ed from trading yesterday, ended Thursday's trading at HKDollars 16.20.</p>

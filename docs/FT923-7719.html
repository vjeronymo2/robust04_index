			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Anger at PW move over salaries A DECISION by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, to raise starting pay for graduates has angered rival firms, Andrew Jack writes. Five of the six biggest firms have traditionally kept salary levels comparable with one another, while Arthur Andersen has maintained a slightly higher entry-level rate. But Price Waterhouse has now increased its salaries for students joining the firm in London in the autumn from Pounds 12,500 to Pounds 14,000. Price Waterhouse's move comes at a time when the graduate job market is depressed and accountancy firms are cutting recruitment and staffing. Two other firms - Ernst &amp; Young and Coopers &amp; Lybrand - have increased salaries to the same level. KPMG Peat Marwick and Touche Ross have maintained their starting salaries at Pounds 12,500, while Arthur Andersen is offering Pounds 15,000 this year. Mr David Wilson, national marketing partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said the decision to raise salaries was driven by Price Waterhouse and would cost his firm about Pounds 500,000 in additional salaries. Price Waterhouse said last night it had increased salaries as part of a regular review of competitive rates.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool is selling very well in Australia at firm prices. Clearances are over 90pc and this is in a week when offerings are high. Holidays are now virtually finished and this could be helping to keep up demand. The currency situation is of importance all around the world. Wool priced in the US or the closely associated Australian dollar is firm in price and historically not very cheap. In terms of sterling and European currencies it has been easing and is cheap - getting quite close to the low points registered last season. Apart from currency volatility, and the short-term outlook for it, recession is keeping the wool trade subdued.</p>

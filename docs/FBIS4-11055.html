			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "With Life Hanging by a Thread"] </F>   [Text] The only sector that suffered net losses in 1993 was  textiles. While not on its deathbed as some analysts believe it  is, its problems are far from being solved.    The economic liberalization has not been a good thing for  Colombian textiles and the future of the industry looks rather  grim. "In 1992, Colombia exported $840 million worth of textiles  and ready-to-wear garments, one-third of all industrial exports.  However, how much longer can it stay in the market?" asks the  latest edition of THE ECONOMIST after analyzing the problems  facing the country's textile mills. "Last year," the prestigious  publication continues, "nearly 5,000 textile jobs were lost in  Medellin alone, profits collapsed, and several dozen small firms  had to close their doors."    The situation is truly dramatic. According to an analysis  done for the Superintendency of Securities based on the 1993  financial results of 86 companies in the manufacturing sector  whose securities are registered with the National Registry of  Securities and Middlemen, the only economic sector that suffered  net losses last year was textiles. Of the 14 companies included  in the sampling, six--including Tejicondor and COLTEJER  [Colombian Textile Company]--suffered losses and only three of  the other eight improved their financial situation (see box).    What is more serious is the fact that despite the  government's efforts to plug some of the holes that caused the  crisis, such as the elimination of minimum import prices and the  free entry of fabrics into the country, the sector's prospects  are not at all bright. The world market is glutted and  incentives to smuggle remain great. Dumping is far from  disappearing, Customs has not caught up with the requirements of  liberalization, and revaluation has hurt the ability of  Colombian textiles to compete on the world market. It is  therefore not surprising that shareholders in the country's  largest companies meeting in recent days demanded better  treatment for the industry from the government.  <H5>  Domestic Scene </H5>   Not all the sector's ills are the fault of the international  environment or government policy, however, says one prestigious  American consulting firm. For over a year, Monitor has been  completing a diagnosis of the ability of Colombian  industry--including textiles--to compete and last week submitted  its conclusions in Bogota and Medellin. According to analyst  Michael Fairbanks, the sector's biggest companies, such as  COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, are facing an unprecedented  fall if they do not want to be pushed out by China, Pakistan,  and India, whose low-cost production is flooding the world  market. Furthermore, in Fairbanks' opinion, it would almost be  better to close the existing companies and replace them with new  ones that are more vigorous and aggressive.    The textile companies feared the result of the Monitor  studies, but emphatically reject such a radical solution, i.e.,  pulling the plug on the big companies and precipitating their  death throes. "If dying and being born were so easy, we would  have heaven in our hands," COLTEJER President Rene Gomez told  SEMANA.    In terms of its ability to compete, Monitor gives the  national industry low grades in four key areas. Looking at the  so-called advanced factors, it fails in terms of basic  infrastructure (highways and ports), telecommunications,  technological experience, and professional training. It has  little or nothing to offer in terms of competitive strategies.  Effort is poor in the area of common trade guild objectives. The  lag in the makeup of the domestic market is worrisome. Only one  of its two traditional comparative advantages, geography, still  ranks above average. The other, wages, has also begun to sag.    The truth is that labor liabilities have the three Colombian  giants: COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, on their knees.  COLTEJER has one retired worker for every two on the job, and  the ratio at Fabricato is practically the same. Even Tejicondor,  which has had no union since the 1982 crisis and has thus been  able to negotiate with its employees directly, has only four  active workers for every one retired. "When the economy was  closed, the private sector managed some of the retired workers  and handled certain benefits," Gomez says, "but under the  economic liberalization, that social burden has been transferred  to the government." As a result, led by COLTEJER, Antioquia's  textile companies intend to present new alternatives so that the  government will shoulder the responsibility for retired workers.  "That social function belongs to it," Gomez adds.    Nevertheless, the companies recognize that some progress has  been made in terms of benefits, in particular, passage of Law  50, the system of work providing no benefits. In the case of  Tejicondor, for example, the company has managed to place 90  percent of its personnel roster (1,835 persons) under the new  regime. In addition, most of the company's new contracts are for  a set term. "Our average seniority no longer exceeds four  years," SEMANA was told by Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil.  At COLTEJER, half of the 7,200 workers opted for the new system,  while at Fabricato, 60 percent of the 5,330 employees did so.    However, progress made in this field has been lost in the  area of wages, which rise daily in relative terms. When compared  with other Latin American countries, Colombia's minimum wage has  surpassed that of Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile. When one adds  the accelerated rate of the revaluation, the labor advantage  shrinks even further. For this reason, textiles now being  produced in Colombia include finished (and sometimes complex)  components because making rough fabrics is no longer profitable.  <H5>  A Little Bit of Everything </H5>   Concerning the Colombian supply, Monitor criticizes the  practice of making a little bit of everything for an  underdeveloped national market that consumes five kg of fabric a  year compared with a world average of 25. COLTEJER, Fabricato,  and Tejicondor recognize that the multiplicity of lines is a  drawback and have begun to make significant cuts. "Monitor is  right about this business of trying to produce everything,"  Perez admits. As head of Tejicondor, he has cut his factory's  lines from 100 to 33. The immediate effects include a  substantial improvement in quality and a tangible reduction in  costs.    Monitor recognizes that changes introduced by the textile  companies in this direction have been positive because they have  given Colombia a new competitive outlook it did not have before.  "Most of the competitive innovations in Colombian industry can  be seen in the textile sector," Fairbanks says, while suggesting  even deeper scrutiny: "The bottom line is that the lines  produced by Colombian textile companies are so elementary that  they are easily copied, which explains the takeoff of Asian  producers."    The fact is that Colombia is still far from creating a  movement of style and ready-to-wear clothing enabling it to  impose trends and brand names as the garment industry  multinationals have done. "In this area, there are international  trade barriers that hurt us," says Fabricato President Jorge  Restrepo. "Turning Colombian brands into stylish name brands  will take previously unheard-of levels of time, investments,  marketing, and advertising which we are not prepared to make."    Monitor points to what it considers a serious flaw in the  primitive articulation of the Colombian textile chain, a fact  which the presidents of the main national companies accept, but  which they largely blame on the government. The price of cotton  is one example. Manufacturers are forced to buy and pay for  Colombia's total production at the international price, plus an  additional duty of 10 percent. In Asia, Colombia's main  competitor, the price paid by manufacturers for raw materials is  25 percent under the world price. By trying to protect cotton  producers, the textile companies say, the government hurts  manufacturers.    Monitor also criticizes the Colombian manufacturers' custom  of operating as sealed units, preventing anyone else from  discovering their secrets. There is no true guild spirit that  serves to stimulate every link in the chain. While this is  true--and the entrepreneurs admit they have all been very  accustomed to going their own separate ways--they have recently  begun to obtain state-of-the-art information, share data on  world style trends, buy raw materials as a bloc, and respect  each other's markets.    Nor do their efforts end there. Another effort to remedy  shortcomings pointed out by Monitor involves industrial  conversion. The textile firms say they have invested over $400  million in state-of-the-art technology in order to catch up with  the latest market developments, a step that has already gained  recognition. For example, the ECONOMIST article points to the  plans of COLTEJER, which "has cut its labor force from 8,900 to  7,200 in a matter of just a few months, invested $32 million in  manufacturing systems, and cut back on its range of  production"--previously amounting to some 4,000 lines--"by more  than half."    In short, Monitor's diagnosis is not far removed from  reality, but some of its conclusions are nothing new to the  entrepreneurs. Many of them were already in the works.    Consequently, while relying on more active government  intervention in terms of Customs supervision and control of the  exchange rate, they look to the future with more optimism than  does Monitor. "We shall make the necessary efforts, but we  cannot change overnight without causing serious social  problems," Gomez says. "If we were to accept all the  recommendations, we might make our business more profitable, but  we would be leaving the government with a serious social crisis,  which we cannot do. We shall view it as our social mission."

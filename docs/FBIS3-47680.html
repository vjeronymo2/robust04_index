			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The chairman of a House of  Councillors political reform committee said Monday [17 January]  he will wrap up debate on a package of government-proposed  political reform bills on the committee floor Wednesday.    Yubun Ueno's comment paves the way for voting on the bills  by  the committee later the same day.    "I decided to hold a panel session on January 19 prior to a  final vote," Ueno said.    The government and the seven-party ruling coalition have  been  trying to force the bills through the committee by Wednesday and  through the House of Councillors by Friday at the latest.    The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed a  plan  to modify 10 points in the government's bills as a condition for  endorsing them, but the coalition rejected them and is ready to  get the bills through the committee and an upper house plenary  session without any revision.    The bills cleared the more powerful House of Representatives  on November 18.    Two of the 10 points demanded by the LDP are a continuation  of donations by enterprises and groups to individual politicians  and a ban on visits by candidates to the homes of voters.    The LDP also called for revising the system whereby votes  are  counted by treating the whole of Japan as an electoral district  for proportional representation in lower house elections.    The government bills allow candidates to visit voters' homes  for 12 hours from 8 A.M. during campaign days and bar firms and  groups from donating money to individual politicians.    The government wants 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats  decided by proportional representation, cutting the current  total of 511 seats in the lower house to 500.    The lower chamber killed the LDP-proposed bills on November  18.    The bills, designed to revamp Japan's corruption-tainted  politics, set the amount of public money available annually for  political activities at 30.9 billion yen, a figure proposed by  the LDP, down from the coalition's initial proposal of 41.4  billion yen.    The upper house delayed deliberation of the government's  bills after they cleared the lower house, and the Diet voted  December 15 to extend for 45 days beyond the deadline of the  90-day session to January 29.</p>

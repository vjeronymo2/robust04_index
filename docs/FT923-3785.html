			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow Pounds 16m loss prompts dividend cut to 0.5p TAYLOR WOODROW yesterday became the second large UK construction company within 24 hours to announce an interim dividend cut after incurring a first-half pre-tax loss. It is reducing its payment from 1.86p to 0.5p following a loss of Pounds 16m in the six months ended June 30. That compared with a profit of Pounds 25.3m at the same stage last year. Turnover fell by almost a quarter from Pounds 759.3m to Pounds 579.8m. The loss was arrived at after a Pounds 21m provision to cover falling housing and commercial property prices. Losses per share were 3.5p, against earnings of 4.9p. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, blamed the loss on 'the severity of the deep and prolonged recession in the UK construction, housing and property businesses.' He added that there was 'little reason for optimism about prospects in the UK economy for the second half of 1992.' The group planned to achieve a Pounds 20m reduction in overheads by 1993 through cutting costs across all operations. The company published its results a day after Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder, announced that it had ran up a Pounds 7.2m first half loss and was halving its interim dividend to 2p. Taylor Woodrow's share price, which had fallen by two thirds since it peaked at 143p in May, dropped a further 19 per cent to 35p yesterday. Most of its businesses remained under pressure in the first half with no sign of any slackening in the recession in the UK residential and commercial property markets. More than Pounds 17m of provisions were against housebuilding. Commercial property profits, said Mr Parsons, were depressed by an absence of disposals, which had earned the company Pounds 18m last year. It did not provide a breakdown of divisional profits but stockbrokers estimated that it had made about Pounds 8m from property in 1992. This was helped by a 15 per cent net increase in rents following reviews and letting of completed buildings. Contracting was thought to have incurred a loss of some Pounds 10m after provisions on overseas operations, mostly against claims for work on the Euro Disney development in Paris. UK contracting, which broke even, had seen a sharp drop in turnover as demand for domestic construction fell. Housing profits were understood to have been no more than Pounds 1m, despite an increase of worldwide sales from 724 to 819 units. The UK, where the bulk of the sales increase was thought to have come, operated at a small loss as margins continued to come under pressure. North American housing profits, which were underpinned by a solid performance from Monarch in Canada, were thought to have been in the region of Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m. Net debt at June 30 of Pounds 167m was Pounds 12m higher than at the year end when the group reported gearing of 23 per cent. Borrowings since the half year, however, were understood to have risen to approaching Pounds 200m. COMMENT In the middle of a tempest all you can do is batten down the hatches and try to ride out the storm. To save the vessel, it may be necessary to jettison anything that is not essential for the rest of the voyage. That is the position many of Britain's construction companies find themselves in at the moment, battered by the worst recession to hit the industry for half a century. Taylor Woodrow is working hard to reduce overheads and preserve cash for which it deserves credit. The problem is to identify where earnings growth is to come from once the recession ends. Housing and commercial property markets, post recovery, are likely to remain dull in low inflation economy. For this year losses could be about Pounds 10m, or higher if further provisions are needed to counter falling UK house prices.</p>

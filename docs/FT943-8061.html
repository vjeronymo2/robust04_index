			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cleaning up plastic recycling Attempts to recycle waste plastic usually run into difficulties because chloride-based plastics emit hydrogen chloride and other harmful by-products. Toshiba, the Japanese corporation, has started a pilot plant which overcomes this problem by adding a high-density alkaline solution during the heating process. This transforms hydrogen chloride into a harmless salt, allowing the fuel oil to be reclaimed without contamination. The pilot plant can handle a maximum of 250kg of waste plastics from Toshiba's factories in an 11-hour reclamation process. The company expects to start up full-scale commercial plants at the end of next year. Toshiba: Japan, tel 3457 2105; fax 3456 4776.</p>

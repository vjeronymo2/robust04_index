			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier in uncertain session THE UK stock market rounded off a successful week yesterday with an uncertain session which left share prices little changed from the close of the previous day. London was again influenced by the New York market, easing at first following the fall in the Dow overnight but rallying towards the close when New York recovered 5 points early in its new session. Concern over the international outlook deepened as Unilever shares reacted badly to first-quarter results which disclosed that, despite good profits overall, Europe and the US had lagged. Hopes for an early cut in UK base rates appeared to fade somewhat in spite of a steadier performance by the sterling rate index. Traders said that a number of sizeable clients were in the market, on both sides of the trading ledgers. BT, badly hit on the previous day, recovered strongly in good turnover, reflecting in part demand for utility-type stocks from the US. Transatlantic investors have reacted sharply to fears of renewed inflation in the US economy. This week has seen the stock market influenced strongly by stock index futures dealings, often a reflection of uncertain investment sentiment. Seaq business remained fairly high yesterday, totalling 620m shares compared with 797.6m on Thursday. Retail, or customer, business has held steady this week, Thursday's value total settling at Pounds 1.57bn. The FT-SE Index closed last night at 2,847, a net loss of 2.3 on the session after dipping to the 2,838 area in the first half of the session. Over the week, the Footsie has risen by 53.3 points or around 1.9 per cent as the political misfortunes of the UK government have been translated into hopes that these might force cuts in UK base rates. The second line stocks, which shared less significantly in the general equity shakeout which followed the government's resounding setback in the UK county council and an important by-election, have also made ground this week. At 3,142.3 last night, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 9.6 off on the day at 3,142.3. But the Mid 250 gained 1 per cent over the week and on Thursday brushed its all-time trading peak of 3,156.9. Trading volume in non-Footsie stocks, strong all week, dipped slightly yesterday to make up only 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total, compared with an average daily contribution of around 62 per cent.</p>

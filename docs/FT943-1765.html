			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas highlights recovery with 11% rise The recovery in the UK building market was once again highlighted yesterday when Tilbury Douglas, the construction group, reported an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits on continuing operations at Pounds 6.1m for the first six months of the year. Overall, the pre-tax figure showed a fall from Pounds 12.8m, although this included the Pounds 6.8m proceeds from the sale of Douglas Concrete among the exceptional items. Tilbury's equipment division was the driving force behind the growth, with pre-tax profits there increasing nearly threefold to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 593,000) on turnover 17 per cent higher at Pounds 14.49m (Pounds 12.35m). Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said that overseas contracts had bolstered the performance, with the group providing the equipment needs for some high profile projects, such as the Pounds 10m Ma Wan Viaduct project in Hong Kong. Within group turnover ahead 18 per cent to Pounds 199.07m (Pounds 169.35m), construction accounted for Pounds 172.12m (Pounds 139.62m) - an increase of 23 per cent. However, profits declined 14 per cent to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.52m). Mr Bottjer blamed tighter margins, although he added that the benefit from the higher turnover would feed through to the profit line during the second half. Profits in the Scottish housing division fell from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.3m on slightly improved turnover of Pounds 7.58m (Pounds 7.37m). Mr Bottjer said the situation remained tough, although he foresaw a slow improvement. 'Providing land prices are reasonably contained, Scottish housebuilding looks set for medium term growth,' he said. Construction work in hand was ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 215m, with mainstream building and specialist contracting showing improved order books. Contracting in the civil engineering business was stalled by concerns in the water industry over regulatory issues, but the company expects work to begin picking up, following the recent issue of the Ofwat report. The interim dividend was held at 10.5p, with the company expecting to pay a maintained total of 33p. Earnings per share came to 11.9p, against 26.9p. The shares responded positively, closing 15p ahead at 563p.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Allied Domecq There is no reason to doubt the strategic logic of Allied Domecq's purchase of Pedro Domecq earlier this year. But it is disconcerting to see the Mexican market - which accounts for half Domecq's profits - turning down so sharply, so quickly. Why was Allied not able to see this coming? Confidence in the group's deal-making prowess has taken a dent, especially as it is now clear that due diligence ahead of the Domecq deal did not dig so deep as to reveal in which part of the year the Spanish company earned the bulk of its profits. There is little consolation for shareholders in Allied's disingenuous protestation that there would be no earnings dilution from the deal, but for Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa's decision to exercise his 'put option'. The option, obliging Allied to buy the outstanding shares in Domecq, is being exercised, and the purchase will dilute in the current year as a result. It is not surprising, under the circumstances, that Allied's share price dropped by more than 3 per cent yesterday. Across the group as a whole, operating performance was poor, with only modest underlying growth in spirits and retailing. The 9 per cent drop in Carlsberg-Tetley's operating profits provided more evidence of difficult conditions in the UK beer industry. The shares will struggle to maintain a market rating, given the pedestrian outlook for earnings growth in the next few years.</p>

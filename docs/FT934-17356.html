			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: First among equals European and American executives are used to looking around nervously to see what their Japanese rivals are up to, but they do not usually regard modesty as a prime characteristic of the competition. Yet the fact that Japanese companies tend to underestimate their prowess in bringing innovative products to the market first is a factor in their success, according to the Boston Consulting Group. 'Japanese companies in general are faster (than those in the US or Europe) but are also more self-critical about being slow.' After studying 600 companies, it found that among those with turnover exceeding Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m), Japanese corporations needed an average of 19.1 months to develop a new product against 22.6 in the US and 23.4 in Europe. Below this turnover level, Japanese companies needed 14 months compared with 16 in the US and Europe. Hans Seifert, a Munich-based partner of BCG, believes Japanese and other southeast Asian companies will increase their strength in world markets, citing trends in the printing sector - where German companies have traditionally been strong - and in vehicles. 'The danger for Europeans and Americans lies less in the technological potential of Asian competitors than in their own complacency.' BCG identifies three crucial areas which determine success in being first with new products: simultaneous engineering, with full co-operation and communication early in the development process; early prototyping so opportunities and problems (in components as well as the full product) can be spotted quickly; and a low ratio of design engineers to people in other important functions like marketing, manufacturing and purchasing. None of these depends on fancy new theories. 'These techniques have less to do with restructuring or training and more to do with managing and doing,' notes BCG. It is also vital that project teams have adequate power of decision, insists Seifert. Top management should restrict itself to guidance and advice and stay out of the detail.</p>

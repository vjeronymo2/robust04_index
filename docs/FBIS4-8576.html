			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 14 -- The Senate adopted on Thursday  amendments to the law on the mode of enacting a new constitution  that allow a group of 500,000 citizens to submit their own draft  of a basic legislation. The amendments were passed with 72  votes for, one against and six abstentions.    Under the law, a group of half a million citizens will be  able to put forward their proposal for a new constitution within  three months after the amended law comes into force. The passed  amendments also provide for a possibility of holding a  nation-wide referendum on basic principles of the future system  of the state. The amendments also oblige the National Assembly  to use all constitutional bills prepared by the previous Sejm  and Senate.    Senator Jerzy Madej, independent, the only opponent of the  amendments, pointed to the fact that should they be adopted, the  time of work on a new constitution would be elongated. The  argument came up frequently in the discussion but finally the  senators decided that the public should participate in the work  on a constitution.    Also on Thursday, the Senate unanimously decided to put  forward an amendment to the law on the relations between the  state and the Evangelical-Augsburg (Lutheran) and  Evangelical-Reformed (Calvinist) Churches.    The amendment provides that donations for the churches'  charity work would be exempted from tax. For the Roman-Catholic  and Orthodox churches the right has already been legislated.  The senators stressed in the discussion that churches should  have equal rights in Poland and praised the civil virtues of the  Protestant churches.    The Senate will meet for the next session on April 28 to  discuss the report of the ombudsman on his work and the Senate's  amendment to the law on unemployment. The Senate is also to  decide then whether Senator Andrzej Gawronik, a businessman,  should be deprived of his immunity and stand trial.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Private lives, public heirs YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales are to live separately raises more questions about the future of the British monarchy than it answers. In essence, it says that since nothing will change except the living arrangements of the heir to the throne and his wife the couple should now be left in peace. This is not convincing. Everything will change, and the prince and princess will continue, however regrettably, to be the focus of attention. The statement, issued by Buckingham Palace and read in the House of Commons by the prime minister, might prove conclusive in a country in which there was no established church, no popular demand for a family to represent the crown, no insatiable public thirst for information about all aspects of royal life and no antiquated structure of law and tradition. Britain is not such a country. The monarch is head of the Church of England, the Queen is revered as head of a family, the media reflect public tastes and the essence of royalty is tradition. When the time comes for Prince Charles to ascend the throne his putative subjects may find it difficult to understand how a man who lives separately from his wife can become head of the church that bears his country's name. The Archbishop of Canterbury was quoted in aid by the palace yesterday, but that does not necessarily end the matter. Like the monarchy, the established church depends for its existence upon the support of its adherents. Because it is established, there is a sense in which the two institutions sink or swim together. There is a balance to be struck between maintaining strict rules of personal conduct and accepting that social morality has changed. It is not clear that either palace - the archbishop's or the Queen's - has yet got it right. Family life During most of the present century the British people have demanded of their sovereigns that they symbolise traditional family life. It was because he could not do so that the Queen's uncle was obliged to abdicate in 1937. The Duke of Windsor's sin was that he proposed to marry a divorced woman. At that time such a move was unacceptable to both church and state. It might not be so today. Yet the highly publicised marital difficulties of the present Queen's children have unfortunately damaged what Bagehot referred to as the 'dignified' part of the constitution. The proposition put forward yesterday that somehow this separated couple can become King and Queen as if nothing untoward had happened does little to repair that damage. It is difficult to imagine life under what would be two thrones, sitting back to back, facing opposite directions. Sensational stories The strength of royalty is a matter of perception; if people do not believe that what they think they see is worthy of respect the monarchy is devalued. The increasingly intrusive tabloid press, followed closely by television and some of the broadsheets, has not served the royal family well. An industry has been created around a single product: sensational stories about royal persons. This is a sad comment on an unsavoury aspect of contemporary life. Yet no industry can exist without customers. If people did not want to read such stuff, and pay to do so, it would not be produced. The market for palace scandals is a keen one. Against such harsh reality, the call in parliament yesterday for a moratorium on stories about the prince and princess sounds forlorn. It is therefore possible that the British constitution, which exists in the mind rather than on paper, will suffer from further destabilisation when the Queen's reign comes to an end. She has conducted herself with great dignity and composure over the past 40 years, and would serve her country well if she could continue for many more decades. But, in spite of Mr John Major's plea for silent acceptance of yesterday's news, it cannot now be said that the succession is predictable. For a constitutional monarchy, it is not a disaster that there should be debate about the implications of the announcement and the changes in social context and expectations which form its background. At all events, such a debate is now inescapable.</p>

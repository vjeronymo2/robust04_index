			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEBSTER SEES WIDE THREAT IN LIBYA CHEMICAL PLANT  </P> <P> CIA Director William H. Webster said today that Libyan strongman Moammar  Kadafi's chemical weapons plant is so big that he could easily share its output  with other radical nations.  </P> <P> "The production capability is far more than Col. Kadafi could ever need or use  by any stretch of the imagination," Webster told the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.  </P> <P> "Is this going to become just another form of currency . . . a brokering  capability?" he asked.  </P> <P> Webster also said Libya could have the capacity to target such countries as  Israel with chemical weapons if Kadafi's forces obtain air-to-air refueling  capacity for their bombers.  </P> <P> "It moves it (the chemical weapons threat) off the battlefields and puts it  into the cities and strategic areas" of the whole Middle East, he said.  </P> <P> Webster was asked by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) if elements of the West German  armed forces had aided Libyan efforts to obtain air-to-air refueling  capability.  </P> <P> Webster said he would prefer to discuss the matter in a closed, non-public  session but told Helms, "You're right on target."  </P> <P> Webster later declined to elaborate on his comment.  </P> <P> Kadafi has said the plant was built to produce pharmaceuticals, not chemical  weapons. Webster said that even if that is true the facility could be converted  to manufacture weapons within a day's time.  </P> <P> The CIA director did say, as he and other U.S. officials have said before, that  West German corporations as well as those from other European and Asian  countries have helped Libya acquire a chemical weapons production capability,  and that it "would have been virtually impossible" for Libya to do that without  such help.  </P></p>

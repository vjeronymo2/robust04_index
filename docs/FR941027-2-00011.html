NIST will examine such proposals to determine whether substantial revisions have been made. Where the revisions are determined not to be substantial, NIST reserves the right to score and rank, or where appropriate, to reject, such proposals based on reviews of the previously-submitted proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Transfer of Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NIST reserves the right to transfer a full proposal received in response to a General Competition invitation to a Program Competition underway in the same general timeframe if the subject matter of the proposal clearly falls within the scope of the Program Competition. NIST will not transfer proposals from Program Competitions to General Competitions. Applicants will be notified if and when a proposal is transferred from a General Competition to a Program Competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Other Requirements, Requests, and Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant or recipient who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either the delinquent account is paid in full, a negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or other arrangements satisfactory to the Department are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All for-profit and nonprofit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If applicants incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Primary Applicant Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> All primary applicants must submit a completed form CD&hyph;511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying,'' and the following explanation is hereby provided: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

Anti-Lobbying_Persons (as defined at 15 CFR part 28, section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 USC 1352, ``Limitations on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying section of the certification form prescribed above applies to applications/bids for grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.

The ATP does not involve the mandatory payment of any matching funds from state or local government and does not affect directly any state or local government. Accordingly, the Department of Commerce has determined that Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs'' is not applicable to this program. Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and Department of Commerce policies, regulations and procedures applicable to financial assistance awards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are hereby notified that any equipment or products authorized to be purchased with funding provided under this program must be American-made to the maximum extent feasible in accordance with Public Law 103&hyph;317, section 607 (a) and (b). Adequate justification will be required for any proposed purchase of equipment or products that are not American-made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Arati Prabhakar, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=2 --> Director, NIST. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=2 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26658 Filed 10&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=2 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;13&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

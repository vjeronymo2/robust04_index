			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The press secretary said  Prime Minister Yi submitted his resignation to President Kim at  Chongwadae [presidential office] on Friday afternoon. "I have  nothing further to say," he said.    A stir had developed in the officialdom on Thursday when Yi  told his senior officials to see to it that all policy items  referred to the Unification and National Security Policy  Coordination Council be implemented with advance approval by the  prime minister.    Yi said it was unreasonable that a policy decision on North  Korean loggers, for instance, was released to the press even  before it was formally adopted at the cabinet level.</p>

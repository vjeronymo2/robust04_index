			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chevron profits slide to Dollars 50m as charges take toll PROFITS at Chevron, the US energy group, have been hit by restructuring charges of Dollars 552m to cover the proposed disposal of two refineries and 200 service stations. The group was left with net income for the second quarter of Dollars 50m, or 15 cents a share, down from Dollars 315m, or 92 cents, a year ago. Before net special charges of Dollars 515m, earnings rose to Dollars 565m from Dollars 354m in the same 1992 period on a comparable basis, on turnover down from Dollars 10.5bn to Dollars 9.9bn. Chevron has moved further than most other large US oil and gas groups in cutting costs to counter the over-capacity in the US refining business. Mr Ken Derr, chairman, said average costs in the first half were Dollars 6.54 a barrel, 87 cents lower than in 1991 and ahead of the company's target cost reductions. Second-quarter operating results were supported by a rise in US exploration and production earnings, to Dollars 207m from Dollars 121m (or Dollars 146m before special charges), helped by the higher natural gas prices. Higher prices have bolstered the profits of all the big US energy groups. International upstream earnings fell to Dollars 142m from Dollars 157m as a result of special charges, though they were Dollars 17m up, at Dollars 147m, before charges. US refining and marketing returned a loss of Dollars 507m due to the restructuring charges, though Chevron said sales margins had improved, especially in the south-east. International downstream earnings jumped from Dollars 42m to Dollars 107m, helped by a Dollars 13m contribution from a disposal and by higher margins and sales. Earnings from chemical operations were flat at Dollars 6m, before a Dollars 135m gain on the sale of the group's Ortho lawn and garden products business. Net income for the first half, at Dollars 551m, was down from Dollars 655m last time, before the effects of accounting changes. Leaving aside special charges in both periods, earnings rose from Dollars 607m to Dollars 1.068bn. Second-quarter net income at Phillips Petroleum rose to Dollars 121m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 100m, or 38 cents, a year ago. The advance was attributed to higher natural gas prices and lower worldwide exploration expenses. Earnings were held back by Dollars 16m of charges related to litigation claims and foreign currency losses, compared with special credits of Dollars 10m in the 1992 quarter. First-half net income of Dollars 182m (Dollars 194m before special charges) compared with a loss before accounting changes in the first six months of 1992 of Dollars 5m (a profit of Dollars 61m after leaving aside one-off charges). Mr CJ Silas, chairman, warned: 'Natural gas and crude oil prices have declined recently, and downstream margins continue to be depressed.'</p>

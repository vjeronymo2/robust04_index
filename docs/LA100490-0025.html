			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY TO ACQUIRE MUFFLER SHOP PROPERTY  </P> <P> Torrance city officials are taking steps to acquire the land occupied by Aable  Muffler Center in the city's old downtown, despite protests from its owner,  Walter J. (Jake) Egan, that the city is acting to please the neighboring  American Honda Motor Co.  </P> <P> The aging muffler shop is at Torrance Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue, in front  of the new $225-million Honda headquarters.  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council voted 7 to 0 Tuesday to approve the city's  acquisition of the muffler shop land through eminent domain. Next, the city  will file a lawsuit to condemn the property, said City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson.  </P> <P> City officials say they need the land as part of a project to widen Torrance  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "We want to resolve what's considered an unsafe curve," said City Manager LeRoy  Jackson. "You need the north side of the street in order to accomplish it."  </P> <P> Egan's lawyer, Kurt D. Bridgman, said: "Mr. Egan's shop is right in front of  the centerpiece of Torrance's redevelopment project, the Honda Center. Mr.  Egan's property is in great contrast to that center."  </P> <P> "We have offered him several different locations, and he's turned them down,"  said City Councilman Timothy Mock.  </P> <P> This summer, the city offered Egan $87,000 for the muffler shop and land, but  he rejected the offer, saying the property is worth at least $1.8 million.  </P> <P> Now the value will be determined by the court as part of the condemnation  proceedings, Mayor Katy Geissert said.  </P></p>

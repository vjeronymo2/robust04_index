			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DENSITY' ENOUGH FOR MONORAIL? 1 YES VOTE  </P> <P> In his op-ed article "Transit Options Must Deal With Real World" (Feb. 26),  Bruce Nestande said that Orange County can't have fixed-corridor mass transit  because its density is too low. His only suggestions are to improve the bus  system and create more commuter lanes.  </P> <P> This is not very creative, and judging by current usage, it also won't be very  successful. In reality, higher-density development is needed only at the  destination point for a monorail-type system to work. The origination point is  unimportant: People can drive a mile to a collection point, park their cars and  get on a monorail as long as it drops them off within walking distance of where  they want to go.  </P> <P> Do we have enough "density of destinations" to justify a monorail? I think so.  That's why we already have traffic jams around South Coast Plaza, the Irvine  Business Center, Anaheim Stadium, the 91 Corridor and other locations in the  county.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, most of these areas are next to freeways, which are the most  logical and inexpensive rights of way available for a monorail-type system.  </P> <P> It will be good advertising, too. Picture creeping along the Santa Ana Freeway  at 5 m.p.h. in rush-hour traffic as the monorail whooshes by overhead. That,  finally, would get people out of their cars.  </P> <P> JOHN B.

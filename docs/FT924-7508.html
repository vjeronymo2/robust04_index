			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Expanding exhibition centre CROWN HOUSE ENGINEE RING is creating the 'ideal environment' for shows in a new hall complex being added to Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. The Pounds 44m complex of four halls and concourse will increase show space by an additional 33,000 sq metres. The new halls, used seperately or interlinked, are expected to provide the perfect exhibition setting with greater flexibility for displays and stands, and improved quality of facilities. Air conditioning and heating will be programmed to adjust automatically to the varying size of crowds. The Pounds 13.8m contract, awarded by Laing Midlands, the main contractors, covers the design and installation of all heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electrical services in the new complex. Exhibitors can have every facility and service supplied direct to their stand in any desired location. Large service tunnels running below the new halls and interlinked, feed a grid system of channels to supply water, gas, air power, drainage, telephone and information technology to individual stands and displays. The NEC's glass-domed atrium concourse is being extended to link with the new halls 9 to 12 and two new restaurants and a conference suite. The exhibition space will be boosted to a total of 155,000 sq metres on completion of the complex next summer, and 3,000 car parking spaces are being added, making a total capacity for 18,000 vehicles. The new halls are scheduled to open with the International Print Show in September 1993.</p>

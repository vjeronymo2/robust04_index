			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Allegation over Trident contract THE Ministry of Defence said last night it had received a letter from Mr Gary Streeter, the Tory MP for Plymouth Sutton, claiming officials had arranged for confidential details of the bid by Devonport dockyard, Plymouth, for refitting Trident submarines to be passed to Rosyth dockyard, Fife, its rival for the work. If Rosyth does not secure the Trident contract, it might close with the loss of 4,000 jobs. The same number of jobs might be lost at Devonport if it loses the work. The MoD said: 'The department would not disclose information about the contract to anyone not authorised to receive it'.</p>

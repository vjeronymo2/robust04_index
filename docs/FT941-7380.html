			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / India urged to press on with reforms India must press ahead with further economic liberalisation, trade reforms, cuts in subsidies and reductions in public borrowing, according to the government's annual economic survey published yesterday. Without more economic reform, the country risks losing the hard-won gains of the recent past, the report presented to parliament by Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, warns. The report sets the outlines of the government's economic plans for the financial year starting in April. Its detailed plans will be made public when Mr Singh presents his budget on Monday. Investors welcomed the report, prompting a rally on the Bombay Stock Exchange, where the 30-share index rose 103.55 points to 4132.33, close to recent highs. The report estimates the economy will grow only 3.8 per cent in the year to the end of March, down from 4 per cent the previous year and well short of the target of 5.6 per cent. Agricultural output is set to decline slightly, following a record performance the previous year. Industrial production, which fell sharply when India embarked on reform in mid-1991, is recovering far more slowly than anticipated, growing just 1 per cent in the first seven months of 1993-94. But the authors note signs of recovery in recent months, notably in the consumer goods. industry. The report blames industry's disappointing performance partly on the unrest which followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque and partly on continuing uncertainty about the impact of reform, which has curbed investment and hit capital goods producers hard. The survey highlights the country's export performance as 'the most striking evidence of progress,' noting a 19.9 per cent rise in exports in dollar terms in the nine months to December. With imports weak, because of poor demand for capital goods and low oil prices, foreign exchange reserves have soared to Dollars 10.9bn (Pounds 6bn) this month and should reach Dollars 12bn by the end of March. The current account deficit should fall to just 0.5 per cent of the economy, the lowest in 15 years. The strong current account performance has encouraged more foreign investment than expected. The combined flow of foreign direct investment, investment in the stock market and in paper issued by Indian companies overseas should reach Dollars 2.5bn in 1993-94, up from Dollars 390m last year. Weak imports have hit government revenues by depressing customs payments. With spending also higher than expected (due to extra subsidy hand-outs), the government's borrowings have climbed far above targets. The fiscal deficit will be 'substantially higher' than the target of 4.7 per cent, the report said, though it gives no figure. The deterioration in the fiscal position remains 'the principal cause of macro-economic concern.'</p>

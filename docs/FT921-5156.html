			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Much of Libya's money has long been on the move: It should be no surprise, that the country has done what it can to protect its assets AS INTERNATIONAL pressure has grown for sanctions against Libya, so has Libyan concern risen about the safety of both its deposits in overseas banks, along with its substantial downstream investments in Europe. It should be no surprise, therefore, given the precedent of the US freeze of Libyan assets in January 1986 in reprisal against its alleged involvement in terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, that Libya has done what it can to protect its assets. Libya holds around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in liquid assets in reporting countries of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, and, according to Arab and European bankers, it has shifted between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn of this towards banks in the Middle East, particularly those in Bahrain and other Gulf centres, from London and other European centres deemed in Tripoli to be vulnerable. So far, however, there is no sign that Libya has been seeking either to liquidate its substantial European investments, or to change ownership structures to afford these investments greater protection from possible predators. Libya's most substantial European interest is its Tamoil petroleum distribution network in Italy and Switzerland, where Tamoil Italia and Tamoil Suisse have 5 per cent and 8 per cent of the refined-product market respectively. Tamoil, purchased by the Libyans in 1986 from Lebanese investor Roger Tamraz, is continuing its aggressive expansion in its core Italian market and also spearheading a Libyan drive into Eastern Europe. The Italian press is reporting that Tamoil Italia is seeking to purchase 150 petrol stations from the Genoa-based Cameli Company for Dollars 48m to add to its more than 1,000 service stations. Libya may well feel that there is not much more that it can do to shield its European oil sector investments, channelled through its Netherlands Antilles-registered investment vehicle, Oil Investments International Company (OIIC). Oilinvest is, in turn, jointly-owned by Libyan state institutions: the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (LAFB), the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico), and the Libyan National Oil Company (LNOC). Oilinvest, established in 1988 to provide an umbrella for Libya's European investments, has subsidiaries in Amsterdam and Zurich. Libya may also have reckoned that if economic sanctions were imposed, they would be relatively short-term and therefore would not affect its long-term strategic investments. But these calculations have not prevented the Libyans from battening down the hatches. According to reports from Tripoli and from European bankers, the government has stockpiled foods and medicines, frozen as far as possible all non-essential imports and halted some projects altogether. Libya is also concerned that Britain, the US and France might seek to impose an embargo on its oil exports, albeit reluctantly, since the decision would harm European consumers, for whom Libya is a leading supplier. Italy, Germany and Spain are the largest purchasers of Libyan crude, together accounting for about 75 per cent of oil exports, and the Italian state company ENI has about 45 per cent of its reserves in Libya. The US, meanwhile, is quietly pressing ahead with its own programme of isolating Libya economically. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the body charged with enforcing the 1986 trade embargo and asset freeze instituted by the Reagan administration, is preparing an enlarged list of Libyan companies and individuals with whom US business may not deal. OFAC officials say that not only will more institutions be added to the 60 already on the list, but additional enforcement measures will be adopted. OFAC has been looking particularly closely at Libya's European investments. Last August, when the latest OFAC listing was released, Mr Richard Newcomb, its director, warned that the 'recent Libyan economic expansion into western Europe increases Col Muammer Gadaffi's ability to promote and finance terrorist activity'. However, the ability of the US to interfere with Libyan activities in Europe is constrained because they fall outside US jurisdiction and do not, as a rule, involve US companies. US companies and individuals engaging in business with Libya, or with those described as 'specially designated nationals'(SDNs), are liable to maximum criminal penalties of Dollars 500,000 per violation for corporations, and Dollars 250,000 for individuals, plus prison sentences of up to 12 years for individuals and senior corporate officers. Among the SDNs are such prominent Libyan businessmen as Mr Abdullah Saudi, president of the Bahrain-based and highly regarded Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), an attractive-looking destination for some of the Libyan funds moving out of Europe, although Mr Saudi yesterday denied this. 'We've seen no change in our position, even as client,' he said. Libya, together with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, is co-owner of ABC. Its share is between 25 and 30 per cent. Libya also has a controlling interest in Al-Ubaf, the Bahrain offshore banking unit which is part of the increasingly loosely associated Union de Banques Arabes and Francaises (Ubaf) group. OFAC officials would not be drawn on what additional measures against Libya are being contemplated, but a weakness of the US embargo has long been the ability of US companies to circumvent the ban on dealings with Libya by channelling their Libya business through European subsidiaries. Meanwhile, the latest international row over Libya's alleged terrorist activities is also bad news for five US oil companies - Conoco, Amerada Hess, Marathon, WR Grace and Occidental - who are waiting for the US to lift its 1986 ban on their doing business there. According to the US General Accounting Office in these companies are losing between Dollars 2m and Dollars 25m per day through their absence from Libya.

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Too soon to rule alone Hungary's Socialist party won an absolute majority in the second round of the general elections over the weekend. But it will probably do a service to itself and to the country if it rejects the temptation to go ahead alone. Instead, the Socialists should seek to attract the Free Democrats into a broader-based coalition government, even though the price of such a government would be the sacrifice of the prime ministerial ambitions of Mr Gyula Horn, the veteran former communist who led his Socialist party to victory. Despite the fact that voters have given the Socialist party a powerful vote of confidence, many Hungarians will question the legitimacy of one-party rule by politicians with roots in the communist past. There are also doubts whether the party alone would be able to keep to the difficult path of market-based reform, given the strength of support shown by the election for traditional socialist policies. Higher social spending, greater job security, a slowdown in privatisation, and higher taxes on the emergent business class are the sort of policies which many of the party's former communist voters and its powerful trade union wing are likely to demand from a one-party Socialist government. Such pressures would be diluted if the party, at its extraordinary congress this coming weekend, demonstrates that it is indeed a reforming, modernising force in Hungarian political life. It could do this best by endorsing the market-orientated reform line associated with Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the party's finance minister. The most convincing endorsement would be to chose Mr Bekesi himself as the party's prime ministerial candidate. This would please the Free Democrats and open the way for a coalition which would be the best guarantee of reforms needed to reduce the current account and budget deficits, and continue the modernising process begun by the outgoing Hungarian Democratic Forum. Main obstacle The main obstacle to such an outcome appears to be the understandable ambition of Mr Horn, who gives every indication of wanting to lead the next government. He is undoubtedly a tough and skilled politician and a survivor. As foreign minister in the last communist government Mr Horn executed the decision to open Hungary's western borders to East Germans in 1989. This act fatally undermined the government of the late Mr Erich Honecker and led to the domino-like collapse of communist governments throughout the region, including Hungary's own reform-communist regime led by Mr Miklos Nemeth. Old regime For that act alone Mr Horn is warmly regarded by many in the west, especially in Germany, with which he has already indicated a desire for the closest possible relations once the new government is formed. But for millions of Hungarians Mr Horn remains a man of the old regime, a participant in the suppression which followed the Budapest rising of 1956. His leadership could open up barely healed scars and would be watched apprehensively by the international community. Foreign investors, who hold Dollars 25bn of Hungarian debt and have invested Dollars 7bn over the last four years in what has been perceived as a stable, pro-market reforming country, would focus a particularly close eye on such a government. In Poland, under similar circumstances, the victorious Democratic Left led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski offered the premiership to the Peasants party as the price of bringing its junior partner into a coalition. Hungarian Socialists on the reformist wing of the party in particular will argue at this weekend's congress that the party must make similar concessions to bring in the Free Democrats, who made clear before the second round of voting that they would not serve in a coalition headed by Mr Horn. Now the Free Democrats' position is weaker because the electorate has given the Socialists the power to rule alone if need be. Paradoxically, however, the Socialists probably need the Free Democrats more than ever. A coalition provides the best way for the Socialists to convert their return to power into good government for Hungary, and longer-term rehabilitation for a party which has sole power in its grasp too early for its own good.</p>

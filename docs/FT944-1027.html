			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Black wins option on Telegraph shares In what is almost the end of an era, the Berry family, once proud owners of The Daily Telegraph, has decided to dispose of most of its remaining shares in the national newspaper group to Hollinger - Mr Conrad Black's main company. Under an agreement reached yesterday with the Telegraph Newspaper Trust, which holds the family shares, Hollinger can acquire from the trustee 7m ordinary Telegraph shares at 450p each. The agreement provides that Hollinger can acquire the shares between April 15 and October 24 next year. In the period from November 8 to November 30 Hollinger 'may be required by the trustee to acquire the shares'. Lord Hartwell, the former chairman of The Daily Telegraph, and his brother Lord Camrose, both directors of the trust and of The Daily Telegraph, will retire from the Telegraph board one year after the shares are sold. The trustee currently holds 7.99m shares in The Daily Telegraph, representing 5.91 per cent of the capital. It is not clear why the Telegraph Newspaper Trust has decided to sell, although Lord Hartwell said yesterday it was time for the family to spread its interests now that it no longer controlled the company. Mr Adrian Berry, a science writer on The Daily Telegraph, will remain a Telegraph director.</p>

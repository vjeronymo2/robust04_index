			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: The realities of Sunday trading - in the UK, and for Virgin in France (1) Sir, May a banker express a view about the letter from Mr Barry Hyman of Marks and Spencer (Letters, January 3) in which he claims: 'There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the public is crying out for a seventh day on which to purchase food or clothing.' I am normally unable to go shopping for anything during the week and often find it difficult to do so on Saturdays. I would like nothing better than to visit M and S on my way home from church on a Sunday. Nearly everybody I know feels the same - and not only as far as food and clothing (and M and S) are concerned. There are enough pressures in modern life without being prevented from shopping when it is convenient. Mr Hyman's remark that 'when the law is rationalised . . . some of us may wish to ease congestion and assist customers by opening on the occasional Sunday' is telling in its condescension and (together with M and S's refusal to accept other issuers' credit cards and anybody's debit cards in its stores) suggests that his company has much to learn about assisting customers. While I am not suggesting that M and S (or anyone else) should break the law by opening now on Sundays (that is a separate argument), I do wish they would admit that there is a very real demand from the public for all kinds of shopping on Sundays, and join the campaign to repeal the Shops Act. And if Mr Hyman does want to attend to his banking affairs on Sundays, perhaps he should consider moving his account to First Direct, which is already open for retail banking 24 hours a day, seven days a week (and which, incidentally, is not my employer). If enough bank customers want to move their accounts to banks which do business on Sundays, I am sure the banks which do not will soon get the message. Loans, socks - it's all the same.

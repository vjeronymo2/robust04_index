			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has pointed out that  unfounded rumors about the Cyprus issue have been spread  recently in order to confuse the people. She stressed that it  is out of the question for Turkey to make any concessions on  such a vital issue. Ciller said: I did not make any promises  about Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States  or anywhere else.    Addressing a meeting of the True Path Party National  Assembly  group, Ciller pointed out that Turkey's foreign policy follows a  line that was drawn up by Ataturk and which has not changed  since the republic was founded. She explained that Turkish  foreign policy is based on national consensus and is above the  party. She stressed that exploiting this issue by making  unfounded speculations about it will only weaken the country.    Ciller charged that certain circles have been making  unfounded allegations recently to the effect that concessions  will be made in Cyprus as a result of Turkey's economic  difficulties. Ciller said:    [Begin recording] Let me say it clearly: Neither I nor any  prime minister of the Turkish Republic can make concessions on  the Cyprus issue -- one of Turkey's most vital issues -- because  of economic or other reasons. [applause] No prime minister can  do that. It is inconceivable. Such unfortunate rumors and  allegations hurt our country first and foremost. [applause] I  am again saying clearly that I did not make any promises about  Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States or  anywhere else. [end recording]    The prime minister pointed out that Turkey's views on Cyprus  were conveyed to the U.S. Administration in written form.    [Begin Ciller recording] This is what President Clinton said  to me regarding this issue: The Cyprus issue is at an impasse.  Can you help?    Almost every U.S. President has spoken to almost all our  prime ministers along these lines at various platforms. This is  not a new development. Whenever a Turkish prime minister went  to the United States, he heard these remarks from the U.S.  Administration. There is nothing new in that.    My reply to President Clinton's remarks was as follows, in  brief: The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus had agreed to the  original confidence-building measures [CBM's]. The package was  later changed to satisfy the Greek Cypriots. The frequent  changes in the package are causing difficulties. Nonetheless,  let us look at the latest situation once again. Let us look for  the common ground between the two sides. In fact, that is the  aim of the CBM's.    That is the essence of what we said. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jun (NA) -- It was officially  announced here that the Argentine Navy corvette "Parker" has  captured the Taiwanese fishing trawler "Man Wei III" which was  operating without a permit inside the Exclusive Economic Zone.  The seizure occurred 199 miles east of Cabo Blanco, off Santa  Cruz Province, where the Navy detected the "potero," which is  how squid fishing boats are known here. The Taiwanese boat  obeyed the order to stop and was boarded by a Navy Visiting and  Registering contingent.    The Argentine Navy released a communique saying that the  "Man  Wei III" did not have a permit. On deck, in the hold, and in  the tunnels [as received] were several metric tons of fresh  squid.    A recent resolution issued by the Agriculture, Livestock and  Fishing Secretariat forbids the fishing of squid south of  Parallel 43 30'.    The "Parker" is escorting the Taiwanese fishing boat to Port  Madryn where it will arrive on the night of 12 June. The  appropriate authorities will then take over the investigation.</p>

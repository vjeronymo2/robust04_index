			<p>BFN     [Text] Enrique Ters Hors, the new director of the UN  Observers for El Salvador [Onusal], said yesterday that if he  had to give a diplomatic opinion about the state of Salvadoran  human rights, he would have to say it could use improvement.  There is still a long way to go before we can say there is a  full respect for human rights in the country.    Ters Hors, who met with Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos  Mauricio Molina Fonseca, said there is concern at the United  Nations about the visible delays in the deployment of the  National Civilian Police [PNC], land issues, and constitutional  reform. These reforms should be approved by 30 April at the  latest by all of the political parties represented at the  Legislative Assembly.    He said that each of the items included in a letter by UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expresses concern about  the current state and progress of the peace agreements due to  the Salvadoran Government's delay. The letter addresses issues  from land transfers to the PNC's training and deployment.    The international official said "it is important for all of  the peace agreements to be fulfilled, but it is also important  that they be properly fulfilled. Sometimes haste affects the  quality of fulfillment."    He added that the more important issues listed in the  secretary general's letter demonstrate that there is in fact  concern about the delays in the agreement, which is why  Butrus-Ghali found it appropriate to bring them before the  Security Council.    President Cristiani recognized yesterday there are certain  delays regarding the PNC, land transfers, and constitutional  reform. He said this was not due to a lack of political resolve  on the part of his government but, rather, due to delays in  receiving international aid and the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front, which did not want to meet with the government  to try and find a solution to the problems.    Ters Hors said he feels optimistic, because the president  has  publicly expressed his will to accelerate completion of the  pending issues. He said that he personally knows President  Cristiani has given his minister instructions, thus  demonstrating the government's will to begin working.    The Onusal director said he believes several programs  designed to strengthen human rights in El Salvador will go into  effect in July with coordination by Human Rights Ombudsman  Molina.</p>

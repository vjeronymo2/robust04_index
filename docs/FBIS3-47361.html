			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 12 Jan (AKP) -- We reproduce here below  the full text of a clarification made on Monday by Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC]:    Following the 9 January AFP dispatch entitled "Ranariddh  reneged on deal over peace talks" [title given in English] which  concerns my letter dated 28 December to His Excellency [H.E.]  Khieu Samphan, I, Norodom Ranariddh, wish to make the following  clarification:    1. At the 17 December meeting with H.E. Khieu Samphan, I  said that due to concrete reasons, it was neither useful nor  productive to have talks within the framework of a technical  group consisting only of the representatives of the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] Party.    2. The idea of having a quadripartite discussion is not  realistic after the implementation of the peace process in line  with the Paris accords and after the formation of the royal  government emerging from the same process.    3. With a view to advancing the process of national  reconciliation, I agree to have a technical working group with  no reference to the PDK or the RGC. On that occasion, I told  H.E. Khieu Samphan that if the PDK looked through all the points  of the 21 November article proposed by His Majesty the king, it  should have noted that His Majesty clearly mentions in that same  article: "The PDK and the RGC."    4. At the 17 December meeting, I made it clear that even if  a technical group is set up without any name, this should also  be accepted by H.E. Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC.    5. In Beijing, His Majesty, speaking with enormous wisdom  and reason and in his capacity as a father, asked me to  establish the technical working group made up of the  representatives of the PDK and of "Samdech Krompreah, first  prime minister of the RGC." With reference to this suggession,  I would like to propose again to the PDK this formula with H.E.  Sok An and H.E. Veng Sereivut as RGC representatives. Besides,  this royal formula has already been endorsed by H.E. Chea Sim  and H.E. Hun Sen.    6. In my reply to H.E. Khieu Samphan's letter that was  quoted by AFP, I clearly stated that:    A. The RGC accepts the five-point proposal of His Majesty  the king.    B. I asked H.E. Khieu Samphan whether it is possible to  accept the proposed formula for the technical working group.  This is to accelerate the process of national reconciliation  and peace.    7. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the PDK is not sincere in  the so-called desire for peace and national reconciliation.    The simple proof is that while declaring acceptance of all  the elements of His Majesty the king of Cambodia's article, the  Khmer Rouge do not want to recognize the RGC, while insisting at  the same time that they become members or advisors to that same  government.</p>

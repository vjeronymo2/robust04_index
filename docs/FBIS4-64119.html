			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense and security cooperation have been under  discussion in Brussels, at NATO headquarters, and particularly  in connection with the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan.  The Estonian representatives have had several meetings. A  meeting with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had also  been likely before the conference began but it never took place.    In an interview to Estonian Radio, Major General Aleksander  Einseln, the Estonian defense forces commander, said that he had  had a meeting with the U.S. Defense Secretary and his general  staff as well as with a NATO forces commander. According to  Einseln, Estonia can count on their comprehensive support. The  Estonian defense forces commander concluded that it is  beneficial to Estonia that Russia is joining the PFP plan.    Estonia's cooperation with NATO is increasing. Our NATO  representative is currently making preparations in the  Netherlands for the exercises due in October, and Estonian  defense forces will also take part.</p>

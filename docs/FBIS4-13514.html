			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian  delegation to the Cairo talks, says this evening that a  breakthrough has been achieved in the deliberations of the Legal  Committee. Progress was also made in the Security Committee on  three issues which had already been noted down in the draft  agreement of the two delegations. Dr. Sha'th also expressed his  belief that next week may be the last week of the talks. He  told our correspondent in Cairo, Moti Amir that the answers  brought by Major General Shahaq from Jerusalem today enable the  sides to make rapid progress in the negotiations. Another  meeting will take place between Sha'th and Shahaq tonight, in  which Sha'th will receive a written document containing the  Israeli proposals. Sha'th says that these proposals are very  close to the formulation of the Declaration of Principles with  regard to the jurisdiction powers of the autonomy authorities,  but he refused to elaborate.</p>

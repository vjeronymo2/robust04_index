			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nationalist Action Party deputy leader Mustafa </F> Muftuoglu: "The Provocations Are Coming From the Other Side"]    [Excerpts] There are certain points on which the  Prosperity Party [PP] and we differ. In his speeches on TRT  both before and after the local elections, Mr. Erbakan said that  in certain parts of Turkey, people will be able to speak  whatever language they want and that the PP feels comfortable  with there being more than one legal system in the country. As  far as we are concerned, Turkey's only official language is  Turkish. An additional language is inconceivable. To say that  people will be able to live within their own legal systems means  dividing the country into a few parts. That is utterly  unacceptable to us. The PP is defending certain dangerous  views. We have warned that party on various occasions.    There is one extreme in Turkey that wants to keep Islam  confined within the people's conscience and another extreme that  wants to impose an Iranian model on the people. One of these  groups hides behind secularism; the other exploits religious  sentiments. Science, religion, state affairs, and justice are  separate issues. The PP wants to assume all four functions at  once. In a campaign we will launch in early May, we will fight  the polarization between secular and antisecular.    The fundamentalists have continuously targeted the  Nationalist Action Party [NAP] since 1980. They tried to bring  about an Iranian-type revolution by either enlisting the NAP to  bolster their passive grass roots or pointing to the NAP as the  target. We never gave in to these games and we never will, even  though the PP may carry out provocations against us now.  [passage omitted]    We heard that the PP got votes en masse in the southeast. It  is possible that the PP worked hard for these votes and got them  in the end. I would like to remind you of one of my previous  statements, which largely went unheeded: I said that a  fundamentalist or liberal type will conduct the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] movement's activities on a legitimate  platform. Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] may soon be no more than a  figurehead.</p>

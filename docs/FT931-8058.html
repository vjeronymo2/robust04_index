			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Double dose of Holmes - Radio ST VALENTINE had a poor showing on BBC radio. Radio 1 gave Stupid Cupid, an hour of romantic pop presented by Liz Kershaw; but Radio 4 had two hours of Sunday Outing, for gays and lesbians, mostly in Blackpool. This is not the place to discuss homosexuality; but I cannot believe that presenters Matthew Parris and Beatrix Campbell would have been happy among the yelling and screaming at Blackpool's Flamingo Club. Saturday night's Radio 4 play, You Choose, written and directed by Jonathan Myerson, was hard to credit but fair to hear. Zoe (Amanda Root), living with Greg and about to have a baby and get married, in that order, meets Simon (Nathaniel Parker), an old flame. He involves her in a plot to stop his opulent father exporting toxic waste to poor African states. This is the theme, incidental matters like random murder and spoilt marriage being treated more casually. Simon is unlikeable, whatever his intentions; finally we hear he has killed himself, while his father continues his evil activities. Whose side are we on? Well, the play is called You Choose. You could choose on Sunday too, between Sherlock Holmes on Radio 4 (Memoirs, next week, Return) or Radio 5 (a new Unopened Casebook). John Taylor, Radio 5's writer, is not yet Conan Doyle; his tale of the doctor who faked his own death was too simple to be exciting, even though some of it passed in a funeral vault. But he has Simon Callow and Nicky Henson as Holmes and Watson  -not quite the chaps we know, but just as plausible as Conan Doyle's pair as anyone else. Clive Merrison and Michael Williams are more familiar figures in the Radio 4 version, though The 'Gloria Scott' this week is an uncharacteristic tale, with Holmes partly as an undergraduate. The Baker Street talk is more as we know it in Vincent McInerney's version; and Watson has some of the keenness that Doyle gave him but actors often omit, even if he got the coded letter wrong. If you like a change, you can get six Unopened Casebook stories in a BBC Publication paperback, besides hearing them on Radio 5. In the World Service's series on South Asia there was a programme on the Gurkhas that was one of the most exhilarating half-hours of radio I've heard for ages. No battle-scenes, just talk - talk about routine Gurkha life, from a young officer, a senior officer, Gurkha officers and NCOs, compiled by presenter Nick Rankin. The Gurkhas' loyalty to the British, who fought against them in the Gurkha wars, is one of the wonders of our time. They also serve now in the Indian army. Those who sneer at colonialism and racial discrimination could learn much from the story of the Gurkhas. Now we are to reduce their strength to a mere 2500. The way we chuck our treasures away] South African Snapshots on Radio 3 confirmed the belief aired in Christopher Hope's programme last week that less censorship might give South African writers trouble in choosing themes. Ellen Kuzwayo, writer of Call Me Woman, spoke mainly of personal problems, with a feminist slant. Sipho Sepumla, whose novel Rainbow Jamie deals with commercial success, had little faith in the future; there would be more repression by the new government and no tolerance for blacks. At least poet-biologist Douglas Livingstone was happy; he would go on writing poetry about the multifarious life he leads. In On the Ropes (Radio 4, Mondays), sympathetic John Humphrys interviews folk with problems that have reached public climax. This week's victim was David Mellor, but he has been well worked over by the press; next week's George Walker, of Brent Walker, sounds more promising. After him - how miscellaneous can you get? - comes Gilbert O'Sullivan.</p>

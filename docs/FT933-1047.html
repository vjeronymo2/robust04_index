			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan Grand Metropolitan will doubtless receive many plaudits for its decision to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. It is gratifying, too, to see a senior executive withdraw gracefully to the sidelines without any immediate sign of an enormous Glaxo-style pay-off. To stop here, though, may be to miss the point. The separation of roles is less significant than it looks. It does not involve new blood, and the ebullient Sir Allen Sheppard will still sit on the executive committee as well as being chairman. A deeper question is raised by the choice of Mr George Bull as chief executive when Mr Ian Martin had so obviously been groomed for the role. Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in GrandMet's share price reflected the suspicion that some untoward development underlay his failure to get the job. That looks unlikely; if GrandMet was sitting on any serious bad news, it would surely have revealed it with the management change. The more plausible explanation lies in the nature of the challenges facing GrandMet. It must reduce gearing by shedding peripheral businesses such as the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs. For the longer term it must develop its brands, particularly in food where Green Giant was proving a mammoth headache until the recent US floods pushed up prices. That is where Mr Bull's talents lie. Mr Martin is better at structural change, such as the acquisition of Pillsbury. The implication of yesterday's announcement is that GrandMet now wants to concentrate on organic growth, but first it has to jump the hurdle of selling unwanted businesses.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Genscher expects EC to expand MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said at the weekend he expected Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to become full members of the European Community this decade. The timing would depend on the internal economic and political developments in these countries, he said. Noting that these countries had treaties of association with the EC, Mr Genscher said the door must be held open for later membership of the Baltic nations and the successor states to Yugoslavia, as well as Romania and Bulgaria. Commenting on progress towards European Monetary Union, he said this would not mean the end of the D-Mark but rather the extension of German stability to the whole EC - 'thus a Euro-Mark'. It was important, he added, that the European central bank be sited in Frankfurt, home of the Bundesbank, which is a symbol of currency stability.</p>

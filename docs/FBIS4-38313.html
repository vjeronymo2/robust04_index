			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, 29 Jun (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur,  member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  has relayed the greetings of His Excellency President Saddam  Husayn to Jordanian parties and the fraternal Jordanian people.  'Abd-al-Ghafur also told the Jordanian parties that his  excellency the president takes pride in the noble pan-Arab stand  they took during the great showdown of the legendary Mother of  Battles.    This came during a meeting between 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Ghafur and the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation on  the one hand, and the secretaries general of 11 Jordanian  parties in Amman today.    During this meeting, 'Abd-al-Ghafur reviewed the latest  developments in the relationship between Iraq and the UN  Security Council, as well as the efforts under way to lift the  unfair sanctions clamped on Iraq. He indicated that the  positive changes in the stands of most members of the UN  Security Council are to be attributed to the steadfastness of  the Iraqi people, and the wisdom of their leader Saddam Husayn.    'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur urged nationalist, pan-Arab,  and  Islamic forces in Jordan and the Arab homeland to step up their  efforts and activities prior to the next periodic review session  of the UN Security Council in July.    During the meeting, the Ba'th Party delegation made some  practical proposals regarding multifaceted moves that could be  made on the pan-Arab and international scenes to expedite the  lifting of the unfair sanctions and mitigate the sufferings of  the steadfast Iraqi people.    For their part, the secretaries general of the Jordanian  parties reiterated their total support for Iraq. They also  commended its steadfastness in the face of the unfair embargo,  as well as its legendary confrontation of all forms of  aggression, conspiracies, and foreign intervention in its  domestic affairs.    The Jordanian parties also renewed their full support for  Iraq's unity, independence, and sovereignty, particularly since  the battle it is waging is meant to vindicate Arabism and Islam.  The enemy in this battle is one; namely, U.S. imperialism, and  its ally, racist and expansionist Zionism, the Jordanian parties  contended.    The conferees agreed to form a committee to draft practical  proposals for future action on the Jordanian, Arab, and  international scenes.    The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi,  director of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of  the Ba'th Party; Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the  Arab Popular Forces Conference; and the Iraqi ambassador in  Amman.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Chattels are the goods - Jennie Hawthorne tells how you can minimise liability to gains tax INVESTORS looking for exemptions from capital gains tax often overlook the personal effects known as chattels. These comprise tangible moveable property such as furniture, jewellery, diamonds, silver, and collectibles like books, paintings and stamps. Wasting chattels, with an estimated life of less than 50 years - for example, a boat or car (not used for business) - are excluded from CGT altogether. Even if you do not have a Cezanne in the attic or a Georgian silver tea set in the cellar, you have possibly acquired other possessions over the years. These could well have appreciated in value despite the recession. No matter whether such items came to you through inheritance or by shrewd or lucky purchases - if they can be classed as chattels, gains made on them are treated benignly by the Inland Revenue. If you sell chattels for Pounds 6,000 or less, you pay no CGT at all. If the proceeds exceed Pounds 6,000, your capital gain is restricted to five-thirds of the excess. So, a set of apostle spoons that cost Pounds 500 and sold for Pounds 6,300 will show a capital gain equal to five-thirds of the excess over Pounds 6,000: that is, Pounds 500. The mathematics mean that, for very large disposals, you are better off under the normal rules relating to chargeable gains. But husbands and wives each can claim the chattels exemption in addition to the usual CGT exemption for sales of other assets on which the profit does not exceed Pounds 5,800 in the tax year 1992-1993. The past few years have brought more losses than gains for many people and even private homes, once considered a bedrock of security, have fallen in value. But this is not always true of their contents. An old kitchen dresser picked up for a few pounds could now be worth a few hundred. A much-loved silver or dressing-table set, perhaps handed down by granny, can sometimes fetch around Pounds 1,000 today. And first editions, which may grace your bookshelves or those of your parents, are in great demand and often sell for two or three times their purchase price. Kenneth Fuller, of Marchpane - located in the internationally-famous antiquarian bookshop niche of London's Cecil Court - says a first (1930s) edition of PG Wodehouse, selling for around Pounds 100 in 1987, now costs around Pounds 400-Pounds 500. A first London edition of Alice in Wonderland, which could be bought for Pounds 200-Pounds 500 in 1987, now costs Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,000. But the real icing on the cake is that when your possessions consist of silverware, furniture, books, or any other of the items classed as chattels, each of them can qualify individually for the Pounds 6,000 gains tax exemption. The exception is when they make up a set. What constitutes a set is a somewhat grey area and difficult to define, according to Timothy Sammons, a director of Sotheby's. The Revenue says: 'Whether a number of articles constitute a set is a question to be decided in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Six matching chairs or a canteen of Georgian silver cutlery would prima facie constitute a set.' Thus, if a set of chairs which cost you Pounds 6,000 was sold for Pounds 12,000, there would be gains tax to pay (ignoring indexation) on the balance over Pounds 6,000. If you sold six individual non-matching chairs for Pounds 2,000 each, you would pay no tax on any of them. That might, however, be considered a trading transaction that incurs other taxes. The best rule for taking advantage of the chattels exemption is to buy only what you enjoy and can afford, and sell only when you must. The Inland Revenue won a victory this week with a ruling by the House of Lords in the Smith v Schofield case. In 1952 Mrs Schofield inherited two pieces of furniture which she sold for considerable profit in 1987. At issue was the order in which two reliefs from CGT should be given, namely indexation allowance, which removes post-1982 inflationary gains from the charge to tax, and time-apportionment which is a method of exempting gains accruing before April 1965, when CGT was introduced. The Law Lords decided that indexation allowance should be applied before time apportionment, which will reduce the benefit of indexation allowance. Richard Rees-Pulley of Ernst &amp; Young which, with other accountants, was involved in the case said: 'It is wholly unjust that a portion of inflationary gains will be taxed as a result of this decision. As the Lords have previously said, CGT is a tax on real gains. The government should take urgent action to amend retrospectively the legislation to give proper indexation relief.'</p>

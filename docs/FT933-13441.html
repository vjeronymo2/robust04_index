			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Liz Claiborne warns of downturn LIZ CLAIBORNE, the US fashion designer and clothing manufacturer, dismayed shareholders on Friday by predicting a 30 per cent decline in full-year earnings per share for 1993. The news, which came only a day after the unexpected resignation of the company's vice-chairman Mr Jay Margolis, sent shares in Liz Claiborne tumbling by Dollars 6 to Dollars 23 5/8 , their lowest level in several years. The stock lost Dollars 1 3/4 on Thursday after news of Mr Margolis's departure hit the market. Mr Margolis is widely respected in the retail industry and many had expected him to take the helm when the current chairman, Mr Jerome Chazen, 65, retires. Mr Samuel Miller, the company's senior vice-president for finance, blamed the bleak forecast on weaker than expected consumer spending patterns for women's apparel, which have left the company with excess inventories. 'We had anticipated that more favourable business trends and improved results in several of our divisions would enable us to resume growth during the second half of the year and planned our inventory commitments accordingly,' he said. 'While we are not happy with the results, at almost 7 per cent of net sales our earnings are among the highest in the industry and our financial position remains strong,' Mr Miller added. For the second quarter, ended June 26, the company posted a 21.3 per cent decline in net earnings to Dollars 31.1m on sales which were 7.3 per cent higher at Dollars 506.9m. A year earlier, net income was Dollars 39.5m on sales of Dollars 472.6m. Earnings per share fell by 19.1 per cent to 38 cents from 47 cents. There were fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter and Mr Miller said that the board had extended the company's share buy-back programme by an additional Dollars 50m of common stock, bringing the total authorisation to Dollars 350m. For the first half, Liz Claiborne earned Dollars 73.8m, or 90 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.04bn against Dollars 102.3m, or Dollars 1.21, on sales of Dollars 1.03bn a year earlier. Earnings in the 1993 period included one-time gains of Dollars 1.6m.</p>

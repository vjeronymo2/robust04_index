			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division.  Yesterday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr. 'Ali  Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Tarqobeh  and Chenaran, Molayer, Mian-e Doab, Samirom, and Urmia gave  speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which  he condemned the shameful signing of the Gaza-Jericho Treaty  between the PLO and Israel and offered congratulations on the  triumph of the blacks in South Africa. Then the Majles went into  consultation, and we direct the attention of our esteemed  readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Tarqobeh And Chenaran </H5>   The government organizations and the Economic Council raise  the prices of goods and services at every opportunity on the  pretext of economic adjustment.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Moradi, deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran. He  commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari,  Teacher Week, and Workers Day. He discussed the disgraceful  performance of the United Nations and the international  organizations with regard to the slaughter of the Muslim people  of Gorazdeh by the bloodthirsty Serbs. He said: The world's  oppressed and tormented nations must realize that the only road  to liberation is the return to self and reliance on God and  unity.    The speaker discussed the importance of the agricultural  sector and the nation's steadfastness towards crises and  economic and political embargoes. He said: Unfortunately certain  decisions, one made this past year by the Economic Council to  increase the prices of fertilizer and pesticides, have weakened  this sector, and if it does not receive serious attention we  will witness the loss of the efforts made by the Ministry of  Agriculture and the national investment. We will even need to  import wheat and major agricultural crops.    Moradi discussed the severe cold in the orchards in the  province of Khorasan, and the serious damage to the agricultural  crops. He said: The government must provide long-term credits  for the current years and it must also insure the orchards in  the years to come.    The deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran also discussed the  one-sided and monopolistic performance of most sugar cube  factories last year and this year. He said: This has not only  irreparably damaged the nation's sugar cube industries, it has  caused an unreasonable rise in the price of sugar cubes and  sugar in the country and has hurt the general public. It is  necessary that the government deal with this matter seriously.    The speaker discussed the one-sided and unjust way in which  the sugar cube factories have dealt with farmers. Then he  discussed the shortage of cash in the nation's factories. He  said: Unfortunately the Ministry of Economic and Financial  Affairs and the Central Bank have regularly obstructed exports  and the import of raw materials, and the result has been factory  closures, unemployment, reduced production, and, ultimately, it  has unleashed inflation, which has caused emotional pain for the  exalted leader and the oppressed nation.    Continuing, Moradi added: Controlling prices and preventing  inflation is not something that can be solved with speeches,  memos, and guidelines. Only production and sound competition can  give the consumer the right to choose.    Continuing, he said: The government organizations and the  Economic Council raise the prices of goods and services at every  opportunity on the pretext of economic adjustment and helping  the vulnerable classes, ignoring the fact that there has been no  benefit to these people other than damage, harm, and inflation,  even though there may be long-term benefits.    Continuing, he criticized some unnecessary classes in the  universities. Elsewhere in his speech he thanked the president  of the republic, the delegation sent and the office of the  governor-general of Khorasan, who made efforts to solve the  problems in his electoral district. He said: Unfortunately,  although a year has gone by since the written order was issued  by the Ministry of Petroleum to provide gas service to the  district of Tarqobeh via Mashhad, nothing has yet been done.    The speaker thanked Engineer Gharazi, minister of post, for  ordering that telephones be assigned to the public for  installment payments in the municipality of Chenaran. In  conclusion he issued memos concerning his electoral district.  <H5>  'Abdollah Nowruzi, Deputy From Molayer </H5>   The next speaker was Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer. During  his  speech he discussed the issue of privatization. He said: If  privatization is to take place, it must occur with Iranian  thinking, with the nation's makeup and culture and in our  various circumstances. It must not be something conceived at the  College of Economic and Financial Affairs or by a council from  the World Bank, some of whom are American.    He added: Unfortunately there is a foundation there called  the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation giving special seminars on  privatization, providing guidance and giving direction to our  activities, yet we ourselves should be doing the privatization.    The speaker added: Their third seminar is to take place on  the 20th and the 21st. Their leader is Mr. David Ellerman [as  published], an American, and according to many of them, a CIA  agent who is officially supported by it. They have utterly  destroyed Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and El Salvador.    Continuing, the speaker said: Although some of what is in  the  Second Five-Year Plan is good, in some places it has impure  strains, and if careful attention is not given to those, it will  face great dangers.    In conclusion, the speaker discussed the fact that in the  Plan and Budget Organization there is a group of valuable and  perceptive experts. He said: There are also some who think in  terms of sectors and sometimes in terms of their own positions  and their home cities. This situation definitely exists in the  management of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of  Defense Affairs, the Administrative Affairs Organization and the  Plan and Budget Organization, and we must design the Second  Five-Year Plan based on the realities and needs of society.  <H5>  Jalal Rasuli, Deputy From Mian-e Doab </H5>   The Economic Council must be controlled with understanding  and expertise.    The next speaker was Rasuli, deputy from Mian-e Doab. During  his speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Motahari. He  said: Unfortunately our Ministry of Education has weak  management and this has meant that there is now a bipolar  educational system in our society. Those who have more money and  resources attend the nonprofit schools. Taking private classes,  they enjoy more instruction, training, and education.    The deprived classes in society, however, have lower quality  education and have been beset by dropouts.    He added: People are now even selling their carpets and  refrigerators so they can pay the costs at the nonprofit schools  and send their own to centers where they will receive good  education and training.    He discussed the Majles project to control prices. He said:  The Economic Council must be controlled with care, attention,  understanding, and expertise so that the result will be  limitations on services and also so that it will not cause long  lines and a black market for goods marketed through government  investments.    Continuing, Rasuli then cited the failure to invest in the  conversion industries as a factor in the reduced capability of  fruitful farms. He said: West Azarbaijan, especially my  electoral precinct, has green pastures and potential resources  for animal husbandry and agriculture, but due to the lack of  conversion industries and the inability of the people to invest  in these areas, it is faced with a serious problem. This is  especially true in the area of beet growing, which could free  the nation from the need to import beets. Unfortunately,  however, a worn-out factory built in that area about 50 years  ago is absolutely unable to answer the production needs of the  people.    He added: The only crop in the area whose cultivation is  mechanized is beets, but because the factory does not have the  necessary equipment and capacity, they have problems marketing  their crop. The people grow crops to meet the factory's  capacity, but unfortunately the people's crops rot in their  hands, while we import sugar from abroad.    He explained: The issue of privatization has meant that now  the Plan and Budget Organization and the Central Bank have  stopped this project to build beet factories in these areas.  They emphasize that investment should be made by the private  sector, although it is confirmed that in deprived areas such as  Mian-e Doab the private sector does not have the ability to  build factories.    Continuing, the speaker discussed the rising waters of Lake  Urmia. He said: This has swallowed up thousands of hectares of  land and not that much attention has been given to it.    It would be appropriate for the government to compensate the  losses of farmers, especially the several rural areas that have  been engulfed in water.  <H5>  Mahmud 'Attarzadeh, Deputy From Samirom </H5>   Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the government  organizations will not only create inflation, it will also  encourage corruption.    The next speaker was 'Attarzadeh, deputy from Samirom. He  commemorated the memory and the name of Martyr Motahari, the  sacrifices made by the nation's teachers. He commemorated World  Worker Day and said: Today more than at any other time, world  imperialism is seeking to create and put pressure on the  community of Islamic nations and especially the revolution  nation of Iran.    He discussed the fact that the policy of economic adjustment  designed for growth and development must not only be balanced  and proportional, but it must also have real and executive  coordination that is appropriate for the social structure and  for the cultural, social, and economic requirements of the time.  He said: In the policy of economic adjustment a general strategy  is pursued to eliminate subsidies, adjust manpower, reduce  currency in circulation, deregulate trade, unify the foreign  exchange rate and strengthen the private sector. In view of the  social and economic consequences of this policy for society,  especially the oppressed and vulnerable classes, attention must  be given to the following issues:    1 - The government and the executive officials must take the  initiative in enduring the pressures resulting from  implementation of the policy of economic adjustment, and they  must endure some of the pressures imposed on the people by  cutting expenses.    2 - In implementing the policy of economic adjustment  planning must be done and solutions must be found for the  problem of bringing the cost of living and the incomes of the  people into line with each other, yet presently there is no  correspondence between incomes and costs.    3 - Careful and logical policies must be made regarding  exports and imports, especially to alleviate the obstacles and  restraining factors at the various stages of executive activity  in export affairs.    4 - Real and more serious attention must be given to  productive economic activities with reliance on domestic  resources and priority to agriculture.    5 - Meeting import needs appropriate for a revolution  society  and designing suitable procedures and models for imports.    6 - The consumer models are not in conformity with the  sacred  goals of the revolution, and they severely exacerbate  formalities and ceremony. The government and the officials must  therefore take the initiative themselves and learn to economize  and make do.    7 - Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the  government organizations not only creates inflation and imposes  pressures of life on the people, it also encourages corruption  and undermines the public spirit of participation and  forbearance.    In conclusion, he issued memos to the Ministry of  Agriculture  concerning concern for marketing and exporting Samirom's apples,  to the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade concerning  allocating more credits and banking facilities for the Regional  Tribal Housing Project and attention to the small rural  industries, to the Ministry of Energy concerning expediting dam  construction in the region and trapping the region's water, to  the Ministry of Roads and Transportation concerning expediting  road reconstruction from Samirom to Shahr-e Reza, and to the  Ministry of Education and Training about the creation of  semicentralized rural schools and their services due to the  scattered disposition of the rural areas.  <H5>  Beytollah Ja'fari, Deputy From Urmia </H5>   The workers are the most valuable and profitable group in  our  society, and the nation's production is in their powerful hands.    Beytollah Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia, was the final  preagenda  speaker. He said: The workers are the most valuable and  profitable group in our society, and the nation's productive  life is in their powerful hands. I hope that one day we will be  able to cap the oil wells and build the nation's economy on  nonoil resources.    He read a selection of poetry concerning the position of the  teacher and discussed the problems and difficulties in his  electoral district. He said: Lake Urmia, with an area of 4,868  square kilometers, is considered the largest permanent  water-collecting basin in Western Asia. It is 1,067 meters above  sea level, and recently, with the rise in the water level, it  has created numerous problems for those residing on its shores.  The Council of Ministers must attend to this problem with  special diligence, because about 7,000 hectares [ha] of useful  pasture and 3,000 ha of farm land have been completely  destroyed. Because the lake's water is salt water, in 15 more  years these lands will be useless, and the government must find  a basic solution for the farmers who have suffered.    At the present time, 30 rural areas are threatened by the  water. It is highly likely that they will have to evacuate and  move to another place.    He added: The facilities at Bandar-e Golmankhaneh are in  danger. Damage is being caused, whose preliminary figure is 11  billion rials [R]. The solution is not for the officials to sit  waiting and then after all this damage has been done undertake  to compensate for the damage. The essential solution is to put  large reservoir dams on the rivers that flow into Lake Urmia  from West Azarbaijan. The precipitation provided by the  Creator's mercy is wasted due to the lack of planning and the  failure to deal with infrastructure in our region, and every  year this damages the strategic agriculture sector. Despite the  cries from the region's Majles deputies, attention is not given  to these matters as it can and should be given. Nothing would be  better than to invest in these provinces that have the ability  to become Iran's great agricultural centers, along with the  desert reclamation projects and the construction of multilane  freeways in the middle of the country.    I ask the nation's media, especially the Voice and Vision  organization, to portray in a clear and comprehensive way the  suffering and disarray of the rural people who have been hurt by  flooding and the rising salt waters.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art  Commission concerning the Motion To Inquire About Article 1 of  the Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government Institutions and  Companies From Printing and Publishing Nonessential  Publications, enacted 7/29/1365 [21 October 1986], of which  Article 1 was approved by the deputies.    Article 1: "The Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government  Institutions and Companies From Printing and Publishing  Nonessential Publications also includes the nation's  municipalities."    It is worth mentioning that the publication of any kind of  book, newspaper, magazine, similar publication, any kind of  promotional paper or sheet, pamphlet, tract, poster or other  item by government organizations was prohibited by the  aforementioned law.    One of the important points in this motion to inquire was  that the Guidance Commission agreed to exempt the municipalities  from this law, but the Majles rejected that.    Concerning this motion, Mr. Movahedi-Saveji said: If the  municipalities come and make huge expenditures on cards for  invitations, congratulations, condolences in the Majles and  other things, this is clearly against the interest of the  people. The people are very unhappy about this money being spent  on these things.    The second item on the agenda was the report from the  Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the bill on the  Amended Bilateral Transportation and Shipping Protocol for  Moving Goods by Road, between the Government of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Pakistan, which was approved by the deputies.    The next item on the agenda was the report from the Plan and  Budget Commission concerning the rejection of the proposed  amendment to Paragraph A, Note 47 of the 1364 [21 March 1985-20  March 1986] National Budget Law, the principle of which was  approved by the deputies.    Article 1: The official in charge of the provincial Islamic  propaganda organization is added to the members of the province  planning committee mentioned in Note 47 of the 1364 National  Budget Law.    One of the reasons the commission rejected the  aforementioned  motion is the "executive point of view" of the work of the  province planning committees, rather than cultural work.    The commission expert also said: If specific cultural  problems arise in the planning committee, the provinciale  general manager of guidance, who is on the committee, will solve  them. Supporters of the motion argued that with the official in  charge of the province propaganda organization on the committee,  it would have a stronger cultural dimension. Just as there are  many managers of economic organizations on the province planning  committee, in addition to the general manager of guidance, the  committee should also have as a cultural official the official  in charge of the province propaganda organization    The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the  Accounting Court Commission concerning the Proposed Law on  Procedures for Spending Current and Development Credits for the  Year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at Payam-e Nur  University (returned from the Guardian Council).    According to Article 1, Payam-e Nur University is  authorized,  due to the special procedures in the educational system, to  spend a maximum of 65 percent of its current expense and  allocated credits and also 25 percent of its development credits  based on the Law on Procedures for Carrying out Financial and  Trade Affairs at Universities and Institutions of Higher  Learning and Research, without observing the government's other  general regulations.    The final item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Agricultural Commission concerning the  Motion To Form the Supreme Agriculture and Rural Development  Council, continued consideration of which was deferred to the  next session.  <H5>  Measures Taken by Majles Commissions </H5> <H5>  Ministry of Intelligence Employment Bill </H5>   According to Article 21 of the aforementioned bill, to  procure and train the technical and specialist cadres it needs,  the Ministry of Intelligence may establish colleges or  institutions of higher learning in fields not taught in the  nation's universities, based on lawful regulations and  requirements. This bill has been approved in the Joint Councils  and National Domestic Affairs and Administrative and Employment  Affairs Commission.  <H5>  Bill Indexing Nongovernment Public Bodies and Institutions </H5>   Based on the above bill, the municipalities and affiliated  units, as long as 50 percent of their shares and capital belongs  to the municipalities, the Foundation for the Oppressed, the Red  Cross, the Imam's Aid Committee, the Martyr Foundation, the  Housing Foundation, the Iran National Olympic Committee, the 15  Khordad [5 June] Foundation, the Islamic Propaganda Organization  and the Social Security Organization are included in the note  for Article 5 of the Public Accounting Law enacted in 1366 [21  March 1987-20 March 1988].  <H5>  Motion To Determine Recording Fees at Official Documents </H5> Offices    This motion states that in order to obtain the funds  necessary to implement Articles 10, 11, 57, and 68 of the  administrative laws for official documents. Every month these  offices are required to pay 10 percent of the recording fees  collected into the account for insurance, retirement,  disability, and welfare, and treatment affairs for office heads  and assistant office heads in the official documents offices and  their dependents.    This motion was approved in the Judicial Affairs Commission,  which was acting as the main commission.  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5> <H5>  New Foreign Exchange Policy </H5>   Engineer Khamushi, deputy from Tehran, discussed the new  foreign exchange policies. He said: If the new foreign exchange  policies are properly implemented as announced, it will be  constructive. That is, the banking system must act on requests  to open credit accounts from the factories out of foreign  exchange obtained from exports. In this case the foreign  exchange market will cool down. The procedure recently announced  is the same one implemented several months ago by the banks,  which produced results controlling demand on the foreign  exchange market.  <H5>  Supreme Agricultural Council </H5>   One of the motions presented at yesterday's open Majles  session was the motion to form the Supreme Agricultural Council.  In this regard Engineer Jalali, chief of the Agriculture  Commission, told our correspondent: To reach its goals, the  agricultural sector needs extraordinary support to solve its  problems, and it needs the necessary coordination between the  relevant organizations. Exports of agricultural crops was one of  the successful sectors under the First Five-Year Plan, and more  than 120 percent of the designated goal was achieved.    Continuing, he said: With the formation of the Supreme  Agricultural Council, supervision of planning in this sector,  setting and designing guaranteed prices for agricultural crops,  creating coordination between organizations, supervision of the  procurement and training of manpower, policymaking to create  conversion industries, support for the export of products from  this sector, and supervision of the timely procurement of  credits and banking facilities for the agricultural sector will  be properly carried out.    He discussed the members of the Supreme Agricultural  Council.  He said: The president of the republic will serve as chief of  the council and the minister of agriculture, the minister of the  reconstruction crusade, the minister of energyr, the minister of  economic and financial affairs, the minister of the interior,  the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, and the chief of  the Environmental Protection Organization will serve as the main  members. Two members of the Majles Agriculture Commission will  attend meetings as observers.  <H5>  Membership of Officials of the Islamic Propaganda </H5> Organization in Province Planning Committees    Following the approval of membership of officials from the  Islamic Propaganda Organization in the province planning  committees, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi Eraqi told  our correspondent: To distribute development credits and  engender coordination between the organizations, province  planning committees will be formed, with the participation of 17  executive officials and under the supervision of the  governor-general. Despite the necessities that are felt with  regard to cultural issues, so far the propaganda organization  has not had members on these committees, and with Majles  approval this will be done.    He added: Despite the fact that the propaganda organization  does not have development credits approved by the Majles, so far  it has carried out 250 development projects, some of which are  half-complete. This organization's projects include the  construction of 50 Koranic societies in the deprived areas. With  the membership of representatives from this organization on the  province planning committees, henceforth it will be possible to  use local credits to complete the propaganda organization's  half-complete projects.</p>

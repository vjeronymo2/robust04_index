Kim Chong-u, North Korea's vice chairman of External Economy  Commission, met in January with the East European source who was  working in Pyongyang at the time and said that military  expenditures are a heavy burden to North Korea's economic  development, the source said. Kim's remarks show a change in  North Korea's economic policy, KYODO said.    Kim was quoted as saying that Asia is achieving the most  rapid economic growth in the world and emphasizing that North  Korea should strengthen its cooperative relations with Asian  countries in the economic field.    According to KYODO, Kim said that North Korea wants economic  cooperation with any Asian countries including capitalist  nations if they are not opposed to North Korean political system  and that North Korea wants to join the APEC in the end. If the  military expenditure is reduced, North Korea's economy can be  revitalized quickly and the North Koreans' living standard will  be improved, Kim added.</p>

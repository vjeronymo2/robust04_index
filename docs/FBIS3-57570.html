Russian authorities are at unease because the number of  holders of Estonian passports is growing in the region, the  leader of the Petserimaa league, Reet Tobre, said in a press  conference today.    She said Russia was demanding that these people formally  gave  up their Russian citizenship. But this would also strip them of  the right to own real estate in the region. After giving up  Russian citizenship they would also have to apply for a special  permit from Russian authorities to enter the border zone.    Tobre said Russia was constantly tightening its border  regulations, thus making it more and more difficult for Estonian  citizen residents to cross the border to Estonia.    The leader of the lobbying group didn't tell the number of  Estonian citizen residents of the Petseri region, an Estonian  territory between the two World Wars, saying she would do so  only after Russia reveals the names of Estonian residents who  have become officially Russian citizens.    The Soviet Union cut the region off from Estonia together  with a strip of land in the North, east of the Narva river, and  annexed the territories to Russia after World War II.    The Russian embassy in Tallinn so far has only said more  than  42,000 Russian citizens are living in Estonia. Embassy  officials say they cannot reveal the names of Russian citizens,  as Estonian authorities might begin a persecution of these  people.    Tobre said that was rather the case with the Estonian  citizens living in Russia.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Exchange controls removed by Spain SPAIN last night removed the last of its controls on capital leaving the country, in an effort to relieve pressure on its overvalued currency before further interest rate cuts become inevitable. The move follows an attack on Spanish monetary policy last weekend by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, who called the peseta's strength in the European Monetary System 'an unexpected phenomenon, even against nature'. The franc is sitting at the bottom of its permitted trading range against the peseta in the ERM, but Paris needs to cut interest rates to help revive its flagging economy. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said in London that the government had decided to allow Spanish residents to hold foreign currency accounts with banks licensed in Spain. He described the reform, which comes into effect this week, as 'transcendental' and 'an absolute innovation in our monetary history.' Analysts in Madrid said the move could lead to significant outflows of funds. The City of London was far from convinced that the deregulation would reduce upward pressure on the peseta. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, senior European economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, pointed out that such exchange control relaxation had often been counter-productive in other countries 'because it simply boosts the confidence of foreigners in the currency'. Mr Solchaga also said a second control, limiting loans by Spanish banks to non-residents to 50 per cent of their convertible peseta deposits, would be completely lifted. The measures mean Spain has largely met its promise last year to remove all capital controls well before its deadline at the end of next year. The only remaining control forces residents to seek authorisation for any foreign loan of more than Pta 1.5bn (Pounds 8.13m) for three years or less. It is used by the authorities to restrict short-term inflows of money. That, said Mr Pedro Perez, Mr Solchaga's deputy. 'can comfortably be lifted in the next 18 months'. Madrid remains in a tight corner. Mr Solchaga has been warning that inflation has not been beaten and that the time is not right for another interest rate cut to follow the one made a month ago when the Bank of Spain cut its official intervention rate a full point to 13.5 per cent. Although both the February and March consumer prices figures have held annualised inflation to 5.9 per cent, first quarter figures published this week show private sector credit and the broad money measure supply growing 21.5 per cent and 16 per cent respectively - more than double their targets. Faced with this, the Bank of Spain refused on Monday to cut its intervention rate. Nevertheless, the Spanish authorities' dilemma is winning little sympathy from Paris, where Mr Beregovoy warned that current tension in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS could only be explained by the fact that the Bank of Spain's money market rate was 13.5 per cent for an inflation rate of nearly 6 per cent.

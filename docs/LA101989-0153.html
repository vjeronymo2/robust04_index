			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> BOEING STRIKE TALKS LAST ONLY 3 1/2 HOURS  </P> <P> Talks aimed at ending a 2-week-old walkout by 57,800 Boeing Co. machinists  ended after just 3 1/2 hours and federal mediator Doug Hammond said he did not  know when negotiations would resume. The two sides were kept in separate rooms  at Hammond's Seattle office so any suggestions of changes in the contract would  be kept unofficial. When meeting face-to-face the suggested changes become  official positions. There are concerns within the aircraft giant and among  customers about delays in aircraft deliveries.  </P></p>

Appendix I, Section V, Paragraph C is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix I to Part 121_Drug Testing Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> V.

Random testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2 &hyph;4 of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the statistical reports required by section X of this appendix. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this appendix are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's compliance with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on November 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David R.

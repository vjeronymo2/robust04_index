V. Shishkin, Institute of Mechanical </F> Engineering imeni A. A. Blagonravov, Russian Academy of  Sciences, Moscow; UDC 620.172.21]    [Abstract] Although limited use has been found in sectors  such as machine building, aerospace, shipbuilding, gas-and-oil  work, and medicine for alloys with shape memory, broader use of  such alloys has been held back by the slow development of new  approaches to the design of structures based on such memory. In  this, the first in a series of articles to be published by  ZAVODSKAYA LABORATORIYA on the mechanics of deformation of  materials with shape memory in the thermoelastic region, the  researchers address the problem of creating a generalized  thermomechanical diagram of alloys with shape memory, i.e.,  _s_[.sub]R[/] = f(_e_[.sub]S[/]), which describes the  relationship between, on the one hand, reactive stresses  generated during the formation of a structure as a result of  thermomechanical recovery and, on the other, the magnitude of a  given deformation of incomplete recovery. The researchers point  out that the return stresses in a structural element with shape  memory are not a function of the means through which the return  process is effected; rather they are determined solely by the  type and magnitude of deformation of incomplete recovery during  contact with the joined part. A generalized thermomechanical  diagram obtained under conditions of absolutely rigid resistance  turns out to be a universal curve of deformation that describes  the process of the thermomechanical return of a structural  element for an entire range of a deformation.

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Margins rise at Grosvenor Inns Grosvenor Inns, a pub operator in and around London and in the Midlands, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 319,000 from a turnover of Pounds 3.52m for the half year ended November 28. The group came to the USM in May 1992. The directors said turnover and profits had been adjusted to exclude the disposal of two loss-making pubs and others earmarked for disposal. They added that with improved operating margins and the acquisition and disposal programme well under way they were confident of a 'much stronger performance' in the second half. An interim dividend of 2p is being paid from earnings of 2.8p. The shares rose 7p to 85p.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Haredi journals HAMODI'A, YATED NE'EMAN, and  SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] YOM LEYOM, covered Israeli  independence day in their weekend issues. Each of them, in its  own way, took pains to emphasize its estrangement from the state  while critically judging those "religious Zionists" who behave  as if the state were the first step towards redemption. It is  not merely that the state cannot be viewed as the start of  redemption, they stressed, but that the opposite is true. As  HAMODI'A put it, "This is the worst diaspora."    HAMODI'A filled an entire page with three articles ticking  off the evils of the Zionist state. In this they seemed to glory  in vindictive satisfaction. This state, one of the articles  proclaimed, is incapable of assuring the peace and safety of its  citizens. It depends on the views of others. What is more, it  even eradicates "Jewish roots." The joy of independence is not  their joy. And as in the past, this year, too, they have  expressed their opinion that the Jewish state, which arose  miraculously after 2,000 years of exile, is not be seen as the  end of exile and the start of redemption.    Indeed, one of the authors makes an effort to emphasize that  his commentary cannot be understood as "schadenfreude" unless it  is taken, as it must be in these times, as the soul searching of  a Jew. To prove that we are not safe in this land, he mentions  the attacks in Afula, Hadera, and other places around the  country that have claimed the lives of more than a prayer quorum  of innocent Jews.    We read in YATED NE'EMAN, among other things, that: "The  grand vision promoted by the Zionists and the various religious  nationalists of Israel as the safe haven where Jewish blood will  no longer be spilled, as they have put it, has been utterly  shattered, almost obliterated. Most unfortunately, today, more  so than other time since the founding of the state, they  themselves see the great lie that they have made of the reality  and existence of the state. This fact gives us great joy, for  exposure of the lie is essential to recognizing the truth. This  day, independence day, is appropriate to [text illegible] in our  hearts, for if the day shall come when a new idolatry arises in  a different guise, they will not pursue it and be seduced into  becoming complete fools."    In an editorial on independence day, YATED NE'EMAN also  called on its readers not to rely on the security of the state  or its independence since it is neither secure nor independent  and its behavior, of course, is alien to the spirit of Judaism.    SHAS' organ, YOM LEYOM, treated the state in the same vein.  We read in one of its editorials that: "Despite the hopes placed  in it by its founders, it has not succeeded in solving the  problems of the Jewish people. It sought to create a land in  which Jews would be able to live their lives independent of  outsiders. But that has not happened. On the contrary, Jewish  lives in the state of Israel are more at risk than are the lives  of Jews in other countries.... Accordingly, we must recognize  that the diaspora still continues in all its aching force  notwithstanding the founding of the state. Until the advent of  redemption, there is nothing for us to do but try to protect  Jewish lives, even at the painful price of yielding the  territories."    On the same page of YATED NE'EMAN, there appeared an article  under the headline, "Some Celebration, Some Independence." The  author ridicules not only the celebration of independence but  the state itself. Referring to the prayer for the peace of the  state, he glibly asserts that "Whoever blesses the national  government, its ministers and advisers each Sabbath, in fact, is  blessing Shulamit Aloni, Amnon Rubenstein, Shim'on Peres, Yosi  Beilin and their colleagues and advisers.... Even these  last-named Zionists are now confounded by this land. So who is  it, exactly, who is celebrating independence here?" The author  also has something to say about standing at attention for the  siren blast in memory of the soldiers who fell in the line of  duty. In his view, "The state established the siren as a form of  identification, but it is a ritual void of any substance or  meaning...." As to the Jewish character of Israel and the  state's relationship to Torah life, he writes that one can learn  from the media, the Knesset, the courts, the street and every  stone and wall. He notes desecrations of the Sabbath, violations  of kashrut, a decline in Jewish Torah education and so on.    In short, there is no room for Jews who observe Torah and  the  commandments to identify with the state.    These are harsh words but the author, with all due respect,  apparently forgot to add that his movement, SHAS, is an active  partner in this anti-Jewish, antireligious government, and has  prevented it from falling and being replaced by another  government that would be more Jewish, more religious, etc.    We read these articles in three newspapers, two of them  dressed in very Haredi garb and the third in the clothing of a  community becoming just as orthodox. To tell the truth, we were  not surprised by what we read. This is not the first time that  Agudat Yisra'el in its two incarnations and SHAS have not  identified with the state of Israel. They treat it as they do  any diaspora. They never have a kind word to say in praise of  the state that arose by the grace of God after 2,000 years of  exile. They also deliberately ignore that the founding of the  state triggered a great turnabout to the benefit of Jewish life  in Israel and the communities of the diaspora. It has become a  defender for untold thousands of Jews in foreign countries and  has even rescued many from the attacks of anti-Semites seeking  to raise their hands against Jewish lives. Not only that, but  also despite the state's continuing war against terrorists and  the enemies around us, there is no better and safer place for  Jews today than in this country.    For all the criticism of what has happened in Israel, no one  can overlook the flourishing Torah education to which we have  been witness, the dissemination of Torah sources to thousands of  Israelis and everything else that instills pride in a religious  person in Israel.    Only the blind cannot see all this and, instead of blessing  the creation of the state of Israel as the beginning of our  redemption, raise their hands against the state of the Jews and  treat it as they would the exile of the Jews.    Even if we continue to pray for the redemption of all  Israel,  God forbid that we should be grateful and offer up a blessing  for the beginning of our redemption or make a prayer of  thanksgiving that, by the grace of heaven, we have been  delivered from the bonds of exile and, as free men, built a new  home in the land bequeathed to our forefathers.    We have no illusions that the haredim, including SHAS, will  change their minds and admit that what they have said is wrong.  Even so, it is worth reminding them that, by the lives they have  chosen to live, they have forgotten the words of the great sages  on the subject of lepers, warning against speaking evil of any  son of Israel. These reproaches are seven times truer when it is  a matter of repudiating and slandering not just the state of  Israel but those who believe in it and each day offer up anew a  blessing on the start of the redemption of the people of Israel  in the land of Israel.</p>

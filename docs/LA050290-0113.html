			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> OTHER CITY WORKERS USED SHERIDAN FIRM  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan's real estate firm has represented as  many as 19 city employees in private land transactions since 1984, her husband  and business partner said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sheridan's role in representing City Atty. Roger Grable in the sale of his home  earlier this year triggered an ongoing city inquiry into the practice, which  was criticized by Councilman Edward A. Dornan as a potential conflict of  interest.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a city official also revealed that the inquiry has been expanded  beyond the Grable transaction to include all business that the Sheridan  partnership did with municipal employees.  </P> <P> City Manager Paul Brady Jr. confirmed that the inquiry, being conducted by a  San Francisco expert in legal conflicts, has been widened to include all city  employees at the request of the council. Brady declined comment on the inquiry,  saying it is scheduled for discussion at a closed session of the council  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sheridan's husband, Donald Sheridan, a broker at ReMax Realty in Irvine, said  Tuesday that he believes his wife did nothing wrong in her business dealings  with city employees. He said no more than 20 such transactions occurred in the  last seven years, and together represented no more than 10% of the Sheridan  partnership's business. The Sheridans were commonly the listing agents for  property sales in these transactions, Donald Sheridan said, which entitled them  to a small percentage of the sale price.  </P> <P> Donald Sheridan also offered to provide detailed information on each  transaction to the council, through his personal accountant. He declined to  identify publicly the city employees he and his wife have represented.  </P> <P> Sheridan said he said his wife have disclosed all financial information  required by law, and challenged other council members to do the same.  </P> <P> "I consider (the inquiry) a persecution of my wife," he said. "Enough is  enough. I think we should all be on a level playing field and open all of our  books."  </P> <P> Sally Anne Sheridan, a candidate for mayor against popular incumbent Larry  Agran in next month's election, could not be reached for comment and did not  participate in Tuesday's news conference at the couple's real estate office.  </P> <P> Dornan, who first questioned Sheridan's transaction, on Tuesday called the  press conference "a desperate attempt to camouflage the issue of (Donald  Sheridan's) representation of city employees."  </P> <P> Dornan said he will seek to require that all city employees report any business  transactions with any council member.  </P> <P> "This way, it's right up front and it doesn't prevent people from doing  anything if it isn't illegal," Dornan said.  </P> <P> City Manager Brady has acknowledged selling at least two houses through the  Sheridans while he served as assistant city manager.  </P> <P> City Atty. Grable also confirmed that his home was listed by Donald Sheridan in  a transaction completed on April 13. Last December, Sally Anne Sheridan voted  to renew a city contract with Grable's law firm, Rutan &amp; Tucker. Grable  said he is familiar with conflict laws and can see no violations.  </P> <P> Sally Anne Sheridan abstained last week from voting on a matter involving Rutan  &amp; Tucker. Donald Sheridan said Tuesday that his wife is not allowed under  state law to vote on any such matter for one year after the sale of Grable's  home.  </P> <P> Sheridan said he and his wife plan to continue representing city employees in  real estate deals.  </P> <P> "I think we should be able to do business with anybody we want to," Donald  Sheridan said. "Why should we be restricted just because Sally is an elected  official? We've got to make a living." WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

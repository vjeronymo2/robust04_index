			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pegasus soars to Pounds 1m halfway PEGASUS Group, the USM-quoted producer and distributor of accounting software, trebled pre-tax profits in the first half of 1993 to Pounds 1.02m. For the 1992 period to July 31 the figure was Pounds 335,000. Revenue was boosted by the introduction of Version 6 of the mainstream Pegasus Senior product and statutory upgrades, said Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive. The impact of those upgrades would not recur in the second half and software sales would continue at reduced levels despite the introduction of Pegasus Opera in the final quarter. The benefit of integrating the Pegasus Supply business with Stockforms had become increasingly evident. The group was in a period of transition as resources were increasingly committed to the development and marketing of Pegasus Opera, Mr Hubbard-Ford emphasised. An interim dividend of 2p is declared, payable from earnings per share of 9.4p. That compared with 3.5p from 3.8p last time, which was part of a 17 months accounting period.</p>

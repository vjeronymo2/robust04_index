			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (32): Good reasons for optimism - Inflation / Is it a thing of the past? One good indicator that inflation may not be as dead as people believe is that so many suppose it is. Apart from this niggling doubt, the picture looks rather good. It should remain attractive for some time. Yet things could go wrong. The main risks lie in the domestic policies of the industrial countries, rather than in outside events, such as rises in commodity prices. The latest forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was that, excluding Turkey, the rise in the deflator for GDP (the broadest measure of inflation) would be only 2.1 per cent this year, following 2.6 per cent in 1993 and 3.2 per cent in 1992. Not since the 1960s has the OECD-wide GDP deflator risen by less than 3 per cent in any year. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has argued that 'price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household decisions'. Given the difficulty of measuring quality improvements, this level is often taken to be 0-2 per cent. The advanced industrial countries have virtually achieved that goal. In fact, the OECD forecasts that in 1994, no fewer than 18 members of the OECD will have inflation rates of less than 3 per cent. This can be contrasted even with 1987, the year when inflation was lowest in 1980s. Then the increase in the OECD-wide GDP deflator (excluding Turkey) was 3.2 per cent, while only eight countries achieved inflation below 3 per cent. The return to fairly low inflation after a quarter of a century is a considerable feat. Not the least of its benefits is that the costs of lowering inflation need not be suffered once again. This should help ensure that the next economic expansion is a long one. There are also good reasons for believing that inflation will remain low. One of these is the low rate of monetary growth in virtually all OECD countries, the principal exception being Germany. Scarred by bad loans in the 1980s, banks seem unprepared to finance any substantial expansion of credit. Those scars were the final injury inflicted by the 1970s, when investors had made fortunes from inflation. It was probably necessary, therefore, to experience a cycle in which inflation did not bail out borrowers from their mistakes. Maybe the reason Germany has had higher monetary growth over the past 12 months than any other member of the group of seven leading industrial countries is that it did not experience a large-scale inflationary redistribution of income during the 1970s. Yet another reason for optimism, many argue, is the emergence of low-cost competition, particularly in east Asia. This development is, in fact, similar in its effects to an increase in the rate of domestic productivity growth. Inflation could still accelerate if domestic nominal costs, particularly wages, were to rise and the exchange rate were to depreciate pari passu. Domestic monetary conditions, not the relative prices of particular commodities will determine those trends. Perhaps the most fundamental reasons for optimism are intellectual and political. People no longer believe it is possible to blow economies up like balloons merely by judicious use of the printing-press pump. Equally, the political weight of those opposed to inflation - notably actual and imminent pensioners - is rising, with their numbers. With exchange controls lifted, it is also easier for investors to protect themselves against inflation and punish those who threaten them with its resurgence. For all that, inflation can hardly be regarded as dead. One reason is that there are plenty of borrowers, including households, who would love to have some inflationary relief from the debts they accumulated in the 1980s. Moreover, among those borrowers are governments, all of whom are under significant fiscal pressure and some of whom - Sweden, Italy and Belgium being the salient examples - seem to be in close to a critical position. When debtors are able to determine whether or not their debts are inflated away, it is sensible to worry about what they will choose to do. Inflations are always symptoms of distributional struggles. Such struggles tend to be fiercest when income falls, which is why inflation peaks have coincided with surges in prices of imported primary commodities, particularly oil. The resulting deterioration in the external terms of trade forces a pass-the-parcel process of redistributing the losses. It is natural, therefore, to ask whether resurgent commodity prices might yet derail the stately progress of non-inflationary growth. Commodity prices have, in fact, recovered quite strongly. In the year to September 1994, the Economist price index for all commodities has risen 37 per cent, for food commodities it has risen 43 per cent and for industrial raw materials it has risen 31 per cent. These seem significant increases, but they must be kept in context. In nominal terms the Economist all-items index of commodity prices is still a little below where it was in 1988. In real terms - deflated in this case by the consumer price index of the OECD - the value of the all items Economist index in June 1994 was 35 per cent below its level of six years before. Over the same period, the corresponding declines were almost a fifth for the real price of foodstuffs and almost a half for industrial raw materials. In the early 1990s, real commodity prices fell to their lowest level of the 20th century. Even adjusted for the quality improvement in manufactures, the real value of commodities has halved since the mid-1970s and is now lower than at any time since the 1930s. The question is whether the still-depressed prices of today are due for a sustained turn-around. This matters because the relative decline in commodity prices, albeit disastrous for many commodity-exporting developing countries, greatly assisted the disinflation in OECD countries during the 1980s and 1990s. In its 1994 Global Economic Prospects, the World Bank forecast an improvement in the terms of trade of exporters of fuel, but only at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent between 1994 and 2000 and of a mere 0.4 per cent for exporters of non-fuel primary products. This is not much of an improvement, although it certainly does contrast with deteriorations of 2.2 per cent a year between 1987 and 1993 for exporters of fuel and of 1.8 per cent a year for exporters of non-fuel primary products.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour presses PM on growth debate LABOUR yesterday stepped up its charges that the government has backtracked on its pledges to use the Edinburgh summit to promote a Europe-wide growth strategy. At a news conference Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, produced documents allegedly confirming that Mr John Major's commitment to debate economic expansion were in reality 'minimalist' and 'insubstantial'. The papers included a confidential Conservative Research Department briefing note that relegated talks at Edinburgh on economic expansion to the eighth and last place on the agenda. The second was the British presidency's compromise proposal for last Friday's meeting of foreign and finance ministers on community financing. That confined the discussion to noting that the European Investment Bank was considering creating a new financial instrument to promote transport networks and small and medium-sized businesses. Backing a warning yesterday from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, that the economic outlook was grave, Mr Brown said Mr Major should take up the scheme for an Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.02bn) European Investment Fund. He dismissed as inadequate the UK's proposals that fellow EC partners should adopt measures similar to its Autumn Statement on spending which sought to promote capital spending while reining in public-sector pay rises. A senior Conservative official close to the Edinburgh planning process indicated last night, however, that the government was looking for little more than useful language on growth from the summit. Downing Street has made clear that discussion on growth is likely to be confined to talks over lunch.</p>

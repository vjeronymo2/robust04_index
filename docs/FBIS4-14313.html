			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, has visited the military hospital where he was  reassured about the condition of the wounded from the 3d Armored  Brigade and the 1st Armored Brigade who were the victims of the  regrettable fighting that broke out the day before yesterday [27  April] in the 'Imran garrison.    The brother president expressed his sympathy and deep regret  and sorrow over this incident, which was planned and carried out  by irresponsible elements. These elements want to achieve their  wicked objectives with the aim of pushing the sons of the one  homeland toward conflict and fighting in order to destroy the  homeland and return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that  prevailed before 22 May 1990. These elements are doing so to  satisfy their whims and narrow interests, pursuant to the  objectives of forces hostile to the revolution and democracy.    The brother president also expressed his heartfelt  condolences to the families of the martyrs and innocent victims  of the regrettable incident, noting that all are the sons of the  one Yemeni homeland, whose souls and chaste blood are dear to  us. He stressed that the sons of the Armed Forces are  comrades-in-arms and comrades-in-struggle who stand in one  trench to defend the revolution, the republic, homeland, and  unity. He said that they will never turn into tools or lackeys  of those elements with egocentric inclinations and destructive  desires who are forcing the sons of the Armed Forces to pay  dearly from their souls and blood for the sake of their  destructive inclinations. He noted that the sons of the Armed  Forces and security forces are our sons and brothers and we are  proud of their sacrifices for the sake of the homeland. He  said: They are the sons of this great people; they are faithful  to this people's struggle, principles, and sacrifices. They  will never allow any tampering with the security, stability, and  achievements of the homeland.    The brother president said: The forces that are pushing  toward war and fighting and toward igniting the military  situation for selfish purposes and personal interests are, in  fact, punishing the sons of our people and the members of the  valiant Armed Forces by exposing them to death and pushing them  toward danger for no reason except to satisfy the whims of these  forces, which are being paid for all this.    He said: As the people expect, the sons of the Armed Forces  will be the vanguards of the ranks and will form the frontlines  that will protect the homeland against all dangers and foil the  sick dreams and desperate attempts to redivide the country and  impose separation. He added: Any separatist act will be faced  with decisiveness and with more coherence among Yemeni unionists.    The brother president praised the high morale and readiness  of the injured to sacrifice their souls in defense of unity. He  noted that this criminal act, in which the sons of our Armed  Forces were dragged into confrontation against each other, falls  within the framework of the criminal series of acts that began  on 20 February 1993, on the eve of the signing of the accord  document in Amman, with the aim of bypassing it and obstructing  the accord document's implementation in order to peddle the  scheme of separation. He said that this series began with the  aggravation of the situation against the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in  the Ibyan Governorate and the incidents in Harth Sufyan, Shabwah  and Dhamar, when the separatist forces intended to ignite the  military situation and mobilize people with to create  estrangement and conflicts among the sons of the Armed Forces  and to push them toward fighting.    The brother president warned these separatist elements,  which  planned these criminal acts, against continuing these acts and  playing with fire. He called on these elements to turn to  reason, wisdom, and peaceful dialogue to resolve all issues, as  well as to respect the will of the people and their  constitutional institutions. He expressed hope that the tragedy  of the 'Imran garrison will be the last tragedy in this beloved  homeland in this delicate phase of its history. He also called  for a mobilization of all national efforts within the framework  of a large-scale national agreement to implement the accord  document without hesitation or procrastination to reinforce  national unity and strengthen our democratic unifying march.    The brother president urged the military committee to  expeditiously present a detailed report on this regrettable  incident, its circumstances, and those who stand behind it so  that the people will be aware of all the facts.    The brother president instructed officials in the Defense  Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff, and the military  hospital to take good care of the wounded. He also instructed  that the serious cases, which cannot be treated in hospitals  inside the country, be transferred for treatment abroad.    The president was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and  Industry Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, Planning and  Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, Interior Minister Brigadier  General Yahya al-Mutwakkil, and Sanaa Mayor Husayn al-Miswari.</p>

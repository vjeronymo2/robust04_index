			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Italian banks close to Soviet finance deal ITALIAN BANKS are close to finalising a large loan for the Soviet Union, the first to be raised under an Italian government programme announ- ced last year aimed at supporting the weak Soviet economy. The funds are being raised under an Italian pledge to provide up to L2,200bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in financial support to the Soviet Union. The loan of Ecu427.9m (Dollars 509.2m), carrying the guarantee of the Italian Treasury, will finance payments to Italian exporters for the supply of goods to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has built up arrears on trade debts with western exporters, amounting to an estimated Dollars 5bn. Banca Commerciale Italiana is arranging the credit, which will be available for a year. It will be repaid in four equal semi-annual instalments with a final maturity at the end of 1995. BCI declined to disclose the interest margin. The syndicate of 15 to 20 banks is expected to be entirely Italian. The Soviet Union borrowed directly from banks until late 1989, but it would now be impossible without guarantees from governments in the industrialised countries. According to a report from the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research group financed by international banks, commercial banks provided more than Dollars 8bn in new credit in 1989 but withdrew about Dollars 12bn last year. This year it expects a further Dollars 7bn will be withdrawn. Most of this swing was accounted for in short-term lending, through a fall in the availability of trade credits and foreign deposits with Soviet banks. It calculated official disbursements of medium and long-term credits to the Soviet Union this year should total Dollars 13.1bn, of which Italy accounts for Dollars 1.4bn. The report, published at the end of last month, estimates Germany will provide Dollars 3bn, Korea almost Dollars 2bn and France, Italy Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US at least Dollars 1bn each.</p>

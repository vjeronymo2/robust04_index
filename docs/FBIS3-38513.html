			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Nese: "Scalfaro: `I Continue To Do My Duty </F> Calmly'"]    [Text] The president of the Republic against  demilitarization of the Carabinieri: These are attempts to  diminish and weaken it.    Inauguration of the academic year at the Carabinieri  officers' school. Incisa di Camerana agrees with the chief of  state. Federici: no more escorts.    Rome--Tradition dictates that it be a solemn and austere  ceremony. But this time even the inauguration of the academic  year at the Carabinieri officers' school took place amid  polemics and venom. With Chief of State Scalfaro who says: "Keep  your hands off the stars [military badges of rank]," to those  who are pressing for the demilitarization of the Carabinieri.  With Commanding General Luigi Federici who is fed up with seeing  the Carabinieri used as escorts. With parliamentary deputy  Antonio Pappalardo (a retired Carabinieri colonel) who gets up  and leaves as soon as Scalfaro begins speaking. As a protest, he  says. Because it displeases him that the president of the  Republic ("a man who should have resigned to place himself at  the disposal of the magistracy, like an ordinary citizen")  stayed away from Calabria on the day of the funeral of the two  murdered Carabinieri.    Scalfaro must be accustomed to these little scenes by now.  He  continued as though nothing had happened, turning his thoughts  to the "two murdered Carabinieri, who remind us of the price to  be paid for the liberty of the Italian people." He called the  attention of all "to man's terrible capacity to commit crime, to  man's immense, fascinating, rich, shining capacity to sacrifice  himself." And then he told of having spoken by telephone with  the commander of the company of Carabinieri at Palmi after  hearing the news of the murder of the two Carabinieri.    "He told me: `We are deeply wounded. We remain calm and  strong. No one will bend us. We will continue to do our duty  calmly, without stopping.'" Scalfaro made these words his own, a  "simple and fresh message. I gather it to myself and, with best  wishes for a good academic year, I offer it to you (directing  himself to the students there present) as a commitment and a  meditation."    The focus of the speech then broadened to the Carabinieri as  an institution. "The stars worn by the Carabinieri are  essential," Scalfaro said. But who wants to take their stars  away from the men of this deserving force? Most of all, the  SIULP [Unified Police Workers Labor Union], the policemen's  union, which insists on the need to demilitarize the Carabinieri  and bring them under the control of the Ministry of Interior,  removing them from the Defense Ministry.    Nothing doing, said the chief of state. These are all  "attempts to diminish and weaken" the Force. Otherwise: "You  might as well say that when the stars are gone, the Carabinieri  are gone."    According to Scalfaro, there are political and historical  reasons for not changing the present arrangement. The decision  to entrust the security of the country and the maintenance of  public order to two separate bodies was taken "at the birth of  the Republic." The president of the Republic recalled that, "It  was a decision of state, a political decision." Certainly, he  added, "there is no doubt that the two solutions have advantages  and disadvantages." But, "it was believed, and it is still  believed, by an absolute majority, if not unanimously, that this  pluralism has enormous advantages, especially in a democratic  state."    A decisive not to demilitarize was also voiced by Army Chief  of Staff Incisa di Camerana and by the commanding general of the  Carabinieri, Federici, who reviewed the reasons for complaints  from within the Force. And he proposed solutions. First of all,  the use of Carabinieri as escorts must be ended. He called for a  halt in "the drain represented by requests for protection and  security measures that risk causing dangerous shortages of  trained personnel."    Federici maintains that it is a mistake to speak of a lack  of  coordination between the two forces: "It already exists." And he  does not want to hear of the possibility of transferring the  Carabinieri to the control of the Ministry of Interior. "Under  this solution--according to the commanding general of the  Force--the functional relationships would remain substantially  unchanged. Only the authority responsible for the Force would  change, and it would raise a question in the future as to the  existence of two separate police forces with broad  responsibilities, which is the result of a democratic choice  that may be found in most democratic countries in the world."    An important part of Federici's speech was devoted to the  murder of the two Carabinieri. According to the commanding  general, there is no connection between the double murder in  Scilla and the discovery of weapons for an assassination attempt  against Judge Cordova: "The ambush is a reaction to the intense  and incisive activity of the Force against the gangs of local  organized crime, the 'Ndranghetta." All the more reason for  Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri to confirm, after the murders,  that the deployment of troops to Calabria is imminent. The  soldiers will take part in an operation called Riace, which will  have the same characteristics as the operation called Sicilian  Vespers.</p>

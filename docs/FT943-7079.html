			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Observer: Academic pull To lose one Treasury official may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two . . . At the beginning of next month, just when all international eyes will be on Italy's 1995 budget plans, treasury minister Lamberto Dini will be waving arrivederci to a couple of his lieutenants. Francesco Giavazzi, who has played a prominent role in recent privatisations, is returning whence he came two years ago, namely Milan's private Bocconi University. Meanwhile, Alberto Giovannini, also only in situ since 1992, plans to chuck in his job as head of the Treasury's international borrowing division. He is likewise returning to his former stable, New York's Columbia University, this time as professor of international business. The G2, as they are known for their joint work on international monetary arrangements, go protesting loudly that they have not fallen out with Dini. But the latter will miss their intellectual clout. All he needs now is for his director-general Mario Draghi to be wafted across to his own old job - number two at the Bank of Italy.</p>

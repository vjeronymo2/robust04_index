			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was one of the worst days -- if one can draw such  comparisons at all -- in this 16-day offensive by the Serb  aggressor on the Bihac region. The howitzers, tanks, [words  indistinct] multiple-rocket launchers, antiaircraft machine guns  on the nearby hills allow themselves no respite. Throughout the  day fierce battles have raged on the Grmusa and Grabez plains.  This afternoon the chetniks launched one of their heaviest tank  and infantry attacks.    In the course of this hand-to-hand battle lasting several  hours fighters of the 5th Corps have managed to repel the  chetnik vampires. The Serbs have been reinforced with special  units from Banja Luka and Prnjavor, who among their ranks have  notorious criminals whose hands are heavily stained with blood.  Some 30 of them will never leave the plain while dozens have  been taken out of action. A number of our fighters have been  wounded in the furious fighting and shelling.    Today's chetnik defeat was yet another reason behind the  intensified artillery destruction of Bihac and Cazin and their  outlying districts. Also targeted were mosques, particularly in  the Cazin municipality. As if this was not enough, the chetniks  from the territory of the so-called Republic of Serb Krajina  also joined in the action. They, moreover, did so from [word  indistinct] in full view of the UN force stationed on the state  border of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the course of the day helicopters, delivering more combat  equipment, have also been sighted. This shows that the chetniks  are still taking advantage of world opinion being focused on the  lifting of siege of Sarajevo as they pursue their goals in other  areas. This is why the civilian and military authorities have  demanded once again from the government and state presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina that it make further efforts leading to  compliance with the UN resolution under which the Bihac region  is designated as a protected area. Along the demarcation lines  with the so-called autonomous province of Velika Kladusa some  provocations and actions by the most extremist groups have taken  place during the day.</p>

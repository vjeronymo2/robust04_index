			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Whitehall papers neglected by MPs SEVERAL parliamentary select committees have failed to examine the expenditure white papers and annual reports issued by Whitehall departments, a study sponsored by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said yesterday. It said the cross-party Trade and Industry, and Scottish affairs committees had never considered the reports on expenditure plans issued by their departments. The Employment and Welsh affairs committees had only done so once each. This was in spite of departmental reports and their predecessor - the public expenditure white papers - containing vital financial and policy information not available elsewhere. The analysis, by Mr Andrew Likierman and Ms Alison Taylor from the London Business School, concludes that departmental reports contain substantially more information on a wider range of topics than the white papers that they replaced in 1990. The white papers provide details on the budget allocations made by the chancellor of the exchequer to each department in the autumn statement. The reports, which are produced by all 19 departments, include expenditure plans, policy objectives and performance measures. The average number of pages has risen sharply in the past two years, with more use of colour, charts and photographs and a more structured layout. The research shows that the circulation of the reports has risen steadily since 1990. The greatest demand from individual purchasers is for the reports from the departments of Trade and Industry and the Environment and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mr Likierman criticised the media for failing to give the departmental reports more attention. There was less coverage of the reports in national daily newspapers this year than last.

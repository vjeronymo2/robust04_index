Entering the Presidential Palace, Feissel said things are  proceeding normally, adding that he does not expect any  difficulties. The goal of the UN official's meetings is to  prepare an agenda and determine the points that each side  considers crucial in implementing the CBM's.    According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation's [CyBC]  information, Kliridhis said the key-points are access to  Famagusta's fenced-off area, the safety of the Greek Cypriots  who will return to their homes in that area, and the travel  documents that Turkish Cypriots will use at Nicosia Airport if  and when it reopens.    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, government spokesman  Ioannis Kasoulidhis, Deputy Minister to the President Pandelis  Kouros, and UN political adviser John Paul Kavanagh participated  in the meeting. Feissel will have another meeting with Turkish  Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas tomorrow. He also met Denktas  yesterday.    Leaving the Presidential Palace a short time ago, Feissel  said the agenda of the proximity talks has been finalized,  adding that it contains six topics. The UN envoy said he will  inform the UN secretary general that the two sides have agreed  on the agenda. He added that the proximity talks will begin on  17 February, as scheduled.    Feissel confirmed a CyBC report braodcast yesterday that Joe  Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus, will arrive in Cyprus next Tuesday [15 February] and  will not be accompanied by UN experts.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Yorkshire women fight on home front WHEN God told Moses that male workers were worth 50 shekels but female workers only 30, He perhaps thought that women's household responsibilities left them poorly qualified for work. Employers who have traditionally followed such divine guidance may wish to reassess this received wisdom now that 15 Yorkshire women have gained vocational qualifications recognised by employers across the country - largely on the strength of their household skills. Two of the 15 now have jobs and all the others are on work placements after completing a groundbreaking course devised Kirklees and Wakefield Chamber of Commerce and funded by Barnsley and Doncaster Training and Enterprise Council. One of the graduates, Ms Sue Lawson, 37, lost her factory job because of illness and did not realise that during more than a year unemployed and at home she was gaining skills that could count towards a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level ll in business administration - equivalent to about four GCSEs. Ms Lawson saw the scheme advertised in her local paper. She said: 'I could never have imagined myself working in an office. I have got a job as a receptionist now and it is an absolutely wonderful experience.' She was able to use her experience of home budgeting, preparing letters to tradesmen, receiving visitors and making and receiving phone calls as evidence of skills learned outside the workplace that each woman was required to compile. Other women could call upon experience of voluntary work. One farmer's wife managed the farm accounts, while a publican's sister ran the pub when her brother took holidays and another woman helped out at her local Citizen's Advice Bureau. The course also involved computing skills, self-awareness and decision-making. The organisers say the project breaks the vicious circle of 'no job-no qualifications, no qualifications-no job', which affects women returning to work.</p>

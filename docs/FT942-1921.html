			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Level of grants deter Design Council bidders Government plans to sell the Design Council's industrial services have run into trouble because private-sector bidders want 'unacceptably' high government grants. The Design Council, the government-funded body which provides design services to industry, is in the throes of a reorganisation which will leave it with just a quarter of its staff of about 200, and a greatly reduced budget. The government's intention is to transfer many existing services to a regional network of one-stop business service centres, called Business Links, and for other services to be sold to the private sector. The industrial services include the Materials Information Service, which maintains a database of materials and their applications; an 'Innovation Noticeboard', which helps inventors get their ideas produced and marketed; and a design-consultancy register, which provides businesses with the names of approved consultants. Both the government and the Design Council's management had hoped that the industrial services could be kept together. A shortlist of four bidders put forward plans for purchases of the package, on the understanding that some Department of Trade and Industry funds would be made available through Business Links. It now appears that there will either be very limited DTI cash, or none. Design Council staff were told yesterday that attempts were to be made to sell the individual services and fresh bids were being invited from the private sector on that basis. The staff, through their union MSF, had been campaigning to keep the services together. There are fears that fragmentation will mean that individual schemes which do not find private-sector purchasers will be scrapped. There is concern among staff that the Business Links network, which has been slower to get off the ground than the government envisaged, has yet to prove its interest or commitment to design.</p>

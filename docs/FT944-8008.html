			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beating the system Sir, Emma Tucker's article (Perspectives: 'Welcome to Soviet Belgium', November 12) about Soviet Belgium's burrocracia (as the Brazilians write it) in the strongest way indicates the need for the so-called developed countries to adopt the Brazilian despachante (expeditor) system. Despachante is the full-time professional interface who, for a modest fee, makes all direct contact between an expat or a native and officialdom (customs, police, tax men, including the paying of fines and buying of 'presents') unnecessary. The only thing he cannot do is provide his customer's fingerprints. All this without a treaty against bureaucracy - written by whom? The bureaucrats?

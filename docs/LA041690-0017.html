			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Perhaps the only acceptable way to solve our health insurance crisis is by  adopting a two-tier system. One form of insurance covers cost for basic health  care, another a more comprehensive one.  </P> <P> In the basic coverage, heroic measures such as neonatal care and organ  transplantation will be totally excluded or only 50% covered.  </P> <P> Today there is no great incentive for either the patients or the physicians to  conserve our medical resources. I know of a case wherein an 84-year-old woman's  relatives insisted on a coronary bypass procedure after having been advised  that there was a zero chance for recovery. Unfortunately, were the physician to  refuse to perform the procedure, he would face a lawsuit as certainly as the  sun rises from the east.  </P> <P> Thus, major legal reform will also be necessary to reduce both the direct and  indirect cost on medical care. Under the Canadian system, a common procedure  such as coronary bypass often requires months of waiting. I doubt that this is  acceptable to most Americans.  </P> <P> JOHN T.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The State Council,  China's cabinet, has decided to try out the shareholding system  in 100 major state-owned enterprises this year, according to a  senior government official.    He Guanghui, vice-minister of the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, said that governments of various  province-level areas have also decided to choose a number of  local enterprises this year to try out the joint-stock system in  an effort to invigorate them.    Experimentation with the shareholding system is part of the  Chinese Government's effort to institute a modern enterprise  system, he said.    China will continue to try out the shareholding system this  year, but will not introduce the system on a large scale, he  said.    He said: "The shareholding reform is still in the  experimental stage because China lacks experience in this  respect."    Furthermore, as China has a large number of state-owned  enterprises, it is both impossible and unnecessary to turn all  of them into joint-stock companies, he said.    The vice-minister described the shareholding system as an  "important form" for the introduction of the modern enterprise  system, adding that joint-stock companies serve as a major  channel for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned  assets.    With progress in instituting a modern enterprise system,  there will be more and more shareholding companies in China,  mostly limited-liability ones and limited-liability joint-stock  ones, he added.    "I think there should be a small number of listed companies  in China, as in developed Western countries," he said.    The Chinese Government will continue to control the number  of  businesses issuing shares to the public, and listed companies.    When companies issue stocks in China or in other countries,  priority will be given to major state-run enterprises involved  in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw materials  industries, he said.    "Meanwhile, we shall continue to restrict the number of  financial institutions and real estate agencies issuing stocks,  and we do not encourage large numbers of commercial businesses  to issue shares to the public," he said.    Government statistics show that shares issued by listed  companies were worth five billion yuan in 1993, and the value of  shares to be issued this year is projected to rise moderately.    The vice-minister said that the Chinese Government will  encourage more enterprises, including large state-owned  companies, to issue stocks in Hong Kong and the United States  and to be listed there, he said.    Last year, six shareholding companies, including the Qingdao  Brewery in Qingdao, Shandong Province, and the Shanghai  Petrochemical Corporation, issued shares in other countries.    Since China began to try out the shareholding system in  1984,  the number of joint-stock companies has risen to 11,560, with  shares totalling 314.7 billion yuan in value.    Of these, 3,261 are limited-liability shareholding  companies,  with total shares valued at 259 billion yuan; and 8,299 are  limited- liability companies, with shares totaling 55.6 billion  yuan.    Of these, 63 percent are collectively-owned enterprises and  22 percent state-owned companies.    According to He Guanghui, shareholding companies are ahead  of  other enterprises in transforming the enterprises' operational  mechanism.    He said that the joint-stock system has enabled companies to  operate independently and assume full responsibility for their  profits and losses.    Under the shareholding system, companies have introduced a  new labor system and performance-based wage system, and have  improved their economic returns markedly, he added.    To facilitate the introduction of the shareholding system,  it  is necessary for government departments to change their  functions, improve the country's securities market structure and  reflect the state industrial policies, he said.</p>

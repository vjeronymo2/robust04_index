			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TOXIC SPILL CLOSES STREETS IN IRVINE  </P> <P> Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell off a chemical  truck in Irvine this morning, forcing authorities to close off the intersection  at Von Karmen and McGaw avenues and evacuate two businesses, authorities said.  </P> <P> Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by  discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, about  9:45 a.m. The drums fell off a truck from Cypress Chemical Co., based in  Anaheim, Cha said.  </P> <P> Two hazardous materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene  to identify the chemicals and stop the spill in the largely industrial and  commercial area.  </P> <P> Cha said that "because it is open air and because there are no winds," the  situation appeared to be under control. The ether-based substance is moderately  combustible and causes skin irritation, Cha said.  </P> <P> Fire officials also advised area businesses to shut off air-conditioning units  to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were reported.  </P></p>

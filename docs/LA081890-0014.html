			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORCES BEHIND IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> The commentary by Asencio and Torres reveals the hidden agenda behind the  free-trade talks with Mexico.  </P> <P> The authors confessed it is their "hope that fostering (economic) growth in  migrant-sending countries (like Mexico) would eliminate the need to enforce our  immigration laws."  </P> <P> This call for open borders has been a frequent cry from voices on both sides of  the border. For example, Mexico wants more than just free trade. President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari has indicated he wants to see the "free movement of  labor" as a part of any trade agreement.  </P> <P> Likewise, many politicos in this country are also hoping to get more than a  free trade agreement with Mexico.  </P> <P> The trade talks with Mexico involve more than meets the eye. Many want an  open-border agreement, and some even want to achieve a political harmonization  with Mexico. American citizens should beware.  </P> <P> ERICH PRATT  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> United States Border Control  </P> <P> Springfield, Va.  </P></p>

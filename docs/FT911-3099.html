			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: UK banks The absence of rights issues in the bank sector has helped the market to value the clearers as a simple bet on interest rates and economic recovery, similar to the construction and property sectors. The prospect of flat earnings this year has largely been ignored on the assumption that 1992 should see a gratifying bounce. As fresh evidence has suggested that the recession may be deeper and longer than was thought only weeks ago, the banks have begun to suffer. The UK bad debt provisions which dragged down profits last year could turn out to be annoyingly persistent. The sector has underperformed the market by some 4 per cent since its peak in March. Since the start of the year, Midland and NatWest, seen as the most heavily geared to recovery, have slipped back to only modest outperformance. Lloyds has done worse again, while Barclays, financially the strongest of the clearers, has outperformed the market by 10 per cent in the year. Abbey National, alone in having no corporate exposure, has returned to the top of brokers' buy lists. All of which highlights the importance of the interim reporting season in June. If the banks make further large UK provisions, the implication is that far from being flat, 1991 could actually turn out worse than last year. Putting a price on 1992 will be harder than ever.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Infant restraints are designed to meet infants' particular physical needs. An infant cannot be seated in a completely upright position since its neck muscles are not strong enough to enable the infant to hold its head upright. An infant restraint must be designed, therefore, so that it supports the infant's spine and head in a partially inclined position. At the same time, an infant must be positioned sufficiently upright and rear-facing so that in a crash, the forces are spread evenly across the infant's back and shoulders, the strongest part of an infant's body. Further, an infant restraint positions the back of the child's head against the restraint's seating surface in a crash. This helps to prevent severe neck injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Century's Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Century submitted its petition because it wishes to produce an infant restraint that, under normal driving conditions, would allow the infant to lie on its back in a more reclined position than is possible in current infant restraints, with the infant's head nearest the front of the vehicle and its feet nearest the rear of the vehicle. To provide proper protection in a frontal crash, a portion of the infant seat, including the surface on which the infant is resting, would change position by rotating upwards and toward the front of the vehicle so that the child would be rear-facing and almost upright. As a result, the crash forces would be applied to and spread across the infant's neck and shoulders. In the almost upright mode, the restraint would provide occupant protection similar to that provided by infant seats lacking the capability of dynamic readjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner described three ways in which safety could be improved if infant seats were allowed to change adjustment positions in a crash. First, the petitioner believes designing an infant seat so that it changes adjustment positions during a frontal crash could reduce the crash forces imposed on the child. The movement due to the change in position could help dissipate the stored kinetic energy during the initial stage of a frontal crash (i.e., when the momentum of the child and rear-facing seat are causing them to attempt to move toward the front of the vehicle).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second improvement in safety relates to what Century stated was the primary advantage of the new seat. The petitioner believed the seat would enable a child to travel in a more reclined position than is possible with current infant seats. The petitioner said that this would benefit premature, apnea-prone infants, and infants with other breathing problems. Included in Century's petition was the petitioner's public service message on ``positional apnea.'' It explains the problems that infants with positional apnea have when riding in current infant restraints:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Positional Apnea is a breathing difficulty that could occur when very small infants are positioned in an upright angle in infant products such as car seats, car beds, strollers, carriers, swings, etc. Because of their tiny bodies and weak necks, small infants are in danger of Positional Apnea. If the angle of the child in the infant product is too steep, the infant's head may fall forward far enough to choke off his/her air supply. Depending on the positioning of the child in an infant product, the risk to the child may be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To explain its reasons for believing a change to S5.1.1(b) would help children with apnea, Century submitted articles and statements from members of the medical community on positional apnea. These materials are fully discussed in the NPRM. They include a July 1990 policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics on the safe transportation of premature infants, which states that some infants, particularly premature, low-weight infants, may be subject to oxygen desaturation when placed in an upright position in infant restraints. Century argued that the articles indicate a need for new infant restraint designs that are specially designed, such as the infant seat the petitioner wishes to produce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third advantage of the seat relates to improved positioning of all infants in infant restraints. Infant restraints are tested by NHTSA for compliance with FMVSS No. 213 on a ``standard seat assembly,'' which is an essentially horizontal vehicle seat cushion. The ``standard seat assembly'' is specified in S7.3 of the standard. If the vehicle seat cushions actually being installed in vehicles are not horizontal, but slant downward to the rear, as they do in some newer model cars, an infant restraint placed on that vehicle seat cushion would be tilted rearward. Thus, an infant riding in the infant restraint would likely sit more upright than if the infant restraint were placed on a horizontal vehicle seat cushion. A restraint's back support surface that is too upright might not be able to provide adequate support to the infant's head and neck. Century said that its new infant restraint would compensate for the effect that a slanting vehicle seat cushion may have on infant restraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

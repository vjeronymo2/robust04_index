			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Germany dismayed at Maastricht delay THE British government decision to postpone final ratification of the Maastricht treaty was greeted in Germany yesterday with alarm and dismay. Senior officials fear that it will cast a new shadow over next week's planned summit between Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister - just when Anglo-German relations had started to revive in the wake of sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'If the British are making their decision dependent on the second Danish referendum, it is totally wrong,' one official said yesterday. 'To make the future of Great Britain dependent on some emotional Danish voters is silly and irresponsible.' German dismay is clear for three reasons. In the first place, the British decision will make it more difficult to insist that there shall be no renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty to meet Denmark's objections. Second, it will actually relieve the pressure on Denmark to vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty when it finally comes to a second referendum next year, because it will no longer be the last EC member left to ratify. Third, it may stoke popular doubts within Germany about the treaty, and strengthen demands to abandon the idea of a single European currency to replace the D-Mark, or to have a referendum. Mr Kohl is absolutely determined to resist both moves, but they are a severe embarrassment. The German government put out a careful statement yesterday, expressing its 'regret' at the British decision to postpone ratification, because it would mean that the treaty would not come into effect on January 1, 1993, as intended. At the same time, Germany politely but coolly welcomed the restated British determination to implement ratification of the treaty during 1993. For its own part, 'the federal government remains determined, like other member states, to finalise its ratification process - as foreseen - by the end of this year', according to Mr Norbert Schafer, the deputy government spokesman. The first suggestion of doubt about that aim was voiced by Mr Gunter Verheugen, the Social Democrat chairman of the joint parliamentary committee set up to ratify the treaty. He said the British decision should start a full debate on whether the aim of European union remained realistic. 'We cannot simply carry on regardless,' he said yesterday. 'At least we should have some clarity over whether European union is still realistic. The British decision means that Britain is dependent on finding a solution for Denmark, and there is no solution in sight.' The delay should be used to canvass for wider popular support for the treaty, he said, bearing in mind German opinion polls showing a growing minority casting doubt on the ambition of European union. Nevertheless, Mr Verheugen said he expected the German Bundestag to stick by its ratification timetable, and complete the process before the Edinburgh summit in December. Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was adamant that there must be no wavering on the part of Germany. 'If we start to show uncertainty, it would be a catastrophe,' he said. 'As for Britain hiding behind Denmark, it is simply not right. It is not worthy of your country. Britain should be giving Denmark the lead, not the other way round.'</p>

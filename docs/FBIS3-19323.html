Haumer: "OeMV: Great Prospects, High </F> Risks"]    [Text] Vienna -- Within the framework of international  consortia, the OeMV [Austrian Petroleum Corporation] currently  is examining two projects that might yield much but which are,  at the same time, fraught with high political risks. The  construction of a gas pipeline to Europe is being discussed with  Iran and Turkey.    In Libya, on the other hand, the issue is participation in  the gigantic Murzuk oil field, which contains more than 110  million tonnes, according to the OeMV. The technical journal  ARAB OIL &amp; GAS reports on estimates of up to 280 million  tonnes.    The Iranian gas pipeline project is supported by the rising  demand for natural gas in Europe. In the year 2000 West Europe  will face a deficit of 33 billion cubic meters, according to  today's (changeable) state of affairs.    The proposal that is being discussed involves an annual  supply capacity of 5 billion cubic meters. In addition to the  National Iranian Gas Corporation, the consortium also includes  Gaz de France, Ruhrgas, the Spanish Enagas, the Czech and Slovak  corporations, as well as the OeMV.    Iran currently produces about 110 million cubic meters per  day. Its own consumption in the 1993-94 business year will  probably be 38.9 billion cubic meters.    The economic and political framework presents a problem.  Tensions between Iran and Turkey have risen strongly over the  past months -- to such an extent that troops have been  transferred to the joint border.    The problems arise, on the one hand, because of the Central  Asian area (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan), where both countries want  to expand their influence. On the other hand, the conflicts of  the Turkish state with its Kurdish minority are far from being  settled.  <H5>  Libyan Hopes </H5>   In the Libyan Sahara the OeMV might expand its own oil  production considerably. As of 1997-98 7.5 to 8 million tonnes  of oil per year could be produced from the Murzuk field. The  Libyan National Oil Corporation [LNOC] is looking for  international partners and is holding discussions with a  consortium.    This consortium consists of the French company Total, which  is the leader of the consortium, holding 40 percent. The OeMV  and the Spanish Repsol Exploracion hold 30 percent each.  Experts of this industrial branch estimate the consortium's  capital need for the entire project at 6 billion schillings.    However, what benefits the investors at first glance also  makes their involvement more difficult. Libya cannot make any  great demands. The UN embargo is becoming tighter and tighter.    Airlines may no longer fly to the country. Some months ago a  ban on capital transfers to Libya by all companies with a Libyan  majority was added. Equipment for oil terminals and refineries  is also subject to the embargo.    As a final escalation of trade barriers, the United States  is  threatening an oil embargo. This would mean that foreign  (European) oil corporations could no longer sell the oil they  are producing in Libya. In contrast to the European  corporations, U.S. corporations have not been active in Libya  since they were thrown out in the 1980's and because of the  permanent conflicts between the United States and Libya.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / AGIP judgment set aside by court THE Isle of Man High Court yesterday set aside a judgment obtained by AGIP (Africa), the oil company, in the High Court in London in May 1989. The judgment, registered by AGIP in the Isle of Man in October 1989, was to recover Dollars 518,822 (Pounds 346,000) from Mr Barry Jackson and Mr Ian Griffin, two Manx accountants. Mr Jackson and Mr Griffin had petitioned on the island for the order to be set aside. In March 1992, AGIP assigned the judgment to Bowrings insurance company and Deemster John Corrin, the island's senior judge, yesterday ruled the judgment be set aside because the rights of the 1989 judgment were not now vested in AGIP. Bowrings' said it would apply to re-register the judgment in the island in its own name.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafael Candanedo] </F>   [Excerpts] Belem, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Cuba's readmission into  the OAS is no longer viewed as a taboo issue within the  organization, but its debate will be delayed and may be included  in the agenda of the OAS general assembly in 1995.    The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly -- the  main  forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which  will close on 10 June -- have addressed the possibility of  readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach,  although without much enthusiasm.    The 24th OAS General Assembly, which is hosted by the city  of  Belem, Para State, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim. It is in its final stage and is now being  attended by second level delegates because most of the  respective foreign ministers have already returned home.    Considering Cuba is the only Latin American country excluded  from the OAS, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the  Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be  included in the agenda of the OAS.    A senior Foreign Ministry official of one Andean country  rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and  yet Cuba continues to be excluded from the Inter-American  political system, which is regarded as universal and  pluralistic"? [passage omitted]    OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, whose 10-year  tenure  will conclude on 20 June when he will be replaced by Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, told reporters that a slight majority  of OAS member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue."    Brazilian President Itamar Franco immediately endorsed the  initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of Venezuela,  Costa Rica, Canada, and Bolivia, among others, followed suit.  [passage omitted]    Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo went as far as  to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate  among the United States, some Latin American countries, the  Havana Government, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to  promote the democratization of Cuba.    One South American diplomat said the situation is  complicated  because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the  radical stance of the United States, which does not conceal its  interest in having President Castro step down.    Three positions can be identified among Latin American  countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by  Argentina, El Salvador, and other Central American countries;  second, a current -- which includes the Caribbean Community  (Caricom) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with Cuba and  its readmission into the OAS; and third, a current that respects  Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the Group of Three  (Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela).    The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the Group  of Three, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the  opening toward the Catholic Church, the renovation of the  Communist Party of Cuba's cadres that has been implemented in  recent months by Fidel Castro, and the talks held in April by  Castro's government with opposition groups in exile.    Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization,  which could be jeopardized if Cuba remains isolated.    He added: "Perhaps Cuba should make more significant  gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than  to slam the door in someone's face."</p>

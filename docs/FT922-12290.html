			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Social Chapter will only handicap European companies Sir, Your leader of April 14 ('Mr Heseltine at industry) highlighted a number of reasons why CBI members welcome Mr Michael Heseltine's appointment. We have long argued for a more effective and re-focused Department of Trade and Industry. It is, clearly, not for me to speculate about Mr Heseltine's intentions. He is well placed and capable of speaking for himself. But I thought that I should draw attention to a fallacy in your leader which has important implications for Britain in Europe. You state that because Mr Heseltine believes (with the CBI) that every company should have effective communications with its workforce, it is 'difficult to see why Mr Heseltine would want to resist the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty'. The reason is plain, and is summed up in the word 'subsidiarity'. We believe that effective employee participation and communication comes from voluntary action by companies,and that the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty will only handicap European business in its bid to compete with the rest of the world - a view shared by our colleagues throughout Europe. As it happens, British business has made notable progress in improving communications and in securing the involvement and commitment of all employees over the past five years - as our recent publication, Europe After Maastricht, made plain. These efforts can only be set back by bureaucratic interference from Brussels. Brian Corby, president, Confederation of British Industry, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Big double-glazing company fails: MP demands rapid inquiry by official receiver 'to ensure there has been no malpractice' A DOUBLE-GLAZING com-pany started by founders of the collapsed Stormseal group has failed after less than 15 months. Northern Stock Plastics, which traded as Surestyle, was started with the assets of the Stormseal group. It has called in receivers, with a threat to about 500 jobs. Mr Mark Palios of Cork Gully, the receiver, said last night he hoped to have a preliminary estimate of Surestyle's debts today. Stormseal failed in January last year owing about Pounds 20m to unsecured creditors, including Pounds 500,000 to leading players in a snooker tournament it was sponsoring. Exact figures have not yet been calculated by Grant Thornton, Stormseal's receiver, and the inquiry has not yet been completed. More than 3,000 jobs were lost or affected. Stormseal and Surestyle were both founded by brothers Michael and Mark Sweeney, of Bury, Greater Manchester, where both businesses were based. The companies both used nationwide sales staffs paid on commission. High-pressure methods used by some of their salesmen had attracted criticism. The Sweeneys formed Surestyle as a 'phoenix' company after buying the Stormseal businesses from the receiver for Pounds 3m in February 1991. Mr Alastair Burt, Conservative MP for Bury North, last night called for a speedy inquiry by the official receiver 'to ensure there has been no malpractice'. He has written to Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, about the time taken to complete the Stormseal inquiry. As a minister - in the social security department - he is limited in what he can say in public on constituency-related matters. Concern is understood to be increasing at Westminster about 'phoenix' companies - failed companies restarted by people who ran them before their collapse. Limited liability enables directors to leave the trading debts of a failed company behind and start afresh in the same business. There is no suggestion that the Sweeneys have done anything improper - they had to compete to buy Stormseal's assets. Some MPs, though, are asking whether people involved in a business failure should first be cleared by the receiver in order to start a phoenix operation with the same assets. Mr Michael Sweeney yesterday blamed Surestyle's collapse on the recession and 'unwarranted' bad publicity. He said that in having a second go at the business he and his brother had been trying to save jobs. Earlier this year a Teesside lecturer called on police to remove two Surestyle salesmen who refused to leave his home without a sales order. Surestyle later sacked them.</p>

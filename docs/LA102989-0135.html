			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATURAL HISTORY SEEMS TO BE A NATURAL AT ALTADENA BOYS' HOME  </P> <P> Nine-year-old Bobby had never seen much wildlife and had never been to a  museum. With a mixture of curiosity and excitement, he regarded the life-sized  stuffed animals, touched the deer antlers and wrapped the fox fur around his  neck.  </P> <P> Last week, volunteers from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County  took their show on the road to reach about 40 kids like Bobby -- abused,  abandoned and emotionally disturbed boys who live and attend school at The  Sycamores in Altadena.  </P> <P> The official purpose of the museum volunteers' visit was to provide children  who are unable to visit museums an opportunity to learn about subjects like  mammals and dinosaurs. But for many of the boys, it was much more than that.  </P> <P> Getting the boys to participate was no problem. With each question asked, they  raised their arms eagerly, competing to answer first.  </P> <P> They patted coyote and grizzly bear furs and bison horns and howled when they  were asked to identify a picture of a wolf. One boy volunteered to place the  largest fur in the exhibit over his body and crawl about the floor, imitating a  black bear.  </P> <P> Museum volunteers not only answered questions from the boys, but also used a  story board to teach them about mammal wildlife and took them on an imaginary  journey through animal habitats.  </P> <P> "It looks like it's still real," Bobby said while touching a stuffed prairie  dog.  </P> <P> Bobby, wearing a yellow T-shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, then picked up a  coyote fur, wrapped it around his head, and said, "It's neat."  </P> <P> Bobby is one of 60 residents at The Sycamores. They range in age from 6 to 14  and are referred by the Los Angeles County Departments of Mental Health and  Children's Services, public schools and occasionally by area families.  </P> <P> Cecille Rasmussen, a volunteer docent for the museum, started off the 45-minute  class by asking her group of 8- to 11-year-old boys, "What is a mammal?"  </P> <P> A boy, wearing a cap, a Batman T-shirt and jeans, eagerly raised his hand and  answered, "Mammals are warm-blooded animals that reproduce."  </P> <P> At the same time, a group of older boys, aged 11 to 13, were learning about  dinosaurs in another room. They handled dinosaur models, snake skins, fossils,  plants and dinosaur teeth.  </P> <P> A 12-year-old boy from North Pasadena said he enjoyed the program because "it  was real educational." The youth touched furs and horns for the first time  during the presentation.  </P> <P> "You normally wouldn't get to touch the horns of buffaloes," he said. "It's sad  to see how they are all getting extinct."  </P> <P> The youth, who has lived at The Sycamores for more than a year, said he had  grown socially and academically at the home.  </P> <P> "I like reading and writing. I want to be a writer. I like to write rap  (songs)," he said.  </P> <P> Last week's program was the first time volunteers from the museum's Special  Educational Outreach Program visited the boys' home, said Michael Schaller,  principal and director of educational services.  </P> <P> Outside regular classroom activities, there have been speakers and other  educational programs provided for the boys, he said.  </P> <P> "We've gone out to the Huntington Library to have botany classes. We've had  people from the sheriff's and fire department come out, too," Schaller said.  </P> <P> The boys are encouraged not to limit themselves academically.  </P> <P> "Some of these boys will graduate from college," he said. "We try to show them  that they have to apply themselves to work hard. We want them to work up to  their potential. We try to make them feel like they have control over their own  lives."  </P> <P> The Sycamores was founded by a group of concerned women in 1902 as a home and  training school for neglected, homeless, orphaned and abandoned children. It  was called the Pasadena Children's Training Society until the institution moved  to Altadena in the 1960s, she said.  </P> <P> Today, three cottages house 14 boys each, and three group homes house six boys  each.  </P> <P> Although the education they get is important, the main benefit for boys at The  Sycamores is that they have a safe and stable home environment, said Rebecca  Chapman, director of development and public relations.  </P> <P> "They learn trust and problem-solving," Chapman said. "These kids get bounced  around enough as it is. Our goal is to keep them as long as we can do them some  good and then move them to better homes."  </P></p>

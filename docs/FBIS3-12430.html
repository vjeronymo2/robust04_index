This is reported by our correspondent  Ya'el Ayalon. The payment will be a one-time compensation to the  families of the dead and the wounded. During the first stage,  each family who lost one of its members will receive an advance  payment of 5,000 shekels. Ora Namir, labor and social welfare  minister, says this is a humanitarian step. National Insurance  Institute Chairman Yosi Tamir notes that this move is not  intended to set a precedent.</p>

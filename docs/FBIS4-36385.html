			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, June 6, SPA -- The Minister of Finance and  National Economy, Muhammad Aba-al-Khayl, who is also the  representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the IDB's  [Islamic Development Bank] board of governors, opened on Monday  [6 June] a symposium on the fringes of the 151st meeting of the  bank's executive managers.    Addressing the opening ceremony, Aba-al-Khayl, on behalf of  the Saudi Government, welcomed the participants and emphasized  the steadfast determination of the government of Custodian of  the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to support all  Islamic joint action projects.    "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is honoured by the  Almighty Allah to house the two holy harams, has been sparing no  effort to reinforce the Islamic solidarity, cooperation and  cohesion between all Moslems of the world with noble and welfare  initiatives which led to the creation of a number of Islamic  organizations," he said.    "Moreover, the role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not  merely confined to the establishment of the existing Islamic  organizations, but is also continuing to extend the unlimited  moral and material support to these organizations which are  located in the kingdom or elsewhere," Aba-al-Khayl said.    He affirmed that the kingdom will continue to extend  whatever  necessary support is required for the activities of the IDB  (Islamic Development Bank) which was set up to dedicate  cooperation between Islamic states.    The finance and national economy minister expressed deep  satisfaction over the excellent performance of the IDB as a  leading Islamic economic institution and expressed confidence  that the bank would realise aspirations of member states.    Aba-al-Khayl said the paid capital of the IDB has increased  to dlrs 8.4 billion from two billion dollars and the number of  its member states now totals 47 with the joining of a number of  Central Asian states.    He cited the necessity of maintaining the firm financial  performance of the IDB.    Addressing the gathering, Dr. Osama Faqih, president of the  IDB welcomed the participants and spotlighted the great  achievements accomplished by the IDB in the framework of the  noble objectives for which it was established.    Praising the distinguished financing policies being pursued  by the IDB, Faqih expressed delight that the bank had managed to  develop successful financing policies that suit the Islamic laws  in all banking dealings.    For this purpose, he said, the Islamic Institute for  Research  and Training was set up in 1993 to make adaptation of modern  financing techniques.    He said the bank is giving priority for financing  commodities  and products of Islamic origin and expressed confidence that the  bank will continue to develop its methods to extend services for  the entire Islamic world.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the data provided by the provincial  commodity administration bureau, Shandong has encountered  serious problems in importing Russian commodities. In 1993, the  provincial commodity administration bureau inspected 462 tonnes  of commodities worth over $82 million imported from Russia. Of  these commodities, 69 lots of them worth over $12 million were  appraised as substandard in the inspection. Of the Russian  commodities imports, particularly serious problems cropped up in  imported fertilizer, timber, steel products, and automobiles.  Major problems cropping up in the imported fertilizer and  timber were that of being short in weight and length measures as  well as substandard quality. General problems cropping up in  the imported automobiles from Russia were three leakages,  frequent mechanical failures, and unsuitable-size engines for  the cars. The provincial commodity administration bureau is  adopting effective measures to strictly guarantee the quality of  Russian commodities imports to safeguard the vital interests of  the country and enterprises.</p>

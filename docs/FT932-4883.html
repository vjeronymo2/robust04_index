			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Right to use Intel chips lost by AMD A CALIFORNIA appeals court has dealt a serious blow to Advanced Micro Devices by overturning an arbitrator's decision that gave the semiconductor manufacturer the right to use Intel microprocessor technology. The ruling stems from a bitter six-year legal battle between the two Silicon Valley chip makers. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, dominates the world market for microprocessors used in personal computers. AMD, once an Intel partner, now competes with Intel by selling its own versions of Intel's chips. The court decision places a legal cloud over AMD's most profitable and promising products: its version of the Intel 386 microprocessor and its recently introduced 486 microprocessor. AMD claims the right to Intel's technology under prior agreements between the two companies. Last year, after almost five years of hearings, an arbitrator ruled that Intel had breached its technology-sharing agreements with AMD and awarded AMD the right to use Intel 386 technology. In a decision released late on Friday, however, the appeals court ruled that the arbitrator had 'exceeded his powers' in awarding technology rights to AMD. AMD said it would immediately ask the appeals court to reconsider its decision and, if necessary, would take the matter to the California Supreme Court. 'This reversal will not deter AMD from continuing to compete in the 386 microprocessor market,' said Mr Jerry Sanders, chairman and chief executive officer of AMD. 'Despite this setback, competition will continue and we will support our customers.' Intel will now seek damages of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from AMD. Last month, in another related Intel-AMD dispute, a jury's verdict that AMD does not hold a licence to use Intel microcode was set aside by the judge because Intel withheld evidence. Thus, although Intel has won an important ruling from the California appeals court, it still faces significant challenges to its intellectual property rights. The legal battles between Intel and AMD appear likely to drag on, perhaps for several more years and almost certainly beyond the lifetime of the products currently at issue.</p>

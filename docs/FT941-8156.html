			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Small price to pay for prime seat: George Soros and John Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre The announcement that Mr John Ritblat's British Land has bought a stake in Stanhope, a struggling developer, has turned the spotlight on Broadgate, the City of London complex which is Stanhope's main asset. For a small outlay, Mr Ritblat has won a seat at the negotiating table, from which he intends to gain control of Stanhope's Broadgate assets. The deal was greeted by analysts as a potentially important deal for British Land. 'It looks as though John Ritblat is making sure that he either gets Broadgate through the corporate route, or that he has a ringside seat whenever it goes up for sale,' said Mr Chris Turner, director of research at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. 'This is potentially another big hit by British Land,' says Mr Robert Fowlds of Kleinwort Benson. 'Mr Ritblat is paying a small amount for potentially a slice of a Pounds 1bn property.' It is not yet clear whether Stanhope will play according to Mr Ritblat's plans, although its alternatives appear limited. Stanhope also appeared to query the validity of the stake acquisition by drawing attention to the pre-emption rights belonging to Mr Stuart Lipton, Stanhope's chief executive, by which he would have first refusal on the shares that originally belonged to Olympia &amp; York. If British Land succeeds in achieving its goal, the prize could be a substantial one. Stanhope owns a half share of Broadgate Properties, which owns six buildings in the Broadgate Development, as well as the 600,000 sq ft Ludgate Development on the western edge of the City of London. It also has pre-emption rights over the other half, which is controlled by the receivers of Rosehaugh. Broadgate was one of the largest developments to be built in the 1980s. At a ceremony during the building work in July 1986, Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, described it as the largest development in the City since the Great Fire of London in 1666. The Pounds 2bn development was successful in attracting the financial services industry as it expanded in the aftermath of 1986's Big Bang. Its large buildings, constructed to accommodate the computer cabling and air-conditioning needed by large trading floors, succeeded in persuading a workforce of some 20,000 to move to hitherto unfamiliar territory north-east of the City. Broadgate and Ludgate have been affected by falls in the London office market, where values have fallen by two-thirds from the peak of the market three years ago. Half of Broadgate has been sold, and the two are now worth about Pounds 1bn. Broadgate was a remarkably ambitious scheme for two small companies. Carried out in partnership with the British Rail Property Board, it was conceived in 1983 by Mr Lipton and Mr Godfrey Bradman, both property entrepreneurs. The key for such relatively insubstantial companies to build such a large development lay in the use of non-recourse loans - commonplace in the US but new to the UK. These allowed the borrower to confine the security of the loan to specific assets, rather than the parent company. Despite Broadgate's success in attracting prestigious tenants, it was not enough to cushion its developers from the downturn which hit the industry in 1990. Rosehaugh was one of the first large property companies to signal the coming problems, when it announced a Pounds 125m rights issue in 1990. Its losses continued to mount and in December 1992 the company was put into receivership. Stanhope has struggled on, courtesy of its bankers. Its net assets fell from Pounds 458m in 1990 to a minus Pounds 15.8m in June 1993. Asset values have started to appreciate again, but the company has continued to suffer operating losses and its existence remains contingent on the approval of its bankers. Several months ago, it began work on a Pounds 160m restructuring plan, which involved raising new funds and merging with its associate Broadgate Properties. Analysts expected to see some results last month, but progress so far has been limited. British Land said yesterday that it intended to play a role in Stanhope's restructuring plans. Mr Ritblat said, however, that he was not interested in gaining control of Stanhope, or even in having board representation. 'Our objective is to ensure that Stanhope remains independent,' he said. 'We would not expect to play an active role in the company.' In his view, the solution to Stanhope's problems is to sell Broadgate and Ludgate - and in the process offload the large debt they carry. 'We want to stabilise Stanhope and provide some some seed capital. We know what we want to do,' he said.</p>

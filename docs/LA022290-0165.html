			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS WATCH WHILE CLARK WORKS ON PITCH  </P> <P> The hitter dug in, the crowd cheered merrily and the umpire leaned intently  over the plate. Poised for action, everyone awaited the magic phrase that would  set the game in motion. Another few seconds for the anticipation to build, and  here it was. It came as a shout.  </P> <P> "Action!"  </P> <P> So much for "Play ball!"  </P> <P> The umpire was an actor and the fans at the UC Irvine baseball field were  Hollywood extras, all players in a television commercial starring San Francisco  Giant first baseman Will Clark. To the eight Angels who had gone there  Wednesday to run and stretch and throw, the film crew's visit was a welcome  diversion from a routine that had become tiresome by the time the lockout  reached its seventh day.  </P> <P> Pitcher Chuck Finley, his workout done, sat with his back against the fence and  regarded Clark with a bemused expression. "Well," he said, "I'm glad somebody's  working."  </P> <P> Left to their own devices and consciences, the Angels worked hard enough to  break a sweat during their 90-minute session at the place that has become their  home away from home since the lockout put Anaheim Stadium off limits.  </P> <P> Finley and Jim Abbott paired off to loosen up with easy tosses that grew  progressively harder, breaking up the monotony with chatter about a pickup  basketball game Finley had played. Bert Blyleven, wearing a T-shirt imprinted  with the slogan "Play Ball," did exactly that with reliever Willie Fraser.  </P> <P> "Throw it where I can reach it," Blyleven scolded after Fraser hurled a pitch  high over Blyleven's head. Fraser wasn't the least bit remorseful. "Hey, the  fence will stop it," he said.  </P> <P> Mike Witt and Bryan Harvey wandered past the commercial set at home plate and  headed for the left-field bullpen, where Witt got in some throws off the mound.  Kirk McCaskill did some serious throwing in another enclosure on the first-base  side.  </P> <P> Only shortstop Dick Schofield, the lone nonpitcher at the workout, left before  his teammates had finished their regimens by running in the outfield. Schofield  says he has felt the effects of the lockout less than the pitchers because  although pitchers and catchers would normally have reported to spring training  a week ago, the earliest all other players were permitted to report was today.  </P> <P> "There's nothing to do here," Schofield said. "It hasn't gotten to me yet  because (Thursday) I'd just be leaving for spring training. The pitchers are  the ones it's bothering. But if it goes into March, it's going to hurt  everybody."  </P> <P> The workout was satisfying for Witt even if "there probably wasn't as much  intensity" as in a usual spring practice. "It's getting kind of boring," he  said. "You enjoy your time off, but there comes a time when you should be out  there using your skills."  </P> <P> Those skills might rust if the lockout drags on.  </P> <P> Fraser said he would continue to work out even if the negotiations recess, as  players union head Don Fehr said would be the case if an agreement weren't  reached today.  </P> <P> Abbott also will go on working out. "I have nothing else to do. I didn't plan  on being here, so I didn't make any other kinds of plans, and I'm getting  bored," he said. "You end up feeling like you've just wasted days at a time,  not doing too much."  </P> <P> Finley shares that sense of futility.  </P> <P> "I've been losing a lot of golf balls," he joked. "I don't even know what I've  been doing. . . . I've just got to stay in the same pattern, but it's hard to  get motivated to come out here and go through these workouts. I've got to force  myself to do it.  </P> <P> "I'll keep prying myself out of bed and coming here until somebody tells me  something else. But if it doesn't get settled this week, I'm going back to  Louisiana and going fishing."  </P></p>

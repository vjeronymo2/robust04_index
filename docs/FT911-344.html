			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Construction Contracts: Expansion of Strand law courts KYLE STEWART has been awarded a Pounds 10m contract by PSA Projects for the redevelopment of the east wing of the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand, London. Work is scheduled to commence shortly on the contract under the project management of PSA Projects which involves the stripping out of the northern half of the east wing, a Grade I listed building and the reconstruction of existing floors from basement to third floor and roof space, to create 14 courts and ancillary areas. Much of the existing fabric of the building will be retained. The chimneys, outer, main and cross walls will be fully braced following internal demolition. The listed roof trusses and major timbers will be stored prior to eventual reinstatement. The contract is scheduled for completion in May 1994.</p>

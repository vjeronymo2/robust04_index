			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Riga, Mar 28, BNS -- Latvia's parliament and  non-parliament right parties keep protesting the anticipated  troop withdrawal treaty between Latvia and Russia what they call  is legalizing of Soviet occupation of the Baltic country.  [passage omitted]    On March 26, several parties and public organizations  reiterated that, in their opinion, the agreement undermines  Latvia's security and sovereignty, and pressured President  Guntis Ulmanis not to sign the document.    The Saeima (parliament) should never ratify the agreement in  the present edition, they said.    The group includes the Latvian National Independence  Movement, the Tevzeme (Fatherland) National Association and the  Latvian Popular Front.    The National Independence Movement (LNNK) urged Ulmanis not  to confirm the draft because "the signature of these agreements  would mean Latvia's enclosure into the sphere of Russian  interests, endanger Latvian sovereignty and chances for the  national survival."    The initialed agreements contradict the CSCE and UN  declarations on the complete and unconditional withdrawal of  ex-Soviet troops, according to the statement. The accord on  Skrunda was, in fact, reached by the presidents of the United  States and Russia without consent of Latvian citizens.    "Accepting the initialed agreements, Latvia actually fails  to  resolve issues connected with troop withdrawal" while "armed  Russian servicemen may freely move in the Latvian territory,  thus, posing a threat to the Baltic security," said the document.    LNNK wants the Saeima (parliament) to first adopt a law on  the status of aliens and stateless persons, foreign policy  concept and an appeal to the United Nations on the occupation of  the Baltic states in 1940.    Letting occupation army officers stay here, Latvia  voluntarily gives up its earlier claim for the recognition of  its occupation. By doing so, Latvia also lifts the  responsibility for Soviet-era damages of Russia, the party said.    The Saeima should form a new negotiation team for talks with  Russia to tackle withdrawal issues, repatriation of former  Soviet colonists, return of the Abrene (now Pitalovo, Russia)  district to Latvia and compensation for occupation damages.    LNNK also wants to Saeima to accept its proposal for the  organization of nationwide referendum on the functioning of the  Skrunda radar after all Russian troops leave Latvia. The  attitude of Latvian citizens toward granting social guarantees  to retired Russian military persons would be another question at  the referendum.    If the Saeima rejects these demands, LNNK will propose  extraordinary Saeima elections.    Similar demands are included in a statement by Fatherland's  congress. Association member, MP Roberts Milbergs described the  document as "a document of despair" saying that the issue (of  the ratification of Latvian-Russian accord) is actually  determined.    Popular Front's board member Juris Kokins told BNS that, if  the international community recognized Latvia's occupation in  1940, Latvia could turn for help to international organizations.    Fatherland plans to stage a rally March 29 at the Cabinet  building to protest signature and ratification of the Latvian-  Russian agreements. The Cabinet is scheduled to look through  the initialed documents on the same day.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Phillips seeks extension of Ekofisk licence PHILLIPS PETROLEUM Norway is to seek an extension of its licence for the giant Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, hub of the world's largest petroleum transportation system, before committing itself to a plan calling for investment of Dollars 4bn to build new facilities. The Ekofisk licence, of which Phillips is the operator with a 36.96 per cent stake, is due to expire in the year 2011, but the plan envisages production until 2040. Phillips announced recently that it is considering a comprehensive plan to extend the economic life and enhance the value of the field by installing new facilities, to be called Ekofisk II, outside an area which is plagued by an annual rate of subsidence of 35 centimetres. Concerned over safety at Ekofisk, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, last October warned Phillips it would close the main processing and transportation facilities at the field's storage tank, through which 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production passes, by the winter of 1995-96. The NPD said ageing technical equipment combined with inadequate maintenance were the main causes of concern over Ekofisk and ordered Phillips to submit a plan by July to remedy the problems. Phillips believes Ekofisk still contains 1bn barrels of extractable reserves. Industry officials say Phillips aims to undertake the Ekofisk II project without having to seek outside financing, which would put a heavy burden on the cash-strapped company. That is also the reason that will be seeking substantial tax concessions for the project. 'The battle over Ekofisk II will not be fought over the technical solutions, but over redistribution of ownership of the field and the extension of the licence,' officials said. Phillips said it did not anticipate problems in securing financing for the project. A detailed commercial and definitive technical plan for Ekofisk II will be submitted to Norwegian authorities by the end of the year, for which the company hopes to gain approval by parliament during spring 1994 to meet a planned target of 1998 for start-up. Phillips is also expected to deploy the most advanced technology available for Ekofisk II in which remotely-operated, unmanned platforms may be built in order to eliminate as many as possible of the 2,000 offshore jobs at the field, and thus reduce costs significantly.</p>

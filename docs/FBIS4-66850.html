The exercise drills to garner  Muslim votes are increasing in the Congress Party now. This time  around, they are trying to incarnate Ghulam Nabi Azad as the  messiah of the Muslims. It is possible that Mr. Azad will be  credited with the success in loosening the rules. This game will  be played because the Muslims are upset. They will consider  anyone who helps them rid of it their supporter.    In this exercise to bring Mr. Azad to the front, many  veteran  Muslim leaders have been pushed back. Salman Khursheed, Aslam  Sher Khan, Tariq Anwar, P.M. Sayyed, C.K. Jaffer Sharif, Ahmed  Patel, Ammar Rizwi, Sibt-e Razi, and Asad Madni will have the  role of Mr. Azad's associates. Meetings and conferences have  been started to promote Azad's new image. He is being cheered in  these meetings and conferences according to a strategy.    The Congress (I), which was pushed away from the Muslims  after the Babri Masjid incident, is eager to get back its old  vote bank. The efforts are to develop one of its leaders as a  Muslim sympathizer, so that his name can be used to attract  votes during the next election. This leader will have to tell  the Muslims at the time of the election what he had done for  them. The hint will be that Mr. Azad and Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao had formed a similar policy. Mr. Azad is following  the prime minister's instructions. He has also started various  meetings. After understanding this whole game, other ministers  like C.K. Jaffar and P.M. Sayyed have also become very active on  this front.    However, Ghulam Nabi Azad is in the forefront of this race  to  become the leader of Muslims. He has already sponsored two major  conferences on Muslim problems. His major achievement was  holding the conference of Urdu editors. The Urdu editors were  greatly opposed to the Congress until recently. It is hoped that  after this conference, they will be softened towards the  Congress Party. These programs are organized in a way that the  people do not suspect involvement of the Congress Party.  Therefore, new faces are being pulled in for the success of  these programs. Even the meeting organizers are not made aware  of the plan to develop leaders. In order to keep the reality  hidden from the people, leaders of other parties are also  included in the program. This was especially kept in mind when  holding meetings of Urdu editors and of the so-called ulemas  (Muslim scholars). Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam  Singh, was invited to the Urdu editors conference. E. Ahmed,  secretary of the Muslim League, and Abdul Samad Siddiqui, a  Janata Dal leader, were invited to the ulemas conference. Mr.  Azad announced in the conference that he wanted to have everyone  with him and this conference did not have any thing to do with  the Congress government. In the ulema conference, Mr. Azad was  trying to prove himself to be more popular than non-Congress  leaders. He called the non-Congress leaders to him for talks and  had himself recorded on videos for this purpose.    Efforts were made to raise the burning issues related to  Muslims in these conferences. In both conferences, Mr. Azad  raised issues showing he was not happy with the central  government's policies. Mr. Azad went as far as to say that he  did not care for his cabinet position when it came to resolving  the problems faced by the Muslims. Taking the courage to say  this clearly shows that his Congress bosses had given him the  green flag to do so.    It has been decided to bring the Muslim into the Congress  fold for the elections. This can happen only when the problems  faced by the Muslims are alleviated. The Congress is aware now  that it must do something to reduce the problems faced by the  Muslims before it asks for their votes, so that the Congress  leaders can declare that the Congress had helped the Musims.  Then Muslims will have to do a favor in return for this favor.    Jaffar Sharif is not as successful in establishing himself  as  the leader of Muslims as is Ghulam Nabi Azad. Both of them spoke  in the Urdu editors conference. Mr. Azad used sycophancy and  emotions to deceive the Muslims. Mr. Sharif had to say in the  end that he did not want to talk like Mr. Azad and lose sight of  his goal. He spoke very emotionally. It was too much in the  ulemas style. The whole Congress drama was fully rehearsed. The  plan was to declare Mr. Azad the leader of all Muslims in the  country. No one got wind of it before this. The information  about this conference was privy to only a few people.  Salamatullah had gathered people from here and there for this.  The journalists were not informed about this conference.    One major reason for not informing eminent leaders in the  capital was to avoid their opposition to this plan. Mr. Azad has  neither any importance among the Muslims nor is he called  dishonest or deceptive like other leaders. In addition, the  ulemas who were going to make this announcement were not well  known. Salamatullah is known as a cemetery salesman and  government broker. Still, these two leaders were declared the  leaders of the whole Muslim community in the nation in the  presence of a few bearded people.    Another conference in this series was held to discuss  education on 28 April. Mr. Azad was the guest of honor.  Parliament Member Sunil Dutt was also invited, however, he did  not attend. However, A.M. Khusro, chancellor of Aligarh  University, M.N. Farookhi, vice chancellor, and several other  professors and intellectuals expressed their opinions. This  conference was also organized by Salamatullah.</p>

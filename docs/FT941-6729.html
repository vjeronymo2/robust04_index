			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Fight to rescue EU enlargement talks Strenuous high-level efforts were being made early this morning to rescue talks aimed at getting Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the European Union by next year. Negotiators 'stopped the clock' and pressed on beyond the midnight deadline for concluding the talks, amid clear signs that Austria and Norway were unable to agree entry terms. Mired in detail, the two sides were set to continue through the early hours into today, and one EU neg-otiator warned: 'This is starting to go backwards.' The EU member states were faced with either settling early entry terms for Sweden and Finland, or adjourning the negotiations for a few days before reconvening - possibly even at a summit of heads of government. Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, joined the negotiations yesterday with a plea from Chancellor Helmut Kohl for flexibility on both sides to get all four applicants into the Union. Enlargement, he said, was much more important than arguing over a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian fish, one of the main sticking points in the talks. Oslo is resisting Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fishing waters, as well as French-inspired attempts to restrict access for Norwegian fish to the EU single market for four years. In addition, disputes over agriculture subsidies, the newcomers' contributions to the EU budget, and transit rights for EU lorries through the Austrian Alps, have still to be settled. Germany, the EU's main paymaster, also warned that enlargement was part of the 1992 Edinburgh summit deal, which agreed the 1994-99 EU budget resources, including a doubling of aid to poorer countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. EU diplomats disclosed that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, has written to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to spell out Madrid's bottom line. Though Spain still insists Norway cannot be allowed a better deal on fish than the limited agreement Spain and Portugal got when they joined in 1986, Mr Gonzalez made clear he will not countenance significant change to the EU's weighted majority voting rules to accommodate the newcomers. Spain and the UK want to keep existing voting rules to preserve their ability to block EU measures. Currently, 23 votes out of 76 - normally meaning two large and one small member states - can stop legislation in the Council of Ministers. If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes. A majority of the 12 want to maintain the carefully nurtured existing balance between big and small EU club members by requiring 27 votes to block proposals. This issue alone may need to be resolved by a summit, some EU diplomats predicted.</p>

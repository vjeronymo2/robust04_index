			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The municipal party committee and government  held a rural work conference on the morning of 12 April to relay  the guidelines of the central rural work conference and to  arrange Tianjin's agriculture and rural work. They called for  efforts to thoroughly study and implement the guidelines of the  central rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's  reality in agriculture and rural work, further unify thinking,  enhance understanding, conscientiously strengthen party  leadership over agriculture and rural work, and strive to  fulfill the basic tasks of agriculture and rural work.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and  Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee  and mayor of Tianjin, gave important speeches. Li Jianguo,  deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, attended. Li  Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and  executive vice mayor of Tianjin, presided over the conference.  Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's congress standing  committee; and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the municipal committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference;  attended.    Also attending were municipal leading comrades Yang Zhihua,  Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng  Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Pan Yiqing, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang  Gonghui, Li Changxing, and Huang Yanzhi.    Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin has attached  importance to and scored notable achievements in agriculture and  rural work for many years. Central leading comrades have  affirmed on many occasions its bumper grain harvests for 10  years in a row and, in particular, its good job in carrying out  the "vegetable basket" project. The good development trend in  rural economy, the increase in peasants' income every year, and  the stable rural situation have constituted an important  contribution to Tianjin's economic development. However, we  should also note that the economic development rate, the level  and economic efficiency of agricultural productive forces, and  the increase in peasants' income are not high enough. By  conscientiously studying and implementing the guidelines of the  central rural work conference, we should enhance our  understanding of the importance to strengthen agriculture and  rural work in the new situation. The current priorities are as  follows: First, we should enhance the understanding of the  position of agriculture as the foundation. Although Tianjin is a  large industrial and commercial city developing the  suburban-type rural economy, it should firmly embrace the idea  of taking agriculture as the foundation. The rural economy is  an important growing point of the economy of the entire  municipality and an important force to realize sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development. The healthy development of  agriculture and rural economy is the foundation not only for the  national economy but also for reform, development, and  stability. Second, we should enhance the understanding of the  importance of successful production of grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops. In the new situation in establishing the  socialist market economy system, we should understand the  extremely important production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  crops from a strategic and political perspective and, proceeding  from reality, strive to improve the self-sufficiency rate of  grain and gain the initiative in the overall planning for the  economic work of the entire municipality. Third, we should  further enhance the understanding of the importance of a  successful "vegetable basket" project. In Tianjin's suburban-  type agriculture, the key link is the production and supplies  for the "vegetable basket." We should pay close attention to it  under all circumstances and make it still better. Fourth, we  should further enhance the understanding of the importance to  restructure agriculture on the premise that the production of  grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is stabilized. The  production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is the  prerequisite for restructuring agriculture and restructuring  rural production. We should pay particular attention to  comprehensive agricultural development and transformation of  low- and medium-yielding farmland, through which to improve the  basic conditions for agricultural production, so that there will  be more room for agricultural production. Fifth, we should  further enhance the understanding of the importance to rely on  agricultural development to increase peasants' income. By  improving the production level of farming and livestock breeding  and operating on as large a scale as possible, we should raise  the output rate of land and fund input and continuously increase  peasants' income. [passage omitted]    Gao Dezhan emphasized: The major policies, targets, tasks,  and policy measures for Tianjin's agriculture and rural work  have been clarified. The key to the next step of work is to  further strengthen party leadership over agriculture and rural  work, pay close attention to implementation, and, through  fruitful work, achieve real results in meeting the requirements  of the central authorities and the municipal party committee for  greatly strengthening agriculture and rural work. We should  make sure that our understanding and work are in place; the  system of responsibility for work targets is conscientiously  carried out; leadership force is further replenished; functions  are transformed and work styles improved; and all trades and  professions render great support to agriculture.    Zhang Lichang spoke on specific opinions on current  agricultural production and relevant issues. He pointed out:  Stabilizing and developing grain and cotton production is a  major issue concerning urban and rural economic development and  social stability. The current serious drought has resulted in  reduction of the areas sown to grain and cotton, and the prices  of the means of agricultural production have increased. All  districts, counties, and relevant departments should  conscientiously study this issue and exert great efforts to make  this year's grain and cotton production successful. We should  adopt every possible means to stabilize the areas sown to grain  and cotton. We should strive to increase the areas sown to  grain, raise the multiple crop index, and plant the areas that  can be planted in spring. We should make great efforts to  increase per- unit yields, continue the grain increase  demonstration project and the dissemination of the 500,000-mu  paddy rice high-yielding cultivation technology this year, and  achieve success in the cultivation and supplied of fine seeds.  We should institute the system whereby district and county  heads are responsible for management of targets. All districts  and counties should assign grain and cotton production tasks to  townships, villages, and households and hold the responsibility  for them. On the premise that their total grain supply and  demand are kept basically in balance, they should develop and  utilize land resources to develop good-quality, high-yield, and  high-efficient cash crops and ensure rural self-sufficiency in  grain supplies. All-out efforts should be made to combat  drought to ensure wheat fields and spring sowing. All cadres of  agricultural departments should overcome difficulties,  concentrate efforts on this work, and make it successful. All  trades and professions in Tianjin should actively support the  antidrought work to ensure wheat production and support spring  farming. We should deepen the reform of the grain purchasing  and marketing system and establish the grain reserve system and  risk fund. In addition to the portion to be consumed by  peasants themselves, some of the grain produced in Tianjin  should be supplied to its urban areas. Departments concerned  should purchase this part of grain on a priority basis in line  with state's regulations and policies, and they are not allowed  to increase or lower the purchasing price at will. Grain  departments should coordinate well with major grain producing  areas, sign contracts with them, and ensure fulfillment of the  contracts. They should play the major role in the supplies of  grain. In line with state requirements and the actual demand of  Tianjin, grain departments, in addition to ensuring normal grain  supplies, should stabilize grain stock while ensuring a certain  amount of circulating grain. Meanwhile, they should increase  the reserve of edible oil to a proper extent through various  channels. [passage omitted]</p>

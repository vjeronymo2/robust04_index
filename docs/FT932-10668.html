			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Smurfit falls to IPounds 95.5m as weak prices take toll JEFFERSON SMURFIT, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday announced a sharp fall in profits due to recession and weak prices in several of its main markets. Pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 157.5m to IPounds 95.5m (Pounds 93.8m) in the year to January 31 on turnover up 3 per cent at IPounds 1.26bn. At the interim stage, profits fell 20 per cent to IPounds 60m. Mr Ray Curran, chief financial officer, said the results showed 'a very solid performance. We're looking forward to an upturn in the cycle'. Trading profits dropped to IPounds 102.9m (IPounds 133.2m). Net interest receivable increased to IPounds 16.2m (IPounds 15.3m), while net cash fell to IPounds 149.5m (IPounds 238.8m). Operating profits in Latin America increased 3 per cent to IPounds 63.2m. The region increased its share of overall profits from 43 per cent to 59 per cent, as European profits fell and North America turned from a profit to a loss. Ireland maintained operating profits at IPounds 19.4m, although profits in the UK fell sharply from IPounds 13.6m to IPounds 4.71m. However, orders have since improved and the company achieved a small price increase at the year end. JSC/CCA, the US associate which was set up through a leveraged buy-out in 1989, suffered from falling prices despite higher sales. JSC, which also released first quarter results yesterday, reported a net loss up from Dollars 19.9m to Dollars 32m (Pounds 20.7m). Exceptional charges of IPounds 28.4m covered the cost of closing down some European mills. There was also an extraordinary charge of IPounds 19.3m to cover refinancing costs for JSC/CCA. Some of these costs were incurred after the year end, but have been included in last year's results. Earnings fell from 24.4p to 11.8p per share. A proposed final dividend of 2.5094p makes a total of 3.74p, an increase of 5.7 per cent. See Lex</p>

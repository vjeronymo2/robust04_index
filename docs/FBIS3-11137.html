Early this morning, Robaina  held a meeting with his counterpart, Dinesh Singh, during which  the two diplomats reviewed the historically friendly relations  between Cuba and India. During this encounter, Dinesh Singh  expressed his admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to  resist the economic difficulties they are facing. He went on to  say that India will continue supporting Cuba in international  forums.    Roberto Robaina said: Even though the two nations have  always  maintained close ties, we should take advantage of this occasion  to take practical steps to search for common interests that  could deepen trade relations.    The diplomats agreed to meet again in June, during the  summit  of nonaligned countries to be held in Cairo to discuss the main  problems of developing nations. Both diplomats expressed  themselves in favor of strengthening the work of the Nonaligned  Movement.    Just hours prior to his meeting with his counterpart,  Robaina  placed a floral wreath at the Indira Gandhi memorial here in the  capital. He also visited the Red Fort, the most important  monument in New Delhi, which gives a complete vision of Muslim  scholars' way of life.    Today's most important event was a meeting that Roberto  Robaina held, just minutes ago, with 60 businessmen at the  Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where the Cuban foreign  minister gave a comprehensive explanation of the outlook for  investment in the island. He said: Even though there is a  certain preference toward Latin American countries in order to  achieve greater regional integration, we must give consideration  to the countries like India that have stood by us during  difficult times.    There was great interest on the part of the Indian  businessmen in learning of possibilities for investment in  biotechnology, pharmaceutical products, tourism, fishing,  textiles, and agriculture. Robaina explained that today Cuba  does not have enough capital but does have a great human  resource and an existing infrastructure, which are primary  factors for joint ventures.

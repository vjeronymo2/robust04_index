			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.351 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Channel assignment policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The channels allocated for use in the Public Mobile Services are listed in the applicable subparts of this part. Channels and channel blocks are assigned in such a manner as to facilitate the rendition of service on an interference-free basis in each service area. Except as otherwise provided in this part, each channel or channel block is assigned exclusively to one common carrier in each service area. All applicants for, and licensees of, stations in the Public Mobile Services shall cooperate in the selection and use of channels in order to minimize interference and obtain the most efficient use of the allocated spectrum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.352 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Protection from interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Mobile Services stations operating in full accordance with applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of their authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If the FCC determines, however, that interference which significantly interrupts or degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, require modifications to any Public Mobile station as necessary to eliminate such interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Failure to operate as authorized.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any licensee causing interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station into full compliance with the authorization and rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intermodulation interference.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Situations in which no protection is afforded.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is afforded in the following situations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inteference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interference to fixed stations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No protection is provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric propagation of signals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Facilities for which the FCC not notified.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No protection is provided against interference to the service of any additional or modified transmitter operating pursuant to &sect;22.163 or &sect;22.165, unless and until the licensee notifies the FCC (FCC Form 489) of the additional or modified transmitter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In-building radiation systems.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No protection is provided against interference to the service of in-building radiation systems (see &sect;22.383). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.353  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Blanketing interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for resolving cases of blanketing interference in accordance with the provisions of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees must resolve any cases of blanketing interference in their area of responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one-year period following commencement of service from new or modified transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the complainant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where the field strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or exceeds 115 dB&mu;V/m. To determine the radial distance to the boundary of this area, the following formula must be used: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w62,d16 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER17NO94.007 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without consideration of the antenna's vertical radiation pattern or height, must be used in the formula. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to mobile receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing interference occurring as a result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly installed consumer antenna systems, or the use of high gain antennas or antenna booster amplifiers by consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where there are already one or more transmitting antennas are responsible for resolving any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting antennas at the same location are jointly responsible for resolving blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine which station is causing the interference, in which case the licensee of that station is held fully responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

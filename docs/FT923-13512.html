			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter (1): Proposals for protected trade are confused and misleading Sir, Prof Ronald Dore's prescriptions confuse the benefits of inward investment with the disadvantages of trade barriers (Personal View, July 8). While the gains from such investment are tangible, the harm inflicted on the local economy from the coercive policies designed to attract that investment is often more obscure. Inward investment is to be welcomed, but tariff-jumping operations are no better than the protected local firms that they replace. Governments can only coerce firms to invest by maintaining high tariff walls against imports. Without such a protected market, they are unlikely to be willing to incur the higher costs of producing locally. As with old-fashioned protectionism, Prof Dore's neo-mercantilist policies fail to address the likely effect on world economic welfare when all countries are playing the same game. As more and more countries compete for the same efficient Japanese factories, the only beneficiaries are likely to be the Japanese firms themselves. The greater costs of production from foregone economies of scale from too many plants in too many countries will be incurred by local consumers who must face high prices in order to sustain local production. Hence, to pretend that investment-inviting import quantity restrictions are somehow economically justifiable while protectionism is not is fatuous. The outcome is the same except for the fact that monopoly profits accrue to a foreign firm rather than to local shareholders. Prof Dore might also want to reflect on whether the disappearance of the British motorcycle industry in the space of a decade is a testament to 'the bankruptcy of the comparative advantage paradigm', or a tribute to its success.

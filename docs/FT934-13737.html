			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc takes centre stage  -A look at the French chemical group THE privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris, successfully launched on the Paris stock market on Monday, will be a hard act to follow. The challenge will fall to Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals group, chosen by the French government as the next public-sector company to take its place on the auction block. Several factors suggest a repeat performance when the chemicals group is sold within the next few weeks. Rhone-Poulenc has been partially privatised. A sale of 10 per cent of the company's shares in January reduced the government's direct holding in the chemicals group to 43 per cent, with Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank, and AGF, the state-controlled insurance group, holding 8.2 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively. The reduction in the state's stake has given Rhone-Poulenc experience of share issues and makes the sale a relatively small operation. The government's remaining shares are valued at about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.7bn), compared with the FFr28bn raised by BNP and the FFr50bn which would flow from the sale of the government's 50 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, the oil, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which is next on the government's privatisation list. For the first time, the government will use a book-building technique to ascertain the value of the shares. However, the precedent of BNP which was cheaper than expected, and the need for the government to maintain momentum in its plans to privatise 21 groups, suggests that they are unlikely to be expensive. As with BNP, the price asked of a group of stable core shareholders - expected to hold between 25 per cent and 35 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc after privatisation - is expected to be higher than for individual investors. But this is not expected to pose difficulties, and the formation of such a group appears nearly complete. Credit Lyonnais and AGF are expected to be joined by Axa, the insurance group, and BNP, in which Rhone-Poulenc took a 1 per cent stake at the time of its privatisation. The Dassault and Merieux families will become core shareholders following a share issue which will give Rhone-Poulenc complete ownership of Institute Merieux, the vaccines group. If the technical aspects of the issue and the probability of an attractive price support the prediction of a smooth privatisation, however, the company faces a series of challenges at the operating level. First-half profits, announced last month, showed a fall of 11 per cent to FFr1.37bn. Mr Jean Rene Fourtou, the group's chairman, expects full-year profits to decline and does not expect a significant recovery next year. The reasons are to be found in the company's operating environment. Healthcare remains the group's most important business. SG Warburg, brokers, expects the division to generate operating profits this year of FFr6bn, compared with FFr6.4bn for the group. But the healthcare operations, which include the majority-owned subsidiary Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, have been hit by healthcare reforms in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sales for the subsidiary could fall during the third quarter compared with the same period last year. For the year they will continue to rise. Analysts expect RPR's underlying sales growth to be about 7 per cent this year, while earnings per share will grow by about 15 per cent as interest payments fall and cost-cutting improves margins. In the longer term, reforms in France, which accounts for 25 per cent of the group's healthcare sales, are inevitable, admits the company. However, it insists any changes will be less severe than elsewhere on the continent. The agrochemicals sector is troubled. Rhone-Poulenc's activities, which generated sales in 1992 of FFr10.3bn, are expected to report falls in turnover and trading profits this year. Its most important markets, France and Germany, dropped 25 per cent this year following the reforms of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. The group is launching two products in the next two years which should lift sales but incur additional marketing costs. Meanwhile, Rhone-Poulenc's more traditional chemicals activities have been hit by a downturn in Germany and France which was more serious and prolonged than expected by the management. Analysts believe fibres and polymers may break even this year on a turnover of about FFr10.5bn. The organic and inorganic intermediates division is expected to tumble into loss on turnover of FFr13.4bn and speciality chemicals, heavily weighted towards the US and UK, should make a small profit of FFr600m on turnover of FFr12.3bn. However, the worst seems to be over. In chemicals, prices appear to have stopped falling. Even the price of phenol, which has suffered from over-supply and a sharp fall in demand, is stabilising. In the fibres division, which saw profits fall to FFr36m in the first half from FFr418m, benefits of restructuring - such as July's joint venture with Snia of Italy  -should help curb costs and improve margins. Broader reorganisation within Rhone-Poulenc is likely to be one of the most important factors in a return to profit growth. The sale of assets, such as the group's shares in Roussel-Uclaf for about FFr4.5bn in June, are helping to reduce the group's debt from about FFr25bn. It seems possible that the company's target debt/equity ratio of 50 per cent by the end of 1994 could be achieved by the end of this year. About 10 non-core businesses remain in Rhone-Poulenc and some could be spun off or sold. The benefits of reorganisation should bring more fundamental advantages. Mr Fourtou's strategy since taking over has been to transform Rhone-Poulenc from a production-oriented company to one focused on marketing and innovation. More than 80 of the group's businesses have been sold as part of the the shift in strategy. Annual R&amp;D expenditure has increased to FFr6.5bn from about FFr3bn in 1986. The benefits of this shift in focus and restructuring, have been masked by the depressed state of many of its markets. The group should find itself in a relatively strong position when European economies, France and Germany in particular, start to revive. The group has important launches in drugs, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals, whose success will be critical for the company's future. Profitability should be assisted by privatisation. Mr Fourtou has argued that the sale of the government's stake will make it easier to raise new capital, strengthening the balance sheet and reducing the cost of debt. The company does not anticipate a new share issue immediately, relying on continued restructuring to reduce borrowings. But the more impressive the privatisation act, the greater the attractions of a return to the market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RHONE-POULENC (OPERATING PROFIT BY SECTOR, FFr m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1991       1992      1993(E)      1994(E)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oll*                          763        528         -200          200 SC*                            89        562          600          800 Healthcare                  4,206      4,962        6,000        6,600 Agro                        1,161        870          700          850 Fibres &amp; Polymers             651        532            0          300 Miscellaneous                -598       -675         -700         -700 Total                       6,272      6,779        6,400        8,050 Net Financial Charges      -3,454     -3,208       -2,300       -1,900  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Organic &amp; Inorganic Intermediates/Specialty Chemicals (E) = Estimate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

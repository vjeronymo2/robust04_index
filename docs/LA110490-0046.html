			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> TRIAL BY FIRE: A Woman Correspondent's Journey to the Frontline By Kathleen  Barnes (Thunder's Mouth Press: $19.95; 256 pp.). Kathleen Barnes chases stories  written in blood.  </P> <P> Covering that kind of carnage, from Northern Ireland to the Philippines, should  be a young person's job, but Barnes came to it in her mid-30s, fleeing a  pleasant life as a reporter on a small-town daily in Upstate New York, the wife  of another reporter perfectly content to cover a place she found stultifying.  Her book is an absorbing memoir of her six years in the midst of the depravity  born of intractable religious and political differences. If it does not cross  the line to art -- if she fails to step back and describe events with the  perspective available to someone not meeting daily deadlines -- it is still a  valuable reminder of the outrages people (too much like us) commit in the name  of God and state.

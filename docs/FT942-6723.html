			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rights issue and fears of inquiry hit Mediobanca Shares in Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, fell again yesterday to cast a deep shadow over the group's planned L1,500bn rights issue. The shares have fallen almost 20 per cent since the issue was announced on April 29 and following the disclosure that Ravenna magistrates are considering a criminal investigation into the bank. Official notice of an inquiry is expected to be sent to bank directors within the next few days. The magistrates are examining Mediobanca's role as adviser on the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison, the Italian industrial group which collapsed last year, as part of a wider investigation of Ferruzzi finances. In particular, they will probe allegations by Mr Carlo Sama, former chief executive of Ferruzzi, that Mediobanca was aware last June of L400bn (Dollars 251m) of undeclared bad debts to offshore companies, but did not insist that these were disclosed in the Ferruzzi 1992 accounts. Under Italian law, this is a criminal offence. Mediobanca is co-operating with the magistrates, but is understood to regard the alleged breach as a purely technical matter, that had no effect on the subsequent restructuring of Ferruzzi's L31,000bn of debt. When Mediobanca launched its rights issue, it said new shares would be issued at a price of at least L15,000 each, against a market price at the time of more than L18,500. But yesterday the shares slipped by a further 2 per cent to L15,290, perilously close to the floor set for the capital increase. Mediobanca's shareholders - dominated by a group of large former state-owned banks and some of Italy's biggest companies - will meet to approve the rights issue plan on June 13. The possibility of a criminal investigation into the merchant bank is fascinating the Italian media, because of the influence Mediobanca exerts over the financial and industrial community. The bank's strategy is still guided by Mr Enrico Cuccia, its honorary chairman, who is 86. Mr Vittorio Vicini, the chief prosecutor in Ravenna, where the Ferruzzi family is based, fuelled speculation on Thursday when he told journalists, after meeting with Mediobanca's lawyer, that 'no sanctuary was inviolable'. He said a decision on the case would be taken early next week. Mediobanca has also come under attack for installing allies on the boards of the two recently privatised banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano.</p>

At the moment it is impossible to give any more details  since  this process is still under way, Karadzic said.    The president of the Serb Republic arrived in Moscow this  evening and immediately met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin. Their tete-a-tete meeting lasted for 45 minutes.    "The very fact that we are in Russia and that the Russian  army is in our country already means a lot," Karadzic said  following talks with Churkin. "There are a few countries in the  world that are impartial as regards the Bosnian conflict.  Russia is impartial in every respect, and it is also a friendly  country,, Karadzic stressed. He went on to say that these were  traditional relations and "an old friendship."    Speaking about the Russian initiative for the  demilitarization of Sarajevo, Karadzic said that it saved the  world many troubles. "We wish the same path to be pursued  further. It seems to me that Russia has chosen the right way to  contribute to the resolution of conflicts in Bosnia," Karadzic  concluded.    The president of the Serb Republic is to continue talks with  Russian officials tomorrow. He is expected to meet Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.</p>

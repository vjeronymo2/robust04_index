			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NERVOUS SAVERS LINE UP AT OFFICES OF TROUBLED THRIFT  </P> <P> Worried depositors lined up Monday at beleaguered Columbia Savings, some intent  on taking out their money while others were simply looking for a little  reassurance.  </P> <P> Both camps apparently got what they were looking for.  </P> <P> Several of Columbia's 22 savings branches were extra busy Monday and one  particularly long line numbering about 30 people spanned the tastefully  decorated lobby of the savings and loan's main Beverly Hills branch at  mid-morning. But panic was noticeably absent, and some offices were downright  quiet.  </P> <P> Many customers said they were concerned and surprised by the announcement that  the maverick thrift, which until recently was advertising the acumen of its  management, had lost about $575 million in a recent five-month period, wiping  out its capital and rendering it insolvent. Most of the losses were blamed on  the institution's portfolio of junk bonds, those high-risk securities that have  lost much of their value in recent months. Analysts say a government takeover  is highly likely.  </P> <P> "Some people have closed accounts. That would be expected," said spokeswoman  Lenore Hatch. She declined to specify the size of the outflow or whether  withdrawals were heavier than deposits made on Monday.  </P> <P> It may not be known for at least several days if the stunning news of  Columbia's insolvency triggered a run on deposits. Columbia had attracted  deposits by offering higher rates than most of its competitors.  </P> <P> "Obviously there are people who have come in and have been very concerned,"  Hatch said. "There's been a great misconception about what the insurance is."  </P> <P> Deposits are insured up to $100,000 by the federal government, and some  combinations of different types of accounts can take an individual's total  coverage even higher. But that didn't comfort all of Columbia's depositors.  </P> <P> "I just came from working out and there's no way I wasn't going to close out my  account today," said Elaine Stein, who waited in line at the main Beverly Hills  branch for an hour to close her three accounts, which totaled less than  $100,000.  </P> <P> "I know it's insured and all that, but I don't care," Stein said. "I'm angry."  </P> <P> She added: "I blame this on Mike Milken and his crappy junk bonds."  </P> <P> Columbia sent extra officials into its branches to try to soothe customers, and  many were talked into leaving their money alone.  </P> <P> Matt Gold went to Columbia's Tarzana office to withdraw his $10,000 certificate  of deposit, but was persuaded that his money is safe.  </P> <P> "They're not thinking of closing," the Encino resident said. "I think it (the  CD) will be covered."  </P> <P> Ed Bangert also decided to leave his checking account intact after a visit to  Columbia's Costa Mesa branch.  </P> <P> "It doesn't affect me any because everything is insured," the retired carpenter  said. "If you can't trust the (banking) system and the government, then  everything will go down the tubes."  </P> <P> Doris Ostrow planned to withdraw just enough money Monday to bring her account  under the insurance limit.  </P> <P> "I think I will leave in the $100,000 because where do I go from here?" she  asked. "You can't hold it in the house."  </P> <P> Sy Brill is an old hand with troubled financial institutions. The Sherman Oaks  resident said he has been a customer at Columbia's Encino office for only a few  months -- since paying a penalty to withdraw his CD from ailing Lincoln Savings  of Irvine, which was taken over by federal regulators.  </P> <P> Times staff writers John Medearis in the San Fernando Valley, Cristina Lee in  Orange County and Nancy Yoshihara in Los Angeles contributed to this article.  </P></p>

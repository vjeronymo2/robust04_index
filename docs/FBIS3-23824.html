			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice </F> faction in the State Duma, by Aleksandr Bekker; place and date  not given: "Yegor Gaydar: The Academicians' Program is a `Very  Interesting Document.' It Clarifies Why the USSR Economy  Collapsed"]    [Text] It is expected that today the State Duma will  conduct parliamentary hearings devoted to programs of economic  reform and anticrisis measures. The impact caused by the  parliamentary elections on the moods of the political leaders of  Russia was extremely significant. In this connection one can  expect that the results of the hearings will be taken into  account by the government when it determines the plan for  further measures.    SEGODNYA offers its readers an interview with the  leader of the Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma, Yegor  Gaydar, who previously defended the government program from  attack by the Supreme Soviet and is now criticizing developments  for changing this program proposed to the government by a group  of Russian academicians.    [Bekker] Anatoliy Chubays called the proposals from  academicians Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov for changing the  course of the reforms "economically absurd." Do you too consider  them to be unworthy of professional attention?    [Gaydar] No, it is a very interesting document. It makes it  possible to guess the riddle of the 20th century--why did the  generally inert economy of the Soviet Union collapse so quickly?  Of course, by 1985 it was severely ill. But in order to  completely destroy the consumer market and financial system in  six years and by the end of 1991 to leave the country without  currency reserves or grain supplies--one had to try very hard to  accomplish this.    [Bekker] And you mean to say that this striking result was  achieved by a set of measures similar to the ones proposed in  the report by the scholars?    [Gaydar] Yes. Take such a proposal as state regulation of  prices of the most important raw material commodities. They do  not reveal precisely which ones, but apparently they are the  products of the fuel and energy complex and, possibly,  nonferrous and ferrous metals and products of chemistry. The  regulation would be introduced against a background of  large-scale financial infusions, working capital of enterprises  and the savings of the population would be indexed, and capital  investments, expenditures on conversion and the social sphere,  and critical imports would increase.    The consequences are obvious: the sharpest disproportions  would arise between regulated and free prices. As a result,  after a short period of time even with the present rates of  inflation, oil, gas, and practically all goods on which prices  are frozen would begin to be produced at a loss. There would be  a need for a large financial influx to cover the needs of these  branches. Otherwise there will simply be nothing with which to  pay wages and nothing with which to buy electric energy and  spare parts.    [Bekker] But the report suggests establishing a certain  rational relationship among parts for branch goods.    [Gaydar] In the first place, who knows what this ratio is?  In  the second place, it is not simple to do that. In two months  inflation could bring products, say, from machine building to a  new price level, and in order not to shut down the fuel and  energy complex the government would have to scrape together  funds from the budget. But the disparity in prices would get  ever deeper and ever more subsidies would be required, the  budget deficit would start to grow and unfixed prices would rise  ever more rapidly.    Further--there would be two other consequences. If the  demand  for metal were greater than the supply of metal at suppressed  prices, a waiting line would form for it and the seller would  determine whether to provide it or not based on who satisfies  certain of his additional needs, say, through barter. And the  second thing: there would arise a need to control this  distribution. And then there would appear the boss who decides  who gets what limits and funds and assignments. A sector of  deficit distribution would develop in the economy.    [Bekker] And inevitably it would be necessary to restore the  Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply] in  order to divide up the deficit and the Gosplan [State Planning  Committee] in order to determine the national economic  proportions and calculate interbranch balances.    [Gaydar] Well, naturally. The report masks this with a  euphemism--"the state will undertake to play the game." But  what will the "player" do when he finds out that first metal has  ceased to be very profitable and then it is produced at a loss,  and then there is nowhere to get the money to pay the wages of  the metallurgists, and then strikes begin at the combines. Of  course, under pressure the government will give in and raise  prices. But not by 15 percent, as is now happening in the  market, but three- to four-fold, since by that time the other  prices will be rising sharply. As a result, throughout the  entire economy a powerful pro-inflation impulse will be set in  motion. That is, instead of making it possible for the  enterprises, hard as it may be for them, to adapt each day to  the changes in the proportions, you will reorganize them once  every four months and beat them over the head with a club. And  then see how they react to that.    [Bekker] After all, just in July the government finally  released prices for petroleum and stopped regulating grain  prices.    [Gaydar] Indeed, the minute they have achieved something  they  are immediately ready to drive up the high cost waves,  reproducing price distortions and an immense load on the budget.  The esteemed academicians say that this is being done in order  to bring the prices in the branches up to normative ratios. In  principle it is possible to achieve this by two methods.  First--slightly influence supply and demand; introduce export  and import tariffs and stimulate the importing or exporting of  goods. The second is to assign prices. To say that they will be  this or that.    [Bekker] Is that what the State Committee on Prices has been  doing?    [Gaydar] Yes. This system would have to be made  all-encompassing. Because if you regulate prices for knitted  goods, you automatically have to control the price of cotton.  And then there arises the problem of equal advantage in  producing products which was well known in Soviet times. This  problem practically does not exist now: products are sold at the  prices at which they are sold. In the academicians' version we  are given a deficit and an escape from producing disadvantageous  products. If you know that it is impossible to buy many batching  items and spare parts at any price, you will have to construct,  without any of these absurdities, an integrated price regulation  system.    [Bekker] Plus the system for regulating incomes and wages  through the State Committee on Labor and Social Problems.    [Gaydar] Sure. And for orders on prices and wages to be  carried out they must be backed up by strict sanctions and  legislative rights for state organs. For instance, if someone  refuses to produce the necessary kind of fitting the authorities  must have the possibility of firing the leader or giving a  reprimand. But here is the problem: all of this somehow cannot  exist in a private economy.    In order for there to be no cracks in the system, it is  necessary, as was said in the report, to abandon the populist  voucher privatization and begin the reverse  process--nationalization. Then events will develop in the  standard way on the consumer market. As soon as the monetary  assets of the population grow as a result of indexation and  prices, according to the advice of the academicians, are fixed,  the government itself will be very bewildered when it discovers  that again nothing can be bought for the money. And that again  it is necessary to go from Tula to Moscow, stand in lines,  introduce ration cards, divide up the supplies of meat products,  go to the capital to try to scare some up, have good relations  with the salesmen, and have a foot in the back door. In brief,  all the charms about which we have forgotten somewhat will come  creeping back, although in terms of time they are not far behind  us.    In our history there existed a great organ--the Commission  on  Distribution of Material Resources. It died quietly and  unnoticed in 1922 with the liberalization of the economy and the  introduction of a relatively stable currency. And very quickly  it turned up restored in expanded form as soon as a set of  measures painfully similar to the ones proposed in January 1994  were implemented.    [Bekker] You have not yet touched on an important element of  the academicians' concept: they assert that administrative  regulation will halt the decline of production and make it  possible to saturate the commodity market.    [Gaydar] The scale of financial disproportions that will  follow such a measure will be incomparable to the current  fluctuations and production volumes. As a result of such a  decision the demand will automatically increase not by 2 percent  or even by 10 percent but several-fold. Because this is a  monetary phenomenon.    According to this scenario, stabilization or at least  retardation of the rates of decline of production would be  possible only under the condition that the authorities fully and  effectively restore the previous system of management. But I am  convinced that now it would take years of deep crisis in order  to arrange a normally functioning Gosplan, Gossnab, and 50  branches of ministries, to restore the old ties, to cast off  privatization, and to again adapt to the discipline of fear.    We are now living under the conditions of a very painful  intersystem transformation whereby the old system has been  broken down and a new one is just being built. And here, without  hanging on, without being patient, in general, a  year...experience shows that in a postcommunist economy  financial stabilization comes in the third year of reform, and  production begins to increase in the fourth. Instead of  continuing things, they are now beginning to turn this machine  back, that is, worsen the condition of systemless chaos. How and  from what will production all of a sudden begin to grow in this  situation--this is absolutely incomprehensible.    [Bekker] But yet in certain periods of 1992 and 1993, when  the government and the Central Bank had increased monetary  emissions and unleased the nonpayment crisis, production was  clearly invigorated.    [Gaydar] That was a very short-term and transitory result  which was swept away with the next wave of disproportions. No,  of course, if in three years you restore strict total control of  the state, if you bring back fully the administrative-command  system of management and force the population to tighten their  belts, in time production volume could stabilize and the  preconditions for a certain growth could even appear. But there  is no reason to think that anybody will be happy because of  this. Because the volume of economic activity never signifies  its effectiveness. This is simply the quantity of shovelled  resources: the volume of ditches you dig, the number of tanks  you rivet. After this you will completely deprive the economy of  the set of microregulators that were vitally necessary and  because of which, actually, the old system of administration  collapsed. Innovations? Why are they innovations? Economic  utilization of resources--from what item? Having poured capital,  labor, and resources out of ineffective branches--nothing of the  kind. The maximum you can do with a great deal of labor is  preserve the archaic economic structure, which will drag the  country into the web of backwardness.    [Bekker] Boris Yeltsin, having the academicians' work in  mind, said that "such advice had already been given." But  Messrs. Petrakov and Abalkin were not working on a public basis  but on instructions from First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets.  To what extent, in your view, is Viktor Chernomyrdin prepared to  listen to the president's assessment today?    [Gaydar] I do not think that Viktor Stepanovich will decide  to implement the complex of recommendations contained in this  report. Moreover, all the proposals are in the intermediate  phase. If the academicians were to write down what we have just  discussed, that is, the set of consequences and the set of  institutions that would have to be formed immediately in this  connection--beginning with deprivatization of the economy and  ending with the restoration of direct specific administration of  all flows of resources--that would be some kind of integrated  and comprehensible program. Well, say, the program of  counterreforms. But in the present form it is simply a program  for restoring the chaos of 1990-1991. It is doubtful that the  prime minister would even dream of this.    [Bekker] You probably know his program plans.    [Gaydar] No, but I do know that Viktor Stepanovich has not  lost his mind. The academicians' concept contains certain  shortcomings that are obvious and, in my opinion, apparent even  to the non-specialist. Let me put it this way: I would be  surprised if the government would have the courage to  consistently implement what is presented there.    It is presented, incidentally, in an extremely contradictory  way. In one place the government is reproached for its extremely  strict financial policy, for the fact that it has used purely  monetary means of holding down inflation through limiting  demand. But two paragraphs above it says: "The government has  widely used emission as a kind of narcotic for emboldening  production." The strictest financial policy which proceeds  against a background of wide use of emission--that is brilliant.  Or: "In two years they still have not managed to normalize the  budget system in spite of enlisting immense amounts of credit  from the Central Bank to cover the budget deficit." Apparently  the esteemed authors sincerely think that attracting this credit  is a means of stabilizing the budget systems.    [Bekker] The academicians' attack against voucher  privatization as populist and pro-inflation does not seem  altogether clear either. According to the State Program, voucher  privatization will end by 1 July and investment trade for money  and control of publicly financed enterprises will begin.    [Gaydar] Quite right. I especially want to discuss the  supposedly pro-inflation essence of voucher privatization. Even  if one proceeds from the assumption that the checks are an  ersatz means of payment, check privatization is now playing a  marked stabilizing role since the number of vouchers, which was  maximal as of 1 January 1993, is decreasing rapidly. This means  that the total amount of the monetary residuals is increasing  considerably more slowly.    One could argue about whether the emission of vouchers had a  pro-inflation effect at the end of 1992. That, as it were, is an  interesting question. But the fact that now if voucher  privatization has any influence on inflation at all it is only  in the direction of restraint is obvious to anyone who  understands anything about the analysis of monetary reserves. So  the academicians were at least a year and a half late with their  criticism.    [Bekker] And if the chambers of the Federal Assembly approve  this program as a basis for compromise between the government  and parliament?    [Gaydar] Well, the punishment for experiments of this kind  will be forced and apparent to society.    [Bekker] But the academicians are calling your reforms  violence against the economy, shock therapy. Moreover, your  previous friend, when working with Stanislav Shatalin in the  Central Economics and Mathematics Institute and then a  like-thinker in the first post-communist government, Aleksandr  Shokhin, said a couple of days ago that you had resigned in  order to avoid responsibility for what you had done.    [Gaydar] Yes, I heard that. You know, last year we had a  paradoxical, almost unprecedented situation in which there was a  strong, energetic prime minister who did not seem to bear  responsibility for what was happening, which is borne by Gaydar  who is in retirement. And his colleagues, who have also remained  in the government, do not seem to have anything to do with this.  I am not running away from responsibility. I think that was  clear during 1991-1992. In the autumn of 1993 I came to the  government at a time that was not the easiest for it. In my  view, responsibility is inseparable from the possibility of  implementing the policy that you consider right. As long as I  was able to implement this policy, I considered it possible and  necessary to bear responsibility for it and I did not shift it  to anyone else. But, in my view, to take responsibility  absolutely does not mean to be chained to the chair regardless  of fluctuations in the course pursued by the government. It does  not mean to be omnivorous and it does not mean to be prepared to  swallow our pride and accommodate any twists in this policy as  long as you can remain in the loop.</p>

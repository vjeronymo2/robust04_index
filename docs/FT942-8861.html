			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: British Gas to sell Bow Valley stake to Talisman Talisman Energy plans to buy all the common stock of Bow Valley Energy, including British Gas's 53 per cent holding, in a deal which could be worth CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.1bn). The deal would create one of the world's biggest upstream oil and natural gas companies and the third biggest gas producer in western Canada, said Mr James Buckee, Talisman president. Talisman, the former BP Canada and independent since 1992, is offering between 27.5m and 30.2m Talisman common shares, plus CDollars 480m cash for all Bow Valley's 88.3m common shares and equivalents, including several classes of preferred stock. Bow Valley shares on Monday traded around CDollars 13.75. The takeover was subject to the approval of Bow Valley's board and shareholders, and by the Alberta court, Talisman said. British Gas said it intended to vote its shares in favour of the arrangement, Talisman said. The UK group said the sale of its 53 per cent stake in Bow Valley to Talisman would total about CDollars 720m, payable in cash and Talisman shares, based on an average price of CDollars 15.45 for each Bow Valley share. British Gas did not say how much it paid for the shares, or whether it would make a loss or a gain on the sale. The company said in March it was reviewing its shareholding in Bow Valley. 'This transaction forms part of our review of our activities,' said Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive. 'It is consistent with our policy of focusing on international markets where we see the greatest growth potential and where we can apply our expertise.'</p>

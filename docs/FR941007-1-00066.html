			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Multiple Service Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution's CRA rating should reflect its performance in all the local communities in which it does business. However, the proposed regulatory language provided that the agencies would conduct full lending, service, and investment tests (or the other appropriate assessments) in a sample of the service areas in which the institution operated. The agencies would then assign separate composite ratings for each area. The institution's overall rating would reflect the performance of the institution in all service areas studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters urged the agencies to conduct assessments in every one of an institution's service areas, because every institution has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of all of its service areas. These commenters and others also expressed concern that the regulation did not provide clear rules as to how performance in each of the service areas assessed would be combined to arrive at an overall rating for the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution is obligated to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including all of the institution's service areas. However, ensuring that institutions fulfill this responsibility does not necessarily require that an institution's performance in each of its service areas must be examined. Questions of how many service areas should be examined during an examination and how performance in different service areas should be weighed are more appropriately handled through examination procedures than through regulatory language. The agencies have therefore omitted from the revised proposal all discussion of examination treatment of multiple service areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies note that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would establish requirements for the examination of multi-state and other institutions. This proposal and examination procedures will be modified as necessary to comply with that Act if it becomes law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of Ratings on Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CRA requires the agencies to consider an institution's CRA performance record when considering an application by the institution to establish a deposit facility ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , branch). The December proposal specified how CRA ratings would be considered in applications. For example, an application from an institution with a ``substantial noncompliance'' CRA rating would have generally been denied, whereas an application from an institution with an ``outstanding'' rating would have been given extra weight. A ``satisfactory'' rating generally would have been consistent with approval of an application and a ``needs to improve'' rating, absent other evidence, generally would have resulted in a denial or conditional approval of an application. The agencies emphasized, however, that the CRA examination rating is not conclusive and recognized that other information related to CRA performance and the convenience and needs of communities, including information collected through public comment and reports, is also relevant and would be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not intended as such, a number of the commenters believed these provisions would have provided institutions with a ``safe harbor'' from challenges to their performance record in the applications process if they achieved an ``outstanding'' CRA examination rating. Those commenters were concerned that they could be prevented from effectively commenting on the CRA performance aspects relevant to applications and urged that those provisions be dropped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion of the effect of particular ratings on applications in the December proposal was not intended to alter the agencies' policy of considering examination ratings and public comment during the applications process and has been deleted. As stated in the December proposal, the agencies have consistently recognized that materials relating to CRA performance received during the applications process from public comments and other sources, can and do provide relevant and valuable information. The revised proposal explicitly states that interested parties would have the opportunity to comment on applications and that the agencies would take their views into account in considering the CRA performance of an institution in the applications process. The agencies continue to believe, as provided in the Interagency Policy Statement Regarding the Community Reinvestment Act, that information from an examination is a particularly important consideration in the applications process because it represents the on-site evaluation of an institution's CRA performance by its primary federal regulator. The revised proposal also would specify that an institution's record of CRA performance would be considered in an institution's expansion proposals (as defined in the CRA) and may be the basis for approving, denying, or conditioning approval of an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

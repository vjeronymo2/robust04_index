			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS  </P> <P> I have just found the time to throughly study the income tax return form for  1988. The first thing that I discovered was that there is a 33% tax bracket  that was not included in the estimated tax form that I used during the year.  Next I learned that the 33% bracket applies only to taxable incomes between  $71,900 and $149,250. Above $149,250 the tax rate goes back to 28% plus the  loss of personal exemptions. It is an obvious concession to the very wealthy  such as those people who are making hundreds of millions on leveraged buyouts.  </P> <P> On top of this our President wants to reduce the capital gains even further.  All this while the economic conditions of low-income people continue to  deteriorate. The tax schedule emphasizes that no matter how many "tax reforms"  occur, the very wealthy retain their advantage.  </P> <P> GEORGE BILLIPS  </P> <P> Rolling Hills  </P></p>

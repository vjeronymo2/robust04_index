			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters said that OSHA should limit the types of vehicles requiring mesh material (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They said mesh should not be required on front-end loaders, log stackers, forklifts, scrapers and graders. They contend some of these machines are used in log stacking areas where there is no danger of branches entering the cab. In the final rule, OSHA has deleted front-end loaders, trucks, graders, and scrapers from paragraph (f)(3) because they are used in performing construction activities rather than logging operations. With regard to log-stackers, OSHA believes it is necessary for these machines to be equipped with mesh material or equivalent protection. Log-stackers are used to raise and move trees as well as logs. In some cases trees are not topped until they are taken to the landing. When trees still contain branches, they could enter the cab and injure the operator if no cab protection is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule also specifies that the cab may be enclosed with a material other than mesh, provided the employer demonstrate that it provides equivalent protection and visibility. The proposed rule implied that transparent material could be used but did not specify what level of protection it must provide. The 1978 ANSI logging standard specified that when glass enclosures were used, they must be safety glass or its equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. One commenter stated that many machines are already enclosed with other material, such as safety glass, that offers equivalent protection and visibility (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1084, April 1980, ``Operator Protective Structure Performance Criteria for Certain Forestry Equipment, Recommended Practice'' allows cabs to be enclosed with safety glass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that when transparent material, other than safety glass is used, that it provides both equivalent protection and visibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of the final rule requires that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility. The proposed rule required that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility to the rear. OSHA believes that it is necessary that the enclosure allow maximum visibility in all directions so that the operator and other employees in the area are not injured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(3)(x) of the final rule requires that if transparent material, rather than mesh, is used to enclose the upper cab, it shall be of safety glass or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection and visibility. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. The proposed standard also specified that a metal screen must also be used where transparent material alone does not provide adequate protection. In the final rule, OSHA specifies the preferred transparent material (i.e. safety glass). OSHA agrees with various commenters that when safety glass is used, additional metal mesh screens are not necessary. The final rule does allow alternative material to be used, and makes clear OSHA's intent that it is the employer who bears the burden of proving that the alternative material provides protection and visibility that is equivalent to safety glass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (f)(3) (xi) and (xii) of the final rule require that transparent material be kept clean and be replaced when it is cracked, broken, scratched or damaged in any other way that may create a hazard for the operator. These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of the final rule requires that deflectors be installed in front of each cab to deflect whipping saplings and branches. This provision also requires that deflectors be located so they do not impede visibility or access to the cab. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(3)(xiv) of the final rule requires that the height of each cab entrance be at least 52 inches, or 1.3 meters, from the floor of the cab. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. No commenters opposed this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

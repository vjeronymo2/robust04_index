			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNISYS TO CUT 6,000 WORKERS BY END OF 1990  </P> <P> Unisys Corp. today announced that it will cut more than 6,000 jobs -- as much  as 8% of its work force -- by the end of next year in a restructuring plan to  battle weak domestic demand and stiffer competition in the computer industry  worldwide.  </P> <P> Unisys, formed by the 1986 merger of Sperry Corp. and Burroughs Corp., also  said that by September it will complete a review of all its operations that  will include the cuts.  </P> <P> "We have examined in detail both our strategies since the merger and their  operational execution," chairman and chief executive officer W. Michael  Blumenthal said.  </P> <P> "The basic strategies are working as planned . . . but our operational  profitability has clearly been inadequate for several reasons, including the  need to work off excess inventories, weaker than expected U.S. demand and  sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide."  </P> <P> Blumenthal said the company will cut annual costs by at least $400 million by  the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Over the same period, Unisys plans to cut its worldwide work force by 7% to 8%  through attrition and layoffs, spokesman Michael A. Stugrin said. That amounts  to between 6,000 and 7,000 workers, he said.  </P> <P> Since Unisys has been under a hiring and salary freeze since the end of the  second quarter, the employees who retire or leave the company will not be  replaced, Stugrin said.  </P> <P> He said a major focus of the job cuts will be in the United States, where, he  said "the softest market conditions prevail, unfortunately."  </P> <P> He said that Unisys has "taken pains to make sure our people understand the  trends in the industry and in the marketplace" and that the company has "a  sense of determination to see this through and go on to better conditions."  </P></p>

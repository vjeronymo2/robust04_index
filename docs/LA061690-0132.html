			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CALTRANS DIRECTOR MCKEAN TO RETIRE  </P> <P> Keith E. McKean, the first full-fledged director of the California Department  of Transportation office in Orange County, has announced that he will retire  Dec. 1.  </P> <P> McKean, 65, said he had always intended to retire this year but was waiting for  passage of Proposition 111, the gasoline tax hike approved by California voters  in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> McKean has headed the Orange County District since 1988, following Robert H.  Ramey, who served on an interim basis while the district was being created in  1987.  </P> <P> "He has been an important player in the development of our state highway  system, particularly in Southern California," said Caltrans Director Robert K.  Best. "His experience and knowledge will be difficult to replace."  </P> <P> McKean said two of his favorite highway projects during his 40-year career were  the Foothill and Century freeways in Los Angeles County, which he routed and  managed, respectively.  </P> <P> But the most significant project "in the mill," he added, is the widening of  the Santa Ana Freeway. McKean said the project has been one of his biggest  challenges, in part because funding for widening the freeway north of the  Garden Grove Freeway "is still a question mark."  </P> <P> "There will have to be an infusion of local money into that project," McKean  said, or widening that section won't begin for many years.  </P> <P> Orange County, known as Caltrans District 12, has an annual budget of more than  $360 million and 715 employees. The district oversees 135 miles of existing  state highway in the county. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAX BUTTERFLIES, INGLEWOOD WALL  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is mentioned (Times, July 15) as  offering a plan to turn 200 acres of the Los Angeles International Airport sand  dunes into a nature preserve, thereby protecting the endangered El Segundo blue  butterfly.  </P> <P> On the same page it was revealed that Inglewood tentatively approved a  five-block-long, eight-foot-high wall on West Boulevard along the Inglewood-Los  Angeles border to protect itself from crime spilling into the neighborhoods  from the Los Angeles side.  </P> <P> It is noteworthy that this part of Los Angeles falls within Councilwoman  Galanter's jurisdiction.  </P> <P> For years, Inglewood and Los Angeles citizen groups tried to contact the  councilwoman about this area and the dismal condition it is in. Just a few  months ago, one of Inglewood's volunteer organizations had a meeting with one  of the councilwoman's deputies regarding this location. Recently a group of Los  Angeles-Florence area residents met with the same deputy, discussing the same  subject. The results, as always, have (ranged) from lip service to nonexistent.  </P> <P> While it is commendable to show concern about the environment, it also would be  commendable to show compassion and actions for people and conditions in other  parts of the councilwoman's district.  </P> <P> HERMANN FAE  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

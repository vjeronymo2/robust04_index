			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB chief in warning over risks of OTC derivatives FINANCIAL institutions should pay more attention to the risks they are running in the over-the-counter derivatives markets, Sir David Walker, chairman of the UK's Securities and Investments Board, warned yesterday. In a speech in London, Sir David also welcomed news that the Group of 30, the US-based 'think tank', was to review the risks to financial markets posed by the growing use of derivatives. 'Often participants are committing themselves to contracts which stretch out way into the future in a market which is untested, extremely volatile and highly illiquid,' Sir David said. Substantial credit risk and falling profit margins also gave cause for concern. 'This is a market for management to watch with particular care,' he said. His comments add to the growing weight of public concern expressed by financial regulators in recent weeks about trading in derivatives markets. Speaking in a personal capacity to the annual conference of the International Swap Dealers Association last week, Mr Richard Farrant, deputy head of banking supervision at the Bank of England, warned that complex new financial products 'stretch the ability of general management to understand and control them.' Earlier this month, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' club, warned of growing financial instability due to the contingent claims that have built up through banks' off-balance sheet activities. 'We simply do not know the size of the indirect risks for the individual institution generated by this interdependence,' he said.</p>

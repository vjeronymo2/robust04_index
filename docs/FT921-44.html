			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Observer: Swedish roulette Sweden has never been one of the world's great gambling dens. The maximum bet allowable on the roulette wheel is a measly two kronor (about 20p). Indeed, it sometimes seems that the only way Swedes can fritter away really large sums of money is through the financial system where the savings banks have spent several billion kronor on dud loans. However, change is in the air. A taskforce has been sampling the nightlife of northern Europe and has recommended that Sweden should be allowed to have three or four big international casinos. Last year, Swedes frittered away over SKr 20bn on lotteries, football pools and betting on the horses, so clearly there is a market.</p>

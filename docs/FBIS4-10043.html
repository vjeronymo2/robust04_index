			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuba is neither the hell they make it out to be nor  the paradise it wishes to be; it is, rather, the work of men  with both virtues and defects, affirmed Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina on 5 April in Montevideo.    Either of these two affirmations is prejudicial to us  because  neither is believable, said Robaina, who began an official  two-day visit to Uruguay on 4 April within the framework of a  South American tour that also includes Argentina, Paraguay,  Ecuador, and Peru.    In speaking to the International Affairs Committee of the  Uruguayan parliament, Robaina maintained that political changes  are associated with systems and that the conditions for such  changes do not exist in Cuba today. Robaina cited sovereignty,  independence, and the ability to speak with one's own voice as  nonnegotiable principles. Unacceptable, too, are any solutions  that would mean backsliding in the spheres of education, health,  the sciences, and sports.    Touching upon the subject of human rights, Robaina stressed  that Cuba has an extremely clean past, and he affirmed that the  nation can display the very strong reality of not having people  disappear, get assassinated, or be tortured.</p>

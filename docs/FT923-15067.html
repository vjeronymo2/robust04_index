			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Technology: Reflections of an electronics pioneer in Silicon Valley - Bill Hewlett talks to Louise Kehoe and Geoffrey Owen about building his company We had a good education and there weren't a lot of jobs around, so (we thought) why not try to start a business. So we did any work that we could get. We built a foul line indicator for a bowling alley, and a clock drive for a telescope, and just whatever came in the door. In these words Bill Hewlett recalls the early days of the Hewlett-Packard Company, one of the oldest surviving West Coast electronics companies. Today, Hewlett-Packard is a Dollars 14.5bn company, with nearly 90,000 employees; a leader in Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology; one of the top manufacturers of computer printers; and to this day, a company that retains its roots in the electronic instruments business. Now 79, Hewlett can still be found several days each week in his office at HP's Research Laboratories, only a few miles from the rented garage in which as young engineers he and David Packard set up shop in 1938. As technology entrepreneurs, Hewlett and Packard set a trend that during the past half century has created, in California, the world's largest complex of high technology companies. They also established, from the beginning, a corporate philosophy based on openness and respect for the individual that has had a strong influence on the character of what is now known as 'Silicon Valley'. Bill Hewlett explains in simple terms: 'We didn't want to have a 'hire and fire' company. Both Dave and I were products of the Great Depression. We had observed its effects on all sides, and of course it had a strong effect on us. It could not help but influence our decisions on how a company should be run.' While layoffs have now become commonplace in Silicon Valley during periods of economic recession, the ideal of valuing employees' contributions above short-term profits remains. A pragmatist, Hewlett acknowledges that 'certain times you have to be that way, but we just didn't want that kind of a company'. The kind of company that Hewlett and Packard did want gave employees a stake in the company's success. In the early days, they initiated a production bonus plan. 'The same percentage was paid to the janitor as to the top manager,' Hewlett recalls. Being egalitarian ensures that communications within the company are open, he believes. Openness was another important tenet of the 'HP Way'. Hewlett chuckles as he remembers inviting a German competitor to visit the HP plant. When Hewlett returned the visit, he recounts, 'he had to show me through his plant. He obviously had never shown a person through the plant in all his life and he didn't know what to do]' That started a policy which HP still adheres to and which has become a distinct characteristic of Silicon Valley. 'You show competitors what you are doing - they will learn soon enough. Just don't tell them what you are thinking]' In contrast to today's entrepreneurs, Hewlett and Packard were determined not to 'operate on borrowed money'. 'We started with a very small amount of money (Dollars 538) and we operated, as much as possible, on a pay-as-you-go basis, that our growth be financed by our earnings and not by debt.' Neither did Hewlett and Packard start out with a 'grand vision', nor even the idea of commercialising a technology breakthrough, like many of their modern-day counterparts. 'We just took on odd jobs,' Hewlett recalls. Some were odd indeed. They included developing an optical device to automatically flush a urinal, as well as an automatic lettuce thinner, designed to thin out rows of vegetable seedlings. Before long, however, HP found its niche with a device invented by Hewlett during his post graduate studies at Stanford University. The 'audio oscillator', for measuring sound waves, gave HP its first commercial success. 'We sent out flyers to some of the universities and to our surprise we got an order or two back, so we sent out more flyers and we got more orders and it looked like a good field to go into so we branched out into related instruments. So that is really how we got started.' HP's first 'big' order, for eight oscillators, came from Walt Disney for use in the production of the film Fantasia. 'Originally, electronics - that word had not yet been coined - radio engineering, we called it, consisted of the phonograph and the recording industry, the telephone industry, the talking pictures, and geophysical work. It was in those fairly narrow fields that we found our customers, as well as the universities.' The second world war interrupted Hewlett's career, but it did not stunt the growth of his company. 'I had a reserve commission. When I went into the Army, we had 17 employed, and when I came out I think we had about 250.' Although HP took on very little 'war work', the company flourished on the growing awareness of the importance of electronics. 'What the war did do for us - it made it evident that electronics could be applied in many provinces. So all of a sudden you found it appearing all over. And we shared in this growth directly, because if you make something, you've got to measure it.' The war years established David Packard as the 'manager' of the company, while Bill Hewlett took on the 'engineering' role. However, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this half century partnership is that throughout it the two men have remained friends as well as business associates, spending holidays together as recently as last year, and always regarding their roles at the company as interchangeable. In 1969-1971, when David Packard went to Washington to serve as deputy secretary of defense, Hewlett readily took over the management of the company until his partner's return. It was in the mid 1960s that Hewlett-Packard took its first cautious steps into the computer business. 'Our customers were getting more sophisticated and a lot of them wanted to have something to control instruments and to take data from the instruments. 'This obviously meant a computer, so we got into the computer business, not for data processing per se, but really as a controller for instruments. Later, HP researchers came up with the idea of a desktop calculator. It really was a computer, but we didn't want to call it a computer, because every company had a computer guru and all they wanted was IBM.' Even now that computers represent the lion's share of HP's revenues, Hewlett seems to remain sceptical, although he is enthusiastic about HP's laser printers, 'one of our most successful products'. He also remembers clearly and makes no secret of the ones that did not prove to be winners. 'We tried to make a watch, a computer watch, and we sold it for Dollars 700. That was a disaster. It was a nice watch, you know, but we just couldn't make it for what our competitors could make it for.' But what of HP's future? Where will HP be five years from now? 'I can't tell you,' Hewlett states firmly. 'The longest planning period we've ever had was three years. We had a five year plan and didn't pay any attention to it. Three years is as far ahead as we could see. That says a lot about this industry. It's very hard - it's not like making railroad cars. You have to be flexible and roll with the punches.' 'But I can tell you that I think we are in a strong position. We've got a good work staff, we've got good management and a good financial position. So unless we screw it up, I think we're in good shape.' Despite his advancing years, Hewlett remains very much involved in the company, albeit in an unofficial capacity these days. 'Dave (Packard) and I know enough people so we can find out what's going on when John (John Young, HP chief executive) may not know it. And we bring these to John's attention. Boy, he hops to it,' says Hewlett with a grin.</p>

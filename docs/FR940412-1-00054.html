			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 7.B._Calculation of Charges for Unspecified Trips  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) For transits which are not specified in &sect;401.405 and &sect;401.410 of this chapter, the Director bases basic pilotage rates on the hourly charge developed in Step 7.A., above. This hourly charge for basic pilotage service is assessed for each hour that a registered pilot is aboard a vessel, subject to a six-hour minimum each time a pilot is assigned, with three-hour increments thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 7.C._Calculation of Charges for Specified Trips  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) For transits which are specified in &sect;401.405 and &sect;401.410 of this chapter, the Director periodically reviews the average time for each individual transit, using the travel time in both directions. This review will be accomplished at least once every five years. The proposed basic pilotage fee listed for specified transits in &sect;401.405 and &sect;401.410 of this chapter is based on the result of multiplying the hourly basic pilotage fee by the average transit time calculated for that transit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) During ratemaking proceedings which occur between periodic reviews of average vessel transit times, the rates for specified transits are adjusted as a group. The pilotage rate for specified transits in each area is adjusted by subtracting the ``projection of revenue'' from the ``projection of revenue needed'' and dividing by the ``projection of revenue,'' with the resultant deficit or surplus expressed in percentage terms, rounded to the nearest whole number. The proposed basic pilotage rates for specified transits are determined by multiplying the existing rates by the resultant percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 7.D._Calculation of Charges for Ancillary Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Ancillary charges are equalized between districts. These charges need not be adjusted during every ratemaking. These charges are reviewed at intervals of not more than five years, during the periodic review of average vessel transit time for specified trips discussed in Step 7.C., above. Each of these charges is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Docking, Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For consistency, these charges are set at the same level in all districts. The charges are determined by the Director, subject to the requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Moveage_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts is twice the docking charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Delay Charges_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, are set at the rate determined in the pilot compensation phase discussed in Step 2 above, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum delay charge for any 24-hour period is the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Cancellation Charges_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Cancellation charges are set at the rate determined in the pilot compensation phase discussed in Step 2 above, and are not adjusted for ship size. If the cancellation occurs less than six hours after the pilot reports, the maximum charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for a six-hour period. If the cancellation occurs more than six hours after the pilot reports, the charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for each hour or fraction of an hour, to a maximum of 16 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Lock Passage Charges_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For consistency, these charges are set at the same level in all districts. The level will be determined by the Director, subject to the requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 7.E._Adjustment for Ship Size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The hourly charge for basic pilotage services discussed in Step 7.A., above, is adjusted by dividing the basic charge by the average weighting factor of the preceding year, as determined from charges adjusted in accordance with &sect;401.400 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix B to Part 404_Ratemaking Definitions and Formulas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following definitions apply to the ratemaking formula contained in this appendix. The account numbers correspond to the account numbers in Appendix A to part 403 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Operating Revenue_means the sum of all operating revenues received by the Association for pilotage services, less ancillary revenues that are offset against operating expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

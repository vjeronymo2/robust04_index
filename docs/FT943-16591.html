			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Divide and thrive at Boots - Neil Buckley reports on how the retailing and pharmaceuticals group used textbook techniques to revive its profitability Late in 1992, workers at Boots factories in Nottingham found themselves wearing a new badge on their overalls. The famous blue oval carrying the Boots name in cursive script was replaced by one sporting two interconnecting squiggles. At the same time, workers had to get used to the idea that they were working not for 'Boots', but for a new business unit, Boots Contract Manufacturing. The logos were visible signs of important developments in the group - changes that might have come straight from a modern management textbook, but which were greeted with suspicion inside and outside the 111-year-old company. 'There was some cynicism about the business-school speak,' says a company insider. 'But now people think and speak the new language.' If the changes are gaining acceptance in the group, Boots' announcement last month of a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 484m for the year to March (before exceptional items) helped to convince the outside world of their effectiveness. In spite of uncertainty surrounding the pharmaceuticals division, losses at the Do It All DIY chain, and disappointing performances from other legacies of the Pounds 900m acquisition of Ward White in 1989, it seemed that chief executive Sir James Blyth had found a way of unlocking extra value. Working with Marakon, a Connecticut-based management consultancy, the then highly centralised Boots group split 18 months ago into 10 business units. All units have a specified market and competitors, their own management team, identity and logo. Each draws up its own profit and loss account, balance sheet and cashflow statements, and presents an annual 'prospectus' to the group centre detailing its strategy, and the capital and resources required to fulfil it. This is discussed with the group chief executive, and becomes a 'strategy contract' signed by both sides. The contract includes performance targets that determine unit managers' incentive payments. This, says Sir James, marks a big improvement on the practice in many companies of allocating capital through annual budgetary procedures, where the amount each division receives often depends on the 'baronial powers of individuals'. The group centre, meanwhile, has slimmed to 100 people in seven roles: personnel, corporate affairs, corporate development, financial management, information technology, quality control and treasury. 'Boots has tried to create an environment in which the group centre becomes a shareholder in each business unit, with only a limited range of services. But it is a demanding shareholder,' says Sir James. The centre is also responsible for new business development and restructuring, as well as exploiting synergies, or so-called 'key affiliation benefits'. These include the transfer of retail skills between businesses, development of the Boots brand, vertical integration, and the sharing of information. Sir James sums up the changes: 'What used to happen at board meetings was that directors would spend a great deal of time talking about numbers. Now all the discussion is about strategy.' The goal of that strategy, as with any public company, is maximising shareholder value. Boots defines this specifically as 'maximising the long-term cashflow of each business unit'. According to Sir James, the concentration on free cashflow reflects a growing shift by institutional investors from looking at earnings per share. 'There is a much stronger correlation between cashflow per share and market value than between earnings per share growth and market value,' he suggests. The new structure at Boots also makes it easier for insiders and outsiders to assess the contribution of different parts of the business. While the future of the prescription pharmaceuticals arm is under review following the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug last year, Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs arm, and Boots Contract Manufacturing, which manufactures products for the other two as well as health and beauty products, are emerging as businesses with great potential. 'Historically, for 25 years, we had been seen as a cost,' says John Watson, managing director of BCM. 'Now we are seen as a profit.' BCM's operating profits rose by nearly a quarter last year to Pounds 16.2m, and as a standalone business it is the third-biggesst manufacturer of its type in Europe. Eighty per cent of its output goes to other Boots companies, 60 per cent to Boots the Chemists alone. It already makes own-label products for several of the UK's large grocery retailers, and is keen to expand its third-party business. Boots Healthcare International, whose brands include such well-known products as Optrex, Nurofen and Strepsils, has also been earmarked for expansion. BHI will concentrate on developing four product groups - cough and cold remedies, pain relief, eye care and skin care - and plans acquisitions in France, Italy and Germany. The dominant business unit, however, remains Boots the Chemists, responsible for 60 per cent of group operating profits. Its recent results - a 13 per cent profit rise to Pounds 322m - suggest it is weathering the everyday-low-pricing strategy operated by Superdrug, which is owned by the rival Kingfisher group. The resilience of BTC stems partly from changes wrought by managing director Gordon Hourston. In 1986 BTC was in danger of losing its identity and focus, with larger stores carrying everything from toothpaste to televisions. A wide variation in store sizes also made functions such as inventory management difficult. Hourston's solution was to split the business in half, with stores larger than 600 sq m operating separately. He also divided the central buying and marketing department into business centres responsible for particular product areas. Under Hourston, Boots the Chemists became a pioneer of retail systems and one of the biggest users of electronic point-of-sale technology in Europe. These moves helped BTC reduce stockholding and operating costs. They also increased flexibility, allowing it to respond almost instantly to price initiatives by competitors, simply by reprogramming its computer, rather than having sales assistants alter prices by hand. Till sales information allows BTC to determine the profit contribution of all products and stop or reduce unprofitable lines - one famous example being pet food. Mistakes were made - Boots sometimes overlooked the fact that an unprofitable product might nevertheless be attracting shoppers to the store. But the final result was a more focused range, with the positioning and shelf space of each product in each store controlled by a computer system called Spaceman. Another important strategy has been the development of the Boots brand. Own-label products are important as they cost retailers less than proprietary brands, and so carry a bigger profit margin or the same cash profit at a lower price. Own-label products now account for 43 per cent of BTC's sales - one-third of them made by Boots Contract Manufacturing. George Charters, director of merchandise and marketing, divides own-label into three categories: Basic products, such as shampoo, which compete with rivals' own-label products. Brand competitors, such as the shampoo-and-conditioner Duo, designed to compete with proprietary brands, but at prices 5 to 10 per cent cheaper. Value-added products, such as the global and natural collections, which compete with rival retailer Body Shop. Charters says the third area, which has the highest margin, is the fastest growing. That means operating margins, which have more than doubled from 5 per cent in 1985 to 11.5 per cent last year, should still have room for growth. There is also scope for physical growth. BTC has identified 240 potential sites for more small stores, and it has a pilot programme of opening shops within superstores operated by J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery retailer. The hope now is that Boots the Chemists' retailing skills can be passed to the group's less successful retail chains - Halfords, Children's World, Fads, and Do It All. A longer-term aspiration is that countries such as France, perhaps under pressure from the European Commission, might relax restrictions on companies holding multiple pharmacy licences, allowing Boots the Chemists to take its business overseas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Kozyrev] We view the signing of the  [Russo-Georgian] treaty as an incentive for further efforts to  regulate the conflicts that are worrying us in Abkhazia and  South Ossetia and for securing the human rights of national  minorities. The treaty will come into full force only after  this is done. The treaty will be ratified but, for the time  being, it is important that the treaty serve as an incentive on  these issues and not a substitute.    [Correspondent] In Sochi you declared that Russia had legal,  historical, and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus. How  will these interests reflect on the Abkhaz issue?    [Kozyrev] This issue should be regulated in such a way that  would allow Georgian integrity. At the same time, the status of  Abkhazia will be defined so that peace is established in Georgia.    [Correspondent] How can that be done?    [Kozyrev] It is an issue for negotiation.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Money to burn? Then think electronics - Do not blink or you will miss the latest technology Technology has moved so far and so fast in recent years that you can now take your pick from large quantities of techno-toys that, a decade ago, would have existed only in the darkest corners of Q's laboratory on a James Bond film set. If money was no object, and you were free to choose from the very best of the techno-toys around, regardless of price, which products could, or should, you buy? Night vision a problem? It does not need to be - not with a hand-held, thermal imaging device. Pysis makes a one-eyed version with a hefty Fuji zoom lens for Pounds 900 or thereabouts. You see things in a fetching shade of luminous pea-green: handy, if you happen to like that colour. The bonus is that its ergonomic shape means you can hold it with one hand. A pleasure to use. The pleasure principle is to be found everywhere in the design of technology. Arguably, there is no product area apart from car design that has benefited more from advances in the understanding of product semantics than the computer. If you feel the need for an electronic organiser to put a little order into your life, the Psion Series 3a is well worth a look for its chunky feel and robust usability. A snip at Pounds 329.95, it comes complete with lots of smart cards and the necessary leads. For tougher tasks, you will need a bigger, beefier computer which is also enjoyable to use. The top-of-the-range Apple Macintosh Powerbook 540c4/320 costs a shade over Pounds 4,000 and plays a nifty game of computer golf as well as dealing with all the organisational material you would want it to handle. One of the nicest things about the most expensive Powerbooks is that you get a trackpad, rather than a ball, as the control for the computer. Your fingertips simply trace a direction over a silkily-textured piece of plastic. How it works is a mystery: but that is half the pleasure of owning such an expensive machine. Another exercise in unadulterated extravagance would be an Ericsson EH237 portable telephone. It is a nicely compact piece of design with all the fully-featured functions that you would expect from a miniaturised communications centre. The hitch is that the EH237 rockets in price if you buy it without a connection. With air-time, it costs less than Pounds 100. Without air-time, it is Pounds 381.99. Another terrific little toy is the Sony Pixis IPS 760 (Pounds 1,299). It is a hand-held global positioning system that tells you more or less exactly where you are at any time - within 30 to 100 metres. Take a map, use it to tell the Pixis the latitude and longitude of your friend's country house - and the device will tell you exactly how far away you are and what direction you should take. The Pixis is a pleasure to hold and to play with. But it is about twice the price of some rival makes, which will give you just as accurate a position. Let us assume that the position your Pixis has given you is 'on the sofa in the living room watching television'. Technology has brought us to a stage where the choice of sets available is bewildering. If you want to see the pictures as the cameraman and the production team see them when they are working, you could do worse than invest in a professional broadcast monitor. The Sony PVM 1444 QM (Pounds 1,499) is the one to look for. A video recorder to go with it? Try the Sony S-VHS SVO 9620 Pro-Recorder (Pounds 2,750). It has the same chunky aesthetic as the television set and, with its no-nonsense functional quality, is built to last. Camera? The Canon EX-2 Digital Hi-8 (Pounds 6,999) has more buttons than a deep-sea exploration vehicle and looks suspiciously like one. The Sony Hi-8 Pro editor Twin-deck Video Player (also Pounds 6,999) should complete the set. For those who prefer something a little slicker, Bang &amp; Olufsen, of Denmark, has been making the sound and vision equivalent to the De Lorean car for years. A completely expandable, modular Beosystem - including a television with motorised stand and interior screen 'curtains', built-in video and several speakers delivering spooky, surround-type sound - would set you back nearly Pounds 10,000. If you wanted to add a huge, compact disc player, Sony's Unilinear Quadruple D/A Converter System D/A Master Clock Twin Optical Linkage CD Player is Pounds 5,000. All this is available off the shelf for the modern technologist with money to burn. Then there are the custom-built techno-toys where the price of a simple stereo and speakers can begin at Pounds 100,000. But who wants to wait for delivery when technology is moving so fast and dragging design along with it?</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Asko returns to profit but opts to omit payout Asko, one of Germany's biggest retailers, returned to profit last year, but will not resume dividend payments on ordinary shares until the end of this year. By then the company should be experiencing a marked improvement in earnings, Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chairman, said yesterday. It will, however, pay out around DM1.5bn in the form of a DM7.50 dividend for preference shareholders, according to Mr Horst Weber, finance director. The payment comprises DM2.50 for each of the past three years, and meets a statutory requirement for a minimum 5 per cent annual dividend to holders of preferred stock. Preference shareholders would have acquired voting rights at the next annual meeting if the payment were not made, he said. The company, majority-owned by the Swiss Metro group since last year, earned a net DM432m (Dollars 255.6m) for the year ended September, 1993, compared with a loss of DM462m in the preceding nine-month period. Last year's profits from ordinary activities, excluding extraordinary gains and payments resulting from a wide-ranging restructuring, totalled DM196m, Mr Wiegandt said. He confirmed that the group would go ahead this year with a rights issue to reinforce Asko's capital base. The board has approval a nominal DM83.25m capital increase. Majority shareholders - Metro, WestLB bank and Begoha-Holding, accounting for 70 per cent of the outstanding shares - would take up their entitlement to the rights offer. The group's ordinary shares gained DM39 yesterday, closing at DM1,089 in Frankfurt, while the preference stock rose DM25 to DM980.</p>

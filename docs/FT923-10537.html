			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: The case for independent input Sir, The topical subject of corporate governance and the desirability of involving non-executive or 'independent' directors centres on the belief that this leads to better corporate decision-making. Independents are expected to be good at distinguishing the wood from the trees, and at ensuring that executives (normally with unquestioned technical competence) use to the full the experience and objectivity which non-executives can bring. Why then, with near unanimity among both practitioners and regulators on the desirability of the independent input, is it ignored as an aid to good decision-taking in some regulatory bodies themselves? Take the Serious Fraud Office. Would it not be sensible to have a panel of senior professionals, businessmen and academics, who could be co-opted when decisions are to be taken on whether to prosecute, what charges to bring, how much 'plea bargaining' to allow, what further resources to allocate to an investigation, and so on. There is little confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of recent City prosecutions: the success ratio has been low and judgment on which cases to press on with and which to abandon has looked unbalanced to say the least. The SFO has achieved little in protecting the City's good name at a time when this has never been more important and when most would agree that in reality London is a 'cleaner' place to do business than any comparable financial centre.

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Mazda in Chinese venture Mazda is to set up a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicles in Fuzhou, China, from 1996. The Japanese vehicle group's partners are Fuzhou Solid Motors, a local company, the Salim group of Indonesia and Tomen, the Japanese trading company. The venture is expected to call for investment of about Y10bn (Dollars 101m) and to have an annual output of 10,000 pick-up trucks rising to 30,000 in 1997. This is in line with the Chinese government's policy that small truck production should exceed 100,000 units a year. Local parts procurement is also planned to increase to 50 per cent. Mazda already has a joint venture in Hainan, in southern China, which produces several thousand commercial vehicles a year. Last year it began licensing small commercial vehicle technology to Fuzhou Solid Motor.</p>

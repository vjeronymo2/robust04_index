			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fenchurch advances to Pounds 7.79m Fenchurch, the insurance broker which gained a stock market listing in November last year, reported pre-tax up from Pounds 4.56m to Pounds 7.79m in the year to September 30. The result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 284,000 (Pounds 1.59m) and Pounds 58,000 profits (Pounds 875,000 losses) from discontinued activities. Pro forma pre-tax profits on continuing operations, assuming the flotation took place at the beginning of the financial year, showed a 15 per cent increase to Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 6.9m). Earnings per share were 15p (10.6p) with the pro forma figure rising 16 per cent to 14.1p (12.2p). The proposed final dividend of 5.4p makes 8p for the full year. Mr Roger Earl, chief executive, said: 'We want to continue this good and consistent growth.' Market conditions were difficult, however, and would continue to be tough during the next year. Turnover rose to Pounds 32.3m (Pounds 31.2m) with Pounds 679,000 (Pounds 3.1m) from discontinued activities. UK retail turnover increased 5.5 per cent to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.9m), including a 25 per cent increase from the Protection House Insurance Services division, despite competition from direct line insurers. Since August Fenchurch has acquired a specialist insurer, a financial consultancy and a minority stake in a provider of health risk management services. The reinsurance business continued to grow, with turnover up from Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 2m.</p>

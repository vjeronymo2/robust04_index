			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: UK should obey EC rules only as scrupulously as its partners Sir, Kelvin MacKenzie ('Mass trick treaty', June 1) said of the EC that 'most of all we want the other members. . .to obey the rules as scrupulously as we do'. Assuming that we do obey them scrupulously, this amounts to wishing that, in general, EC rules carried more weight in member countries. It would surely be more consistent with the rest of his views to argue that we should obey the rules as scrupulously as they do. Apart from ideological neatness, this approach puts the solution to the problem in our hands rather than theirs. Whether we should use such an approach is a matter of opinion. Kelvin's readers would doubtless approve, but what do they know? L C Atkins, 28 Hooper Street, Wapping, London E1 8BU</p>

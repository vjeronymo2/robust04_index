			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: A race that didn't take place - The Bottom Line IT WAS straight out of Alice in Wonderland. The starting pistol went. The contestants raced around the track for all they were worth. They flashed across the finishing line, the crowds roared. But when it was all over, something very curious happened. All the contestants denied that the event had taken place. Even the winner said he had no knowledge of a race, and refused to accept the prize. Fortunately for the crowd, the bookies honoured their bets, and many punters went home much the richer. The amazing non-race was staged by the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Only two years after they were privatised, their annual results season has become an unspoken contest in who can produce the biggest dividend increase. And what a contest it was. The clear winner was Southern Electric based outside Maidenhead which recommended a total increase for the year of no less than 17.6 per cent. But true to the rules of the non-contest, Geoffrey Wilson, the chairman, brushed aside the plaudits. He said: 'We are not trying to be top of the pops.' The average increase for all the RECs was 15.3 per cent, which means that even the lowest increase, from Norweb, was still a handsome 13 per cent, giving shareholders some of the best returns available in the market. (Ken Harvey, Norweb's chairman, attacked the race as 'dreadful' and admitted that Norweb had been preparing to pay out even less until it saw the way the rest of the industry was going.) Is it all too good to be true? How much longer can it go on? The answer is probably for quite a while yet. For one thing the fundamentals of the regional electricity sector look very good. The RECs were floated off at prices which did not fully reflect the potential for cost savings, and all of them are now busy carving out the fat. Thousands of jobs have been shed in the last two years, and several thousand more are likely to go between now and 1995. A typical REC has got its costs down by Pounds 20m a year, with more to go. Strong cash flow has also enabled the RECs to start paying off the government debt with which they were saddled at flotation. South Wales Electric, which now calls itself SWALEC, became the first REC to repay all its debt earlier this year, and others will follow. The RECs have also issued bullish dividend forecasts. Many have used words like 'progressive real increases in dividends', some have even put specific numbers on them, like Norweb which forecast rises of inflation plus 6-8 per cent. The stock analysts agree. Nigel Hawkins, who follows the utilities at Hoare Govett, is forecasting dividend increases of 12 per cent for the current year, and 11 per cent the year after that. 'The dividends are safe as houses for the next couple of years,' he says. But there may be another factor: the attitude of the electricity regulator Prof Stephen Littlechild. He takes the view that it is up to the RECs to decide how much profit they want to pay out in dividends - provided they are reinvesting enough to maintain technical and service standards. In other words, he does not want to get involved. But the RECs are not entirely free from regulatory threat. Prof. Littlechild can - and does - influence profits by setting the price controls. Yesterday he announced a tougher price regime for the RECs' electricity supply business. Although this was a minor move affecting only 10 per cent of the REC's operating profits, it is a forerunner of a much larger review which will affect the other 90 per cent this time next year. So anyone holding REC shares should note that next summer is a key date. The key to individual RECs' success will be their ability to withstand a cost squeeze. Analysts advise looking for those with strong financial positions, like SWALEC and Southern, or those who have got their operating costs below the average, like Seeboard and East Midlands. Nigel Burton of Warburg Securities, said: 'What Prof Littlechild wants to see is efficient companies.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          REGIONAL ELECTRICITY COMPANIES DIVIDEND &amp; PROFIT GROWTH  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Dividend     % growth       Pre-tax       % growth                         year         from     profit year         from                     to March         year      to March           year                     1993 (p)      earlier   1993 (Pounds m)    earlier  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Southern             19.6          17.65         187.0           12.45 London               19.5          16.07         145.5            2.11 Midlands               20          15.94         167.1           17.59 Seeboard               20          15.94         112.7           14.53 Northern            21.45          15.63         111.4           13.44 Manweb                 21          15.07         111.2           17.42 Yorkshire           20.42          14.98         156.3           10.15 Eastern              19.2          14.97         183.4           28.16 South Wales          22.3          14.95          87.0           20.00 South West             20          14.94         101.1           21.81 E.

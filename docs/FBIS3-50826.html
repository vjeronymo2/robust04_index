That is what he said at the end of the lunch  he held with his Argentine and Uruguayan counterparts Carlos  Saul Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle at the Charrua Hill farm  belonging to Samuel Liberman.    For more than three hours the three presidents met with  businessmen, industrialists, and some press barons. Although  Wasmosy at first said that bilateral issues or those related to  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] were not treated, he later  explained that he talked with Menem on aspects related to the  Pilcomayo River.    "We are going to discuss that matter with Menem on 14  January  when the Mitre Canal dredging begins. This is part of the  riverways and Mercosur projects," he said.    He added that he told Menem and Maria Julia Alsogaray  [natural resources and environment secretary] that in Buenos  Aires they will talk thoroughly about the Pilcomayo River, when  Public Works Minister Engineer Carlos Vacetti and engineer Luis  Alberto Meyer, director of the National Pilcomayo River  Commission, will also be present.    Asked whether during the dialogue on the Pilcomayo River  they  discussed the infrastructure that will reportedly be built to  take advantage of the river's low waters, he said: "This  problem does not affect Paraguay and Argentina alone. It also  affects Bolivia, and after all it is also an ecological problem  which needs very special attention."    The Paraguayan president did not rule out the possibility of  demanding compensation from Argentina for the damage caused by  the diversion of the Pilcomayo River. He thus said that he will  first try to solve the problem, and then seek the  indemnification or some arrangement that could be achieved on  the matter.    Wasmosy was also consulted on whether they discussed the  automatic lifting of tariffs that will be in effect among  Mercosur countries, and he said that it is a subject that has a  process to follow. He explained that the policy on this matter  is based on achieving coordination of macroeconomic policies  among Mercosur countries, because otherwise the issue will be  delayed even more.    Asked again why Paraguay did not submit in time the official  lists of products that would be exempted from taxes, he said:  "It is not true that we did not submit in time the lists of our  products, but the integration treaties will be signed and  fulfilled only if they bring more bread, happiness, and  well-being to the inhabitants of the country."    The president added that the presidents of Bolivia and Chile  were invited to the meeting with the Mercosur presidents to be  held in Colonia (Uruguay), but he declined to name the  fundamental topics that will be discussed at that summit.</p>

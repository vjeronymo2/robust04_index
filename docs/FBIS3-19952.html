			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 23 (AFP) -- Economic recession in  the European Community has probably touched bottom, but  unemployment will keep climbing to a record high in 1995, EU  Finance Commissioner Henning Christophersen said here Wednesday  [23 March].    In a report presented to the European Parliament, he  predicted that recovery would be slow, with gross domestic  product (GDP) inching up to an annual growth rate of 3 percent a  year in 1996.    But Christophersen said there were no grounds for changing  last November's estimate that GDP growth, after shrinking 0.3  percent in 1993, would expand only weakly by 1.25 percent this  year and 2 percent in 1995.    He said the unemployment rate -- 10.9 percent at the end of  last year -- would reach a record 11.25 percent in 1995 before  beginning to decline.    But the commissioner warned that the predictions were highly  uncertain, and that recovery depended heavily on consumer  confidence.    The EU's executive European Commission expects inflation --  3.4 percent last January -- to keep falling.    But it says efforts to cut government budget deficits --  essential for strong growth -- are being hindered by the glacial  pace of recovery.    The report suggests that interest rates should be cut in  order to fuel confidence and recovery, provided that inflation  keeps falling.    It adds that even moderate economic growth is dependent on  rising exports, investments and consumer confidence, along with  continued pay moderation and government budget discipline.    Christophersen stressed the importance of steps to stimulate  the economy, such as more research and training, plus  implementation of an EU plan to spend massively on  infrastructure transport, telecommunications and energy networks.</p>

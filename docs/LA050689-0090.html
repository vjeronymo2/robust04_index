			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD'S REPORTED AIDS CASES ROSE TO 151,790 IN APRIL  </P> <P> Reported global cases of AIDS rose by 5,221, or 3.56%, in April to a total  151,790 at the end of the month, the World Health Organization said Friday.  </P> <P> The United States accounted for more than half of the increase, with 2,845 new  cases reported to the U.N. health agency. The U.S. total of 89,501 AIDS cases  as of April 30 represented 59% of the world figure.  </P> <P> "But updated reports basically were received only from the United States and  European countries," a WHO official explained.  </P> <P> WHO tabulations showed that figures last supplied by the most affected African  and Latin American countries were as much as six or even 12 months old.  </P> <P> This distorts any list of the most affected countries because totals for many  of them are far out of date.  </P> <P> The world total is cumulative since the first acquired immune deficiency  syndrome cases were registered by WHO in 1980.  </P> <P> WHO experts also believe the true total to be at least double the known  reported figure because many developing countries, especially in Africa, lack  adequate facilities for tracing and diagnosis.  </P> <P> By geographical region, totals and most affected nations on the basis of  reports available to WHO are as follows:  </P> <P>  -- Africa: 23,262 (Burundi 1,408, Congo 1,250, Kenya 2,732, Malawi 2,586,  Rwanda 987, Uganda 5,998, Tanzania 4,158, Zambia 1,296).  </P> <P>  -- Americas: 105,612 (Brazil 5,712, Canada 2,449, Haiti 1,849, Mexico 2,158,  U.S. 89,501).  </P> <P>  -- Asia/Mideast: 369 (Israel 79, Japan 97).  </P> <P>  -- Europe: 21,136 (France 6,409, West Germany, 3,086, Italy 3,494, Netherlands  791, Spain 2,165, Switzerland 806, United Kingdom 2,192).  </P> <P>  -- Oceania: 1,411 (Australia 1,270, New Zealand 119).  </P></p>

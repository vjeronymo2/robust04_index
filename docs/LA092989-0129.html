			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BITES / BEVERLY BUSH SMITH: GRAPE-FED WILD BOAR TO BE PIECE DE RESISTANCE  AT NEWPORT DINNER  </P> <P> You've heard of grain-fed beef and milk-fed veal. Now you can try grape-fed  wild boar. It's the piece de resistance of Showley Wrightson's second annual  Guenoc Winemaker's dinner Sunday in Newport Beach. The boar, from the Guenoc  Winery estate, literally feeds on the grapes in the vineyards.  </P> <P> Another unique twist to the dinner: a component wine tasting. Grant Showley  explained, "Several different grapes are involved in making a Cabernet  Sauvignon, and we will taste separately the Merlot, Petit Sirah -- all five of  the components of Guenoc's Cabernet," as well as the finished Cabernet itself.  </P> <P> Grant and Sharon Showley's menu also includes a salad of broiled salmon and  greens with chervil vinaigrette, wild and Basmati rice timbales with porcini  mushrooms; $65 per person includes dinner, all wines, tax and gratuities.  Reservations: (714) 760-9700.  </P> <P> MORE WINING AND DINING: Now that the beach crowds have departed, The Rex in  Newport Beach gets down to serious wine dinners, showcasing Carmenet wines on  Oct. 16 and Freemark Abbey vintages on Oct. 23. Reservations: (714) 675-2566.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Dana Point will launch a monthlong Oktober  Weinfest. In contrast to a folksy "Oktoberfest," this celebration will explore  "the modern, sophisticated new world of German wines, cuisine and fashion."  </P> <P> With a wide selection of German wines available (many by the glass), the  hotel's chefs will present compatible cuisine throughout the month. And from  Oct. 10 to 13, chef Boris Keller from Boris' Restaurant in Walluf (in the heart  of Germany's Rheingau wine-growing region) will join the hotel's staff to  prepare "signature" menus.  </P> <P> Other fest highlights include visits by German wine makers and fashion shows of  German couture. Information: (714) 240-5008.  </P> <P> Mr. Stox in Anaheim opens its wine dinner season with vintages from Saintsbury  in the Carneros region, presented by David Graves, Wednesday at 7 p.m. New  releases as well as older wines will complement the cuisine of chef Scott  Raczek; $65 per person.  </P> <P> (The restaurant will also celebrate Oktoberfest with a participation dinner and  cooking class Oct. 25. Learn to make sausage, potato pancakes, apple strudel  and more, starting at 6:30 p.m. The tab is $60, gratuity included.)  Information: (714) 634-2994.  </P> <P> It's Aussie night on Oct. 18 at the Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach. An Australian  dinner will accent Tahbilk wines, presented by Australian wine maker Alistair  Purbrick. Reservations: (714) 673-3440.  </P> <P> There's more: The Bouzy's annual wine sale throughout October offers 75 cases  of rare and older wines to connoisseurs. These California and imported wines  may be purchased by the case or mixed case.  </P> <P> HERE 'N' THERE: New at McCharles House in Tustin is Edwardian High Tea, more  substantial fare than the traditional high tea, served from 2 to 5:30 p.m.,  Monday through Saturday. With its hearty Shepherd's pie -- vegetables with  chicken, beef, pasta or pork and a mashed potato topping -- it could serve as  early supper. At $15.95 per person, it also includes McCharles House scones  with cream and raspberry preserves, a pot of Fortnum &amp; Mason tea and your  choice of homemade desserts such as bread pudding, apple crisp,  chocolate-chocolate cake.  </P> <P> El Torito Grill in Costa Mesa recently began a Wednesday "Salsa Night" at the  Top of the Grill, overlooking the Noguchi sculpture garden. From 9 p.m. to 1  a.m., a nine-piece salsa band entertains. There's no cover charge or increase  in drink prices, and you can order from a seven-item appetizer menu.  </P> <P> Two veteran restaurateurs died recently: Opasso (of Balboa Thai, Newport Beach)  and Gus Muller (partner with brother Geril in the original Newport Beach  Ambrosia). Balboa Thai remains open, with Opasso's nephew Peter in charge.  </P> <P> OPENINGS: Carmelo Manto of Corona del Mar's Carmelo's will offer a new style of  dining at his Viva Italia. Opening next week in Laguna Beach on Laguna Canyon  Road, the trattoria will present meals under $10. They'll roast meats and  poultry on a jumbo rotisserie, bake breads, focaccias and pizzas in a wood  burning oven and prepare over two dozen varieties of pasta in the exhibition  kitchen.  </P> <P> Active in the venture with Manto are brothers Vittorio and Ignazio Romeo and  Frank Arciero. They'll open a second Viva Italia in Laguna Niguel at Crown  Valley Parkway and Greenfield Drive before the end of the year.  </P> <P> Places Afar recently debuted in Mission Viejo on Muirlands Boulevard at La Paz  Road. Partners are Cuban Alex Llorente, his French- Vietnamese wife, Evelyne,  his mother-in-law, Lucie Alm (who ran a French restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale,  Fla.) and Don Hilscher. The cuisine? Cuban, French and Vietnamese, of course --  from black beans with rice and meat or pork asada to crevettes Catalan or  choucroute to salad with rice noodles, barbecued pork, shrimp.  </P> <P> Two gentlemen from Milan -- Tony Bagatta, who owned Capuccino in Laguna Beach,  and Andrea Rogantini, opening chef at Tutto Mare -- combine talents at the new  Il Ristorante Bagatta in Newport Beach. Bagatta has transformed the old Le  Saint Tropez with mirrors, mauve carpeting, a center dome. The cuisine focuses  on Northern Italian, with antipastos such as carpaccio of salmon or beef with  artichoke, smoked Mozarella. The a la carte menu includes risotto with  Dungeness crab, fresh spinach and dried tomato; rabbit in a slightly sweetened  balsamic vinegar sauce; baby rack of lamb with tarragon, with all desserts made  in-house.  </P> <P> CHANGING COURSES: Larry Cano, busy developing his own restaurant operations  (Cano's in Newport Beach, Studio Cafe in Corona del Mar, Salud! in Huntington  Beach and Manana in Fountain Valley and Pasadena) has turned the management of  six El Torito specialty restaurants back to El Torito Restaurants Inc. They  include Las Brisas in Laguna Beach; Chanteclair, Remick's and Players in  Irvine; the El Torito Grills in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. Mike Casey,  president of El Torito Restaurants, termed the change a "mutual decision" and  predicts " . . . a smooth transition."  </P> <P> Corrado Gianotti, late of Sostanza in Los Angeles (and before that, Italy) is  the new chef at Tutto Mare in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The Maniacci Brothers changed their minds about selling Capriccio in Mission  Viejo after they opened Sapori in Newport Beach. Sal Maniacci's in charge of  the Saddleback Valley restaurant at the moment.  </P> <P> ADIOS: John Pohl's Bistro in the South Coast Plaza area is closed. . . . So,  too, is the nearby Ambrosia. . . . Ditto, Gemmell's in Costa Mesa.  Award-winning chef Byron Gemmell is now with the Ritz in Newport Center.  </P> <P> ON THE HOTEL SCENE: The Radisson Plaza in Irvine, known as the Registry Hotel  in its earlier incarnation, opens Nov. 1 with two new restaurants, the  Orangeflower Bistro and the Promenade Cafe. Gone is Le Chardonnay, converted to  a ballroom, with the Orangeflower Bistro (formerly Cafe Chablis) the hotel's  primary restaurant. According to food and beverage director Michael Minassian,  it will specialize in a touch of French, French/California, with an Oriental  flavor in the plate design. Moderately priced, it will serve breakfast, lunch  and a more upscale dinner. The Promenade Cafe, highlighting a deluxe breakfast  bar with fresh bakery items, fresh fruits and cereals, will also be open for  lunch and dinner.  </P> <P> At the Hyatt Newporter, Tom Dusing promises that the new management won't touch  The Wine Cellar, where Karel Vidlak remains as maitre d'. The Jamboree Cafe has  retained the same basic menu, but, Dusing reports, executive chef Ted Gray is  departing and a replacement has not been named.  </P> <P> BETTER WATCH OUT: I know, it's not even Halloween yet. But if you don't want to  to miss watching the Christmas boat parade from the windows of your favorite  harbor restaurant, it's time to make reservations.  </P></p>

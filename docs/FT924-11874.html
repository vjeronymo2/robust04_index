			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Specialist team urged to beat VAT avoidance A SPECIALIST team should be set up within the Customs and Excise department to co-ordinate efforts to crack down on value added tax avoidance, the National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, said yesterday. In a report on the department's efforts to counter VAT avoidance, the NAO said that, overall, the matter had been contained. The report said: 'Nearly all significant avoidance schemes countered over the years have come to light as a result of the vigilance of the department's VAT control staff.' Legislative methods over the past seven years to counter VAT avoidance have resulted in the collection annually of an additional Pounds 500m. Customs and Excise staff issue assessments for traders - rather than accept a trader's own estimate of liability - only when they believe the trader has arranged business affairs specifically to avoid paying VAT. Sample cases outlined in the study include: A publican who failed to pay VAT on bar meals, claiming those meals were a separate catering service offered by his wife. A manufacturer and known avid racing fan who avoided paying VAT on a racehorse by saying the horse had been purchased for business promotion purposes. A large company that issued shares mainly for sale in the UK for which it would have to pay 'input' tax tried to avoid it by first selling the shares in the Channel Islands. The NAO said an analysis of 'disaggregation' cases - those where it was believed that a company had split itself into several independent parts to avoid paying VAT - showed that the department won 75 per cent of all cases. Cases were upheld where it could be clearly demonstrated that the business split was solely for the purpose of avoiding tax. The report also said taxpayers should be assessed for tax only when it was fully justified and they should be treated fairly and consistently. The NAO said that, so far, the department had used its legal powers fully but with due care. HM Customs and Excise: Countering Tax Avoidance. National Audit Office, HMSO. Pounds 7.10.</p>

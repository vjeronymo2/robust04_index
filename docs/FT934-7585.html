			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Smith ridicules 'back to basics' campaign - Reaction in the Commons THE 'back to basics' theme set out by the prime minister in the Queen's Speech was yesterday attacked by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, as an attempt to hide the failure of 14 years of Tory government. However, Mr John Major received strong backing from conservative MPs in the House of Commons when he described the government's forthcoming legislative plans as 'a realistic programme that would meet the concerns of the country'. In the traditional Queen's Speech debate, Mr Smith's dismissal of the prime minister's 'back to basics' idea set the tone for an opposition campaign to pin responsibility for rising crime and social problems on the government. Mr Smith also sought to embarrass the government by highlighting the bill to increase National Insurance contributions. 'So much for Tory promises at the last election not to increase taxes on income,' he said. The Labour leader said millions of incredulous electors were trying to work out what Mr Major meant by his campaign to take the country back to basics. 'The Conservatives have been in government for the last 14 years. If now we have to go back to basics, what on earth has been happening over 14 years of Conservative government?' he asked. Mr Smith said the campaign was 'no more and no less than an appalling admission of failure'. The government had clearly reached the conclusion its record was indefensible. 'They would have us wipe out from our own consciousness the fact that they have been in power for the longest single period since the second world war. They want us to forget that they, and they alone, after all these years are responsible for the state of Britain today,' he said. Mr Smith said the real problem facing the country was persistent under-investment in industry, the regions, and the skills and education of the workforce. 'Instead of back to basics, it should be back to the drawing board,' he said. In his speech, Mr Major hit back by attacking Labour's opposition to government measures such as education reforms, privatisation and tougher punishment for criminals. He said Labour was 'out of touch with the values and instincts of the British people', and promised that the planned legislation would 'provide the foundations for a successful, tolerant, responsible society'. The prime minister clashed several times with Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary. Mr Major told him: 'No wonder you are against back to basics; you are pretty basic yourself. You make Neanderthal man look chic.' The prime minister was also optimistic about the outlook for the UK economy against a background of falling inflation and unemployment and a shrinking trade gap. 'As other countries remain in recession we are emerging from it,' he said. 'We now have the opportunity of a long period of sustained growth with low inflation. There has been a great deal of pain and effort to get inflation down, but now we see the rewards.' Conservative MPs said the relatively light programme was likely to achieve the government's aim of unifying the party after the divisions over Maastricht in the last session. However, some warned Mr Major against moving too far to the right. Ms Emma Nicholson (Devon West and Torridge) said such a move would be resisted by centrist MPs. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal leader, said the government had announced a series of 'small measures', but many were 'deeply offensive'.</p>

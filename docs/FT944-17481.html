			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guatemala says it will continue EU banana fight Guatemala said yesterday it would step up pressure for the repeal of the European Union's banana import regime following the European Court's rejection of a challenge by Germany on Wednesday. 'This action by the court reinforces our resolve to pursue every available option under international law,' said Mr Claudio Riedel Telge, ambassador in Brussels. He said Guatemala was prepared to complain again to the World Trade Organisation under its strengthened rules on dispute settlement. Two dispute panels under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have already upheld complaints about the EU's banana rules. In March, the European Commission settled the disputes by agreeing to increase tariff-free import quotas for Latin American bananas to 2.1m tonnes. But Guatemala refused to accept the settlement, which has not been formally adopted by the EU council of ministers. Germany has lodged an additional legal challenge with the European court disputing the commission's authority to negotiate the deal.</p>

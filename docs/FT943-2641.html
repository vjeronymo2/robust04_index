			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Wild night on the loch - Fishing Most fishing is good, unmemorable fun. But there are two other categories of experience: the hellish, when it becomes a torment, and certain days or nights with a blessed quality that stamps them in the memory, like a seal on hot wax. In general, it is fortunate that there should be a balance between the bloody and the miraculous. Were there too many of the former, we should have to escape and take up something safer. An excess of the latter and we (well, I) would soon shed humility and become smug. It is also to the good that both should be rare. So, I am a little worried for I have had two wonderful, indelible nights this summer - and no immersions in the Slough of Despond. I feel catastrophe is lurking every time I pull on my waders. The first was on the Suir, in Ireland, and I have sung that song of triumph already. The second belonged to a little loch in Inverness-shire with a Gaelic name - a'Ghreidlein - as romantic and wild as its setting in the hills that rise between the glens of Affric and Moriston. Its instigator was a man with a twinkle about him, Kyle Laidlay of Tomlch. What you need for this loch, he told us, is a night with no wind. And even then, he cautioned, there could be no certainty for the trout of the loch (pronounced Uretel) were unpredictable and contrary, and the season was late. But they were big: some up to 7lb. The night came and there was an excitement crackling between my friend Stevie and I as we bounced up the track into the hills that hid the loch. Kyle was waiting for us, as were the midges. Beneath us, the surface was glass-smooth, except for the dimples of the trout. A pale, brilliant full moon lit the sky as we clambered aboard the boat. A tiny wind sprang from somewhere to ruffle the surface. There was no longer any sign of rising fish. The method was simple: a big, hairy sedge cast out, then retrieved in steady pulls to create a highly visible wake on the water. Stevie was bubbling with hope and expectation; I was dubious. But on my third or fourth cast, there was a rush at my fly and the rod tip curved. It was not a big fish - three-quarters of a pound or so - but it was a start and I too was caught up in the excitement of the night. I can still feel what it felt like to be there: the darkening, receding shore; the moonbeams lighting the ripples left by the sedge; the slow push of the oars; Kyle's soft, laughing voice speculating on vagaries of trout - and increasing frenzy at the other end of the boat. For Stevie was into fish after fish, each splash and fight accompanied by an explosive commentary on his expertise as a master angler. He had four, the last a tremendous, big-headed, bold-spotted creature of well over 2lb. And, all that time, although we were fishing the same water with identical flies, I had nothing. On the stroke of midnight, soon after Stevie had yelled that he was hyperventilating with the strain of it, a fish took me near the reeds in quiet, resolute fashion. It fought like a hero, belying its weight (a little under 1 1/2 lb) with the power of its runs. With it duly netted, the quiet of finality settled on the loch. No more would the fish rise that night and, suddenly, we realised how cold it had become. Back on shore, we toasted the catch and then headed down the track, leaving a'Ghreidlein with its secrets and its fish for another night. The loch, and a crop of others just as lovely, can be fished by arrangement with Kyle Laidlay. Tel: 0456-415352.</p>

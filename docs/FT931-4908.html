			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Observer: Honour-bound There is one bit of good news for the government amid the continuing economic gloom, the problems with the coal industry and the setbacks over ratifying the Maastricht treaty. The prime minister's brainwave of turning the honours system into a DIY venture seems to be a roaring success with the punters. Only four days after the announcement and over 1,000 requests for application forms have been received. This has resulted in a 20 per cent increase in the team vetting the applications. But although throwing open the honours system to all-comers may seem a brilliant political ploy by a prime minister with the common touch, it is bound to lead to widespread disappointment since the number of honours available is likely to remain the same despite the increased demand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The United States is  likely to announce punitive steps against Japan on Tuesday [15  February] for what it views as the closed nature of Japan's  mobile phone market, a senior trade ministry official said.    Washington may put higher tariffs on Japanese imports in  line  with a telecommunications clause of the trade act, said the  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,  who declined to be named. But the steps will eventually hurt  U.S. manufacturers, the official said, by preventing their  access to Japanese products.    The U.S. telecommunications clause allows the government to  impose retaliatory tariffs in fields other than  telecommunications, such as on autos and auto parts. Higher  tariffs on Japanese-made auto components, for example, are more  likely to affect the U.S. auto industry, increasing unemployment  in the country, he said.    Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on  Tariffs  and Trade if the U.S. takes retaliatory steps, said the official.    Washington has complained that sales in Japan of mobile  phones developed by Motorola Inc. of the U.S. have been markedly  smaller than those made by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.</p>

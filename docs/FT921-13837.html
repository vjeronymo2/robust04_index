			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Lord Rootes: car industry leader - Obituary LORD ROOTES, who has died at the age of 74 after a long illness, was one of the central figures in the post-Second World War development, and later decline, of the UK motor industry. Educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, William Geoffrey Rootes joined the family business in 1946. He increasingly took the helm of the Rootes Group, the motor vehicles concern founded in a Sussex bicycle shop by his grandfather, William. The group embraced such names as Humber, Hillman, Sunbeam, Talbot and Singer. Lord Rootes, who inherited the title in 1964, was the principal driving force of the intensive modernisation which took place at the group in the 1950s. But the group's vigour began to be sapped by its inability to confront competition from domestic and newly emerged foreign rivals. By the time Lord Rootes became chairman in 1967 it was apparent that even the Pounds 12.3m put into the group by US carmaker Chrysler three years earlier, in return for a 46 per cent stake, was unlikely to ensure long-term survival. With market share fading and losses growing, Lord Rootes had to sell the remainder of the business to Chrysler in 1973 for Pounds 20m. It was subsequently sold to Peugeot-Talbot. He died at his home in Hungerford, Berkshire and is survived by his widow, Marian, a daughter and a son.</p>

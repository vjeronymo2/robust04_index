Vitaliy Churkin, Boris  Yeltsin's representative for the former Yugoslavia, spoke  Wednesday of a "new turning-point" in the peace negotiations.  He thinks that the Washington agreement "if it is correctly  implemented," does not threaten the interests of the Bosnian  Serbs, but should instead contribute to a settlement to the  extent that "it makes it possible to solve the complex problems  which were hampering the discussions" like that of access to the  sea for the Muslims.    In Paris, the foreign minister welcomed this "first step,"  while stressing that the test would be the actual implementation  of this Croatian-Muslim agreement on the ground, starting with  respect for the cease-fire, especially in Mostar. Five or six  shells fell on Tuesday evening on this city in Herzegovina whose  Muslim district is being besieged by Croatian forces, but the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports a calming of the  situation on all Croatian-Muslim fronts. Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic announced on Wednesday that Zagreb was  going to withdraw 1,000 men from constituted units of the  Croatian army still present in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He explained  that the negotiations on what practical measures with regard to  the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim federation, and then  confederation with Croatia would be continued in Vienna as of 4  March. They will try to draw up a constitution before 15 March.    Mr. Granic was due to have talks in Paris this Thursday with  Alain Juppe. The previous day, during a luncheon discussion,  the French foreign minister, while welcoming the involvement of  Washington and Moscow in the handling of the Bosnian crisis,  called for a meeting between Americans, Europeans, and Russians  to prevent "diplomatic proliferation" and "put cohesion into the  inititatives." With regard to the Washington agreement, the  minister stressed that many questions still had to be given an  answer: What territory does this agreement apply to? How can  it be delimited? What are the Serbs being told? Can  Croatian-Serbian relations be ignored? "A three-sided problem  cannot be solved by two," Alain Juppe said, adding that the  European Union's plan (partition into three entities) "remains  valid in principle" although it is not "impossible to change."    Ankara and Athens welcomed the Croatian-Muslim Washington  agreement, as did the UNPROFOR, whose spokesman in Sarajevo said  that it "was in harmony with the efforts being made on the  ground." In northern Bosnia, the Serbs are still besieging the  Muslim city of Maglaj which, according to Sarajevo Radio, was  again subjected to heavy shelling and several infantry attacks  on Wednesday. The Serb forces have also stopped a HCR [High  Commission for Refugees] convoy near Sarajevo which was heading  for Maglaj.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "Germany's Giant Daimler </F> Hurting Badly"]    [Text] Profits of Europe's largest industrial group  have plummeted. Its aeronautics branch is eliminating 10,300  jobs, and its automotive branch, 14,000. And its electrical  engineering subsidiary is seeking new alliances. The emphasis is  now on reduction of costs.    "Gross ist wunderbar [Big is wonderful]," Daimler-Benz's CEO  [chief executive officer] Edzard Reuter responded to those who  criticized his industrial bulimia. That was in 1989. Reuter had  just completed a forceful entry into MBB  [Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm], Germany's big aircraft  manufacturer.    Five years later, the visionary leader of Europe's largest  industrial group (approximately 349 billion francs [Fr] of  annual revenue] is in the grip of the worst recession in its  history. The current economic turnarounds are buffeting the  German eagle's expansionist ambitions in its sectors of  predilection -- the automotive (70 percent of its activity), the  aeronautical (17 percent), and the electrical engineering (11  percent) -- with crushing force.    Dornier, MTU, MBB, Fokker, and Deutsche Airbus -- all  brought  together under Daimler's subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA)  -- are reeling from cancellations of orders by airline companies  and the drastic reduction of military spending across the Rhine.  Its flagship fighter-aircraft program, the Eurofighter, being  realized together with England, Italy, and Spain, and already  seriously downsized, is now also running into serious technical  difficulties. And its prospects are all of the gloomiest. In  1993, DASA's orders will total Fr10 billion less than projected,  and for the second consecutive year, the Munich-based firm will  post losses. Given the situation, Jurgen Schrempp, the company's  president, is slashing away at costs. After putting in place an  initial cost-cutting plan last fall, he has now announced a new  phase: the elimination of 10,300 jobs and the closing of six  plants. The goal: savings of Fr5.2 billion annually in this  sector, deemed strategic for the future of the Daimler group.    The restructurings of its aeronautics branch are all the  more  necessary since its automobile branch, Daimler-Benz's  traditional pillar, has also been profoundly hit. A drop of  around 28 percent in new car registrations combined with the  cost of launching its new C series, and the turbulences of the  European market for heavy trucks, have Mercedes also tobogganing  in the red for 1993. To resume the road to competitiveness, the  subsidiary's top management estimates that it must reduce  operating costs by 30 percent within a period of three years.  This coming year, 14,000 jobs will be eliminated in the  prestigious automobile manufacturer's plants. Mercedes remains  tightly knit and is moreover planning to launch its entry into  the micro-car market -- a cultural revolution that takes on the  allure of a challenge.    Meanwhile, Daimler's profits are melting like snow in a hot  sun, jeopardizing Edzard Reuter's position. Nor can he count any  longer on AEG, Daimler's electrical engineering subsidiary,  which expects to post a loss of Fr1 billion this year. Having  already divested itself of its domestic appliances business to  Sweden's Electrolux, AEG is now searching for new alliances.</p>

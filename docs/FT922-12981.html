			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate rumours revive SPECULATION of an interest rate cut raised its head in the early hours of yesterday's trade, prompted by sterling's strong gains on the foreign exchanges. However, most traders felt a cut was unlikely within the next few weeks. Overnight rates fell as low as 7 1/2 per cent, with money available in sufficient quantities throughout the day. However, the futures market seemed uncertain about a rate cut, and had 'no real direction' according to one trader. The June contract firmed from an opening level of 89.94, implying an interest rate of 10.06 per cent, to 89.85 at the close. This implies an interest rate of 10.15 per cent. Market traders, initially excited by the idea of a base rate cut, found themselves moving to a more conservative position. 'I don't think the Chancellor is in that much of a hurry,' said one dealer. 'A cut has got to be done within the framework of the ERM and the DM2.95 band.' Many speculated that the UK would move to cut base rates, and join the narrow band of the ERM, when it assumes the presidency of the European Community this summer. The Bank of England seemed to fuel the rate cut speculation, however, as it took early action to eliminate record shortages. The Bank initially forecast a squeeze of Pounds 2.35bn and stepped in with assistance of Pounds 2.32bn before lunch. The biggest drain came from bills totalling Pounds 1.2bn due for repurchase by the market. Exchequer transactions called for a further Pounds 860m, treasury bills and maturing assistance Pounds 559m, and bankers balances below target Pounds 330m. A Pounds 610m fall in note circulation eased some of the pressure on liquidity. The bulk of the Bank's morning trade was comprised of a Pounds 1.6bn repo agreement falling due on May 1 at 10 7/16 per cent. A further Pounds 500m repo, falling due on May 13, was pitched at 10 15/16 per cent. Other purchases were in bands one, three and four bills at rates of 10 3/8 , 10 5/32 , and 10 1/16 per cent. In the afternoon the shortage was revised to a record high of Pounds 2.75bn. The Bank purchased bands one and two bills totalling Pounds 451m at 10 3/8 per cent, and offered late assistance of Pounds 40m. In Germany, call rates firmed from 9.60/65 per cent to 9.60/70 per cent. In the US, Federal funds traded at 3 5/8 per cent, just below the new presumed target of 3 3/4 per cent.</p>

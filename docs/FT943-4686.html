			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa rally goes on Gold shares again led Johannesburg higher, as fears of profit-taking after recent gains proved unfounded. Demand for commodity-based stocks was seen from local and offshore investors in strong trade, with rises underpinned by institutional reluctance to invest in gilts and a consequent flow of funds towards equities. The decision by striking motor assembly workers to return to work from today continued to support the industrial market. The gold shares index climbed 49 to 2,502, bringing the gain since the start of business on Friday to 170 points. Industrials collected 54 at 6,662 and the overall index was 53 higher at 6,009. De Beers picked up R2.75 at R109.75 but Anglos lost R1 at R259, while JCI advanced R3 to R119 ahead of results. Iscor strengthened 12 cents to a fresh high of R4.60.</p>

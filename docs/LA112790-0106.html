			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UP DOESN'T LOOK NEARLY AS FAR NOW;  </P> <P> RAMS: SUNDAY'S VICTORY OVER THE 49ERS DOESN'T SALVAGE THE SEASON, BUT IT  CERTAINLY WILL MAKE IT MORE FUN TO PLAY.  </P> <P> The last time anybody checked, beating the Greatest Team in the History of the  NFL still only counts as one victory -- unless you are the Rams, who have to  cling to whatever successes they can.  </P> <P> Then, every victory is worth a celebration, especially one that ends the  two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers' 18-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> Sunday, in the feel-good performance of the year, the Rams beat the 49ers on  the soggy Candlestick Park grass, 28-17, and improved to only 4-7 but their  spirits rose from the depths of season-long depression.  </P> <P> "No, I don't think this makes our season, because I don't think any one game  can make a season," quarterback Jim Everett said. "But I'll tell you, it's a  game that we will cherish very much. There's no question about that. It's a  game that means a lot to us."  </P> <P> With their goals for 1990 demolished by their 3-7 start, the Rams spent Monday  savoring Sunday's brief return to glory after losing to the Dallas Cowboys only  a week earlier.  </P> <P> The playoffs are still almost certainly out of their picture but, after their  defense dominated Joe Montana and their offense dismantled the 49er defense in  the fourth quarter, so is the sense that the Rams might pack it in for the rest  of 1990.  </P> <P> "I think the key feeling is that it was fun and that it meant a lot to each of  us personally to do it," John Robinson said Monday at his weekly media  luncheon. "Just to play good and to get some sense of self-worth about your  team.  </P> <P> "Now we get a chance to play again in seven days (Sunday at Cleveland against  the 2-8 Browns.) Let's see if we can do it again. I think we're all down to  very short-range goals at this point.  </P> <P> "Let's play next Sunday, see what happens, see if we can perform anywhere near  the same level. Then let's play again, and let's play again, and see what  happens."  </P> <P> Robinson said he was never really worried about talk that his job might be in  jeopardy. He said he simply wanted his team to play harder, better and more  successfully and took the necessary steps toward that end last week.  </P> <P> "I think I started (the talk) here when somebody asked me a question about it  last Monday," Robinson said. "I think it's just natural that when you lose in  the NFL there are people who think they should eliminate anybody that loses.  </P> <P> "I don't think it was a big issue because the fact that somebody was saying it  doesn't change whether it is or isn't. I think I have some sense of the  direction that we're going as an organization. I don't know everything about  it, but I honestly felt that the most important thing was that we weren't doing  our jobs well, we just weren't playing.  </P> <P> "Me being secure or insecure I don't think is going to make me coach better."  </P> <P> Robinson, who usually tries to highlight the positive to his team, held an  unusual practice-field meeting last Wednesday to slam home his points.  </P> <P> "Just on the themes of toughness and self-worth," Robinson said. "The physical  aspect of the game. Attacking instead of standing around and watching somebody  hit you in the mouth. And then it degenerated into obscenities. Just trying to  turn on a light that says, 'Oh, . . . ' "  </P> <P> If there had been a failure to communicate among the Rams, Robinson made sure  that was corrected. And his team responded by making the plays against the  49ers it hadn't made all year -- forcing a season-high six turnovers, keeping  Jerry Rice and fellow receiver John Taylor relatively quiet, and driving the  ball for more than 10 minutes in the key possession of the game.  </P> <P> The key to the big defensive performance was the decision to use a  six-defensive back, "big nickel" alignment much more than usual, daring the  49ers to try to run and using four safeties to bump the San Francisco receivers  all across the field. The 49ers still couldn't run -- they gained 66 yards in  19 carries -- and Montana had no receivers streaking free.  </P> <P> For one three-hour period, the Rams' defense played the way it did at the end  of 1989.  </P> <P> "Our defense did a great job of that," Robinson said. "We constantly changed,  constantly kept different kinds of people in the game playing different  schemes. It turned out good for us.  </P> <P> "Whether we could get away with that against them the next time we play them,  who knows? At least we made them off(-rhythm). I think Joe, as great as he is,  did the things that quarterbacks do when things don't go right: throw  interceptions, fumble the football, miss some targets . . .  </P> <P> "I think he's the greatest player ever to play the game, yet it's what happens  when things don't happen right. Everybody is vulnerable to those things."  </P> <P> But Robinson, who said that the Rams probably will play a lot more of that kind  of four-safety nickel defense on first and second downs in the near future,  also said he doesn't think the strategy alone was what mystified Montana.  </P> <P> "Let's don't get too caught up on the strategy," Robinson said. "The guys  played good. Strategy maybe gives you an additional weapon, but they played  good. Balls were tipped in the air, and Pat Terrell makes a great play on the  ball (for an interception). And Mike Wilcher, a ball's knocked out of there,  makes the catch (for a fumble recovery). We were just doing those kinds of  things."  </P> <P> Said linebacker Kevin Greene, who recovered two 49er fumbles: "I think in the  back of our minds we were thinking, were the 49ers going to, like, set records  on us? We hadn't been playing very well on defense, but we came up with the big  plays this time."  </P></p>

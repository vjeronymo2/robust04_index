			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (4): Outlook for growth remains bright - Stock market Breaking through the gloom of recession that has gripped Portugal for the past year, the performance of the stock market has shone like a beacon. While output fell and companies began reporting heavy losses, share prices rose steadily and the outlook for continued growth remains bright. Investors - ignoring dwindling industrial profits and fears that shrinking margins and bad debt would hit banks - turned to the stock market in ever-increasing numbers as an attractive alternative to bank deposits, the traditional home of Portuguese savings. 'Liquidity is clearly driving the market,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, an analyst with independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'Institutional and private investors are attributing more and more weight in their portfolios to equity because the returns are more attractive.' Term deposit rates fell from 15 per cent to about 7 per cent in 1993 and many banks are simply refusing longer-term deposits because of the minimal earnings they offer. Bond rates have also dropped sharply, with interest on one-year bonds, for example, shrinking from 19 per cent to 10.5 per cent over the past two years. These rates compare with earnings of about 20 per cent offered by share investment funds. Growing interest in shares drove up the Banco Totta e Azores (BTA) share index by 59.6 per cent in 1993 to 2,614. Prices have continued to rise steadily this year, with the BTA index growing 19.6 per cent to 3,126.8 on February 9. The few market operators who will be drawn into a forecast predict share prices will rise between 20 and 30 per cent in 1994. They are also agreed that a price correction is almost inevitable. 'If share prices continue to climb over the next few months it is very likely there will be a spell of profit-taking that will set the index back,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. The market can not depend on liquidity alone if it wants to maintain solid growth. 'There will eventually have to be some adherence to reality,' says Mr Gomes. 'Many industrial shares currently have a price-earnings ratio of 20. Investors will soon want to see profit levels of 20 per cent or more as a foundation for that ratio.' Trading volume on the Lisbon stock exchange rose by 97 per cent to Es2,849bn in 1993 while the value of the market more than doubled to Es2,193bn. Bond trading accounted for 85 per cent of total volume compared with 81 per cent in 1992. Public debt bonds represented 95 per cent of bond trading, boosted by the admission last year of 10 treasury bonds to the continuous national trading system. Trading in shares accounted for 15 per cent of total volume compared with 18 per cent in 1992. Share trading volume rose 58 per cent to Es417.9bn. The 183 companies quoted had a market capitalisation of Es2,193bn in December, 1993 compared with Es1,431bn a year earlier. In a market where foreign investors have traditionally set buying and selling trends, domestic investors are now beginning to dominate. In particular, Portuguese banks seeking new products as alternatives to traditional loans and deposits - where their intermediation margins are shrinking - have launched a series of mutual, pension and other investment funds. In September 1993, 109 investment funds, 14 of them foreign, were operating in Portugal, with Es1,500bn under their management. The biggest fund, with a market share of 29 per cent, is CaixaGest, run by Caixa Geral de Depositos, the state-owned savings bank and Portugal's largest financial institution. Bond funds represented 71 per cent of the total and share applications only 2.9 per cent. But the funds are gradually increasing their equity weightings and even a 1 per cent change can make an impact on the share market. 'Small investors used to invest directly on the stock market as if they were playing roulette,' says Mr Jose Cardoso de Matos, director of marketing and organisation for the Lisbon bourse. 'Now they are entrusting their money to funds who do the job in a much more professional way.' In addition to falling interest rates, interest in the stock market has been spurred by the official listing of Portugal on emerging market indexes such as the IFC. This has attracted new investment from emerging market funds launched mainly in the US and the UK. Confidence in Portugal has also been stimulated by recent operational and administrative reforms including the adoption of a continuous trading system, a computerised stock registration house and a new administrative law that governs insider trading, company disclosures rules and other areas. These reforms could be taken an important step further this year following a proposal by the stock exchange commission (CMVM) for a restructuring of the country's two bourses as part of plans to create a futures and options market. The CMVM aims to reconcile opposing bids by the rival Lisbon and Oporto bourses to set up a national derivatives exchange, a move considered fundamental for the development of Portugal's capital market. Mr Fernando de Costa Lima, CMVM president, says the commission proposes replacing the spot market in Oporto with a futures and options exchange and developing a national spot market in Lisbon. The Lisbon and Oporto bourses currently compete with separate spot markets although 69 of the most liquid shares are quoted on a national continuous market for which Lisbon and Oporto act as separate trading floors. The daily volume of share trading in the continuous market is Es2bn to Es3bn. Last year, the two exchanges presented rival projects for setting up a futures and options market. But Mr Costa Lima wants the two bourses to overcome their differences and co-operate in building two national markets for spot and derivative operations. This would end competition between Lisbon and Oporto for the same small market.</p>

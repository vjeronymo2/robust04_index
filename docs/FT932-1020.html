			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Recovery not a sign of net export-led growth in UK Sir, The first quarter national accounts and balance-of-payments statistics released by the Central Statistical Office ('No increase in current-account deficit', June 23) show manufacturing output leading the gross domestic product recovery and diminished net imports of goods and services (at constant prices) accounting statistically for virtually all of the growth in GDP, since total domestic spending increased only marginally. But to assume the recovery can be characterised as manufactured net export-led growth in the wake of sterling's exit from the ERM would be quite erroneous. In fact, the improvement in net exports of goods and services is not due to any improvement in export, relative to import, volumes in trade in goods (excluding oil and erratics) relative to the position before exit from the ERM but to a factor unrelated to devaluation; namely, a return of insurance earnings to more normal levels following two quarters of unusually high claims in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Moreover, within the roughly unchanged level of total domestic spending, private consumption is rising slightly faster than GDP at the expense of central government consumption which is falling - reflecting diminished military spending. From the output statistics, while manufacturing is leading recovery, distribution is not far behind. All of this is consistent with a private consumption-led recovery benefiting manufacturing and distribution - supported by an incidental one-off improvement in service export earnings. A recovery, yes] But, not manufactured net export-led growth. John Wells, faculty of economics and politics, University of Cambridge</p>

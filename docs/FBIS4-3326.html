			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>   [Text] The Chinese government has extended a period of  tough restrictions on the operations of the BBC on the mainland  by six months. The limits on coverage include severe  restrictions on reporting by the broadcaster's Beijing  correspondents and a ban on the entry of film crews and radio  reporters. These moves have reduced the BBC's news gathering to  public press functions around the capital. The restrictions,  previously set to apply until mid- summer, have now been renewed  for another six months, according to sources close to the BBC.    The limits, never officially announced, were placed on the  corporation after Beijing warned Britain about "serious  consequences" if it allowed the BBC to screen a controversial  documentary, Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, a critical account  of the late Communist Party chief's life. The hour-long film  was never shown in China or on World Service Television, but  drew heated protests from Beijing, infuriated by the broadcast  on the BBC's United Kingdom domestic service.    Quoting contacts in the Chinese capital, BBC sources last  night said mainland authorities had "upgraded" the corporation  to a list of "unfriendly" and possibly dangerous foreign media.  The sources said both the foreign and broadcast ministries in  Beijing had circulated documents ordering provincial and local  authorities to "avoid relations" with the BBC, and to treat any  requests by correspondents "coolly". "The other thing is a ban  on all BBC reporters visiting China," one source said.    "Usually, at any time, you're likely to have BBC teams in  China, all up to various things: documentaries, World Service  Television.    "Since the Mao documentary, though, no one from the BBC had  received official permission to go into China."    Authorities refused to allow BBC coverage of the National  People's Congress in March, despite the presence of American,  Canadian, German, and Japanese crews.    "When Xinhua (the New China News Agency) in Hong Kong made  it  clear that no one would get visas, London sent a letter to the  government through the Beijing bureau and there was no  response," a source said.    The corporation's two Beijing correspondents, James Miles  and  Carrie Gracie, have had at least three applications for internal  travel refused since December, while local authorities have  maintained their longstanding refusal to accredit a camera crew  to the service. "It's been almost a ban, except that the one  application that was granted was for a time when they couldn't  go," a source said.    Another source said: "The indications we've had, as to when  applications for travel or entry might be convenient, were  originally that July would be the time. Now, though, the  Chinese embassy in London has suggested that it would be a year  (after the Mao documentary was shown)."    Problems created by the documentary have been compounded by  deteriorating Sino-British relations over Hong Kong and what one  executive described as the increasing popularity of the BBC as  it offers Mandarin-language TV broadcasts and wider penetration  via transmission facilities in South Korea and Japan. The  departure on Sunday of World Service Television from Star TV's  north Asia broadcast service, which includes China and Hong  Kong, has drawn no response from Beijing.</p>

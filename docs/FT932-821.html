			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Racing uncertainty faces Gosforth Park - Chris Tighe details the problems encountered by plans to secure course's future TODAY, the centenary running of the Northumberland Plate, 'the Pitman's Derby' at Gosforth Park, is an historic high point for the quoted company which has owned and run the Newcastle racecourse since 1882. But despite this afternoon's celebrations, enhanced by a visit from the Queen, these are worrying times for High Gosforth Park plc. The green belt designation of the racecourse's entire 800 acre site, acquired by High Gosforth Victorian founders 'to promote sport in a proper fashion and get a fair return for their trouble and outlay' is proving a stumbling block to the property development plans on which the company's, and the racecourse's, future depend. High Gosforth Park this month declared a Pounds 21,000 pre-tax loss for 1992, on turnover of Pounds 1.13m. The loss at the operating level was Pounds 62,000. Mr David Parmley, the managing director and clerk of the course, said that over the last decade the company's retained annual profit averaged about Pounds 20,000. Its reserves stood at only Pounds 100,000. Despite its verdant setting and imposing listed buildings, the course, which offers the only grade one racing between York and Ayr, is being run on a shoestring. Essential maintenance bills are a constant worry. 'It's clear to anybody if this company doesn't get a lot of money quickly it's down the pan,' said Mr Parmley. Only five of Britain's 59 racecourses were making money from horse racing, he added. Many made ends meet by car boot sales and land development. High Gosforth Park argued at a public inquiry last year for planning permission for housing and office development on several pockets of its land. Sale of sites with planning permission would raise about Pounds 4.4m, which it has pledged to plough back into improvements to course facilities and refurbishment of its listed buildings. The inquiry inspector recommended approval for nearly all the plans. But in May Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, indicated he was minded to reject the housing and offices, while supporting other elements. The company was invited to comment. It is now hoping his successor, Mr John Gummer, may accept its arguments for green belt development. Without it, the future for Gosforth Park, ranked 12th and 14th respectively on the levy board's flat and jump merit tables, was very bleak, said Mr Parmley. Its quoted status, unusual in British horse racing, is of little assistance. A rights issue would be 'nonsensical', he said, given that the shares, quoted at Pounds 35 each, passed the 1992 dividend and paid only 15p the year before. Trading in the 90,960 issued shares is moribund. The company has support, including sponsorship, from substantial regional companies. The non-executive directors of High Gosforth Park include several of the north east of England's great and good. Scottish &amp; Newcastle is putting up Pounds 35,000 of the guaranteed Pounds 100,000 prize money for today's Plate, the 150th time the race has been run. Back in 1833, when it was first held before moving to Gosforth Park, Northumberland and Newcastle teemed with miners. Now, just one deep mine, Ellington, clings on. Mr Parmley has to hope the Plate will outlive the pitmen.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLONEL 'MANAGED' NEWS, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> A Pentagon report released Tuesday said that the Air Force colonel who resigned  last week as editor of the Pacific Stars and Stripes newspaper violated  military regulations by manipulating the paper's news content.  </P> <P> Col. Edwin J. Montgomery resigned Friday, citing the report by ombudsman Philip  Foisie.  </P> <P> The Defense Department hired Foisie last year to assess the flow of information  to the military readership of the Toyko-based Pacific Stars and Stripes and its  European sister publication based near Frankfurt, West Germany.  </P> <P> Montgomery had said he was disappointed that Foisie viewed his editing  practices as "news management" but was pleased he had not been accused of  censorship.  </P> <P> In his report, Foisie said that the editing process at Pacific Stars and  Stripes under Montgomery was "seriously flawed" but that there was no  censorship in the sense of readers being systematically deprived of any  specific type of news.  </P> <P> "In my professional judgment, Col. Montgomery has too often infringed on the  common practice of good journalism," Foisie wrote.  </P></p>

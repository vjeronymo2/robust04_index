			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Dunhill warns on currency A PROFITS warning from Dunhill Holdings and the cost of the luxury goods group's foreign exchange policies yesterday cast a small shadow over the corporate restructuring proposed by Richemont of Switzerland. Richemont, controlled by the Rupert family of South Africa, wants to split off the group's tobacco arm, Rothmans International, and combine its two luxury goods businesses, Luxco and Dunhill, into Vendome. Dunhill is at present a 57 per cent owned subsidiary of Rothmans. Dunhill said that because 95 per cent of its business arose outside the UK, it hedged future income up to 30 months ahead. Recent currency movements - notably the strengthening of the yen - meant its sterling profits for 1993-94 and 1994-95 would be Pounds 19m and Pounds 13m lower than without the hedging. Operating profits were also likely to fall this year because of the drop in Japanese consumer spending, weakening economies in Germany, Italy and Spain, and only hesitant recoveries in the US and UK.

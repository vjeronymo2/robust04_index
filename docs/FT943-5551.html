			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Russia plans big shake-up of tax system Russia yesterday announced a new tax structure to try to beat massive tax evasion and to maintain government revenue in the face of falling production. Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, deputy finance minister, said tax revenues to July were only half the forecast amount and were expected to reach less than 45 per cent of forecasts for the year as a whole. At the same time, a report on Russia's short-term financial outlook, by Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, showed that government expenditure was slashed in the first half of the year. Spending on law enforcement agencies was cut by 8 per cent, defence spending by 25 per cent, capital investment by 35 per cent and support for the northern (Arctic) territories cut by nearly half. Mr Aleksashenko said tax evasion, numerous ad hoc tax privileges and falling industrial production had all contributed to the tax shortfall. Gross national product had stabilised, because of the sharp rise in the output of the services sector - which has seen services output outstrip industrial production. But industrial production was running at 76 per cent of last year's levels for the first six months of the year, he said, and the bulk of tax revenue has traditionally come from industry. In an effort to raise tax income, the government intends to raise those taxes which are more effectively governed, and ease the tax burden on industry. The finance ministry proposes to cut profit tax from 38 to 34 per cent and VAT on staple items from 20 to 10 per cent. It also plans to raise the top rate of income tax on 'super incomes' from 30 to 40 per cent, introduce a new federal income tax of 5 per cent and raise the property tax paid by businesses from 2 to 3 per cent. These measures will be put to the parliament in the next two weeks. However, almost a third of the shortfall was due to the much more rapid fall in inflation than the government had forecast at the beginning of the year, said Mr Aleksashenko. Nonetheless, the government plans to continue its squeeze on inflation next year, said Mr Dubinin's report. It aims to cut inflation to 5 per cent a month by the middle of 1995 and to 2.5-3 per cent a month by the end of the year - even at the cost of a forecast 7 per cent fall in next year's GNP. The report predicts that the fall in output should stabilise by the end of 1995, however, and that a 'significant rise in private domestic and foreign investment in the Russian economy should take place'. The government also announced yesterday that new bank regulations had been put in place this week by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, which would allow the bank to assign an administrator to commercial banks, or other financial institutions, deemed to be trading illegally or in a 'hopeless' financial situation. The new measures follow widespread anxiety over the lack of effective regulation of financial institutions following the collapse of the MMM financial empire - built up through the promotion of high yielding 'shares' apparently backed only by continued new purchases.</p>

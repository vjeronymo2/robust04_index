			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Australia power plant problem A proposed ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) private power station in Western Australia is in jeopardy after the state government indicated it would not accept electricity prices proposed by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish engineering group, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. ABB was commissioned in June by the West Australia State Energy Commission (SEC) to build and run Australia's first privately-owned and funded power station. But the project depends on final agreement between ABB and the SEC. Mrs Carmen Lawrence, Labor premier, has said the government would reject any contract with ABB raising energy prices or exposing the state to commercial risk.</p>

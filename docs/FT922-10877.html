			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: Policing accounts Sir, Can it come as any surprise that such a large percentage of British companies neglect to file their accounts within the time limits set by the Companies Act if less than 1 per cent of company directors responsible for such lateness are actually prosecuted? ('Late accounts levies expected to hit 15 per cent of UK companies', April 22) Although this particular failure to apply company law is at last being rectified by the imposition of automatic levies on defaulters, the reluctance of the Department of Trade and Industry to apply the law does not stop there, since Companies House shows little vigilance in monitoring whether the content of the accounts it receives comply with company law. Companies House only acts after the horse has bolted, usually when a company has actually failed and creditors face substantial losses. The amount of money that innocent creditors could be saved by effective supervision of company law is positively mind boggling. The shortcomings of the DTI in overseeing company law have reached legendary status. It is time that the job was handed over to the police. Nigel Wilkins, 8 Petersham House, Harrington Road, London SW7 3HD</p>

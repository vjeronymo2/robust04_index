			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal requirements, must be followed for projects in which Federal funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements could make the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee to make certain that no Federal requirements are circumvented thereby. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding the environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should contact the appropriate regional office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before an applicant may incur costs either for activities expected to be funded by Bus or New Start funds, or for activities requiring funding beyond fiscal year 1997, it must first obtain a written LONP from the FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee must submit a written request accompanied by adequate information and justification to the appropriate FTA regional office. FTA will consider the request in light of its ``Letter of No Prejudice Policy'' (47 FR 46956, October 21, 1982).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> XIV. Electronic Grant Making and Management (EGMM) Initiative_Fiscal Year 1995 and Beyond <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the National Performance Review and the FTA strategic planning process, the FTA has two initiatives designed to improve customer service and efficiency of program delivery: (1) On-Line Grantee Program_available to all grantee agencies which can access the FTA Grants Management Information System (GMIS) mainframe computer system via a toll free phone connection. This program was initially designed for ``inquiry only'' purposes. However, this program will be expanded on a case-by-case basis to allow grantees to make annual certifications and assurances through GMIS and conduct required quarterly financial status and narrative grant progress reporting. (2) Electronic Grant Making and Management Pilot Program_participation in the fiscal year 1995 pilot program is limited to the 21 grantee agencies (including Greater Hartford Transit District, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Baltimore Mass Transit Administration, Lehigh and North Hampton Transit Authority, City of Montgomery Area Transit System, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Chicago Transit Authority, Central Ohio Transit Authority, Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Harris County, New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, Bi-State Development Agency_St. Louis, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, Montana Department of Transportation, Denver Regional Transportation District, City and County of San Francisco_Public Utilities Commission, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, King County Department of Metropolitan Services, Washington State Department of Transportation, and National Easter Seal Society). During the pilot program (October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995) these grantees will apply for and manage grants at their computer stations connected to the FTA GMIS computer using a modem and toll free phone connection. The purpose of this initiative is to streamline the FTA grant making and management process through a paperless electronic grant application, review, approval, acceptance and management process. DOL has agreed to participate in the program and receive requests for Labor Protection Certification under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b) of projects as well as issue Labor Protection Certifications electronically for the EGMM Pilot Program participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa firmed up his  intention on 19 February to go ahead with cabinet reshuffle,  which is a focal point of the political situation, at the end of  February. He will start making a full-fledged effort to iron out  differences of opinions among the ruling coalition parties early  next week. However, members of the ruling parties think that it  is likely that the cabinet will be reshuffled around 28 February  because some members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] are beginning to say that an early cabinet reshuffle is  unavoidable. In addition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, whose fate as chief cabinet secretary has become a  focal point of the cabinet reshuffle, disclosed his intention on  19 February to abide by the prime minister's final decision.  However, it is expected that the SDPJ and other parties will  oppose the idea of having a cabinet reshuffle before reaching a  conclusion on revision of the political reform bills. It is  certain that the conclusion will be delayed until next month.  Therefore, the prime minister is assuming the stand of making  the final decision on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle while  carefully observing the outcome of the coordination-making  process within the ruling parties.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, in his speech delivered in  Nagoya on 19 February, commented on the issue of a cabinet  reshuffle, saying: "Generally speaking, we are not in a  situation of reshuffling the cabinet because we just started  deliberations on economic matters and the budget issue." He  also said: "It is up to the prime minister to decide to  reshuffle his cabinet. I am a party representative and I will  express my opinion whenever necessary. Fundamentally, I will do  my best to support the Hosokawa administration. I am not in the  position of clinging to the post of the chief cabinet secretary  or being reluctant to give it up." In this way, he explained  his intention to abide by the prime minister's decision.    As for the scale of the reshuffle, the prime minister  initially wanted to minimize it by removing Takemura from the  post of chief cabinet secretary and assigning him to another  cabinet post. However, due to strong opposition from the SDPJ  and Sakigake [Harbinger], he plans to make a medium-scale  cabinet reshuffle to lessen the impression that it is designed  to "dump Takemura."    In addition to Takemura's case, personnel reshuffle of  officials in charge of political reform -- whose remaining tasks  are to revise the political reform bills and to draw up bills  for division of single-seat constituencies -- and the  possibility of appointing SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to a  cabinet post will be the focal points of the cabinet reshuffle.  Among the ruling parties, the SDPJ is the only party whose  chairman is not a cabinet member.</p>

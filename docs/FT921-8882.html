			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Governor plays down Emu fears EUROPEAN economic and monetary union need not lead to federalism in the European Community, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night. He underlined, however, that Emu would only work if all sectors of society in participating countries accepted 'the key objective of price stability allied to open, flexible and competitive markets'. Speaking in Oxford, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said monetary union did not have to involve such features as a sizeable EC budget, a European parliament with powers of taxation and the development of more and larger spending departments in Brussels. Such demands - reflected in the latest Commission plans to expand the Community budget by more than a third over the next five years - ignored the benefits of the economic convergence that would have to be achieved in the move towards Emu, he said. Poorer EC members could gain as much from Emu as richer countries, he declared. They would, for example, be able to attract inward investment and benefit from lower interest rates so that 'there should not be inexorable economic pressures making for a federal budget'. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said Britain's policy of delaying its decision on whether to join Emu fully did not put it at a disadvantage in preparing for union. Britain was as well placed as other EC states to qualify for Emu, he said. He warned Euro-sceptics against expecting that Emu would fail to be achieved, as planned, by 1999 at the latest. But he also made clear many problems had to be solved before Emu could function satisfactorily. He warned of possible conflict between the planned independent European Central Bank and governments if they reverted to policies inconsistent with price stability. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

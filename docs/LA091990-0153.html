			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS OPEN COMMODITIES EXCHANGE;  </P> <P> REFORMS: A WIDE RANGE OF ITEMS, INCLUDING SOUGHT-AFTER IBM COMPUTERS, ARE  TRADED.  </P> <P> A small crowd of Soviet businessmen, struggling to master the art of  Western-style market capitalism, began trading today at the first commodities  exchange to open here since the Bolshevik Revolution.  </P> <P> For two hours, about 200 businessmen representing cooperatives and state-owned  enterprises bought and sold commodities ranging from construction materials to  paint brushes and computer software.  </P> <P> It was run like an auction. Two men perched on a podium shouted prices as the  traders standing below timidly raised their hands to bid for the commodities.  </P> <P> "We would like to operate like the Chicago commodities exchange," said Gennady  Poleshuk, co-chairman of the Moscow exchange. "But we are starting from the  beginning. We are 200 years behind."  </P> <P> Among the first items on the block were prestigious U.S.-made IBM computers  that sold for tens of thousands of rubles.  </P> <P> The Moscow exchange -- the boldest attempt yet to steer the country toward a  market-driven system -- opened amid heated debate in the Soviet Parliament over  a radical plan to transform the moribund economy and public pressure for the  government to take drastic measures.  </P> <P> Managers of state enterprises that exceed their production quotas are permitted  to sell goods at the commodities exchange, while cooperatives are allowed to  sell goods outright.  </P> <P> "This exchange allows us to learn what prices the market will bear," said  Alexander Belyaev, a cooperative owner.  </P> <P> "In the Soviet Union, it is difficult to get information about prices. Here,  the price is set according to what someone will pay for it," he said.  </P> <P> The exchange initially will operate once every two weeks and then open one day  a week beginning in October, officials said. To engage in trading, participants  are required to put up 100 rubles ($177).  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Greek economy post filled Mr Yannos Papantoniou, 45, a British-trained economist, yesterday took over as Greece's economy minister, following the death of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas. His appointment signalled that there will be no tightening of economic policy, despite European Commission calls for immediate spending cuts to reduce the public sector deficit. This year's government borrowing requirement is projected at more than 17 per cent of gross domestic product, against a budget target of 12.8 per cent. A technocrat with few close friends in the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Mr Papantoniou lacks the authority to impose overdue but unpopular measures, such as freezing recruitment in the public sector. He could also face problems launching the flotation of OTE, the state telecoms company.</p>

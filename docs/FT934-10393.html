			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Sandner in Globex initiative MR JACK Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yesterday tried to gain the initiative in the struggle for control of Globex, the troubled electronic futures system. He suggested that Globex be governed by a 'consortium' of exchanges, each with an equal voice in the system's affairs. Under his proposal, the CME and the Chicago Board of Trade - the world's largest futures exchanges - would give up their management of the system, which was developed jointly with the UK-based news and information group Reuters. But he rejected the idea that Reuters should run Globex as a utility. If agreement is not reached before April, Reuters is widely expected to strip control from the Chicago exchanges when their contract comes up for renewal. The plan addresses issues that have kept Liffe, London's futures exchange, from participating in Globex, and threaten to drive the Matif, the French futures exchange, off the system. Disputes between the three Globex partners have hampered the system's international expansion, leading to losses for Reuters, Globex's largest investor. The CME's face-saving proposal was given a non-committal welcome by the other players, who said they had not discussed details with Mr Sandner. Any change would have to be palatable to Liffe, whose volume is sorely needed to revive the system, and to the Matif, which currently generates 85 per cent of Globex's volume. 'It sounds very interesting, but we need to study the detail,' said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive. Reuters would study all proposals. It is not surprising that the CME is attempting to broker an end to Globex disputes. Unike the world's other main futures exchanges, the CME depends solely on Globex for after-hours trading, and would be at a competitive disadvantage without it. The 20-point CME plan provides a means for dispute arbitration; forbids Reuters from negotiating with exchanges not party to the consortium; and shortens exchanges' commitments to Globex to three years. It sets technical performance standards for Reuters and removes a requirement that the exchanges pay several million dollars per year to Reuters if they fail to sell their quota of Globex terminals.</p>

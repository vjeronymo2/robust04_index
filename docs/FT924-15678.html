			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycled aluminium contract looks like a winner - The launch next week of the London Metal Exchange's latest trading product TRADERS ARE already making money from the London Metal Exchange's new secondary (or recycled) aluminium alloy contract even though it will not be launched officially until next Tuesday. 'Interest is very high. We have traded many thousands of tonnes,' says Mr Hans Murmann, joint managing director of Metallgesellschaft's London subsidiary. 'It seems the contract is coming at the right time. Secondary aluminium smelters are losing money because of the poor state of the economy and they are pleased to let the LME have metal for ready cash.' Smelters were always expected to be the new contract's best hope of success. They buy scrap metal and have to pay for it by the end of the month. They sell their aluminium alloy (which contains some copper or zinc) to consumers who should pay within 60 days but in present economic conditions frequently keep suppliers waiting for 90 days. The new LME contract enables the smelters to hedge against movements in both aluminium scrap and secondary aluminium alloy prices. They can lock in firm future prices for both. Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, suggests that this is one of the new contract's main attractions. The LME's primary aluminium contract cannot meet this need because primary and secondary aluminium prices sometimes move in opposite directions, making hedging of secondary metal on the primary market impossible. Until now, because there was no way of securing forward prices for scrap sales, merchants tended to release aluminium scrap when prices were high and hoard it when prices were low. 'This creates an apparent boom-bust-boom cycle in scrap supply which is actually driven not by the availability of scrap but by spot prices,' Mr Abbott suggests. The fact that several companies have been unofficially trading the new contract well before the launch date is not the only indication that the LME might have a winner on its hands. Already 47 alloy brands have been registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes of material. The brands are based on three grades that represent the basic - or in the words of one trader, the 'bog standard' - diecasting alloy specifications in Japan, Europe and the US, the three main consuming regions. Although the three chosen grades vary slightly, they are designed for the same function - automotive diecasting - and consequently in practice there is little difference in their prices. All this is a far cry from the situation when the LME launched its primary aluminium and nickel contracts in 1978 and 1979 respectively. Then there was fierce opposition because alternative pricing systems were in place and the industries were nervous about speculators and financial institutions possibly disrupting the market. It took years for aluminium and nickel producers who opposed the contracts to be won over. They certainly did not offer their brands for registration. The LME simply gave its approval to suitable brands even though they were not offered. But the launch of the secondary aluminium alloy contract has not been all plain sailing. 'It would be wrong to say that the launch of the new contract was accepted with enthusiasm in all circles,' Mr Abbott admits. 'However, the general tone of response from the industry has been constructive.' There were times when the opposition was openly hostile. One US alloy producer said: 'It will open the market up to speculators and gamblers which is not in our best interests. It's just a move by the LME to try to sell more products and there is no real industry need and very limited support for it'. The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners Association formally condemned the idea on several occasions. Yet individual members of these organisations are now flocking to have their brands registered for trading on the new LME market. That is understandable, according to Mr Hajime Myoi, director of the Japan Metal Centre in London. 'It's as if someone wants to build a pub next to your house. You fight hard to prevent the pub being built, but when it has been built you become a regular customer.' The LME has already authorised 12 warehouses to store the secondary aluminium alloy in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. It is listing only warehouses that have available, where necessary, temperature and humidity control equipment, which can be used to reduce the onset of oxidation of the metal. This continues to be a contentious issue. Some suggest the alloy oxidises in a few days. Others insist it is not a problem. Metallgesellschaft's Mr Murmann says, for example: 'I saw some 226 which, for a good reason, had been in a warehouse in Germany for six years and it was like new.' Mr Abbott at the LME points out that the same aluminium alloy that is accepted by the LME is used for such things as car engine blocks. He says: 'These blocks seem to last for the whole life of a car without any particular protection,' he says. However, there is a problem because an alloy ingot that has an oxide layer may contain moisture in the oxide and this moisture would cause an explosion if it was introduced to the remelt furnace at a diecaster's plant. He adds: 'The problem, is not one of quality but of handling. The diecaster taking delivery of ingot with oxidation will have to dry the material prior to melting. This is usually done by stacking the ingot next to the furnace before melting.' Mr Abbott says there were three important criteria which were used to determine whether the new contract was needed: There had to be good liquidity, a small-volume commodity could not be considered. The market had to have the support of participants - both producers and consumers. There had to be a need in the market for a representative price and the industry had to be exposed to risk, have the need to control the risk and therefore a need for hedging. The LME insists that all its contracts must be deliverable - in other words it must be assumed that physical metal will be delivered - and the secondary aluminium contract is no different. However, the new contract meets the volume criterion because, as Mr Abbott points out, there is about 4m tonnes of scrap required to make about 4.5m tonnes of alloy. That compares with about 7m tonnes of scrap and primary copper that underpins the LME's 'flagship' copper contract. Mr Abbott expects the new contract to be used by the automotive industry as well as smelters. Diecasters, who buy aluminium ingot from the smelters and turn it into components for the car industry, are less likely to be users. They tend to be small companies and the contract calls for deals to be done in substantial (20-tonne) lots. Some traders suggest the new contract will have a profound impact on secondary aluminium alloy prices and the way aluminium castings are priced. They suggest that the Japanese and German secondary aluminium producers are hostile to the contract because it threatens the price cartels alleged to exist in those countries. The Japan Aluminium Alloy Association sees things differently and explains that, unlike secondary smelters in the UK and elsewhere, Japanese producers have customers lined up for all their production on a long-term basis. None of it gets to the free market. In the UK, diecasters are said routinely to buy metal at a Pounds 150 a tonne discount to the price quoted in Metal Bulletin magazine, which is used industry-wide, but then to charge the full MB price to their automotive industry customers. Mr Ken Lee, secretary of the UK Light Metal Founders Association, points out that the LME price will be for an LME-deliverable material in an LME warehouse, a material which is not of British but of German standard and is for one type of alloy for one type of process. However, a whole range of alloys is used in the UK and a whole range of processes; and the more special the metal required, the bigger the premium which has to be paid. 'So the LME price will only be a marker.' Nevertheless, Mr David Harris, secretary-general of the UK Aluminium Federation, suggests: 'This is a major watershed for the pricing of aluminium ingot and castings. And if it makes aluminium castings more competitive with other materials, it is to the industry's advantage'.</p>

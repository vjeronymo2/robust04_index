			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US floods wash up winners as well as losers - While some farmers' crops were devastated others flourished Farmers are always subject to the vagaries of weather, but this year in the US mother nature was more fickle than usual, flooding grain crops in the midwest and visiting drought on the south-east. Within the affected areas neighbours had sharply different fates: a farmer on high ground in Iowa could boast a record maize crop while his lowland colleague was wiped out by a swollen river. 'There was a real dichotomy of winners and losers. That is the real outcome of a year like this one,' says Mr Alan Barkema, agricultural economist with the Kansas City Federal Reserve. The harsh weather reduced the US maize harvest, the largest crop in the US, to 6.4bn bushels (162m tonnes), 30 per cent below the record 1992 harvest. Soyabean production dropped 19 per cent, to 1.8bn bushels, according the the US Department of Agriculture's latest estimates. The harvest shortfall leaves the US with just enough feedgrains to meet this year's domestic and export needs, and very little carryover to cushion any problems with the 1994 harvest. While analysts are busy counting bushels and fretting over grain supplies, farmers who escaped disaster are enjoying their best year ever. Net farm income is forecast to rise to a record Dollars 59bn in 1993, and thanks to the drawdown in grain stocks, the government is asking grain farmers to plant fencepost-to-fencepost next year, eliminating acreage set-aside programmes for the first time since supply-management farm programmes were initiated in 1981. As a result, Mr Bob McElroy, a financial analyst with the Agriculture Department, estimates that net cash farm income in 1994 will be very close to the 1993 record. The three-year streak of farm prosperity, he explains, stems from the boom-and-bust nature of the crop sequences. The 1992 maize harvest was huge, giving farmers more grain to sell, but at low prices. As crop conditions worsened in the first half of this year, grain prices rose, allowing farmers to market stocks at high prices. Mr McElroy, like many other analysts, expects prices to remain firm through the first half of 1994, benefitting farmers who still have grain to sell. In addition, the Dollars 2.5bn in disaster relief payments authorised for farmers by congress have begun to trickle into farm communities, partly offsetting the estimated Dollars 5bn in crop losses suffered this year. With more land coming into production next year (some 80m acres will be planted to maize) and with ample moisture remaining in midwestern soils, there is a chance for a bumper harvest next summer. However, a good crop is far from certain. Agronomists say the after-effects of flood-drifted soil, soggy fields and disabled equipment could delay spring plantings along midwestern rivers and provide enough uncertainty to continue to support world grain prices. In the meantime, seed and fertiliser producers are gearing up for a busy spring and farmers who have reaped profits are becoming re-acquainted with their tractor and combine harvester dealers. US tractor sales were up 9 per cent in the year to October and the nation's top tractor makers - Deere and Company and the JI Case division of Tenneco - have boosted production in the fourth quarter. Deere reported fourth quarter profits of Dollars 103.5m this week, up from Dollars 4.2m last year, with a large portion of the improvement coming from North American sales of agricultural equipment. Case expects to have Dollars 1.6bn in agricultural sales in the US this year. Mr Tom Reynolds, an economist at Deere, is cautious in his forecasts. He thinks low interest rates, increased income, and to some extent, increased confidence in the farm outlook have helped equipment sales. He says, however: 'It is hard for me to say we'll see the start of a boom in farm equipment sales. I think we'll see a small improvement, not a boom'. Other measures of the farm economy - land values and farm debt - also indicate that US agriculture is in a period of slow but solid growth. Land values have been rising 2.5 to 3.5 per cent a year, in step with the overall growth of the US economy. US farm debt, which peaked at Dollars 194bn in the depths of the farm recession in 1984, has subsided to Dollars 138bn. Farmers have been slow to take on new debt this year, an indication that they also are not expecting an agricultural boom. Although grain and soyabean stocks are historically low, and prices are high, producers are aware that, even if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations are concluded successfully, world agricultural trade is not going to recover soon. High soyabean prices have already inspired record plantings in Argentina and Brazil, and those crops will compete with US supplies on world markets. The former Soviet Union, the US's best grain customer two years ago, is still suffering credit problems, while China, its second-biggest customer, is reducing wheat imports. Overall, the US Deparment of Agriculture forecasts that feedgrain exports will drop to 1.35bn bushels in the 1994 fiscal year, down 15 per cent from 1993 and well below the peak of 2.2bn.</p>

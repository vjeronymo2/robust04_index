			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "Opponents of a Chemical </F> Weapons Ban Resort to Old Methods"]    [Text] Almost 18 months have now elapsed since the  international Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,  Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and Their  Destruction was opened for signing. Since then representatives  of approximately 160 countries have already signed this document.    Work on the convention lasted almost a quarter-century. Very  complex problems were encountered. Although only three states  -- the United States, Russia, and Iraq -- officially admitted  that they possessed chemical weapons, in fact 20-25 countries  had them. Also, until recently the political climate was not  disposed to the adoption of an agreement that would have been  acceptable to all.    In the final analysis, however, such a document was  elaborated. It prohibits everywhere the acquisition,  development, production, sale, or use of chemical weapons. All  stocks and also production capacities must be destroyed within  10 years of the convention's entry into force. Provision is  made for monitoring of national chemical industry installations  and for appropriate inspections to be conducted on a permanent  basis, as well as inspections on demand, when any country is  obliged to give foreign observers access to installations which  have come under suspicion.    According to the terms of the convention, it will come into  force once ratified by 65 participant states. This is expected  to happen next year. At present, however, the ratification  process is proceeding slowly. Just five countries have  confirmed in legislation their adhesion to this act of  international law. It is perfectly obvious that the majority of  countries are waiting for it to be ratified by Russia and the  United States.    In Russia the State Duma has now begun examining the  convention, and preparations are under way to ratify it. The  document is also being discussed in the U.S. Senate. Hearings  on ratification of the chemical weapons convention were held  recently in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The  Administration's representatives at the hearings -- James  Woolsey, director of the CIA; General John Shalikashvili,  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and John Holum, director  of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- pointed out that  this international document, which prohibits an entire class of  mass destruction weapons, meets U.S. national security interests.    On the whole the senators listened favorably to the  Administration representatives. But it is no secret that there  are also opponents of the convention in the United States. It  can hardly be considered a coincidence that on the eve of the  hearings the U.S. press launched a new campaign of accusations  against Russia, which is allegedly "concealing its efforts" to  develop the latest types of chemical weapons, including binary  weapons.    THE NEW YORK TIMES has shown special zeal. It has repeatedly  addressed this topic in the past few days. At the same time,  not possessing any facts, since none exists, it has returned to  the long-refuted "revelations" of the Russian chemical scientist  Vil Mirzayanov in his sensational interview with THE BOSTON  GLOBE. True, in passing, it made the reservation that "some of  his frightening statements elicit a skeptical attitude." But  this was only a reservation.    As far as it is possible to judge, the majority of U.S.  congressmen still incline toward ratifying the convention. The  speediest positive examination of this problem in our State Duma  would obviously make a favorable impression on them. Although  it would be perfectly legitimate to put the question this way:  Ratification of the convention on chemical weapons in the U.S.  Senate would also prompt Russian legislators to make such a  decision.</p>

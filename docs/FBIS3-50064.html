Zebic said the government on Sunday  adopted the last in a series of measures necessary for launching  the economic reform programme which would primarily focus on  curbing hyperinflation. The programme for slashing the monster  inflation whose monthly rate reached one million percent last  December starts with the issuing of the new convertible dinar  with 100-percent gold and hard currency backing.    Other measures include a radical reduction of the primary  issue and an increase in production geared for the market made  almost non-existent after many companies withdrew their products  from the market because of hyperinflation.    Economic expert Dragoslav Avramovic, the chief architect of  Yugoslavia's stabilization programme, said that the package did  not envisage wage or price freezes and that the state could opt  for such measures only in a very limited number of cases.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / People: Taking off from Manchester One of the best jobs in the air transport business has become vacant as Gil Thompson, chief executive of Manchester Airport, yesterday told his board he wants to retire. His contract comes up for renewal in March, when he will be 63. Thompson, a former British Airways general manager for northern England, has had 12 remarkable years at Manchester, presiding over an increase in passengers from 4m to 12.4m a year, making it Europe's fastest growing airport. On the way, Manchester became Britain's second official hub after Heathrow and achieved international gateway status. It is now used by 95 airlines flying to 165 destinations. At the beginning of March, the Queen is due to open the first stage of Manchester's Pounds 570m Terminal Two, Thompson's piece de resistance. Combined eventually with a second runway, the new terminal will enable the airport to leap four places to 12th in the world league table by size. Thompson says the next great step forward - which envisages 30m passengers a year and 50,000 new jobs locally by 2005 - should be placed in younger hands. Among other things, a bruising battle looms with Cheshire residents opposing a second runway and further expansion generally. The board yesterday formed a sub-committee, Thompson included, to consider how to pick his successor. He will stay on long enough to achieve a smooth handover - and will be lodging the planning application for the second runway in the spring. ***** Bill Caskey, formerly vice-president sales, food service in the US, has been appointed retail sales and marketing director for CAMPBELL FROZEN FOODS. ***** Kevin Wilson has been appointed group md of WAGON INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS; Mel Bailey has been appointed md of the material handling and storage division; Bill Hall is appointed md of the automotive products division; and Neil Hannah as md of Wagon Storage Systems. Don Poyner will become a non-executive director as from the end of March. ***** Jonathan Smith has been promoted to the main board of KWIK SAVE GROUP. ***** Mike Elms, formerly md of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, has been appointed chief executive of CIA UK HOLDINGS, and a director of the CIA GROUP. ***** Paul Russell, chairman of SONY Music Entertainment UK, has been appointed president of Europe Sony Music Entertainment; he is succeeded by Paul Burger, president of Sony Music Canada. ***** Richard Medus, md of Meridian, part of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, has been appointed MILLS &amp; ALLEN's agency and client sales manager. ***** Michael Neame, formerly marketing director of KDG Mobrey, has been appointed md of PEEK Measurement. ***** Miguel Escobar, president and director general of Prosema Organizacion de Ferias, acquired by BLENHEIM GROUP, and Michael Fletcher, md of Blenheim's UK operations, have been appointed to Blenheim's board. ***** John Goldring has been promoted to technical director of Tooling Products, part of WEIR GROUP. ***** Hew Stevenson, chief executive of Westminster Press, part of PEARSON, is also to become chairman when the Duke of Atholl retires in June. ***** Richard Gibbons has been appointed development director of London Adshel for MORE O'FERRALL ADSHEL; he moves from JC Decaux. ***** Alan Williams, formerly deputy md of Hays Storage Services, has been appointed md of Rentacrate, also part of HAYS in succession to George Sutherland who is moving within the group. ***** INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, has appointed its first non-executive directors since Sir David Plastow took over as chairman in September. They are (left) Tony Alexander, 54, chief operating officer UK of Hanson, and (right) Liam Strong, 48, chief executive of Sears. Alexander joined Hanson as company secretary in 1971 and went to the board five years later. He is also a non-executive director of Shanks &amp; McEwan. Strong joined Sears from British Airways in 1991 and was appointed chief executive last February. The leadership of Inchcape has changed markedly since ill-health caused the early retirement at the end of 1991 of Sir George Turnbull, the group's forceful chairman and chief executive, who died last month. Charles Mackay stepped in to become chief executive, as previously agreed, and deputy chairman Sir David Orr acted as chairman until the arrival of Plastow from Vickers.</p>

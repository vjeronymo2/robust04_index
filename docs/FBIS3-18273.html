			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Marcovici: "Diplomatic Initiatives"] </F>   [Text] The beginning of a Serb withdrawal around Sarajevo  reassures the NATO countries--notably those with ground troops  in Bosnia--who thus see the prospect of air strikes recede. Of  course, this withdrawal remains to be confirmed and the alliance  continues to display the same determination. If guns were still  to threaten Sarajevo, planes would fly at the expiration of the  ultimatum. Nonetheless, everyone hopes that things will not go  that far.    This is why Russia's pressure on the Serb forces was greeted  unanimously like a victory of Russian diplomacy. However, this  is going a little too fast.    Since the NATO ultimatum, the Russians have done everything  in their power to avoid a strike on their Serb friends. They  have threatened, going as far as brandishing the specter of a  world conflict; they have used dilatory maneuvers in an attempt  to disempower NATO to the benefit of the UN; they have  negotiated by multiplying contacts with Western embassies. These  efforts were all in vain and did not shake the West's resolve.  The Russians had but one avenue left: convince the Serbs to  adhere to the conditions of the ultimatum. This is what Moscow  did, and this is where the success of its diplomacy stops. It  must be admitted that it is modest.    On the other hand, the policy conducted by the French  Government scores some points. Paris has been repeating for  months that to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian  issue, it is imperative to have the cooperation of the United  States and Russia. However, these countries to date had refused  to do so. Washington did not want to pressure the Muslims, just  like Moscow refused to pressure the Serbs. The French  determination following the Sarajevo massacre compelled the  Americans to join forces with France in NATO and to reconsider  their relations with the Muslims. Thus created, the  Franco-American front led Russia to participate in the  diplomatic process and pressure the Serbs.    If this new element, derived from the French initiative,  produces results and renders useless NATO air strikes now that  the stranglehold on Sarajevo has loosened, France will have won  an important diplomatic success. On condition, however, that  taking advantage of the opportunity, Muslims do not decide to  fill the void left by the Serbs and raise too high the stakes in  the peace negotiations that could start as early as next week.</p>

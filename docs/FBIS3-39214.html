			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zheliu Zhelev, president of the Republic of </F> Bulgaria, by Edouard Van Velthem in Brussels; date not given:  "On NATO and Balkan Security"]    [Text] [Van Velthem] You have come to Brussels to sign the  Partnership for Peace which NATO is offering to the countries of  East Europe. Some of these countries -- Poland in particular --  have made no secret of their disappointment at the timidity of  this initiative. Do you believe that this cooperation goes far  enough or were you expecting more from the Atlantic alliance?    [Zhelev] From the point of view of Bulgaria's national  security, you cannot say that this initiative goes very far.  Despite the statements by its senior officials on joint  security, NATO gives no guarantees to the countries which adhere  to this Partnership. It would be a different situation if we  could institutionalize this process.    However, this program does show NATO's desire to encourage  the emergence of an open democratic system from which nobody is  excluded. NATO -- and this is very positive -- has refused to  divide the countries into different categories, such as the  Visegrad group, the Balkan states, or the Baltic states. The  Partnership gives an equal chance to all and allows each country  to commit itself to the extent that its financial and moral  resources will allow. It is a very realistic approach and it  permits the necessary double adaptation: By the candidates  prior to their final membership, and by NATO which must change  from a military bloc facing an indistinct enemy into a  collective security system, continental and Euro-Atlantic.    [Van Velthem] How do you feel about Moscow's lack of  enthusiasm for the project?    [Zhelev] None of our countries need any longer fear Russian  influence, the age of the Soviet empire is over. We are  independent, sovereign states with an autonomous foreign policy,  and nobody can determine our priorities for us.    [Van Velthem] Doesn't the rise of the ultranationalist  Zhirinovskiy worry you rather more?    [Zhelev] Political developments in Russia itself could be  cause for concern if revanchist elements were to become  dominant, fuelled by reawakened imperialist ambitions which  account for the rise of Zhirinovskiy. We expelled Zhirinovskiy  for what he said in Sofia. This move itself demonstrates the  total independence of our diplomacy, as does the recognition of  Macedonia and Russia as independent states before the break-up  of the USSR -- a move which in fact surprised our Western  partners.    [Van Velthem] What did you say to your NATO hosts concerning  their recent ultimatum addressed to the Serbian forces in Bosnia?    [Zhelev] I see this initiative as remaining within the  framework of measures to achieve a peaceful settlement. It is  the final stage in such a process and I hope the ultimatum will  fully accomplish its role as a warning, without having to be  implemented. The parties involved in the conflict and to whom it  is addressed must clearly understand that NATO, in committing  itself so categorically, cannot now turn back. It is up to them  to make every effort to favor a diplomatic solution to the  crisis.    [Van Velthem] Bulgaria itself is suffering from the embargo  on Serbia....    [Zhelev] This is true, we have suffered enormous financial  losses due to the sanctions. More than the other neighboring  countries -- with the exception of Macedonia -- as Bulgaria is  the most isolated and all gateways to the West must pass through  Serbia. This is why we have raised the matter of compensation,  especially indirect compensation: The reevaluation of our  foreign debt, investment aid, and funding for regional  infrastructure projects in the communications and transport  sectors. In particular the highway linking Istanbul and Sofia,  via Skopje, to Italy. Or the highway between Salonica, Sofia,  and the Bulgarian port of Vidin on the Danube.    [Van Velthem] A motion of censure against the government --  which is accused of slowing down reforms -- has just been  rejected in Sofia. Can Bulgaria afford a political crisis?    [Zhelev] In Central Europe and the Balkans, crisis --  political and economic -- is always with us. It is the price we  must pay for changing from one system to another. But there is  no turning back. We should clearly distinguish between the  restoration of communism, which is excluded, and the return to  power of the former Communists, which is plausible. The  essential thing is to continue with the reforms, the identity of  those charged with the task is of secondary importance. Today,  in East Europe and especially in Bulgaria, the former Communists  of the nomenklatura -- who have money and key positions -- are  becoming genuine capitalists. Sometimes even including certain  groups which tend towards Mafia-like practices.    [Van Velthem] You yourself have been accused of being a  "neo-Communist" by your former friends, who are now in  opposition....    [Zhelev] These are just arbitrary accusations. The only  institution which guarantees stability, democratic change, and  the dismantling of the communist system in Bulgaria is the  presidency of the Republic. You need look no further to  understand why it is criticized from all sides. But my training  in philosophy allows me to remain calm in the face of such  criticism.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: German tool maker files for protection Deckel Maho, the German machine tool group, yesterday filed for protection from its creditors just 12 months after it was formed through the merger of two rival companies. It gave up the struggle after one of its backers refused to take part in a bank-led rescue package. PSV, an incorporated industry association which guarantees member-companies' pension schemes, said it would not take over responsibility for Deckel Maho's total DM45m (Dollars 26.3m) pension commitments. It offered only to pay current retirement benefits for three years. The association, which represents more than 30,000 companies, said earlier this week it had to consider possible future demands on its resources. A life-saving package costing several hundred million D-Marks in written-off debt and new capital, agreed between a banking consortium and Bavarian state financial institutions, was conditional on PSV's full participa-tion. Deutsche Bank, which together with the Bayerische Vereinsbank last year led the supposed rescue-merger project, said yesterday it was trying to find a constructive solution. If Deckel Maho is allowed to collapse, this could bring problems for Gildemeister which has a foreign distribution joint venture with the troubled concern and which in the past has been named as a possible white knight. The group, which is reducing capacity and slimming its workforce from 1,800 to 1,200, made a net loss in the year to mid-1993 of DM45m on sales of DM310m. This week's crisis coincides with the first signs of recovery in the machine tool business. Orders rose in the first quarter of this year for the first time since 1991.</p>

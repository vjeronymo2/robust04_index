			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (10): Farming roots run very deep - Some CAP reforms go right against the grain Where else but France would a Communist deputy (Mr Remy Auchede) representing a heavily industrialised constituency (Pas-de-Calais), stand up in Parliament and declaim that 'rural society is the standard bearer of the great values of solidarity and humanity which make for the coherence and identity of our nation.' Mr Auchede did so this month. But the long-held maxim that what is good for French agriculture is good for France has been put under increasing scrutiny, both by the reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and by the Gatt world trade negotiations. So far as the Gatt is concerned, it is no longer clear to the Balladur government and France's captains of industry - although they remain very wary about voicing their doubts in public - that France can afford to isolate itself in the Gatt (and in the EC) by holding a world trade accord, with potential multi-billion dollar gains to all parties at a time of widespread economic depression, hostage to its agricultural interests. France may not want to see cuts in the EC export subsidy system which has made it the world's biggest agricultural exporter after the US. But farming now accounts for only 2.4 per cent of French gross domestic product, much less than services which a Gatt agreement would help expand. Nor is it any longer axiomatic that the old-style CAP has been 'good' for French agriculture. Certainly its high price supports have provided French farmers with the incentive to increase their productivity by an average of 5 per cent over the past 40 years - with borrowings and investments which have made Credit Agricole France's biggest bank. Exploiting its natural advantages of soil and climate, France has become the EC's one big 'agri-power', with a regular surplus of about FFr50bn a year on its food trade and accounting for nearly a quarter of total EC production. But this has been production for production's sake. With Brussels ready in the past to take unlimited amounts of food into storage and to subsidise the dumping of surpluses on to world markets, farmers generally have not had to bother about consumer demand in the way that other industries must. Now, farmers must re-learn marketing skills which have grown rusty over past decades. The CAP reforms have produced two changes which go right against the grain for French farmers. One is the switch to direct income aids to compensate farmers for cuts in price supports. This has already happened in oilseeds, whose price support was reduced by 40 per cent in 1992 to world levels, though with compensatory direct payments to farmers spread over 1992-93 (which meant that French farm incomes dropped by 7 per cent in 1992). This move to the kind of 'deficiency payments' system which Britain had before it joined the EC - and which the US still has - has made many French farmers feel like 'pensioners of the state'. They were always that under the old CAP, of course, but provision of state aid through price support gave them the illusion they were earning their living from the market. The second change, unwelcome to French farmers proud of their ability to plant up every available hectare and to squeeze every last quintal from it, is the set-aside system. The new general requirement that larger European farms leave fallow 15 per cent of their arable land could lead, according to some French estimates, to some 1.5m hectares coming out of production in France - equal to the total of land under cereal cultivation in Denmark, or 10 times that in the Netherlands. One trend which the CAP reforms seek to reverse is the intensification of farming. The most efficient French farms, in the 200km radius belt around the French capital known as the 'Paris basin', can compete with any in the world. But they do so by using a good deal of fertiliser and pesticides. The value of these intermediate inputs, as a share of total agricultural production, rose from 18.9 per cent in 1950 to 43 per cent in 1990, to the benefit of French companies such as Elf-Aquitaine, which makes fertiliser as a by-product of its oil business, and Rhone-Poulenc, which makes agro-chemicals as well as ordinary chemicals. The reaction of French farmers to set-aside will be to make them all the keener to get the most out of land remaining in cultivation. But environmental concern about 'agri-pollution' may eventually prove a restraint. As for livestock, Brussels is now providing financial incentives to persuade farmers to rear fewer animals on a given area of pasture. There is a widespread fear that the CAP's new restraints on production and the likely Gatt restrictions on subsidised exports will increase the 'desertification' of the French countryside. This is quite possible. The number of individual French farms has dropped from 5m in 1950 to about 1m today, although the total number of people working on the land is higher than 1m. According to the 1988 census, there were 1m farmers, 800,00 family helpers and 156,000 hired hands. Nevertheless, this relatively small section of the population retains an enormous emotional and political hold over its fellow citizens, partly because many town-dwellers have country cottages and partly because so much of the French way of life has its cultural - certainly gastronomic - roots in the countryside. The farm vote, too, is conveniently distributed across the political spectrum. Most farmers vote conservative - which puts the present government under an obligation to them - but some, particularly in the south and south west, have a tradition of voting on the left. As a result, no French politician has wanted to tell the farmers what they do not want to hear. Under international pressure the Balladur government is gradually taking its courage into its own hands - certainly more so than the last centre-right government, which chose the head of the largest farmers' union, FNSEA, to be France's agriculture minister. It has acquiesced in the EC's commitment to the US to restrain Europe's production of oilseeds, although it still remains opposed to export subsidy cuts insisted on by the US. But the French government may be mistaken in thinking that it is doing the farmers a favour by slowing the pace of change for the rest of France's rural community. One of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's first acts was to order a temporary stop to the shutting down of any public service, and to the opening of any big new supermarkets, in the countryside. Certainly everyone living in France's rural communities wants to keep their post offices and public transport. Clearly, too, small shopkeepers will welcome the respite from supermarket competition. But it is questionable whether the government is doing the farmers themselves a service by denying them the same consumer benefits as their city brethren enjoy.</p>

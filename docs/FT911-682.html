			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Director must come to court IN RE SEAGULL MANUFACTURING CO LTD Chancery Division: Mr Justice Mummery: April 30 1991 A DIRECTOR of an insolvent company in compulsory liquidation can be ordered by the court to attend for public examination as to the company's affairs, irrespective of his nationality and notwithstanding that he resides out of the jurisdiction; and, at the court's discretion, he can be served with the public examination order at his foreign residence. Mr Justice Mummery so held when allowing an appeal by the Official Receiver from Mr Registrar Pimm's decision setting aside an order for public examination of Mr Colin John Slinn, director of Seagull Manufacturing Co Ltd, and an order for service of a copy of that order on Mr Slinn in Alderney. HIS LORDSHIP said that Seagull, an English private company, carried on the business of computer utility organisation from a registered office in Dorchester. Mr Slinn was a director from January 27 1986 to July 3 1988 and was the tenant of the Dorchester premises. He did not deny that he was a British subject, but he claimed that from January 1979 until July 1986 he resided and was domiciled in the Isle of Man, and that since July 1986 he had been resident and domiciled in Alderney, Channel Islands. Seagull was being wound up by the court on the ground of public interest, following a Department of Trade and Industry enquiry. It was alleged that Seagull was insolvent. The estimated claims exceeded Pounds 2m. Since April 4 1990, when the compulsory winding-up order was made, the Official Receiver had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Mr Slinn to submit a statement of affairs and to co-operate by providing information required in the winding-up. On July 17 1990, on the application of the Official Receiver, Mr Registrar Buckley (1) ordered Mr Slinn to attend the Royal Courts of Justice on September 25 for public examination; and (2) ordered service of a copy of the public examination order at Mr Slinn's address in Alderney. On September 25 Mr Registrar Pimm set aside both orders on the ground that they were made without jurisdiction, since Mr Slinn was in Alderney at the material time. The Official Receiver appealed on the ground that on their true construction, section 133 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and rule 12.2 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 empowered the court to order attendance of a British subject who had been an officer of an English company in compulsory winding-up, and to give leave to serve a public examination order on him, notwithstanding his residence abroad. Section 133 provided that in a winding-up by the court the Official Receiver might apply for public examination of 'any person who (a) is or has been an officer of the company'. Rule 4.211(1) of the Insolvency Rules provided that after a public examination order was made 'a copy of the court's order shall . . . be served on that person'. Rule 12.12(3) provided that for purposes of insolvency proceedings, the court might order service of process or court order 'on a person who is not in England and Wales'.' Insolvency proceedings' meant any proceedings under the Act or the Rules (rule 13.7). There was a general rule of statutory construction that English legislation was primarily territorial in effect. In applying the territoriality rule the court must enquire as to the person in respect of whom Parliament was legislating. In Clark v Oceanic Contractors (1983) 2 AC 130, 152C Lord Wilberforce formulated the relevant question as 'Who is within the legislative grasp or intendment of the statute under consideration?' In re Tucker (1990) Ch 148 the Court of Appeal held that section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, which empowered the court to require attendance of the debtor or 'any person' for private examination, did not assert a jurisdiction over British subjects resident abroad. Lord Justice Dillon rejected a contention that 'any person' in section 25 meant any person in the world, or any British subject anywhere in the world. Ultimately, however, the question as to who were the persons with respect to whom Parliament was presumed to be legislating must turn on the language, context and purpose of section 133. The 1986 Act provisions for private examination of a bankrupt were in sections 366 and 367. Section 367(3) provided that the court might order examination in or outside the UK of 'any person who if within the jurisdiction would be liable to be summoned under section 366'. In Tucker Lord Justice Dillon said of equivalent wording in section 25(6) of the 1914 Act that it 'carries inevitably the connotation' that if the person was not in England he was not liable to be brought before the court. There was little doubt that on the authority of Tucker sections 366 and 367 were subject to the same territorial qualification as section 25 of the 1914 Act. Sections 236 and 237 of the 1986 Act conferred a similar power to order private examination of a company officer. It was submitted for Mr Slinn that in the light of those provisions it was unlikely that Parliament intended section 133 to apply to a person out of the jurisdiction. The section 133 public examination provisions were not territorially limited in the same way as the private examination provisions of sections 236, 237, 366 and 367. The private examination provisions were different from the section 133 provisions in two important respects. First, the power to summon persons for private examination extended to a much wider class than for public examination. The power to summon for private examination applied not only to any officer of the company or the bankrupt, but also to any person who might have in his possession property of the company or bankrupt, or might be indebted to the company or bankrupt. It even extended to any person who might be able to give information concerning the company or bankrupt. The second important difference was that the private examination sections contained express provisions which conclusively and inevitably connoted that if the person was not in England he was not liable to be brought before the English court. Such provision was conspicuously absent from section 133. It was more appropriate to compare the section 133 provisions with public examination provisions relating to bankrupts, than with private examination provisions. The relevant provisions for public examination of a bankrupt were now contained in section 290 of the 1986 Act. The power to order public examination of the bankrupt was not confined to British subjects or other persons present or resident in England (see definition of 'debtor', section 265). The public examination provisions relating to bankrupts were similar in three respects to the section 133 provisions. First, the court might only order public examination of the bankrupt. Similarly in the case of a winding up, under section 133 the court might only order public examination of a person who had voluntarily participated in a specified capacity in the affairs of the company. Second, the court had no discretion to refuse to direct a public examination in the case of a bankrupt or a winding-up, if the application was duly made in accordance with the relevant sub-section (sections 290(3) and 133(3)). Third, neither the provisions relating to public examination of a bankrupt nor those relating to public examination in a winding-up contained any provision similar to that in section 25(6) of the 1914 Act, now in sections 367(3) and 237(3) of the 1986 Act. Section 133 on its true construction plainly implied that it applied to all who fell within a class of persons specified in section 133(1), whether or not they were British subjects, and whether or not they were within the jurisdiction at the relevant time. Parliament had legislated for public examination of persons who had acted in one capacity or another in relation to the affairs of a company which was either liable to be, or was being, wound up by the English court under English law. One would expect such persons to be 'within the legislative grasp, or intendment' of section 133, whether or not they were in England and whether or not they could be served with a summons in England. The appeal was allowed. Mr Registrar Buckley's orders were restored. For the Official Receiver: Nigel Davis (Treasury solicitor). For Mr Slinn: Robin Hollington (Vance Harris, Crowborough).</p>

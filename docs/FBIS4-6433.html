			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia hopes that countries sending soldiers to  the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be invited to an international summit on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was proposed by Russia. Foreign  Minister Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said it would be  improper for the summit to be attended only by certain  countries. He also called for the summit to be immediately  convened because time is running out. He said Malaysia may show  a positive attitude and hopes that a settlement will be achieved  although it is not so sure about the matter. He was commenting  on reports that U.S. President Bill Clinton had welcomed  President Boris Yeltsin's proposal that a summit on Bosnia-  Herzegovina be held.    Meanwhile, the International Parliamentary Group on Bosnia-  Herzegovina [IPGB] has urged Muslim nations and the Third World  to consider immediate concrete steps to protect that country and  its people. Mr. Kassim Ahmad, member of the IPGB Secretariat,  said the latest developments -- the attack by Serbian terrorists  on the town of Gorazde -- proves that the United Nations no  longer serves as an effective and authoritative international  organization that can maintain the security of its member  nations. In a statement in Penang today, he said the IPGB fully  supported Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's  statement that the United Nations had failed and colluded with  the Serbian terrorists in their efforts to capture Gorazde and  impose a partial and unfair peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

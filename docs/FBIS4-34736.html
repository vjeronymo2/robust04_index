			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Brasilia correspondent Francisco Goncalves] </F>   [Text] Encouraged by the ratification in Congress of the  Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes nuclear weapons in Latin  America and the Caribbean, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has  decided to intensify the Brazilian Government's participation  within international organizations to fight the proliferation of  nuclear weapons. Itamaraty's priority is to expedite the Geneva  talks aimed at achieving a complete ban on nuclear tests.    Itamaraty has instructed the Brazilian negotiators to take  steps to ensure that the treaty addresses the ban on two fronts:  on the one hand, to prohibit countries that still do not have  nuclear weapons from making tests with a view to mastering the  technology; and on the other, to prohibit countries that have  already mastered the technology from making tests to develop new  generations of nuclear weapons.    Heading the group of 21 developing countries at the Geneva  talks, the Brazilian Government believes the treaty on the ban  of nuclear tests will be concluded early in 1995. Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim said: "We hope the stumbling blocks  standing in the way of the agreement will be rapidly removed so  we may all contribute to having mankind eliminate the nuclear  threat." Countries like Great Britain, France, and China have  objected to the ban on nuclear tests at the Geneva talks.</p>

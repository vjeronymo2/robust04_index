			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Christmas bonus for Gingrich Santa Claus, in the guise of one of Mr Rupert Murdoch's publishers, has come early for Congressman Newt Gingrich, next Speaker of the US House of Representatives. But the Christmas present - a book advance said to be worth Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) - has been instantly transformed into a distinctly unseasonal row. The congressman's office yesterday confirmed a Washington Post report that Mr Gingrich would sign a contract with Harper-Collins, the New York publishing subsidiary of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation, for two books. He would write one about his own political philosophy and edit the other, a political anthology. The Post put the advance at Dollars 4m and an aide to Mr Gingrich said: 'That's about the figure I've heard.' Whatever the precise sum, it far exceeds the congressman's previous literary earnings, such as the modest Dollars 15,000 commission he received last year to write an as yet unpublished novel. Not surprisingly, the White House jumped all over the story yesterday. Ms Dee Dee Myers, in her last day on the job as press secretary, said the deal 'raises some very important questions', such as the 'size and timing' of the payment. Mr James Carville, President Bill Clinton's campaign manager in 1992, was typically more to the point. 'This is the first guy who tried to cash in before he was sworn in. Are you sure he's not going to give it to some orphanage?' - a wicked allusion to one of the next Speaker's solutions for America's welfare problems. Mr Murdoch, in Beijing, said he had 'no knowledge' of the deal.</p>

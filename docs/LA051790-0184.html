			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY RESIGNS POST IN SOUTH GATE  </P> <P> City Atty. Bruce Boogaard has resigned effective May 25 to become chief  attorney for the city of Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Boogaard has been South Gate's city attorney for eight years but had come under  criticism recently.  </P> <P> During the campaign leading up to the April 10 election, some candidates  suggested that administrators, including Boogaard, would be fired if the  balance of power changed on the five-member City Council.  </P> <P> Three newcomers were elected. The new council quickly scrapped a plan --  approved on the eve of the election -- to give top appointive officials,  including the administrator and city attorney, more job protection and an  improved severance package.  </P> <P> The council also hired a special legal counsel for some matters. Mayor Robert  A. Philipp said the council wanted to avoid creating a possible conflict of  interest for Boogaard. Philipp, a critic of Boogaard, said the city attorney  "had resigned. He was not fired." Philipp said he would not discuss  difficulties he had with Boogaard.  </P> <P> Boogaard said he enjoyed working in South Gate and "was looking forward to a  new challenge."  </P> <P> Philipp said the council may name a new attorney at its next meeting May 29.  </P></p>

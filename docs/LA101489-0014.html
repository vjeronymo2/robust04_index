			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPARATIONS FOR JAPANESE INTERNEES  </P> <P> I want to applaud The Times for its advocacy on behalf of the 117,000 Japanese  Americans who were forcibly interned by the American government during World  War II (editorial, "For Redress at Last," Oct. 3). In August, 1988, when  President Reagan signed the act into law to provide speedy monetary  compensation and an apology to the Japanese American citizens unjustly  imprisoned, the former internees finally felt that this stain of injustice  would soon be purged away.  </P> <P> But, one year later, no monies have been appropriated and more than 2,400  internees have died, separated from final justice by a barbed-wire fence of  promises made, promises broken, promises unfulfilled.  </P> <P> I urge Congress, on behalf of the American people, to keep its word. Justice  delayed is justice denied. As the leader of the free world, America can exhort  other nations to guarantee human rights, but only when it fulfills its own  moral and legal obligations at home.  </P> <P> JONATHAN T. KAJI  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

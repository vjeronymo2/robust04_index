			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The mother of all parliaments: Andrew Adonis analyses proposals to reform the way laws are made in the UK The best cure for admiring the House of Lords, said Walter Bagehot, is to go and look at it. If you have never looked, and harbour admiration for either Lords or Commons, save yourself a trip to Westminster and read the Hansard Society's report on the legislative process*. The report, published yesterday, is a withering critique of the way law is made in Britain, produced by a commission of senior legislators, lawyers and lobbyists chaired by Lord Rippon, the former Tory cabinet minister. It is a tale of obfuscation, lack of consultation, grossly inefficient use of parliamentary time, yet inadequate scrutiny of either the principles or details of legislation. As the case studies in the report testify, the heart of the problem is the government's largely unfettered control over the legislative process. At one extreme, it cites the 1990 Dangerous Dogs Act. A panic measure, now widely regarded as unworkable, to ban pit bull terriers and Japanese tosas passed through all its stages in the Commons in a single sitting, less than a week after publication. In contrast, the 1990 Broadcasting Bill, which reformed the regulatory regime for the independent broadcasting sector, was subject to lengthy consultation before reaching Parliament, and debated for 17 days once there. Yet so faulty was the bill as introduced, and so little had ministers done to take on board prior criticism, it practically had to be rewritten on the floor of both Houses. The government was obliged to table 800 amendments in the Lords alone, many of them at a few days' notice. 'Public anxiety about the current system is great and demand for change is strong,' says the report. Its main recommendations for change fall into three categories: more intelligible drafting; more meaningful consultation; and more rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. However desirable, major statutes will never make good bedtime reading. On the second theme, the commission wavers between wanting improved consultation, and proposing to take the framing of legislation out of the government's hands. It would, for instance, 'welcome more frequent appointment of independent inquiries, including royal commissions'. But what is an 'independent' inquiry? One staffed by 'experts' (who are generally far from independent)? Or one including political opponents of the government, in which case its report - like that of so many royal commissions in the past - will inevitably be the lowest common denominator of its diverse composition? No royal commission in the early 1980s would have got the privatisation ball rolling; nor is one likely to reform the welfare state. It is in the third area, parliamentary scrutiny, that the commission makes particularly valuable recommendations. Two radical proposals are set out: Before being debated, controversial bills should be referred to select committees with the power to take evidence from academics, professional bodies and interest groups. Ministers and whips should not be members. Select committees should conduct inquiries into important bills before they are subject to line-by-line scrutiny by the Commons. If implemented, these proposals would provide far greater opportunities for those affected by bills to make their voice heard, without compromising the government's necessary right of initiative. And by reducing the direct control of ministers over at least part of the parliamentary process, they would make it more difficult for ill-considered bills to reach the statute book. Would the Hansard proposals have made any difference to the poll tax, perhaps the worst product of the legislative process this century? Possibly not, given the size of Lady Thatcher's majority in 1987, and her determination not to change a dot or comma. But under Hansard's plans, MPs would, at least, have had to address the chronic practical difficulties thrown up by the tax. They would also have come face to face with the near universal condemnation of it. It will take a battle royal between the government and Parliament - that is, its own backbenchers and the opposition - to get the Hansard reforms through. But it has happened before. In 1979, immediately after the demise of a Labour government with no overall majority, MPs voted to set up the departmental select committees, which have proved influential of late. They should seize the chance offered by Mr Major's slender majority to establish select committees for legislation too. * Making the Law, Hansard Society, St Philips Building North, Sheffield Street, London WC2A 2EX.

At 1500 that afternoon, leading comrades of the municipal  revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang walked to a meeting  room of the organ of the municipal party committee, where  Comrade Chen Xitong had already stayed. Chen Xitong happily  said: Today, I invite comrades of the Kuomintang Committee, a  friendly party of ours, here to have a talk. There are already  the system of political consultation and the forms of special  report meetings and forums. But, the small-scale heart-to-heart  talks are very limited. Now that you are invited to a  heart-to-heart talk today, you may make yourselves at home and  chatter away about this and that, such as international and  domestic situation, the modernization of the capital, the united  front work, and the difficulties and problems requiring our help  and solution.    Amid the cordial and warm atmosphere, comrades of the  committee of Kuomintang, expressed their opinions on the  multiparty cooperation led by the CPC, on participation in and  discussion of political affairs, on democratic supervision, on  overseas propaganda, and on self-construction. Some comrades  said with deep feeling: Through heart-to-heart talks, our  affection with municipal leading comrades has become closer and  we are greatly inspired. Comrades participating in the talk  maintained that this form of talk was good and convenient for  them to speak their mind freely.    During the three-hour talk, Chen Xitong continuously  exchanged opinions and ideas with Kuomintang comrades. He said:  In upholding the principles of long-term coexistence and mutual  supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing  honor or disgrace, the key lies in showing utter devotion to  each other. Only by having a heart-to-heart talk can we  establish a profound friendship and can we coexist for a long  time and supervise each other in an even better way. Today's  heart-to-heart talk is the first of its kind between us. From  now on, we should strengthen contacts through diverse forms.  The CPC and the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang share  the same goal, that is, to make China strong and prosperous at  an earlier date and to build the socialism with Chinese  characteristics that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.  Therefore, the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang has no  reason to refuse to participate in the multiparty cooperation  and has no reason to refuse to inherit and carry forward the  fine tradition of showing utter devotion to each other, that had  been manifested between Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and the old  generation of leaders of democratic parties.    Chen Xitong sincerely hoped that the revolutionary committee  of the Kuomintang would recommend its comrades to hold leading  posts at pertinent government departments. He added: The CPC  should strengthen the construction of itself, but I hope that  democratic parties will also strengthen the construction of  themselves.    Attending the heart-to-heart talks were He Luli, Zhang  Lianyun, Wang Xijue, Li Peiyu, Gan Peigen, Jiang Jianguo, Han  Ruqi, He Shengtao, and Geng Yuqi, leaders of the municipal  revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang.    Also attending were Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, and Shen  Rendao,  leaders of the municipality.    It is learned that Comrade Chen Xitong will also hold talks  with leading comrades of other democratic parties and industrial  and commercial federations in the first half of this year.</p>

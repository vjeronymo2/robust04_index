			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zheng Caixiong: "Overseas Aid Sought To Prop Up State </F> Firms"]    [Text] Guangzhou--The Guangzhou municipal government will  soon make 50 money-losing State enterprises available for  foreign investment.    Foreign investors will be encouraged to buy entire firms for  technological renovation and expansion of production, hold some  stakes, set up joint ventures transfer equipment and  technologies, and even join in managing the firms.    According to a government official who declined to be named  36 per cent of State enterprises in the city lost money last  year. Together he said they lost about 3 billion yuan ($345  million).    "To save these State enterprises, which in previous years  were backbone businesses, we need to increase investment, import  new technologies and advanced equipment and introduce new  management systems," the official said.    Some factories in the busy downtown areas will be allowed to  move to the city's outskirts and develop service industries in  co-operation with overseas partners.    To attract foreign investors, Mayor Li Ziliu will lead a  delegation to the United States early in June.    On the delegation's list for foreign investment are new- and  hi-technology projects and infrastructural works such as the  second phase of the Metro subway, light railways, the second  phase of the Zhujiang Power Plant and Pumped Water Storage Power  Plant, and expressways.    The delegation will also try to sell to foreign investors  the  property rights to most State enterprises for future development.    The delegation will consist of more than 150 people,  including government officials, company managers and directors,  and will hold trade fairs in several cities during its tour from  June 5 to 20. Municipal authorities are also planning a similar  fair in Hong Kong in November. The government official expects  Guangzhou's booming economy, political stability and improving  investment climate to attract more overseas investors to join in  the city's economy construction. To improve its investment  environment Guangzhou has embarked on an infrastructural  construction campaign that includes the Metro, the Ring  Expressway, a 115,000-ton ethylene factory and the Zhujiang  Power Plant. Meanwhile, the government intends to establish a  solid framework for a market economy and encourage more  companies to re-orient themselves toward a market economy.  Within three years, all 20,000 enterprises in Guangzhou are to  become corporations, preferably shareholding ones. All will be  guided by the Company Law that takes effect July 1 and will be  run by their directors according to free-market standards.    "Government officials will no longer interfere in the  enterprises' management as they did in previous years," the  official said. Foreign investment and foreign trade in  Guangzhou have grown steadily this year. In the first four  months the city used more than $640 million foreign capital, up  84.6 percent over the same period last year. During this period  Guangzhou exported nearly $1.1 billion worth of goods, an  increase of 32 percent.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union chief attacks critics of Smith reforms A VIGOROUS attack on the union leaders opposing Mr John Smith's proposed reforms to the links between the Labour party and the unions was launched yesterday by Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians' sections of the AEEU union. He said support for Mr Smith's proposal to end direct union influence in the selection of parliamentary candidates was not tantamount to 'breaking' the links. Those union leaders who argued that it was were 'stabbing him in the back'. He said at the electricians' conference in Blackpoool: 'It is time that some union leaders decided what it is they want. Do they want influence in the party of government or do they want power in a party of permanent opposition?' The electricians are likely soon to return to the Trades Union Congress after being expelled in 1988. The union has long backed Mr Smith's reform proposals, but Mr Gallagher's strong support will boost the Smith camp. Also speaking at the conference, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, underlined the ties between the party and the union movement. She attacked the government for trying to weaken those links, for example by requiring ballots to be held on unions' political funds. Mr Smith's proposals on changing the unions' role in the party have so far failed to attract enough union support to be accepted at the party conference in the autumn. But the Labour leadership believes there is still all to play for, at least until the special meeting next month of the national executive committee, the party's ruling body, which will decide how to put the issue to the conference. A proposal to increase the number of women that Labour MPs must vote for in shadow cabinet elections fell at the last hurdle yesterday when the party rejected a package of reforms to modernise its Westminster operations. The move came less than a week after the PLP backed a proposal to raise the minimum number of votes that must be cast for women from three to four.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (4): Phlegmatic reaction to assassination - Stock market COLOMBO stock market watchers were expecting the worst in the aftermath of the assassination of President Premadasa in May this year. There was talk of a political and economic crisis: analysts were readying themselves for a plunge in share prices. But the crisis did not occur. The stock exchange reaction to events was remarkably phlegmatic. By June, the market was in a bullish mood. New issues were well received. In the June-September period this year, the market rose by more than 20 per cent. 'The fact that the market did not overreact to the assassination shows its resilience and maturity,' says Mr L. S. Jayawardena, chairman of the Sri Lanka Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 'The Sri Lanka market might be relatively small, but in the space of just a few years it has become a sophisticated market in which foreigners are showing increasing interest.' Mr Jayawardena was appointed to the SEC in 1987. Total market turnover at the time was less than SLRs200m (Dollars 4m). By 1990, total turnover had shot up to SLRs1.56bn and last year turnover reached SLRs 5bn. This year, it is likely to be more than triple that amount. Mr Jayawardena says the main stimulus to market growth came in June 1990 when the government made the first moves to ease rules on exchange dealings by foreigners. Before that time a 100 per cent transfer tax was levied on share transactions by foreigners. 'The relaxation of the rules on foreign participation in the market was a major decision in an inward-looking country like ours,' says Mr Jayawardena. 'As foreign money came in, so locals felt greater confidence and started to buy shares.' Mr Premal De Mel, a researcher with the Colombo firm MacKinnon and Keels Financial Services, estimates that about 60 per cent of trading on the market is now foreign-based. 'This is still a small market and the weight of foreign funds coming in can make a big difference,' says Mr De Mel. Both foreign and local investors were encouraged by the government's new industrial strategy of the late 1980s which emphasised that the private sector must play a lead role in promoting the country's economic growth. The government's privatisation or 'peoplisation' programme got under way in 1989 with the public share issue of United Motors Lanka. That issue was poorly received in a market still unschooled in the ways of the stock exchange. But by early 1991, when state-owned Ceylon Oxygen came to the market, the share climate had changed. The issue was oversubscribed more than five times. New listings have increased from one in 1990 to 12 last year and a possible 13 this year. At present 196 companies are listed on the Colombo exchange. An SEC-sponsored public education programme telling people about the stock market helped to broaden share ownership. By the end of last year the SEC estimated that the number of shareholders in the market had increased to 40,000 - from only 10,000 in 1990. In addition, 20,000 shareholders had been created through the peoplisation programme under which employees were given 10 per cent of shares in the privatised state-owned enterprises. But it has not been all plain sailing for the exchange. Market overheating in 1991 was followed by a prolonged downturn through 1992. As a result, market capitalisation dropped from SLRs81bn to SLRs66bn in the year. Although foreign interest in the market remained, local investors tended to shy away from new public share offers, choosing instead to take advantage of high bank deposit rates and Treasury bills which offered attractive 18 per cent yields. The privatisation of one of the bigger state banks, the National Development Bank of Sri Lanka (NDB), in February this year helped turn the market. The NDB issue, backed strongly by foreign investors, was oversubscribed nearly four times. The subsequent entry into the market of two state-controlled hotel groups further buoyed investor confidence. The main constraint on market growth now is liquidity. Despite high interest rates and the attraction of raising funds on the stock market, many of Sri Lanka's biggest companies still choose to remain private, mostly family-controlled businesses. Many are reluctant to put themselves in a position where they have to make financial disclosures. The Colombo stock exchange has come a long way in a very short time and is one of the region's most technically sophisticated. When he took on the job of SEC chairman one of the first moves Mr Jayawardena made was to set about introducing a computer-based central depository system. With funding and technical assistance from USAID, the scripless system came into being in late 1991. 'We realise we are small, but we are one of the most technically advanced exchanges in the region,' says Mr Jayawardena. 'Given continuing healthy economic growth and providing more companies discover the advantages of going public, there's no reason we won't expand rapidly in the years ahead.'</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sketchley bolstered by Supasnaps A move into the photographic film business helped Sketchley, the dry cleaning and photo processing group, increase pre-tax profits by 6 per cent before exceptionals to Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 1. Supasnaps, the photo processor acquired for a total cash payment of Pounds 6m in 1993, offset a difficult year in the core dry cleaning business. The new division contributed Pounds 1.4m to operating profits of Pounds 6.6m. This compared with a total operating return of Pounds 5.8m last time, which was depressed at the pre-tax level by a Pounds 1.7m exceptional charge. Sales were also boosted on the back of the acquisition, rising by 37 per cent to Pounds 142.9m. Excluding Supasnaps, sales fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 101.4m. Mr John Richardson, deputy chairman, said that he was optimistic about the current year, particularly given the recent increase in dry cleaning volumes. In four of the first five months of 1994, there had been a rise in sales of about 2 per cent. An increase in the dividend was intended to pass that confidence on to shareholders, he said. The pay-out is increased by 10 per cent to 2.2p, for a total up 7 per cent at 3.2p, payable from earnings per share ahead from 4.9p to 6.7p. The integration of Supasnaps was going forward as planned, with substantial cost savings yet to be realised. Sketchley had cut Pounds 1.2m in costs last year and expected a further Pounds 800,000 in savings this year. The group merged 40 Supasnaps outlets with dry cleaning shops, and planned to combine a further 50 this year. Textile rental suffered an Pounds 800,000 drop in operating profits, due to the accelerated closure of British Coal pits. Mr Richardson said Warrender Aircraft Services, purchased six weeks ago for Pounds 8m, was expected to contribute more than Pounds 1m this year.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Magna shrugs off recession with CDollars 10.7m MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, continues its recovery despite weak North American car production caused by the recession. For the second quarter to January the group reported net profits of CDollars 10.7m (USDollars 9m) or 26 cents a share, against losses of Dollars 2.3m, or 8 cents a year earlier. Sales were unchanged at Dollars 484m. First-half profits came to CDollars 36.2m or 84 cents a share, against CDollars 500,000 or 2 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.1bn, up 12 per cent. Magna, which also has several plants in Europe, benefited from a shift in product mix, lower interest rates and lower capital spending. Assuming conversion of CDollars 200m of convertible debentures, debt-equity ratio is 0.6:1. The company is resuming common share dividends with a 10 cent cash payment for the latest quarter. Magna in the latest period achieved a return on equity of 11 per cent after returning from the brink two years ago.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> EL TORO DOCTOR HAS LICENSE REVOKED  </P> <P> State medical officials said they have revoked the license of an El Toro  physician accused of administering a hormonal treatment that posed a public  danger and caused harmful side-effects in at least 18 women. Dr. Norman King  Beals Jr., 55, who hosted a call-in radio talk show in Orange County and  advertised heavily in local newspapers, admitted that the California Medical  Board's allegations were true and declined to contest the charges at an  evidentiary hearing, according to documents filed last week by the state  attorney general's office. Beals had touted "hormonal replacement therapy" as a  cure-all for a host of female-oriented afflictions -- including breast cancer,  menopausal hot flashes and premenstrual syndrome.  </P></p>

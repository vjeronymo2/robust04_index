			<p>BFN     [Text] The commanding officer of the Bundibugyo Battalion,  Captain (John Tumwebaze), has urged RC's [resistance committees]  in Bundibugyo to be on the lookout for Zairean antigovernment  rebels who are crossing into Uganda as a result of hot pursuit  by government troops.    Capt. (Tumwebaze) cautioned the RC's that many of the rebels  possessed guns that may cause insecurity in Bundibugyo, a  district renowned for maintaining peace and security. He  appealed to the people of Bundibugyo to report any suspicious  character to security personnel. Capt. (Tumwebaze), who was  speaking at a district development committee meeting in  Bundibugyo, disclosed that many Zairean rebels have been  intercepted by Ugandan troops guarding the Uganda-Zaire border.

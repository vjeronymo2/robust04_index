			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, the Mexican president said his government is  duty-bound to guarantee that the law prevails. Democracy and  law go together and cannot be separated, President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said at Los Pinos presidential residence when  he received the 1994 Norma Corona Sapiens Award, granted by the  Association of Litigant Lawyers of Mexico for the Defense of  Human Rights.    Salinas was decorated with the national award named after  Norma Corona Sapiens, a lawyer from Sinaloa who defended human  rights and who was murdered during her struggle against drug  traffickers associated with policemen. As a result of her  murder, President Salinas created the National Human Rights  Commission, which he later incorporated into the Constitution.    [Begin Salinas recording] My government has assigned top  priority to the defense of human rights under all circumstances  and with all due authority. I have pledged to guarantee rule of  law. [end recording]    Even though he admitted there is much more to be done, the  president said Mexico's legal system is at the vanguard of this  century.    [Begin Salinas recording] Fighting against criminal bands,  particularly those of drug traffickers, is indispensable for  guaranteeing the civilized coexistence of society. [end  recording]    Maximo Carvajal, dean of the School of Law of the Autonomous  University of Mexico, said the award was given to President  Salinas for his work in defending human rights in Mexico.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who is currently  visiting Santiago de Cuba, today inaugurated the Sierra Mar  Hotel. The four-star hotel, located in the western sector of the  province near Chibirico, has 200 rooms. Fidel toured the hotel,  accompanied by authorities and an enthusiastic group of Canadian  and German tourists. After getting over their surprise at seeing  Castro, all the tourists tried to get near him, and to get  souvenirs.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified woman in French] Mr. Castro  [words indistinct], if you please.    [Castro] There you go.    [Unidentified woman in French] Thank you, thank you, Mr.  Castro. [end recording]    The Cuban president admired the hotel, which has been built  in the form of terraces on the slope of a mountain. The hotel is  part of the tourist development center of the Sierra Maestra  Park.    Last night, following the event for the 35th anniversary of  the triumph of the Revolution, and the ceremony during which  Fidel Castro was presented with the shield of the city, Fidel  met with reporters.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Commander, today you were  awarded the highest distinction in the city. How do you feel?    [Castro] I am very embarrassed.    [Reporter] Embarrassed?    [Castro] Yes. I am embarrassed when I receive those honors  and distinctions. Of course, I am honored, but also embarrassed.  I do not consider myself deserving of so many honors.    [Reporter] But it is inevitable that you should receive  them.  It is a way to thank you.    [Castro] When someone gives you something, you must be  courteous and accept it. [laughter]    [Reporter] Commander, do you know....    [Castro, interrupts] [Words indistinct] I can only accept  it.    [Reporter] Commander, we Cubans like to make comparisons.  The  people are asking themselves whether the most difficult year of  the special period is now behind us. What do you think?    [Castro] I believe this has been the most difficult year. We  must do our best to ensure that it was the most difficult. We  can do that in 1994 by working more and well. If we do that, we  can make the situation change.    Proof of this is the sugarcane harvest. The fact that we  have  a smaller harvest this year means that we are not changing the  situation. This is why we must ensure that this harvest is in  accordance with the plans. We must mill all the sugarcane we  have planned to mill. We must mill it efficiently. This will  show us whether we can change the situation. We will then know  if we can produce 200,000, 300,000, or 400,000 tons of sugar. It  is a good test. We have worked hard and put forth special  efforts.    New things have been done and we should begin to see some  results. For example, the work being done by the Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], and the support of the  Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] in the  agricultural sector -- they have thousands of soldiers working  and producing.    We must continue to increase our oil production. We must  begin to see our first results in the field of exploration, not  extraction, of oil. We must continue to promote tourism. The  measures we are taking to decriminalize the excess currency  should begin to yield good results. We may begin to see some  signs of progress if we do things right. The important thing is  to change the situation, even though it is a difficult  situation. We are experiencing a special period, the blockade  has deepened, and there is an international economic crisis.  These are not favorable conditions. This is why we have said  that we must overcome not only our problems, but the objective  problems experienced by the world, and continue to develop.    [Reporter] I saw you five years ago when you launched the  socialism or death slogan. Today when I saw you hold up a  replica of Antonio Maceo's machete, I could tell that you were  more filled with emotion than you were five years ago. Why?    [Castro] It is only logical. It is a replica of Antonio  Maceo's machete and it was a great honor to receive it. I regret  not having a horse like the one Maceo had. I regret not having  an enemy in front of me. All I needed was the enemy and Maceo's  horse. The truth is that Maceo's machete strengthens the arm and  energizes the mind. [end recording]</p>

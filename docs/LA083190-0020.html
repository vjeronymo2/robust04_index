			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIBERIA LONGS FOR A CONNECTION ACROSS THE PACIFIC;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: VLADIVOSTOK AND ITS REGION SMOLDER OVER THEIR ISOLATION FROM  MOSCOW. WE SHOULD BUILD A BRIDGE OF SORTS.  </P> <P> America's nearest overseas neighbor is the Soviet Union. Yet our view of that  country is Eurocentric; we tend to look at it the long way, eastward across the  Atlantic instead of westward across the Pacific. Many people in Vladivostok,  the leading city of Pacific Siberia, are urging us to look across the Pacific.  Don't ignore the regions closest to you, they say.  </P> <P> At a time of global trend from nationalism and centralization to regionalism  and local authority, the geography of proximity takes on new importance. Yet  Vladivostok, headquarters of the Soviet Pacific fleet, has remained remote to  Americans and even Soviet citizens because of poorly developed transportation  networks and government security policy.  </P> <P> A visit to this long-sealed fortress city, capital of the Primorie (Maritime  Province) reveals a smoldering rage against the Moscow bureaucracy and a warm  desire for economic independence for the region. Some are even talking of  political autonomy. In the Primorie's case, yearnings for greater independence  do not stem from ethnic differences with Moscow (Slavs heavily predominate in  the Soviet Far East) but erupt instead from a sense of administrative abuse.  "They treat us like a colony!" is the cry. Local people find the central  authorities condescending in their attitudes and incompetent at dealing with  local problems. Why for instance, Vladivostok asks, is Leningrad dictating the  study of Pacific oceanography? What do they know about the Pacific?  </P> <P> No matter who is to blame, the local economy is certainly in a bad way,  suffering from its narrow base of timber, fish and extractive industries. The  region must import 50% of its food. Existence is characterized by scarcity,  dilapidation and alarming environmental degradation.  </P> <P> "You cannot believe how bad our life is," one woman scientist remarks. "We talk  of nothing but the struggle to find essential material things: food, clothing,  a flat." No wonder turnover is high; many workers and intellectuals who come to  the Far East soon leave in disgust. Yet the foreign visitor is impressed by the  courage and intellect of the people, their savage self-mocking humor and  ruthless candor. "We are survivors," they say proudly.  </P> <P> Civilians do not conceal their resentment toward the military. "They have made  of our Primorie a wasteland surrounded by a hedge of missiles," one scholar  remarks. Some people talk of the desirability of getting the Navy out and  wistfully refer to Singapore as a possible paradigm, a great naval base turned  into a center for the manufacture of high-tech consumer goods. But the iron  grip of the military keeps the "open" status of Vladivostok ambiguous, even  four years after Mikhail Gorbachev's speech there promising it.  </P> <P> In the city's intellectual community, there is thirst for change, a longing for  international interactions in commerce and culture. The phrase "joint venture"  hangs on everyone's lips. The citizens of Vladivostok respect the Japanese. Old  Toyotas and Mazdas find appreciative new owners here. South Korea is attracting  new admiration. But everyone wants to practice English and visit the United  States.  </P> <P> World peace depends on a stable Soviet Union. It is to no one's interest to  have that huge nation fall into economic collapse and political chaos. What can  and should the United States do? Massive investment in the Soviet Union or even  just in the Primorie is unfeasible. Even if we were to find and commit the  money, the scale and complexity of the problems is too great, and not to be  solved by anyone except the Soviet people themselves.  </P> <P> What many people of the Primorie would like is the chance to study in the  United States in order to develop a stronger sense of the entrepreneurial  culture they perceive necessary to the success of a market economy. We should  offer them this opportunity. American troops occupied Vladivostok for a year  and a half at the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution, their presence  interpreted by the Soviets as imperialist aggression. We now have the  opportunity to erase that image. A program bringing 100 scholars a year from  the Primorie for the next five years would cost relatively little. Yet in a  population of only 2 million, it would create a critical mass for change and  yield great return, both to local benefit and that of U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P></p>

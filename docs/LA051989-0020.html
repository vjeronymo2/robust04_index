			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. KASSEBAUM OF KANSAS TO SEEK THIRD TERM DESPITE PLEDGE  </P> <P> Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) announced Thursday that she will seek  reelection, reversing a pledge to serve only two terms.  </P> <P> The 56-year-old senator, daughter of former Republican presidential candidate  Alf Landon, is one of only two women in the Senate.  </P> <P> "It's been very difficult," Kassebaum said of her decision. "I have been  struggling with it for some time. Up to yesterday, I can't truthfully say I  knew for sure."  </P> <P> Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas said, "She's a one-of-a-kind  public servant, incomparable and unbeatable . . . . Nancy's third term is in  the bag."  </P> <P> Kassebaum said her original qualms about a third term centered on whether any  senator could muster the same energy and commitment after 12 years, adding: "I  came to terms with whether I could challenge myself."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> A Wednesday press conference at Los Angeles City Hall hosted by Mayor Tom  Bradley will kick off an unprecedented cultural exchange that will send Jewish  musicians on a tour of the Soviet Union. Billed as a "folk-rock-Jewish-soul"  tour, the five-city trek will feature Jewish folk music pioneer Shlomo  Carlebach and the L.A.-based band Promised Land, with the first date set for  Sept. 7 in Leningrad. The tour is the result of two years of planning and  negotiations by music executive Stuart Wax who, according to a spokesman,  "combines Orthodox Judaism with his love for rock music, especially the  Grateful Dead." In exchange, the Soviet band Secrets plans to tour the United  States next spring. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

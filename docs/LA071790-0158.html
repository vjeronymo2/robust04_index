			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUDGET GAMES OVER: BUSH;  </P> <P> WILL PRESS COMPROMISE ON DEFICIT  </P> <P> President Bush said today that disturbing new figures on the federal deficit  show that the "time for game playing is over," and he pledged to increase  pressure for a compromise on new taxes and budget cuts.  </P> <P> "We're getting to a crunch," Bush told a group of magazine publishers at the  White House. "It is absolutely essential that something be done. I will do my  part."  </P> <P> He spoke a day after the White House Office of Management and Budget boosted  its estimate of the fiscal 1991 deficit to $168.8 billion -- up $10 billion  from the Administration's estimates a month ago and up sharply from the $100.5  billion it estimated in January.  </P> <P> The projected deficit is more than $100 billion above the target of $64 billion  set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.  </P> <P> Congressional budget negotiators had given mixed reviews to the  Administration's gloomy assessment -- some saying it would help prod  slow-moving talks and others suggesting the opposite.  </P> <P> "Given yesterday's news," Bush said today, " . . . the time for game playing is  over. And we have to get something done that is not only a sound budget  agreement but is seen by the American people to be a sound budget agreement."  </P> <P> Bush said that although he was still "fairly optimistic" such a pact could be  reached, it will require both spending cuts and tax increases.  </P> <P> Bush earlier this month abandoned his 1988 "no new taxes" campaign pledge.  </P> <P> The President said he was fearful "about the confidence in the marketplace"  should a budget deal not be struck.  </P> <P> "We will be pushing in the next couple of weeks, and the meter is running,"  Bush said.  </P> <P> Budget summit talks between Administration officials and congressional leaders  enter their third month this week.  </P> <P> The Administration coupled the release of the revised figures Monday with a  bleak assessment of how a $100-billion cut in services -- which would be  triggered this fall by the Gramm-Rudman law in the absence of a budget accord  -- would affect government services.  </P> <P> The scenarios included eliminating half the nation's 2 million active military  personnel, reducing hours of operation at the nation's airports and halting  increased drug interdiction efforts at the country's borders.  </P> <P> No one was willing to say they believed that such dramatic cuts would be  allowed to stand for very long. As recently as last fall, the Gramm-Rudman law  required spending cuts that were rolled back as soon as negotiators worked out  a budget deal.  </P> <P> But some lawmakers argued Monday that the new numbers illustrated a problem  that had to be dealt with.  </P> <P> "The day of reckoning has arrived," said Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel  Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget  Committee, said the details should send a message to lawmakers who have opposed  the budget talks.  </P> <P> "They now have a clear alternative," Domenici said. "If it is not an economic  summit, it is this," a $100-billion automatic spending cut.  </P></p>

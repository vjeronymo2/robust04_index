			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Left-Center Opposition Leaders' Appeal to Russian </F> Federation Citizens" followed by Boris Slavin commentary under  the general heading: "Accord for Russia"; last paragraph is  Slavin commentary]    [Text] Various political blocs, coalitions, and alliances  are taking shape in anticipation of possible presidential  elections. Today we present an appeal by the left-center  opposition, which has the blessing of Metropolitan Ioann of St.  Petersburg and Ladoga:    There is calamity in our common Russian home. This is being  discussed by families, on the street, in dying plants, and cold  schools, it is being mentioned by the opposition and the  government, religious and political figures, the Federal  Assembly, and the president. Everyone secretly thinks the same  -- we cannot go on living like this. A halt must be called.    We have one means of salvation -- we must come to our  senses,  extend our hands to one another in forgiveness of the mutual  recriminations and transgressions. There will be no winners or  losers in this confrontation. Each new conflict increases the  danger of Russia's destruction. We contrast the folly of words  and deeds with respect for the law and creative activity in the  name of Russia.    A social contract between all patriotic forces, movements,  ideologies, and faiths that reject violence, racism, and  nationalism and that set civic service to the homeland above all  else is what can stop the catastrophe.    The only freedom is that which brings prosperity to the  fatherland, strengthens its independence, and provides  guarantees of personal safety and faith in the future.    We people of different views, with a different way of life  and thinking, representatives of various fragments of our  multifaceted ideology and policy, state that we are setting up  the movement "Accord for Russia," uniting all Russia's patriots  -- as has frequently happened in times of trouble for Russia --  pooling our wealth, ability, and moral and political  experience.... The "Accord for Russia" movement is open to all  citizens in our multiethnic Russia who are able to help their  fatherland at its time of severe trial.    We do not differentiate between liberals and communists,  entrepreneurs and workers, private farmers, and kolkhoz workers,  nor do we distinguish between republicans and supporters of  presidential authority. We are uniting to perform urgent tasks  in an endeavor:    -- to avert the definitive breakup of historic Russia, the  destruction of the cultural, economic, and political ties that  have developed over the centuries between its equal peoples;    -- to restore the power and might of Russia's statehood,  providing its peoples and citizens with security and conditions  for economic prosperity and the development of the individual;    -- to protect national cadres and the scientific,  technical, and defense potential of our great country;    -- to stop reforms "for reforms' sake," the destruction of  national production, protect the national market and national  capital, and ensure conditions for Russia's move toward a  postindustrial future;    -- to bar the way to rampant crime and looting of the  wealth that has been created by the work of several generations  of our people and provide legal protection for state and private  property;    -- to avert unemployment and starvation, provide every  citizen of the country with a fitting way of life and standard  of living;    -- to restore our peoples' sense of community, membership  of and pride in a sovereign state, and their belief in justice,  conscience, and good.    We have behind us the constructive experience and heroism of  Russia's great citizens and our homeland's patriots. We have  behind us the experience of 1,000 years of Russian statehood.  We will strive to secure national accord, the consolidation of  society, and mobilize all patriotic citizens to restore ravaged  errant Russia.    [Signed] V. Zorkin, A. Rutskoy, M. Lapshin, A. Tuleyev, S.  Glazyev, G. Zyuganov, P. Romanov, S. Baburin, V. Lipitskiy, A.  Prokhanov, G. Seleznev, V. Chikin. A. Shilov, S. Govorukhin, N.  Mikhalkov, A. Tsipko.    Thus, a coalition of left-centrist forces -- effectively,  the  main popular-patriotic forces -- has been formed. The intended  split in the opposition following the amnesty has not taken  place. On the contrary, most opposition forces have united.  They include politicians and representatives of the creative  intelligentsia -- supporters of nonviolence and a rule-of-law  state. The real democrats are wavering. But the door to the  future is open to them. As for the radicals from "Russia's  Choice" and "Democratic Russia," I think that they have had  their day. Without simplifying the situation I will say: The  way is closed to everyone who wants to see a repeat of October  1994 [date as published].</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Alatas stressed that Indonesia  is not a mediator in the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue, but  can only hear the issues from the involved parties through  diplomatic methods. Speaking at a news conference with his  South Korean counterpart, Han Sung-chu, Minister Ali Alatas said  Indonesia, as a neighboring nation and in its capacity as the  leader of the Nonaligned Movement, can only make an effort to  hold a dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency,  IAEA, North and South Korea, and other parties such as the  United States, Japan, and China. Indonesia hopes that through  such dialogue the Korean peninsula's crisis can be fully settled  without aggression.    Meanwhile, the South Korean foreign minister also hoped that  the conflict, which has become a concern in the international  community, can be fully solved.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (9): A man with his work cut out - Greece has the EU's highest debt to GDP ratio Behind the desk of Mr Nikos Kyriazides, the deputy finance minister, stands a late 19th century safe - a leftover from a period when Greece declared itself bankrupt more than once. It is a sobering reminder for Greece's new debt manager as he addresses a public debt that has ballooned from 98 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989 to 138 per cent of GDP in January this year. Greece has the highest debt to GDP ratio of any EU member, almost double the target for economic convergence under the terms of the Maastricht treaty. Last year the government borrowing requirement reached 13.9 per cent of GDP against a target of 7.9 per cent. What should have been a manageable shortfall in budget revenues turned into a yawning gap as a result of a burst of pre-election spending by the former conservative government and the loss of more than Dr300bn in expected privatisation revenues. So far, the socialist government is proving no more efficient at collecting taxes than its conservative predecessor. Unless radical measures are taken to boost revenues, this year's budget revenue shortfall will bring central government borrowing up to 17 per cent of GDP, against a target of 12.8 per cent. Clearly, Mr Kyriazides, a former executive director of the IMF who has also served as deputy governor of the Bank of Greece, the central bank, has his work cut out. Apart from the problem of financing a mounting deficit at interest rates approaching 20 per cent, an additional Dr3,600bn of government debt has been revealed, which will have to be securitised in 1994. 'We managed to cover the end-of-year problem through increased borrowing abroad,' Mr Kyriazides says. 'The question now is getting interest rates down to lighten the burden of financing both new and existing debt.' In addition to raising Y340m on the Japanese market, the government borrowed Dr200bn from four Greek banks through a seven-year bond issue with interest at 2.25 per cent above the rate for 12-month Treasury bills. The newly discovered debt includes Dr280bn in obligations by the state-owned Agricultural Bank and another Dr350bn in state-guaranteed debt, with the remainder in claims against the government by the central bank, which must be recognised under the terms of the Maastricht treaty. While part of the new debt can be securitised without increasing net borrowing, the Bank of Greece is demanding market rates of interest on the government's residual debt, which will add to the government's borrowing problem. The government has tried to ease the pressure by extending its debt profile, issuing three- and five-year bonds which have proved popular with institutional investors in Greece and elsewhere. However, these offer no real respite as they carry floating rates linked to that of the 12-month Treasury bill. 'The policy is now changing: over the next few months, we plan to start issuing fixed-coupon drachma bonds at longer maturities, now that that the supranationals have done so,' Mr Kyriazides says. The successful launch of 'marathon' bonds by the European Investment Bank and World Bank earlier this year has soothed the government's fears that fixed-coupon bonds would prove unattractive to investors. While the annual inflation rate has steadily declined, falling from a peak of 16.4 per cent in March 1993 to 10.2 per cent in March this year, interest rates on the 12-month bill have moved down more slowly, from 22 per cent in to 18.5 per cent over the same period. As a result, real interest rates reached a record 8.3 per cent last month. They seem unlikely to decline further; the inflation rate is edging up again and there are signs of fatigue among investors, underlined by last month's shortfall of about Dr60bn in renewals of Treasury bills. Real rates must also remain high enough to continue attracting investors from abroad, while allowing for depreciation of the drachma. However, the government's unexpected decision to liberalise short-term capital movements six weeks ahead of the July 1 deadline could alter the picture dramatically. The liberalisation was designed to pre-empt speculative attacks against the drachma in the run-up to July 1 and avert a possible devaluation. It remains to be seen whether the central bank's policy of hiking interest rates on the interbank market to record levels in order to protect the currency can be sustained for more than a few weeks. There is no doubt that interest rates on government bonds will have to rise sharply, to buttress the drachma against the likelihood of massive capital outflows. Greek bankers predict that devaluation can be held off, at least for the moment, through faster depreciation of the drachma. Whatever happens, the prospects for lightening the debt burden this year are fading fast.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong deputies to  the National People's Congress (NPC) appealed for protection of  rights and interests of workers in overseas-funded enterprises  at a meeting here today.    With a growing number of overseas-funded enterprises in  China, disputes between labor and capital have increased and  infringement upon workers' rights and interests has also become  a severe issue, Hong Kong deputies said at a group discussion of  the Guangdong provincial delegation at the ongoing NPC session.    Cheng Yiu Tong, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions  of  Hong Kong and an advisor on Hong Kong Affairs, made an  investigation in labor-capital disputes before he came to attend  the NPC session in Beijing. He said, infringement upon workers'  rights and interests by overseas-funded enterprises includes  withholding workers' wages, extending work hours, insufficient  facilities for safety production, lack of labor contracts, harsh  factory rules and regulations, arbitrarily encroaching on  personal rights and depriving workers of the right to organize  trade unions.    After listing a number of facts and figures, he summed up  that 70 percent of the disputes belong to the violation of  economic contracts by the capital side and infringement on  workers' rights; 20 percent are cases that the capital side  encroaches on democratic and personal rights of workers; and  only 10 percent cases belong to unreasonable demands by workers.    Hong Kong deputies raised suggestions on protection of  workers' interests and rights with reference to relevant  regulations of Hong Kong and in accordance with domestic reality.    It is necessary to strengthen supervision and strictly abide  by law in handling the disputes, they said.    They suggested that workers have the right to ask for  liquidation of enterprises which withhold workers' wages for  more than one month; those that extend work time arbitrarily,  violate industrial safety regulations and endanger workers'  health shall be punished; those that refuse to sign labor  contracts or allow workers to organize trade unions shall be  ordered to stop operation until they accept the demand.    They also suggested that the labor law being drafted shall  protect rights and interests of workers in all types of firms --  state-owned, collective, overseas-funded or private enterprises  -- just the same.</p>

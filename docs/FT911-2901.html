			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Ford steps up Halewood job cuts FORD of Britain is to step up job losses at its plant at Halewood on Merseyside because of the decline in car sales caused by the recession. About 900 jobs will go at Halewood this year, but the company said they would be part of a five-year programme announced 12 months ago to reduce the workforce by 2,800 in a long-term productivity drive. Ms Sarah Perris, head of public affairs at Ford, Halewood, said: 'When we announced our programme last year we could not anticipate the drop in sales which the industry has experienced recently, just as we cannot possibly know where we will be in three or four years' time.' On Thursday, Ford said it was reviewing its cost structure and wanted to cut 2,500 of its salaried jobs throughout Europe over the next three years, mainly among white-collar support staff not direct-ly employed in production or sales and marketing. Mr Martin Watkins, head of public affairs for Ford UK, emphasised yesterday that the cuts were also part of a long-term cost-reduction campaign. Ford employed more than 14,000 people at Halewood in the 1970s and the figure is now down to about 8,500, accompanied by labour-saving, capital-intensive manufacturing investment. Mr Watkins said that the national 1979 workforce of 76,000 was now reduced to 44,000. There had been no compulsory redundancies and the aim was to continue job cuts through voluntary severance and early retirement. Recent talks with unions had been straightforward business meetings. He added: 'The current situation means that the focus has been somewhat sharpened. There is no precision about our programme and details are still being discussed.'</p>

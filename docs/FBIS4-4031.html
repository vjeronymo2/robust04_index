			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Newly-elected Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata was sworn in by Emperor Akihito today,  formally taking over as Japan's 51st prime minister.    Hata, elected by parliament on Monday, has failed to reach  agreement among coalition party leaders on a new cabinet and  appeared set to form the first minority administration in four  decades.    Hata will make a last-ditch effort later in the day to  persuade the socialists to return to the ruling coalition.    The Social Democratic Party (the socialists), the biggest  partner in the eight-month-old coalition, walked out on Tuesday  [26 April] in an angry reaction to the establishment of a rival  parliamentary bloc grouping five coalition parties but excluding  the socialists within just hours of Hata's election.    The socialists' move wold deprive Hata of his parliamentary  majority and raise prospects of a period of weak minority rule  followed by forced early elections.    Hata took over from Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned abruptly  on April 8 after just eight months in office over his dubious  personal finances and a Diet (parliament) stalemate.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEACE HARD TO KEEP  </P> <P> Does peace have a chance? Yes. Peace has been given a chance many times, and it  will come around hopefully without bloodshed.  </P> <P> Are we going to keep it? No. We didn't keep it after WWI, WWII and the Korean  War. We start wars, but we do not keep peace. Not for long. We still don't know  how.  </P> <P> SOPHIE BINGHAM  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

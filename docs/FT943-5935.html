			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Housebuilders offer evidence of recovery Share prices of housebuilders rose sharply yesterday after companies reported that new house sales had recovered last month after a poor June and July. Persimmon, the UK's eighth-biggest housebuilder, said it had sold 250 homes in August, 25 per cent more than August last year. Ideal Homes, part of Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group, also reported higher August sales than a year ago. Wimpey, the UK's biggest housebuilder, which announces first-half profits next Tuesday, is also thought to have seen sales bounce back in August after falling in the first two months of the summer. Mr Jeremy Withers Green, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'This shows that the housing recovery is still on track, while new homes are taking market share and selling better than existing houses and flats.' Persimmon, which yesterday announced a 34 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.3m, saw its share price rise 10p to 262p. Barratt Development rose 12p to 210p; Berkeley Homes 15p to 430p and Wilson Connolly 17p to 234p. Mr Duncan Davidson, Persimmon's chairman, said: 'I believe the recovery is sufficiently entrenched to withstand an increase in interest rates of up to one percentage point - although I would prefer rates not to increase.' He said that Persimmon had increased net profit on each sale to Pounds 7,818 from Pounds 4,825 in the first six months of last year. This compared with a peak profit per house of Pounds 18,000 in 1988-89. The aim was to get this back to Pounds 10,000 a unit.</p>

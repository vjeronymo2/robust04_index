			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 70m write-down at Ensign Trust A SHARP drop in the value of its unlisted investments resulted in a Pounds 69.7m write-down at the interim stage for Ensign Trust, which has recently faced the possibility of being wound down by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, its largest shareholder. Net asset value per share at March 31 totalled 53.6p, a decline of 57.52p on the 111.12p standing 12 months earlier In addition to the write-down, which was equivalent to 23p per share, a further write-down of Pounds 17.8m has been made in the unlisted investment portfolio, equivalent to 5.9p per share. For the half year to March 31 the trust reported a loss before tax of Pounds 58,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 75,000 previously. The Pounds 44,000 surplus available to shareholders in the previous half-year was reversed in the revenue account to a deficit of Pounds 567,000. Losses per ordinary share amounted to 0.19p (earnings 0.03p) and a same-again interim dividend of 0.3p per share is being paid. However, the board does not expect to recommend payment of a final dividend. Borrowings increased by Pounds 26.23m to Pounds 118.18m (Pounds 91.94m). The group is looking to gradually reduce the unquoted portfolio proportion of its overall assets. Disposals will be made with a view to receiving full value for the investments, and the proceeds will go to reducing the level of its gearing, it said. The group warned that the loss of income from Argosy Asset Management, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary, would reduce future revenues. Argosy, which was considered unable to continue to operate autonomously after it lost its contract to manage the MNOPF's investment portfolio, was acquired by Ivory &amp; Sime, which took over management of Ensign Trust's investments from Argosy.</p>

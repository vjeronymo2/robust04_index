			<p>BFN     [Text] Differences of opinion between Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres over  negotiations with the Palestinians are centered on whether  Israel must sign the agreement within two weeks. Our  correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Minister Peres in his  talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Romania received the impression that  if the agreement is not signed within two weeks, then, in his  words, the whole thing will be a dead letter. Mr. Peres  believes that the detailed negotiations on security should be  finalized, the agreement signed, and the remaining issues worked  out later. Mr. Rabin, on the other hand, believes that before  the agreement is signed, issues touching on sovereignty, such as  currency, stamps, and telephone dialing areas, should also be  worked out.    Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said there is no dispute  between Rabin and Peres. Minister Tzaban said the differences  refer to the niceties, and Police Minister Shahal believes that  the issue is a matter of different perspectives. He believes  the full cabinet must be involved in the deliberations. Under  the draft agreement Peres brought back from Romania, there will  be a Peres-'Arafat meeting in Cairo on Thursday [28 April] in  order to prepare a meeting between the Prime Minister Rabin and  'Arafat next week. The only issues which will remain unresolved  at the Rabin-'Arafat will be the size of the Jericho area and  the location of the Palestinian policeman deployed on the Jordan  River bridge.</p>

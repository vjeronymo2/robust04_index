			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japanese business circles have highly praised the 4  February U.S. decision to completely lift economic sanctions it  previously imposed on the SRV, saying that "we should extend  open arms to welcome it" (as stated by Akira Nishio, president  of Nissho Iwai Corporation and chairman of the Japan-Vietnam  Economic Committee under the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan [Keidanren]). There are strong hopes  that full-scale business operations in the SRV by U.S. firms  "would help expand economic aid programs to the SRV, such as by  the IMF, and help vitalize its market" (as stated by a Japan  External Trade Organization official). This would also help  diminish investment risks. Japanese businessmen thus welcome  this latest U.S. move.    Presuming that sanctions would be lifted, about 30 major  U.S.  businesses, including IBM Corporation and Coca Cola Enterprises  Incorporated, have already made preparations to advance into the  SRV market. For example, they have set up local branch offices  staffed by their employees. Among Japanese firms, Nissho Iwai  Corporation has worked things out "to the point where operations  can begin immediately" regarding tie-ups with U.S. firms. For  example, it embarked on a joint project last December to probe  off-shore SRV oil fields with Mobil Corporation, a U.S. oil  major, and other firms.    Last year, Japanese trade with the SRV increased about 23  percent over the previous year to $1.6 billion. There is high  Japanese business interest in the SRV since, among other  reasons, yen appreciation has forced firms to search for cheap  labor.    After the end of the Vietnam war, Japanese firms resumed  trade with the SRV in the early stages. They are said to be  ahead of U.S. firms by seven years. For this reason, U.S. firms  are deeply concerned about their "having made a late start."  Thus, it is expected there will now be fierce competition  between Japanese and U.S. firms.</p>

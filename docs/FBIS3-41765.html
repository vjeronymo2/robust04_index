The water in rural  wells has been mixed with debris, fertilizers, and herbicides,  and it has been contaminated with radio-nuclides. How can it be  drunk?    Some journalists have increasingly been whipping up fear;  they have reported that hordes of rats have appeared in the  affected regions, and they are carriers of infection. I have  talked with the Director of the Brest Oblast Center of Hygiene  and Epidemiology, Nikolay Lyakhov. Flooding, he says, of course  has complicated the ecological situation, but we foresaw this  and prepared ahead of time. The situation is overall under  control.S    What specifically is being done? Hyperchlorination has been  introduced into the water lines in order to prevent outbreaks of  mass infectious diseases. Farm-by-farm rounds and special  monitoring of wells are regularly being carried out in the rural  areas. Analysis of the water is being done regularly. It is  being boiled before consumption. If it can be seen as the result  of analysis that pesticides have penetrated the wells, the water  is pumped out to the point of complete purity. This is heavy  work, but the villagers are helping the firefighters.    With regard to the radio-nuclides, in the words of Lyakhov,  they are being flushed from the soils, and the rivers of the  Polesye are carrying them into the Dnepr; thus nature itself is  removing some of the radionuclides remaining after the Chernobyl  catastrophe. The hordes of rats, he continues, are a fairy tale.  No one has seen them anywhere. Of course, the flooding has  driven wild animals and various rodents from their habitats.  But, they are not threatening the inhabitants in any case.    Emergency commissions are working in each affected region,  the epidemiologist asserts. So far there are no grounds for  panic; the number of infectious illnesses in the flooded regions  is within the limits of last year's level.</p>

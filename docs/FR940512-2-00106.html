In 1991, a pension plan (the Pension Plan) sponsored by the Employer was terminated, and a form 5310 (Application for Determination upon Termination) was filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a favorable IRS determination was received. At that time the assets of the Pension Plan were merged into the Plan, including the 1/2 interest in the property located at 1831 West Clinch Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee (the Clinch Property). The Plan is a profit sharing plan, currently with 16 participants. As of February 18, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $3,716,331. The Employer is a Tennessee subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in the practice of medicine. The owners and officers of the Employer are the following doctors: Dr. Richard A. Brinner, Dr. Randal O. Graham, Dr. Hugh C. Hyatt, Dr. Michael D. Kropilak and Dr. P. Kevin Zirkle. The Trust Company of Knoxville is the trustee and the named fiduciary for the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Employer was granted an individual exemption by the Department in 1982 (PTE 82&hyph;162), for the Plan and the Pension Plan to purchase (the Past Purchase) the Clinch Property from a certain partnership which was a party in interest with respect to the Plans, and for a subsequent lease (the Past Lease) of the Clinch Property by the Plans to the Employer. The Past Lease was for a term of five years with an option to renew for an additional five years. PTE 82&hyph;162 also required an annual appraisal of the Clinch Property, and for the rentals to be adjusted to reflect the fair market rental value of the Clinch Property. Valley Fidelity Bank and Trust Company (Valley Bank) of Knoxville, Tennessee was the independent fiduciary which monitored the Past Purchase and the Past Lease for the Plans. PTE 82&hyph;162 also provided for an Employer guarantee that if the Clinch Property was ever sold during the initial five year term of the Lease and the five year renewal of the Lease for below the original purchase price, the Employer would indemnify the Plans for the difference between the original purchase price of the Property and the selling price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

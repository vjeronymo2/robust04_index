			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article under general heading: "Some </F> Want Peace, Others Political Points"]    [Text] During the last days of last week a wave of  articles swept through both Russian and foreign mass media.  Their essence may be boiled down to the following sentence:  Russia is losing its role as first violin in the peacemaking in  the former Yugoslavia. This is linked to the success of the  Washington talks on forming a Muslim-Croat federation, as well  as to the fact that Bosnia's Serbs will not join this  federation. It was these "surprise discoveries" that made some  journalists and even politicians say that "the peacemakers'  laurels are passing from Moscow to Washington."    Such statements could even have been ignored owing to their  scant seriousness in the matter of big-time politics. But they  are being made at a time of a certain general cooling in  Russian-U.S. relations and could exacerbate the situation still  further. Therefore, I believe, it should be clearly decided that  Russia and Washington cannot compete to see who will earn more  points out of the tragedy of the Yugoslav peoples. Both great  powers are doing what they can and what is in their power to end  the fratricidal war and to restore a just peace in Bosnia as  quickly as possible. What is more, our countries are agreeing  and coordinating their efforts between themselves. The Bosnian  problem, by the way, is one of the most important on the agenda  of the Vladivostok talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Warren  Christopher.    They really do have something to discuss. Unilateral  initiatives far from always spell success. For example, that  federation in Bosnia and the prospects for forming its  confederation with Croatia. Work on preparing the draft  constitution of the Bosnian federation was completed Sunday  under the Americans' patronage in their embassy building in  Vienna. Its official signing is scheduled for Friday. But it  is not enough to sign a document, it is necessary to make it  work.    Without Serbian participation (and this will hardly be  achieved without Russia) in the "divorce process" the vitality  of the new federation will be in question if only because its  formation provides for the transfer of 60 percent of Bosnia's  territory to Muslim and Croat control. Today approximately 70  percent of the country's territory is in Serb hands. Will they  agree to voluntary concessions? If so, on what terms?    The fact that the federation's creators have left the doors  to it open for the Bosnian Serbs as well is, most likely, simply  a political goodwill gesture. It is obvious that the Serbs, if  the question of their joining anyone at all arises, will choose,  rather, federal Yugoslavia, the present union of Serbia and  Montenegro. This decision will have its pluses and its minuses.  The positive aspects are clearer. The negative aspects are less  obvious but have more complex consequences: The likelihood of  forming a new "Greater Serbia" and "Greater Croatia" is fraught  with a deeper split and growing tension.    The resolution of both the present and the long-term  problems, precisely because of their complexity, requires  concerted joint actions by all the interested sides, not a race  to pick up political points and to maintain the image of  peacemakers.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Japanese banks pay price for poor loans - Other companies Results to be reported this week for the six months to September will show Japan's leading commercial banks still in the mire. They are expected to report - on Thursday and Friday - yet another decline in recurring profits, before tax and extraordinary items, and in net earnings, marking a record four-and-a-half-year profits decline. Non-performing loans will once more have to be written off, a legacy of the explosion of lending, backed by over-valued properties, just before the 1990 collapse in asset prices. Sluggish demand for capital, due to corporate Japan's reluctance to invest in new equipment, has hit lending volumes.</p>

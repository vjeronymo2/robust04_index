			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (8): An attractive proposal - A pipeline could link the UK to wider markets December could see the end Britain's isolation from the continental gas grid with the construction of a pipeline connecting England and Belgium. Such a link could open up trading to and from the vast European gas network, widening horizons for gas companies that have already adapted well to new opportunities in the competitive UK market. But is a pipeline commercially viable and the best option for future UK gas trade? The proposed 300m interconnector consists of a 250km high pressure gas pipeline from Bacton in eastern England to Zeebrugge in Belgium. Although capacity is not definite, the central case has a range of possible flow rates from 9bn cubic metres (Bcm)/yr up to an anticipated maximum 15 Bcm/yr through a 38-inch diameter line. A larger option - a 40-inch line with capacity up to 20 Bcm - is also being considered. An interconnector study group, comprising seven project sponsors - British Gas, British Petroleum, Conoco, Distrigaz of Belgium, France's Elf and Norsk Hydro and Statoil of Norway - has been set up to examine the feasibility of the proposed pipeline link. The UK government, and in particular industry and energy minister Tim Eggar, see in the interconnector as an export route in the short term, providing an outlet for valuable gas exports to the continent. Detractors have suggested low gas prices on continental Europe make it difficult to imagine more expensive gas flowing from the UK to continental buyers. But others suggest present-day prices are irrelevant as there will be a potential surplus of gas from UK continental shelf fields over the next 15 years or so which cannot be absorbed by the UK market alone, already at a high level of penetration. The interconnector's viability would clearly be enhanced by a strong commitment from a leading producer to use this route. There are suggestions the UK government is putting pressure on Norwegian gas producer Statoil to put some of its volumes through the interconnector. The apparent trade-off would be a softening of the UK government position on imports of gas from Norway to the UK. The current Frigg treaty allowing Norwegian imports will expire when Frigg gas runs out in 1996-7, but discussions over a future treaty have reached impasse between the Norwegian and British governments. This is in spite of supply contracts negotiated between Statoil and British buyers such as National Power and ScottishPower. Mr Eggar may be prepared to look more favourably on Norwegian imports in return for support by the Norwegians for the interconnector. Statoil already has four pipelines into continental Europe and is considering a fifth to meet future commitments. While the interconnector route carries additional costs of transporting gas via the British Gas network from St Fergus in Scotland to Bacton, on the plus side it could offer Statoil further diversity of export options. The initial interconnector project concept clearly separated ownership and capacity interests, but interconnector group commercial director Paul Reed said a consistent theme in discussions had been the perceived risk balance between owners and shippers. In May, the group changed its strategy to offer shippers equity in the line linked to the level of booked capacity, to increase the project's chances of success. Given the probable creditworthiness of shareholders in the line and the transport terms, the group does not see financing as problematic. Funding options under consideration include shareholder loans, guaranteed bank loans (possibly including the European Investment Bank) and UK finance leasing. Capital market funding post-completion will also be considered. Shippers expressing interest in using the interconnector must indicate their willingness to make long-term capacity bookings by letter to the steering group by the end of November. A signing meeting for final participants is scheduled for December 8, after which a company will be formed. Mr Reed said about 20 companies had expressed interest in booking capacity. Of these he expects 10-12 to make final commitments. Initial bids for capacity from shippers ranged from around 0.5 Bcm to 3.0 Bcm, with an average around 1.5 Bcm, but some larger bids are expected. BP has already announced it expects to take up to a 20 per cent stake, according to BP managing director John Browne. Mr Reed is confident the interconnector will be built and suggests 'it is not a case of if, but more a case of how big'. The Bacton-Zeebrugge project does not end with construction of the pipeline. Transportation of increased volumes of gas from landing points such as St Fergus or Teesside will require British Gas to reinforce its network, unblocking bottle-necks in the system. Harry Moulson, managing director of BG TransCo, the transportation and storage business unit, has suggested this reinforcement could cost more than the interconnector itself. A working group he established to look at the level of reinforcement required produced three scenarios of different volumes arriving at different terminals. Shippers are being encouraged to give estimates of future demand. Similar reinforcement issues face Belgian gas company Distrigaz which will be carrying gas from Zeebrugge to other European destinations. The study group examined whether the interconnector would be the most economic means of either taking UKCS (UK Continental Shelf) gas into the European market or bringing continental gas into Britain. On comparing the hypothetical cost of transporting gas from a field in the central North Sea to a customer in Germany via the interconnector with the cost of sending gas via a direct line from the field to a German landfall, it found the estimated pre-tax transportation cost per therm of the interconnector route to be about 5.4 pence, 0.5 pence lower than the alternative. While the price advantage may seem insignificant, the group claims advantages in terms of capital efficiency and early cash flow of opting for tariff payments instead of up-front capital expenditure make the interconnector a more attractive option in terms of post-tax cash flow. This benefit is made more significant by the flexibility and grid-to-grid nature of the interconnector. In addition, The interconnector is not field-specific and can offer economies of scale and new trading opportunities such as swaps, peak shaving, aggregation and pooling of capacity.

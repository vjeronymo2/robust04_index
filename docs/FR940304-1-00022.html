			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until now, the investigation of thrust reverser system reliability on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes has not been given as high a priority as the other Boeing models because Model 747 series airplanes have never experienced control problems as a result of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. In fact, previously there had been at least 29 incidents in which the thrust reverser installed on Model 747 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D series engines deployed during flight and the airplane was still controllable. Based on this long safety record and the available evidence up to this time, it has been accepted generally that all Model 747 series airplanes would be shown to be controllable throughout the flight envelope following an in-flight thrust reverser deployment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, however, Boeing has responded to an FAA request for further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation to determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. The investigation results thus far indicate that Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes could experience certain control problems in the event of a thrust reverser deployment occurring during high speed climb or during cruise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of this new information, the FAA has determined that certain inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system on Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, similar to those required previously for Model 757 and 767 series airplanes, are necessary as precautionary actions to provide an acceptable level of safety for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes. Accomplishment of these inspections and functional tests is intended to reduce the exposure of the airplane to potential undetected single failures in the thrust reverser control system. The presence of an undetected failure in the thrust reverser control system, in some cases, can increase the likelihood of an uncommanded thrust reverser deployment in the event of an additional thrust reverser control system failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment of the thrust reverser system reliability of Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, SP, and SR series airplanes is continuing. The FAA may consider rulemaking action for those airplanes based upon the results of that assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletins 747&hyph;78&hyph;2112, dated November 11, 1993 (for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines); 747&hyph;78&hyph;2113, dated November 11, 1993 (for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series engines); and 747&hyph;78&hyph;2115, dated October 28, 1993 (for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G/H series engines). These service bulletins describe procedures for various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed AD also would require that operators submit a report of initial inspection and test results to the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified for these airplanes, at which time the FAA may consider further rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 286 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 39 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines is estimated to be $102,960, or $2,640 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series engines on the U.S. Register. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 60 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $3,300 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G/H series engines on the U.S. Register at this time. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 30 hours to accomplish the proposed actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $1,650 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

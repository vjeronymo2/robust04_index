			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> About 420 temporary workers have left their jobs at the Rancho Seco nuclear  power plant since Sacramento-area residents voted to close it down. The  citizen-owned utility that operated the plant 25 miles southeast of Sacramento  also accepted the resignation of the engineer who was managing it. Separation  notices were expected to be sent to about 1,000 regular plant employees by the  end of the month. "Now that the voters have decided they don't want Rancho  Seco, it's time to move on," said plant boss Joseph Firlit. "I'm a builder, not  an undertaker."  </P></p>

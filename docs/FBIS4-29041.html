			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyoto, June 14 KYODO -- The Kyoto Prefectural  Police Department announced Tuesday [14 June] it will soon issue  a statement expressing regret over its mistaken raid earlier  this month on the offices of a pro-Pyongyang group of Korean  residents in the prefecture.    The Kyoto police said it will present the document to the  Kyoto Chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyun) and other Chongnyun-related groups raided on  unjustified suspicion of violating the National Land Utilization  Law.    The statement will be issued under the name of Hisao  Asakura,  head of the crime prevention department of the prefectural  police, officials said. It will repeat the police's view on the  raid, saying that false information obtained from the Kyoto  municipal government is to blame for the mistake, but that the  Kyoto police regret the trouble given to the Chongnyun groups,  they said. However, Chongnyun demands the Kyoto police  apologize, not just regret.    Police searched 27 Chongnyun-related sites after it was  tipped by the Kyoto City Government that the group contravened  the law obliging purchasers of land to report the deal to  authorities. More than eight hours after the raid, the city  found evidence that the group had reported the purchase of a  43,000-square-meter plot of land it obtained to relocate its  school.    The Kyoto police decided to issue the statement after the  National Police Agency (NPA) instructed it to convey the feeling  of regret clearly, officials said. The NPA also issued a  memorandum Tuesday to all prefectural police departments in  connection with the mistaken raid, asking the heads of the  prefectural police forces to be cautious in investigations and  keep in mind "the rare case" of the raid in Kyoto.</p>

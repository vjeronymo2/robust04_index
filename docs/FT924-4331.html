			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Senior Indian official charged A FORMER leading Indian civil servant and his two sons were yesterday charged with accepting illegal payments of 'tens of millions of rupees' from foreign companies. Mr V Krishnamurthy, a former top figure in state-owned industry, was accused of accepting secret commission payments from unnamed overseas companies while chairman of two state companies - Maruti Udyog, a car manufacturer, and the Steel Authority of India. The Criminal Board of Investigation claimed to have found evidence in support of its allegations during an investigation of Mr Krishnamurthy's role in the Rs35bn (Pounds 820m) Bombay securities market scandal. Yesterday it raided homes and offices belonging to Mr Krishnamurthy and his family. The move shows the board's determination to press home its investigations of the affair even against highly placed figures like Mr Krishnamurthy. Mr Krishnamurthy has extensive political ties, and this raised fears in Delhi last night that the political impact of the scandal could widen. A board of investigation official said the commissions were paid by multinational companies in connection with transactions carried out with government enterprises controlled by Mr Krishnamurthy in his capacity as a public servant. Mr Krishnamurthy's sons, Mr Chandra Krishnamurthy and Mr Jaykar Krishnamurthy, as well as Mr Binoy Jacob, an associate, were also charged. The board said 'tens of millions of rupees' in commission payments were deposited into foreign accounts of Apten Marketing of Delhi and Link Universe, a Hong Kong-registered company, both owned and controlled by Mr Krishnamurthy's sons and Mr Jacob. The companies alleged to have made the payments were not named. Mr Krishnamurthy has previously been charged with illegally accepting Rs2.3m from Mr Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker at the centre of the securities market scandal, in return for political favours. Meanwhile the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has separately refused permission for the local chief executive of Bank of America, the US bank which is involved in the securities market scandal, to extend his posting in India. Under Indian regulations, the central bank must approve the appointment of all top executives at both Indian and foreign banks. Mr Vikram Talwar, head of Bank of America's operations in India, had applied for an extension well before his three-year permit expired on Monday. Bank of America said the refusal to renew his permit was unconnected with the scandal. The Reserve Bank said the decision was taken 'in the normal course' of events. But bankers in Bombay said the decision seemed to be linked to the strong criticism of foreign banks involved in the scandal.</p>

"Three of the speakers -- Lyon, Watt and Mehran -- are members of the  California Building Industry Foundation's Hall of Fame for their industry  achievements."  </P> <P> The conference is sponsored by the Sacramento-based California Building  Industry Assn. and is expected to attract more than 11,000 people to its 40  programs and more than 91,000 square feet of exhibits, according to a  conference spokesman.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of `exclusive' with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by </F> correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert for LE FIGARO and Europe  No. 1; Yeltsin speaks in Russian with simultaneous translation  into French; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Yeltsin. With the  Bosnian business Russia is back in force on the international  scene, and you are publishing with Albin Michel [publishing  house] a very interesting book, full of revelations, entitled  "On the Razor's Edge," where you write about the recent failed  coups. So that is at least two reasons -- there are plenty of  others -- for inviting you to speak to us this morning.    Moscow is a living city again: Everywhere you can see new  shops, but the economic situation is still very worrying. What  do you want to say to the West this morning in order to get real  help?    [Yeltsin] I don't want to persuade people any more. Look at  the results. I have spent more than two years trying to  persuade them -- nearly three. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten  much from this. I am not going to try to persuade anyone  anymore. Let the world and the Western countries, and their  leaders understand for themselves that the situation in Russia  influences the situation in the world as a whole, and whether it  deteriorates. In general, we can carry out all our reforms by  our own efforts.    [Giesbert] Don't you feel basically, that the West has cast  you off?    [Yeltsin] It isn't so easy to cast me off. I will fight.  Perhaps I will cast off my opponent, my rival. As for fate, the  fate of Russia is set, and Russia will not turn away from the  path it is following. Will there be aid from the West or won't  there be? What we are talking about is this: We have to  eliminate two-thirds of the strategic nuclear missiles as soon  as possible, and to do this we need huge sums of money. Of  course we don't have the money. If the West wants us not to have  these missiles, then support us; if you refuse, if you want to  live continuously in fear of these missiles, keep your money!    [Giesbert] So you are saying that if we don't help you,  there  is likely to be chaos?    [Yeltsin] No. You have understood it the wrong way round.  Even if the West does not help us, Russia will follow its path  of renewal and democracy based on a market economy, and respect  for human rights at an international level.    [Giesbert] In your opinion, is Helmut Kohl the statesman who  has best understood Russia today?    [Yeltsin] I have great respect for Bill Clinton, but he  simply has not yet had enough time to study Russia in a serious  way.    Helmut Kohl, simply by virtue of seniority as chancellor,  has  had a real chance to get a good knowledge of the former Soviet  Union and Russia. There is no such international scale to say  one is better than another.    [Geisbert] When we read your book, "On the Razor's Edge," it  is clear that democracy is still fragile in Russia. Do you  think there is still a danger of a coup? You have spoken  optimistically, but anyone reading your book has the impression  that things came very close to disaster.    [Yeltsin] Well, of course, these two coups were an attempt  to  divert us from the path of democracy. But now I cannot see any  serious forces which might hinder us on our path.    Of course, as in any other country, there are communists,  reds, and so on, who have their own program, who hinder us in a  way. For example, we have signed a document on public accord,  and of the 248 organizations -- parties, existing structures,  movements, and social organizations -- which took part, 245  signed [the document]. The communists didn't sign.    I am just sorry, and sorry for them, that they are the ones  losing out, because they keep saying: We are for the people.  But they did not sign the document on accord in Russia, to  ensure that there should not be a civil war.    [Giesbert] You have not talked about Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  the abominable Zhirinovskiy. Isn't he a threat?    [Yeltsin] No.    [Giesbert] Are the Russians too intelligent to return to  demagogy?    [Yeltsin] Our people suffered more than anyone else from  fascism in the war against fascist Germany. We lost 20 million  people in it.    [Geibert] A personal question, Mr. Yeltsin. When we read  your book, we have the impression of a strong man, decisive and  determined, but who is also able to question himself. Why do  you disappear from time to time as you do?    [Yeltsin] No, I am in good health. I am not ill. I do not  miss work for health reasons, but there are important questions,  important problems, documents that have to be worked on. For  example, the treaty on public accord. It needed very special  preparation. I took leave for 12 days, part of my annual leave,  that I certainly have a right to take. I never use all of my  annual leave. But in spring I take 12 days or so, and 12 or so  days in the fall. Usually I use these vacation times to prepare  important initiatives of work on some problem or other. I don't  disappear anywhere, and I don't go away.    [Geisbert] What are the main mistakes made by the West in  the  problem of former Yugoslavia?    [Yeltsin] Of course, if we had united at the very beginning,  if we had worked out a common viewpoint and approach as to how  to put an end to this situation, we would have settled this  situation much faster in a peaceful way. That is the most  important thing.    We all, we and the United States, and the United Nations and  Europe, we were all too late. Once the fire had been kindled,  it was much more difficult to put it out.    [Giesbert] Today, the historic responsibility lies with  you, because it depends on you.    [Yeltsin] You mean Yugoslavia?    [Giesbert] Yes. You are the arbiter. Because you are [word  indistinct] led, because you are the only ones who can still  talk to the Serbs.    [Yeltsin] Well, yes, but there are not only the Serbs there.  There are the Muslims and the Croats and other peoples. And  then, we have gotten rid of our imperialist ambitions. We could  not put pressure on them with our full weight, but with all of  us together we could arrive at an agreement.    [Giesbert] Basically, you see the fault as lying with the  Serbs today?    [Yeltsin] No, with all of those involved.    [Geisbert] Mr. Yeltsin, let me recall the title of your  book,  published by Albin Michel: "On the Razor's Edge." What are you  going to do now? Play tennis?    [Yeltsin] I play on Tuesdays and Saturdays.    [Giesbert] Are you going to take a freezing cold bath today?    [Yeltsin] Yes, indeed. I do that every day.    [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Yeltsin. Have a good bath and a  good day.</p>

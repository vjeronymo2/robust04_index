			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / BA ready to defy French ban on flights to Orly The French government yesterday set the stage for a clash with British airlines after declaring that flights from London to Orly airport in Paris could not start on Monday, the date set by British Airways and Air UK for the launch of their services. The announcement follows last month's European Commission ruling ordering France to open the London-Orly route immediately and is likely to fuel the dispute over the liberalisation of the French airline market. BA rejected the statement from the French government and said it planned to go ahead with services to Orly. 'The French authorities have no right to prevent us from going there. We have the landing rights and we are preparing to operate to and from Orly from Monday,' said a BA spokesman. Air UK said it also intended to operate services from Monday. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said the route would be opened as quickly as possible but that certain problems had to be resolved before services could start. 'For now . . . the flights announced for May 16 do not respect the regulations and therefore cannot take place,' Mr Bosson said. He said there were three problems to be resolved. They were the overcrowding of Orly airport; the need to assure adequate access to Heathrow airport for companies wishing to serve the Orly-Heathrow route; and the need for airlines to adapt their schedules to include the new routes. BA said it did not recognise the basis of the problems. It said there had been no difficulty in obtaining slots at Orly and that it had already made arrangements for handling passengers. With regard to landing rights at Heathrow, BA said there were established procedures for applying for slots. Orly airport, in southern Paris, offers better connections for internal French flights than Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport and is more convenient for many business and residential areas of the capital. BA is planning two flights a day between Heathrow and Orly, with two other flights being operated by TAT, its French affiliate. Air UK, in which KLM of the Netherlands has a 14.9 per cent stake, is planning to operate between London Stansted and Orly. The issue represents a dilemma for the French government which is seeking approval from the European Commission for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn) capital injection for Air France, the loss-making state-owned airline. Brussels has linked approval of the capital injection to the liberalisation of the French airline market.</p>

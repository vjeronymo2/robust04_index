			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Train leasing deal faces Treasury obstacles A Pounds 500m deal to equip the Northern Line of the London Underground with 100 new trains has fallen foul of Treasury guidelines on leasing arrangements, Labour said yesterday. ABB Transportation, the Derby-based manufacturer of rolling stock, has been negotiating with London Underground for several months to build, maintain and operate the new trains under a 20-year licensing deal. But it has run into problems with the Treasury rules. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, condemned the delay in approving the deal as a further example of the failure of the government's private-finance initiative: 'The Treasury seems to be inventing problems.' The problem appears to hinge on a requirement for ABB to assume a greater commercial risk, possibly with payments relating to revenues earned on the Northern Line. The ABB proposals would meet half of the Pounds 1bn costs of modernising rolling stock, signals and track. The newest rolling stock on the line is 34 years old. The Department of Transport said it was carrying out an urgent study to see if the proposals met the Treasury guidelines. News of problems emerged on the same day that Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the private finance panel, was explaining in a Mansion House speech to the City how the initiative was meant to work. The panel was set up by the chancellor in the autumn to identify promising projects and remove blockages to implementing them. Sir Alistair acknowledged that the initiative had become 'diffuse', and that there were varying levels of enthusiasm in government departments. It would be 'months rather than weeks' before results could be expected, he added. However, ABB said it needed a rapid decision if it was to keep open its production line in Derby. It is making similar trains for the Underground's Central Line. London Underground, which has repeatedly complained about a lack of funds, said it welcomed any financing proposal which would allow it to improve the quality of service. It hopes for a decision from the government by the middle of the year. London First, the business consortium which seeks to promote the capital, said it was mystified. 'There is a clear need and benefit to London and in commercial terms the deal ticks all the boxes in the government's private-finance initiative,' it said. The Treasury said it could not confirm or deny that problems had arisen over its leasing guidelines. The guidelines state that there is little attraction in leasing if it simply represents a deferred purchase because this could normally be financed more cheaply - and directly - by the government.</p>

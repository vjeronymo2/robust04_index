			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR REVEALS PATCHWORK PLAN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, during an unusual City Council workshop session  Thursday, outlined a series of fee increases, new fees and one-time payments  that, if adopted by the full council, would balance the city's estimated  $40-million budget shortage.  </P> <P> O'Connor's proposed $40-million revenue package was pieced together with help  from Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, the only other council member still  remaining in council chambers at the end of Thursday's lengthy budget workshop.  </P> <P> "This (package) shows that you can balance the budget" without increasing taxes  that have not been previously approved by the voters, O'Connor said after  Thursday's lengthy meeting.  </P> <P> It was unclear Thursday night, however, if a majority of council members would  accept the makeshift revenue package that is designed to balance the city's  $460-million general fund budget.  </P> <P> The mayor's proposed new revenue sources included several items that seem  likely to win support when the council discusses new revenue during next  Thursday's budget session. Council members have indicated that they hope to  have a balanced budget in place by the end of that meeting.  </P> <P> O'Connor's suggested revenue package includes an estimated $6 million generated  by increasing the business license fee. O'Connor also directed City Hall staff  members to find an additional $6 million through a series of increases that  would affect an unspecified number of existing city fees.  </P> <P> O'Connor also is counting upon $3 million from a previously untapped water and  sewer department fund that city officials now believe can be used to pay  litigation costs generated by the city's continuing attempt to halt San Diego  Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> But the proposed revenue package also includes at least one highly speculative  item, a $13-million payment from the San Diego Unified Port District. Although  the Port District has agreed to pay the city for police and maintenance  services provided on port property, commissioners won't determine the payment  total until Tuesday.  </P> <P> The rest of O'Connor's proposed revenue package would come from a variety of  sources, including increased planning department fees, a delay in capital  improvement projects at Balboa Park and a reduction in revenue used to fund  special promotions,  </P> <P> Some of O'Connor's proposed revenue increases mirrored recommendations made  earlier in the day by two private-sector groups.  </P> <P> For example, the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego County  Taxpayers Assn. recommended that the council increase license fees paid by  businesses.  </P> <P> However, unlike O'Connor, the two groups recommended that the city reconsider a  $20-million property tax increase that would be used to fund the employee  retirement fund.  </P> <P> The council approved the $20-million property tax in January by a 5-4 majority,  but members subsequently reversed field and dropped consideration of increasing  property taxes by $44 per $100,000 of assessed valuation -- or $66 for an  average $150,000 home.  </P> <P> The council has the power to approve the additional property tax without a vote  by the public, but O'Connor and other council members have remained steadfast  against raising property taxes without placing the issue on the ballot.  </P> <P> Using property tax revenue for the employee retirement fund obligation would  free up $20 million in the $456-million general fund, which pays for many basic  municipal services, including public safety, recreation and the libraries.  </P> <P> Increasing the business license fees "is prudent and appropriate," chamber  President Lee Grissom said during council's Thursday budget workshop session.  </P> <P> Council members generally agree that a business license fee increase would  occur. Still undecided, however, is how big that increase will be. However,  O'Connor on Thursday suggested that the council might consider increasing the  licenses that now cost $30 to as much as $125.  </P> <P> The council hopes to use the increased business license fee revenue to pay for  increased costs of a number of City Hall operations, including the treasurer's  office and the auditor.  </P> <P> Although the chamber and the taxpayer's group recommended several revenue  increases, they also are urging council to cut to cut at least $10 million from  existing programs. The taxpayer association also has suggested that the council  drop the proposed $13-million housing trust fund, which is designed to make  housing available to lower-income residents, according to taxpayer's  association executive director Jim Ryan.  </P></p>

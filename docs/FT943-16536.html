			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Electricity After a 7 per cent rise last week, the regional electricity companies have regained all the ground lost relative to the equity market earlier in the year. The reasons for this sudden change of sentiment are hard to pinpoint; full year results and dividends at the top end of expectations, combined with thin trading activity, are the most likely explanations. But there is no new reason for optimism about the forthcoming regulatory review of electricity distribution. One-off price cuts averaging perhaps 20 per cent and annual reductions of 3 to 4 per cent below the rate of inflation still look likely. In April this prospect was enough to send the sector into a spin. True, the latest set of strong results has allowed dividend cover to be increased by rather more than expected. If the same can be achieved this year, the electricity companies will have more freedom for manoeuvre on dividends once the tougher regulatory regime starts to bite. The companies also used the results season to foster optimism about their ability to deliver cost savings. Shareholders will feel the benefit if efficiencies beyond those demanded by the regulator can be delivered. Even taking these factors together it is difficult to argue that the outlook for dividend growth has been transformed. But the bulls and bears of the sector are separated by shades of optimism about whether the electricity companies can build enough dividend cover and cut costs fast enough to offset the coming regulatory squeeze. The pendulum of opinion could just as easily swing back the other way.</p>

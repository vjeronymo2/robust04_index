			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FAMILY-CARE PLAN NEARS COMPLETION  </P> <P> The city is in the final stages of planning what will be Anaheim's first  publicly financed facilities to care for children and senior citizens.  </P> <P> About 40 family-care specialists, community representatives and city officials  have been working on the project since the Family Care Consortium started in  November.  </P> <P> The completed plan will be released in April.  </P> <P> The centers will probably include centers for infants and school-age children.  Before- and after-school care is a priority in the city since the Anaheim City  School District is starting a year-round schedule in June.  </P> <P> In addition, tentative plans call for increased parental education and training  programs for family day-care providers who care for children at home. The city  may set up a telephone hotline to distribute this information.  </P> <P> Kelly Hogrefe, child-care coordinator for the city, said the consortium has  developed a rough draft of the family-care proposal. A cost estimate will be  issued after consortium members hold their final meeting next month.  </P></p>

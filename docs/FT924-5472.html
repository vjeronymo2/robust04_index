			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Illinois Tool launches rival bid for Siddons ILLINOIS Tool Works, the US engineering group, yesterday emerged as a rival bidder for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group for which BBA, the UK component maker, has offered ADollars 86m (USDollars 58.8m). WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool, said it had offered ADollars 2 a share for Siddons, valuing the company at ADollars 94m. Pacific BBA, an Australian subsidiary of BBA, offered ADollars 42m in cash and shares worth ADollars 44m. Siddons, which has rejected the BBA offer, did not respond to the announcement by Deutsher. Siddons is seeking an order from the federal court to force Pacific BBA to increase the information in its offer document. Siddons claims the document does not provide shareholders with sufficient information to make an informed assessment of the true value of the share element of the offer. Mr Graham Johnston, Deutsher managing director, said that the Illinois Tool offer was subject to 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which monitors overseas investment. Mr Johnston said Siddons was a leading customer of Deutsher, while Illinois Tool Works was an importer of Siddons products. He said Siddons would continue to operate separately if the bid succeeded. Illinois Tool is a multinational manufacturer of engineering components and systems. The group's head office is in Illinois, but it operates in more than 35 countries and employs about 18,700 people. It reported net profits of USDollars 180m in 1991, on revenues of USDollars 2.6bn. Campbell Soup, the US foods group, said the Australian Securities Commission had granted it an extension until December 11 to mail takeover documents to shareholders of Arnotts, the Australian bakery group, Reuter reports from Sydney. The documents originally had to be in the hands of shareholders yesterday. Campbell had sought the extension on Monday after it said it had disagreed with the Arnotts board's interpretation of a 1985 heads of agreement between the two companies.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures recovered strongly after the previous session's steep setback, but activity was low and the uptrend lacked conviction, writes Jeffrey Brown. Traders said the market was in drift mode, uncertain of direction. Dealing volume was flat, slipping to just 10,383 contracts, against 15,099 on Monday. In the event, the FT-SE 100 December contract closed 26 points stronger at 3019.0 after touching a high of 3023.0 at stage. At these levels the premium to the cash market was 17.2 points, with the fair value premium standing at 14.4 points. Turnover was very thin, with only a number of modest runs by locals - independent traders - to occasionally enliven the proceedings. Traders said that many houses were keeping their books very tight following Monday's shock profits warning from SG Warburg. News of bad derivatives experience at the top securities house weighed heavily on sentiment and was cited as a major reason for the day's low activity. Turnover in traded options also fell, declining to 23,427 lots from 35,586 in the previous session.  FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 9,628 contracts. HSBC was the most actively traded individual stock option with 2,194 lots dealt.</p>

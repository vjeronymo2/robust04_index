			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 22 March  publishes articles on personnel changes in the National Property  Fund of the Slovak Republic (FNM SR) and on the first steps  taken by the new leadership.    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 22 March on page 1 carries a  400-word "asa"-signed report entitled "M. Knit: I Expect Changes  in the FNM Presidium and Executive Committee." The report notes  that "on Friday, 18 March, the FNM SR Presidium withdrew from  Jan Kato the authorization to hold the post of chairman of the  FNM SR Executive Committee. It charged Karol Danys, a member of  the FNM Executive Committee, with the provisional management of  the FNM Executive Committee." The report then quotes M. Knitl,  a member of the FNM Presidium, as having told SME that "he  expects parliament to devote itself in the very near future to  the election of new members of the FNM Presidium and assumes  that changes in the FNM Executive Committee will follow suit."  Asked whether he believes that "political criteria prevailed  over professional criteria in the election of current members of  the FNM Executive Committee," Knitl concedes that "in some  cases, the two criteria were not in conformity." Confronted  with "claims casting doubt on some privatization projects" that  were approved by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before its  dismissal, Knitl says that "the FNM has been only the  implementor of government resolutions" and can be made  responsible only for the technical realization of projects.    On the same page, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a  100-word  interview with Karol Danys, "a member of the FNM SR Executive  Committee charged with its management," by an "asa"-attributed  SME reporter. The interview, the place and date of which are  not given, is published under the headline "We Have Agreed To  Freeze FNM Accounts." In the interview, Danys announces that  "we have agreed with the minister of privatization to ban  trading in FNM securities and to freeze its accounts. To  prevent the situation regarding privatization, around which  there is plenty of confusion, from deteriorating, we have agreed  to halt all property transfers."</p>

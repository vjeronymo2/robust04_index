			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Herzog Is Not a Candiodate of the </F> Liberals"]    [Text] Burkhard Hirsch, spokesman of the FDP [Free  Democratic Party] Bundestag group, has called on Roman Herzog  not to run as the government coalition's candidate for the  presidency. "Herzog is a candidate of the Union, not of the  liberals" he told HANDELSBLATT.    Hirsch explained that the president of the Constitutional  Court was trying to secure his election by exerting political  pressure on the FDP. "In this connection, we had to resolve the  coalition issue very quickly to win back our maneuvering space,"  he said.    Hirsch did not say which candidate the FDP would vote for,  but made it clear that it would back Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in  the first two rounds of voting. If no decision is reached by  then, the liberals will vote for one of the two remaining  candidates, said Hirsch. "I support Johannes Rau because I  consider him the right man to bring the two parts of Germany  closer together," he said. But he added that should the FDP  faction vote for Herzog, he would accept this.    Hirsch considers it wrong to criticize the  economic-political  powers of the FDP, even if his party has abandoned its original  stance vis-a-vis nursing care insurance. "One cannot expect the  FDP on its own to resolve a problem in the teeth of public  opinion," said Hirsch, explaining his decision to vote for the  law on nursing care insurance. He said that in this law, the  liberals had achieved adequate compensation for employers, so  that the work factor does not become an even greater burden on  employment.    Hirsch considers his own position inside the FDP secure;  after all, he achieved the fourth best result in the elections  to the chairmanship of the North Rhine-Westphalia FDP branch.  Leftist liberals are certainly not finished inside the FDP, he  said. Therefore he expects Gerhart Baum to regain his seat in  the Bundestag. "I am tired of being treated as a liberal fossil  all the time," said Hirsch.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Bonn attack on recycling bill GERMANY'S plan to introduce innovative environmental legislation forcing producers to take back and recycle consumer goods is badly conceived and threatens enterprises, parliamentarians said yesterday. Dealing a blow to the government, members of the coalition parties in parliament said the bill had to be significantly changed before it would gain parliamentary approval. The draft law, the first of its kind in Europe, was tabled by the government in April and aims to encourage the collection and recycling of consumer durables. Specific recycling requirements for different products would then be decreed by the federal ministry for the environment and the applications of these legal requirements would be left to the Lander governments. Parliamentarians yesterday warned against allowing state authorities to have too much power in deciding how recycling requirements are carried out. 'Recycling must stay in the hands of the enterprises,' said Mr Gerhard Friedrich, Christian Democratic Union MP in the environment committee. 'We must also make sure that the law is not going to lead to excessive bureaucracy,' he added. In particular, coalition MPs fear that the law would be misused in Lander which are governed by opposition Social Democrats calling for stricter recycling laws. Social Democrats, who control the Bundesrat, the German upper chamber in the parliament, recently said they would only adopt the draft law if tougher requirements were put in place. They want, among others, stricter recycling quotas for consumer goods and bans on specific chemicals used to produce consumer goods. Coalitions MPs say such requirements could hinder the competitiveness of German companies and would especially burden small and medium-sized companies. They are instead calling on the government to let companies decide how to recycle the goods they would have to take back from consumers. Higher fees for landfills would also encourage manufacturers to find recycling technologies for their products, they say.</p>

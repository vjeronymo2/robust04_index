			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Relocation puts Chemex Intl in loss The costs of moving premises put Chemex International, the chemical analysis company, back into loss in the first half to March 31. After making its first annual profit of Pounds 52,000 in the 12 months to September 30 1992, the company reported an operating loss of Pounds 53,700 in the period under review, which it attributed mainly to the loss of business during the move. Exceptional items totalling Pounds 43,000 increased the loss before tax from Pounds 64,900 in the previous first half to Pounds 94,200. The exceptional items consisted of Pounds 16,600 in relocation costs together with the Pounds 26,400 cost of the capital reduction, which effectively halved the number of shares in issue. Mr Brian Webbe, chairman, said that in the long term the relocation would reduce property costs by about Pounds 50,000 per year, increase usable space by 50 per cent and improve efficiency. Sales rose 36 per cent to Pounds 610,600 (Pounds 450,300).</p>

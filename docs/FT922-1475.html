			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (9): New angles taken on information - Hypertext HYPERTEXT allows users to search large bodies of text, data and graphics from a friendly, graphical front-end. It provides built-in links between related concepts, subjects and areas of knowledge, making it easier for users to amalgamate the data that is relevant to them at the time. The technique is widely used in personal computer software to provide 'Help' information. If, for example a user wants to know about a function in a program, a detailed explanation can be called up using Hypertext technique. Hypertext treats knowledge as a mountain of information to be viewed from an infinite number of angles. This is a far more useful way to access information than reading through a number of reference books, which present text and graphics in a static, unchanging format. But hypertext does not only allow infinite views of one set of information. It also directs the viewer from one side of the mountain to another, and it allows browsers to build composite views of different scenes of the same mountain. Looking at information in this way goes against the traditional view of accessing data. Hypertext is closer in many respects to the spoken than to the printed word. In both cases, there is a body of changing, free-form knowledge that can be discussed and presented in appropriate formats for the audience concerned. Parents tell stories differently to their children than they do to friends and older relations, for example. They use the same basic knowledge to tell different versions of a story, but use different formats to do so. Just as thoughts, experiences and language are changeable and amorphous entities, so is the information that can be interpreted by hypertext systems. Hypertext builds further on the accepted concept of storing digital information on computers. This data is already much more flexible than a printed equivalent. It can be electronically distributed among many users, it can be mixed and matched with other digital information, it can be changed and updated quickly and easily, it can be printed out, or it can stay on the computer and just be read on-screen. In another dimension, it makes it much easier to draw relationships between different sets of data, or graphics, or even single words. An intelligent hypertext system can also point users from one concept to another, open up new applications or trigger external events, such as printing or accessing another data source. It will lead users back through the stages through which they have already been, so that they avoid the feeling of being 'lost in space' that so many on-line text retrieval systems engender. The practical applications of hypertext have only recently emerged. The best known generic application is probably the on-line help functions within software packages, such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's System 7 operating system. The widespread use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) means that there is a wider audience for user friendly, mouse driven hypertext help systems than in the past. The aim of software developers working with hypertext is to remove the need for users to constantly consult bulky reference manuals when they want to ask a question about a routine or a menu. Hypertext links allow developers to 'second-guess' which areas of a manual users are likely to want to move on to after asking their first question. It is likely that a user of a word processor looking for help on how to use external files will consequently need to know which files they can import, for example. A good hypertext system will suggest the next area to look at by shading a particular menu option, or showing a subject in a pop-up box. A second generic application for hypertext is electronic publishing. This can mean providing technical or quality management manuals as hypertext systems. Users access manuals via their laptop or desktop PC, rather than consult a number of reference books. Hyperlinks take users by the hand through different sections of a body of knowledge, prompting them with signposts to the next relevant area. It is likely that Hypermedia systems, which add video and sound to reference material, will be particularly useful for manuals, computer-based training and on-line help facilities. But the ultimate scope of hypertext is enormous. At one end of the scale, users can write their own manuals or reference documents, using a product such as Apple's Hypercard or Lotus FasText. Independent consultants can help set up networked corporate hypertext systems or organisations can buy electronic publishing systems such as Interleaf's WorldView or SD-Scicon's Q- Doc. The fact that hypertext aids the fast search and correlation of information means that it is most heavily used in the academic world. The best known and most ambitious hypertext system is Ted Nelson's Xanadu project, which aims to give as many people as possible access to every source of information in the world. For most organisations, hypertext has an immediate - although smaller scale - effect on corporate information retrieval.</p>

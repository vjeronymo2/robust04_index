			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISFITS IN THE URBAN COLLAGE;  </P> <P> RUSHDIE'S CHARACTERS COULD BE OUR NEW NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> Of what relevance is Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" in the City of  Angels? Why does this celebrated tale of self-doubting Muslims in London and  Bombay resonate so in the corner mini-malls and polylingual schools of this  city of migrants?  </P> <P> "The Satanic Verses" is really a novel about the metamorphosis of the  contemporary world brought about by migration and communication. It is about  the conflicts within individuals and between cultures that result from the  immediate juxtaposition in time (mass media, telecommunications) and space  (migration) of very different world views and civilizations. It is is a novel  about the conflicts and spiritual dislocation of fragmented individuals in a  fragmented world wrestling with its plural identities. "The Satanic Verses" is  a novel about the frictions of the global collage, the kind of frictions that  transpire daily in global cities like Los Angeles, which have no identity other  than their plurality: We are a little bit Seoul, Saigon, Taipei, Hong Kong,  Mexico City, Managua, San Salvador, Tokyo, even Tehran.  </P> <P> In Rushdie's celebrated work the traditional world is blown apart by the  metamorphosing agency of a 747 jumbo jet. "Up there in air-space," the author  writes, "in that soft imperceptible field which had been made possible by the  century and which, thereafter, made the century possible, becoming one of its  defining locations, the place of movement and of war, the planet-shrinker and  power-vacuum, most insecure and transitory of zones, illusory, discontinuous,  metamorphic -- because when you throw everything up in the air anything becomes  possible."  </P> <P> Rushdie speaks of migrants who ply the routes between different worlds as  "fragments, absurd, debris of the soul . . . (with) broken memories,  sloughed-off selves, severed mother tongues, untranslatable jokes, extinguished  futures, lost loves, the forgotten meaning of hollow, booming words, land,  belonging, home." These migrants from the past long for the certitude of  origins but only "embrace air."  </P> <P> The immigrants in "The Satanic Verses" are split identities, hybrids. The movie  star, Gibreel Farishta, plays 11 roles simultaneously; the radio personality,  Saladin Chamcha, has 44 different voices.  </P> <P> As a Bombay-born Muslim, Rushdie must ask himself the same questions as the  other 900,000 Muslims residing in Britain: "Am I Indian, Pakistani, British?"  Like Dr. Aziz, a character in one of Rushdie's earlier novels, "Midnight's  Children," who loses his faith because he is unable to accept the unarguable  absolutes of religion, Rushdie is left "with a hole inside, a vacancy in the  vital inner chamber." In the way of the Westerner, Rushdie the immigrant turns  from faith to literature as the medium of his doubt and reconciliation between  worlds, between past and future.  </P> <P> "What I am saying in 'Satanic Verses'," Rushdie has remarked, "is that we have  got to come to terms with our plural identities. We are increasingly becoming a  world of migrants, made up of bits and fragments from here, there. We are here.  And we have not really left anywhere where we have been." Just as migration  transplants other pasts into our present, the information age carries our  present time into the otherworld of Islamabad, Khartoum, Tehran.  </P> <P> The furor caused by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence of Rushdie  mimics the very theme of "The Satanic Verses." Rushdie's life could be at risk  only in the very kind of world that his novel describes -- a world of global  integration in which the blasphemous can engage in a fatal "war of  nomenclatures," a clash of faiths and languages. It is the Word against words.  Milan Kundera has said that the novel is able to exist in the West because it  requires ambiguity and relativity, not a unique truth that must be conformed  to. Rushdie the novelist, like the Western novel itself, blasphemes the  absolute; Khomeini blasphemes the only sacred values of the West: skepticism,  relativism, pluralism and tolerance.  </P> <P> Not in his most fertile imaginative moments could Rushdie have dreamed up a  scene where the ancient religious rivalries that drive Iran's revolutionary  politics are played out on the bookshelves of America's chain stores, nor could  he have envisioned a united, usually squabbling Western Europe rising to the  defense of the idea of the novel. How very extraordinary, after decades of  hardened balance-of-power Realpolitik, that the world should be divided between  those who defend the possibility of literature and those who don't.  </P> <P> Now that the Cold War has lost its impetus, it seems our new preoccupation will  be with the Battle of the Novel, or as Rushdie himself prefers to put it, the  War of the Word -- a drama of struggle between different civilizations that  must live in one interdependent world.  </P> <P> For the moment, Rushdie and Khomeini, the main protagonists of the story, are  tasting the fate of all actors in the paradox of history. Inadvertently,  Rushdie's "sacrilege" has resuscitated Khomeini's waning fundamentalist fervor  -- infidel as evangelist. Inadvertently, Khomeini's death sentence, against  Rushdie but really against the idea of the novel, has revived the waning  importance of literature in the West -- imam as literary agent.  </P> <P> Such are the unexpected twists of plot, the play of contraries, that we will  learn to expect as this grand drama of the closing years of the last modern  century unfolds.  </P></p>

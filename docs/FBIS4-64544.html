			<p>BFN     [Text] In a letter to President Clinton, Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller has informed him as follows: "The Turkish Cypriot  side has done what it was expected to do on the Cyprus problem.  You should now try to influence the Greek Cypriot side."    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller decided to send a letter after  she returned from the United States and after Volkan Vural,  chief adviser to the Prime Minister's Office, visited north  Cyprus. The letter was conveyed to the U.S. Embassy in Ankara  on Friday [29 April]. A copy of it was conveyed to the Turkish  Embassy in Washington. Ciller's letter was also in reply to a  letter she received from President Clinton before the local  elections in Turkey.    According to circles close to the Prime Minister's Office,  the message that was conveyed in Ciller's letter to President  Clinton was: "TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]  President Rauf Denktas agreed to the confidence-building  measures [CBM's]. That was what he was expected to do.  However, the CBM's package was later changed. In view of that,  the ball is now in the Greek Cypriot side's court. We ask you  to try to see to it that the Greek Cypriot side takes a  conciliatory approach."    It will be recalled that President Clinton met Prime  Minister  Tansu Ciller at the White House last month. He asked her to  pressure Denktas to agree to the CBM's.</p>

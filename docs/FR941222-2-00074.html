RTC has submitted a statement of willingness to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and is willing to negotiate with RTC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS' willingness to enter into negotiations with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below. If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the rights-of-way for trail purposes is subject to restoration for railroad purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the financial assistance process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) (Trails), offers of financial assistance (OFA) to acquire rail lines for continued rail service or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim trail use conditions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  49 CFR 1152.27(e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail use may proceed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The statement in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Trails <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  that section 10905 does not apply to abandonment or discontinuance exemptions has since been superseded by our adoption of rules allowing OFAs in these exemption proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  49 CFR 1152.27.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> KCS has filed an environmental report addressing the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources.

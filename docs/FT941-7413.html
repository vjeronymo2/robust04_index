			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Italian Elections (March 27): The rise and rise of Berlusconi - Robert Graham on growing support for Italian media magnate's new political party 'Watching our support grow has been like looking at a temperature gauge that climbs up and up,' says an exultant Roberto Lasagna, campaign manager for media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. As the campaign for Italy's general elections on March 27 opens today, Mr Lasagna claims his organisation's polls give Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia at least 35 per cent of the vote nationwide. If sustained over the next month such support would give the 57-year-old owner of the Fininvest media group, who entered the ring only in January, a good chance of heading the next government. 'There is no precedent in Europe of an entrepreneur entering politics like this, so close to an election and with a completely new political movement,' says Mr Lasagna. 'Within less than four months of being created, one in three voters who have made their minds, is backing Forza Italia.' The sudden impact of Mr Berlusconi owes something to his novelty value at a time when Italy's traditional parties have collapsed and their leaders have been discredited by corruption scandals. He is a genuinely new face even if he is a household name because his Fininvest media group controls 85 per cent of commercial television. The secret of his success is the way he has exploited his wealth and his media outlets with sophisticated marketing to launch himself and Forza Italia. It is no accident Mr Lasagna should be campaign manager. He headed Saatchi and Saatchi's Italian operations and has stepped down to act unpaid as co-ordinator and image maker - what he cheerfully describes as 'panic manager'. In the month since he decided to run for parliament, Mr Berlusconi's three national channels and the host of local television stations he controls have been reaching into the homes of more than 40 per cent of Italians. Screens have been flooded with spots of a smiling Mr Berlusconi promising in his soft Milanese voice a 'new Italian miracle'. Calling himself a liberal, he says he has entered politics to prevent the left - dominated by the former-communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) - from running the country. He promises to create jobs, stimulate economic recovery and lower taxes. Although Mr Berlusconi's opponents criticise his platform as over-simplified and dangerous demagogy, he has found an audience and he knows how to charm. In his student days he worked as an entertainer on a cruise and has made a lot of money out of popular entertainment. He and his advisers calculate many people are unashamedly middle-brow, confused by the collapse of the old political order and take comfort in the role model of a wealthy self-made man. He also is not the innocent he looks. To survive and succeed in business, he had to fight through the political jungle and his ambitions have been maturing for a good year. He began setting up a series of Forza Italia clubs last September, each with a nucleus of 50 people and self-financing through their own contributions and subsequently inter-linked by computer. These were modelled on the experience of his AC Milan football supporters' clubs (hence the name Forza Italia - the cry of Come On Italy). Mr Berlusconi had intended the entire club network to be placed at the disposal of the centrist movement of Mr Mario Segni, the former Christian Democrat referendum leader. However, the two could not see eye to eye and late in the day Mr Berlusconi decided to use the clubs directly himself. Without Mr Segni, Mr Berlusconi turned for political support to the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi in the north and in the south to the National Alliance, the renamed neo-facist MSI movement of Mr Gianfranco Fini. This coalition of forces is now crudely defined as a right-wing alliance, facing the PDS-dominated Progressive alliance on the left and a rump in the centre made up largely of the former Christian Democrats regrouped in the Popular party (PPI) and Mr Segni's Pact for Italy. Now that the campaign proper has begun, strict rules apply on electoral propaganda. 'For us the campaign in a sense has ended,' says Mr Lasagna. Mr Berlusconi has limited access to his trump card, his own media. He must now shake hands and hold public meetings. With more than 60 per cent of voters undecided, according to a poll yesterday, the real battle is only just beginning.</p>

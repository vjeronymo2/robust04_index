			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Goran Gotev: "United States, NATO, and </F> United Nations Have Declared War on the Serbs"]    [Text] The United States and NATO have entered into a war  against the Bosnian Serbs. This time, without the usual  ultimatum given in such cases, U.S. F-16 planes from the NATO  base in Aviano dropped three bombs on 10 April about 13 km  southwest of Gorazde. Yesterday NATO aircraft renewed the air  strikes.    Throughout Sunday the Western media agitated for these  strikes. Report after report came off the printers that the  Serbs had already entered Gorazde, that chemical weapons had  been used, causing about 1,500 deaths, that street fighting was  going on in the town, and that thousands of patients were  fleeing in panic to avoid becoming victims of a Serbian  slaughter. Thus, this time, the world electronic media carried  out the preliminary "softening up by artillery bombardment."  When the U.S. Phantoms [as published] carried out their air  strikes, it was even immediately insinuated that they had been  approved by the UN secretary general and that Russia had also  given her consent. Subsequently it turned out that President  Clinton was unable to answer a question that President Yeltsin  asked him on the telephone as to whether Butrus-Ghali had  approved the air strikes against the Serbs. It also  materialized that Yeltsin had not only not given his consent to  the strikes, but had demanded an urgent meeting of the UN  Security Council to discuss the issue.    Now it is already clear that the U.S. bombs dropped near  Gorazde had been planned in advance. This act of war was  already known about when U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry  and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Council of Joint Chiefs  of Staff were assuring the world that the United States and NATO  did not plan any intervention around Gorazde. By saying this,  they simply inflamed the Serbs' ambitions to capture the town,  because for them it represented an important guarantee, as it  transformed the Drina River into a Serbian river, instead of a  border between Bosnia and Serbia.    Furthermore, it is no accident that the United States and  NATO are joining the side of one of the warring parties at the  moment when no other than the Bosnian Serbs made a comprehensive  proposal for a lasting and stable peace. However, it transpired  that the Bosniaks feared that it might lead to the present front  lines becoming border divisions.    Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin arrived in Belgrade to  try to persuade the Serbs to put an end to the war. However, it  is much more uncertain whether U.S. special envoy Charles Redman  will persuade the Bosnians to stop counting on warfare and  international military intervention, especially at a moment when  this intervention has already begun.    As a first emotional reaction, the Bosnian Serbs broke off  relations with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. It is doubtful  whether this is a sensible step. Now no one should try to  pretend to be offended or insulted. It is not the right time  now for either bad blood or acts of revenge, but the time for  immediately resuming the negotiations process, with all three  parties taking part on an equal footing. As the war approaches  its second anniversary this month, let this not mark the  beginning of a new war, this time with the participation of the  16 NATO states.</p>

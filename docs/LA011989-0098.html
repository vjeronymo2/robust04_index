			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENT FOR HOTEL PROJECT  </P> <P> In a move to speed planning for a proposed luxury hotel at the defunct  Marineland in Rancho Palos Verdes, John E. Corcoran, 45, has been named vice  president for development of the Monaghan Co., which purchased the 102-acre  seaside property in May, 1987.  </P> <P> Corcoran, who was general manager of Marineland when it closed, has been a  consultant on the project since its inception.  </P> <P> The city in November sent back two envelopes of documents to Arizona-based  developer James Monaghan, complaining of delays and missed deadlines in the  hotel planning process. The city invited Monaghan to submit complete  applications later.  </P> <P> Corcoran said his new position gives him "authority . . . to head up the  project and make decisions. . . . Part of this is to speed up the project and  coordinate all different design phases."  </P> <P> Corcoran declined, however, to predict when a completed project and application  package will be given to the city.  </P></p>

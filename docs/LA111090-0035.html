			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARWINISTS, CREATIONISTS AND EVOLUTION  </P> <P> When, oh when, are people ever going to understand poor Charles Darwin? The  latest misunderstanding in your paper was submitted by a law professor,  presumably an educated person. In an attempt to expose the unfortunate  compatibility of science and bias, Prof. Johnson merely revealed a mixture just  as regrettable -- education and ignorance.  </P> <P> "Darwinists begin by assuming that science excludes the possibility of a  creator." This is a statement by Johnson. Darwinists do not now, and have  never, assumed this. Darwin's book is titled "The Origin of Species," not the  origin of life -- there is a difference. Darwin's theory is an attempt to  explain the generation of species after an initial creation of life. Darwin  actually considered himself unqualified to speculate on the origin of life, and  declared this lacking in his book.  </P> <P> BILL COLESON  </P> <P> Meiners Oaks, Calif.  </P></p>

These bureaus,  which will become operational within a few days, will be mainly  devoted to commercial, economic, and consular transactions. The  Senegalese Government has appointed Amadou Kebe to head the  bureau. He was previously first advisor at the Foreign Ministry  and is currently director of the Africa-Asia Bureau of that  ministry. For its part, the RSA Government has appointed Ms.  (Wanda Wald) who will assume the same duties in Dakar. These  bureaus will be upgraded to embassy level probably after the  South African elections.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, who for some time now  has been known as "President Feliciano" by those who currently  reject Abimael Guzman Reynoso's leadership, has reportedly  simultaneously ordered an increase in Shining Path [SL] actions  in Lima and the transfer of SL bases and refuge areas to border  regions, so as to expedite SL escape abroad in case of possible  defeat.    This is according to an intelligence report based on  statements made by Shining Path members who have resorted to the  repentance law and who have been in contact with Ramirez  Durand's lieutenants.    There are indications that a few months ago "Feliciano"  tried  to meet with terrorist cadres operating as "roving" columns in  Azangaro and Melgar, in Puno. There is also, however, testimony  that Ramirez Durand is currently in the Gran Pajonal jungle area  in Pasco. Another theory states that he is in Lima, personally  heading the so-called "Neighborhood Class Movement" [Movimiento  Clasista Barrial] in Lima shantytowns.    The fact is that a so-called "Emergency Central Committee"  has started to operate in Lima. This committee seeks to  coordinate actions in seven areas in the outskirts of Lima, in  the same places where the establishment of an "iron belt" was  attempted, before Abimael Guzman's fall, to strangle and take  over the city.    Ramirez Durand reportedly has a contingent of about 200 SL  members called the "People's Guerrilla Army" [Ejercito  Guerrillero Popular]. They are armed, and the majority of them  have been selected for their "loyalty" and for having shown  cruelty and the capacity to strictly follow "orders."    They are like robots, willing to sacrifice themselves for  "Feliciano," who holds complete control over them. Only a few  of them personally know him, however.    Intelligence souces report that "what they ignore is that  Ramirez Durand will employ the `sausage' [salchichon] policy  against them: When he sees he has lost, he will leave them  behind as cannon fodder [carne de canon] to cover his withdrawal.    They will be grouped in platoons to divert attention or to  halt the Army's advance so that "Feliciano" can escape to the  "refuge" areas.</p>

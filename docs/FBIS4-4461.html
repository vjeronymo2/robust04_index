			<p>BFN     [Text] The governor of the State Bank, Mr. Cao Sy Kiem,  recently signed a decision to adjust the rate of capital  reissued by the State Bank to commercial, investment, and  development banks, to 95 percent. The rate is 85 percent to the  Agriculture Bank.    The rate of capital reissued will be calculated in  accordance  with the interest rate applicable on projects to be reissued  with capital. For special cases the governor will make separate  decisions.    The Gold, Silver and Precious Stones General Company will  lend capital to supplement working capital at the interest rate  of 1.6 percent per month. This interest rate is effective 1  April 1994.    Interest rates for other types of capital lending between  the  State Bank and State Treasury and other credit organizations are  unchanged and are still regulated by the decision dated 30  September 1993. Compulsory deposits of commercial banks that  exceed the legal limit determined by the governor will receive  an interest with the rate twice as high as the current interest  rate applicable for savings of credit organizations deposited  with the State Bank.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS SILBERMAN NEEDS PROFESSIONAL HELP;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE PROMINENT SAN DIEGO BUSINESSMAN, WHO APPARENTLY TOOK AN OVERDOSE  OF SLEEPING PILLS, IS SAID TO BE WORRIED HE WON'T GET A FAIR TRIAL.  </P> <P> Richard T. Silberman's lawyer repeated his contention Wednesday that the  prominent San Diego businessman's right to a fair trial has been jeopardized  and said he would oppose prosecutors' request to revoke Silberman's $500,000  bail.  </P> <P> But lawyer James Brosnahan said the "first priority" is to make sure that  Silberman, who disappeared for two days last week just two months before he was  due to stand trial on federal money-laundering charges, gets appropriate  professional care.  </P> <P> "I know the world sometimes likes to be cynical," Brosnahan said in a phone  call from his San Francisco office. "But the first priority is to make sure  that Mr. Silberman is supported professionally and taken care of, as those  needs exist."  </P> <P> Brosnahan did not elaborate on what sorts of professional attention -- medical  or psychiatric -- might benefit Silberman, or where Silberman has been since  leaving a Las Vegas hospital Monday. "Under the circumstances, he's getting  along OK," Brosnahan said. "And he's, I think, he's improving. That's good."  </P> <P> The lawyer declined to comment on any non-legal issue relating to the  disappearance, saying Silberman's family would release a statement today  detailing "more information about what the situation is and so forth."  </P> <P> Silberman, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was found  unconscious in a Las Vegas hotel room Saturday -- two days after he abruptly  vanished from San Diego -- in what prosecutors have called an apparent suicide  attempt. Silberman, due to stand trial April 10, had swallowed an unknown  number of prescription pills, Brosnahan has said.  </P> <P> Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three others are accused of  laundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI agent who had characterized  it as proceeds from a Colombian drug dealer. An FBI report released Friday, the  day after Silberman was reported missing, alleges that Silberman confessed to  the money-laundering scheme.  </P> <P> In legal papers filed Tuesday, prosecutors claimed Silberman's disappearance  raised the possibility that he would vanish again, this time to evade trial.  But Brosnahan said Wednesday that he would contend in a legal brief he planned  to file today that there is "no basis" to revoke Silberman's bail.  </P> <P> Though Silberman did go to Las Vegas after telling his family he was heading to  Orange County for a meeting, he "was entitled to travel in the United States"  and the request to revoke bail is "not a serious" one, Brosnahan said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also said Silberman's departure raised so many questions about  Silberman's mental state that he should be forced to see a psychiatrist to  learn if he is still mentally competent to stand trial.  </P> <P> But Brosnahan said Wednesday that might not be necessary. The papers he planned  to file today would make it clear that "we'll be able to deal with that in such  a way that won't become a big problem for anybody." He declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. also said Tuesday that it was  "outrageous" for Brosnahan to have contended from Las Vegas over the weekend  that Silberman could not receive a fair trial before U.S. District Judge J.  Lawrence Irving, who is presiding over the money-laundering case.  </P> <P> In an opinion issued last week rejecting a defense request to block the  introduction at the trial of FBI testimony about comments Silberman made to  several agents upon arrest last April, Irving characterized those comments as  "self-incriminating."  </P> <P> "My only position with regard to that, and it's one I'm not going to change, is  that reference should not be made," Brosnahan said. "And, in fact, it should be  stricken from his opinion. Whether (Irving) will do that or not, I don't know.  An accurate contention would describe it as the contention of FBI agents.  That's all it is."  </P> <P> Irving's comment convinced Silberman that the judge had overstepped his  authority and could not be fair, prompting Silberman's disappearance, Brosnahan  said Sunday in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Irving also ordered the release of the FBI report detailing the alleged  confession after finding that disclosure would not jeopardize Silberman's  ability to receive a fair trial. A federal appellate court affirmed that  ruling.  </P> <P> However, Brosnahan said, the subsequent "barrage of released information is not  conducive to a fair trial. Various materials have come out in connection with  various rulings and all that, but the effect of all that is it threatens a fair  trial. It makes a fair trial difficult."  </P> <P> "There should be jurors who are willing to say to themselves, 'Richard  Silberman might well be innocent.' And you know why they ought to do it in this  case? Because he is innocent," Brosnahan said.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 27 January carries in  its regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Hajrudin Sermic reports from Maglaj that "one of the  heaviest  days of war is behind the people of Maglaj, at least in terms of  the number of shells fired at the positions of the fighters of  the 201st Brigade and the villages on the free territory. Three  tank and infantry attacks were repelled in the Pazaric, Sedra,  and (Rovin) area along the newly established defense positions,  even though the chetniks and the ustasha fired over 2,000 shells  from their rich arsenal. However, the fighters of the 201st  Chivalrous Brigade again demonstrated heroism, morale, and  patriotism, and repulsed all the attacks." The report says that  "in order to justify the great losses in his ranks, and to  reduce at least to some extent the panic felt by his fighters  and the people of Zepa, Lozancic, commander of the treacherous  111th HVO Zepa Brigade, has been deceiving the public on  Croatian Radio by claiming that they have captured some point or  another. But that is a lie as his fighters have not advanced a  single millimeter, nor will they. They can only move backward."    Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the attacks  on the free Brcko territory are not letting up. After futile  attempts yesterday at infiltrating sabotage groups in white  camouflage uniforms behind our lines, the [Serb] enemy  intensified the shelling of the Brcko defense lines and the  civilian targets inside the free territory. Vranovaca was again  exposed to the heaviest artillery attacks. This stronghold near  Brcko, which was of extreme strategic importance even in World  War II, is one of the main targets of the Serbian aggressor in  this offensive. Last night Vranovaca was pounded with  howitzers, tanks, 60-mm, 82-mm, and 120-mm mortars, Praga, and  Bofors guns." The report says that "at the same time the  aggressor was bringing in reinforcements to Lipovac, Donja Brka,  and Cadjavac. The large forces that the aggressor has amassed  on the Brcko front do not seem to be having the least effect on  the low morale of the chetniks. Interchetnik clashes have been  escalating into armed conflicts with increasing frequency. Last  night at 1945 [1845 GMT] the chetniks from Stari Brod and Donja  Brka fired at each other with small arms, and later even threw  hand grenades at each other's positions. Last night there were  also small arms fire exchanges among the chetniks in the  Cadjavac region."    Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer  says that "early this morning the chetniks started an artillery  barrage against the city. Howitzer shells and mortars fired  from Krivoglavci landed at Point 850, Jezera, and Vis. From the  direction of Okruglica four howitzer shells were fired at the  Jewish cemetery, while a howitzer from Metalka fired at Kobilja  Glava. At just after 0700 the aggressor in Nedzarici fired  mortars at Dobrinja, and artillery shells fired from Gavrica  Brdo landed on Donji Kotorac and Butmir."</p>

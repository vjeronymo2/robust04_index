			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE AUDIT BLASTS OAKLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: REPORT CITES WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND INCOMPETENCE. STUDY DETAILS 'THE  MOST PERVASIVE SET OF PROBLEMS WE'VE EVER FOUND.'  </P> <P> In an extraordinarily blunt report, the state auditor general charged Wednesday  that the troubled Oakland Unified School District knowingly hired a convicted  drug user, paid administrators for days they did not work or degrees they had  not earned and granted an inflated contract to an underqualified consultant.  </P> <P> The two-volume audit also found that California's sixth-largest school district  borders on financial collapse, even though administrators failed to apply for  millions in grants that would have helped them rebuild schools, remove asbestos  and improve student reading skills.  </P> <P> "They have got to change the status quo," Acting Auditor General Kurt R.  Sjoberg said as he released the report. He added that in Oakland, auditors  discovered "the most pervasive set of problems we've ever found" in any of the  state's school districts.  </P> <P> Oakland School Superintendent Richard P. Mesa, who took over on Jan. 1 with a  mandate to clean up the district, vowed in written responses to the audit to  comply with the recommendations.  </P> <P> Dan Siegel, general counsel to the school district and part of the new  administration, said the audit "helps us because it gives us the moral support  to make the needed changes." Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris, the Oakland Democrat  who commissioned the audit, held out hope that the lesson for the district's  53,000 students is that "we are vigilant. We may be a little bit slow, but our  major priority is their education."  </P> <P> Harris, who is running for mayor of Oakland, said the audit showed that within  the district, "People started taking. There was no check and balance. Everybody  felt it was whatever you could get away with. That was the rule."  </P> <P> Prompted by Harris, the Legislature took the unprecedented step last year of  passing legislation seizing control of the district from the school board. A  state-appointed trustee is trying to pull the district out of its financial  straits.  </P> <P> In the face of the district's problems, three of seven school board members  have said they will step down this year. Elections for the open seats are set  for June.  </P> <P> The audit mentions no names, but portrays a school system run on the basis of  political patronage. Amounts of money involved in questionable expenditures  were small, but many district employees took their cuts, according to the  audit.  </P> <P> The auditors found one administrator was paid $5,400 for 16 days that he did  not work. Other administrators received bonuses of up to $2,575 a year by  claiming they had obtained doctoral degrees they had not earned.  </P> <P> One English teacher received $10,919 in extra pay over a period of years,  partly because he obtained credit from the district toward a post-graduate  degree simply for reading books and maps before embarking on a trip to London,  Paris, Barcelona and elsewhere, according to the audit. The teacher promised to  bring back pictures and brochures.  </P> <P> School officials paid nearly $250,000 to consultants without knowing whether  the services were ever received, the audit found. The district hired a firm at  $652,000 to study asbestos removal, even though the company was the "least  qualified, most costly contractor," the audit said.  </P> <P> The audit found the district paid $1,000 last year in sick leave to an  elementary school custodian who, in fact, missed work because he was in jail --  on drug possession charges. According to the audit, the district hired the  janitor despite knowing he had been convicted previously on drug charges, as  well as on forgery and burglary charges. State education law prohibits people  with drug convictions from being hired.  </P> <P> Citing such personnel practices, the audit said the district "may have allowed  its students to be exposed to drugs, has allowed itself to be vulnerable to  theft and has overpaid $124,000 to six administrators unnecessarily."  </P> <P> The report, noting that the district must reduce spending, said it would have  had a deficit of $1.8 million in the 1988-89 year but for an unexpected  windfall in state lottery money and other revenue. The audit also said the  district could have received $120 million in state aid simply by applying for a  variety of grants in recent years.  </P> <P> In a continuing investigation unrelated to the audit, 13 district officials and  employees have been arrested. Three of the 13 have pleaded guilty to receiving  stolen property or grand theft  </P></p>

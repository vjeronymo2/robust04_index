			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Clarke U-turn over court fines: Home secretary's policy shift seen as fillip for demoralised backbenchers THE government is to abandon the controversial unit fines system. The decision, announced yesterday, represents a surprise U-turn by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary. The government intends to enact its proposed changes immediately by incorporating them into the latest Criminal Justice Bill, due to start its committee stage later this month. The decision to rush through the proposals partly reflects the government's need to lift the spirits of backbenchers demoralised by last week's election disasters. Mr Clarke was encouraged by loud Tory cheers when he made his statement. Unit fines, under which individuals pay penalties according to their income, have led to some people with above-average earnings being fined thousands of pounds for relatively minor offences. They were introduced only in October, and on May 4 Mr Clarke reiterated his support for the principle, but said the banding on which the fines operated needed amending. He told the Commons yesterday, however, that he had decided to abolish the system altogether, as he had reached the conclusion that it would be impossible to modify it satisfactorily. Magistrates will still be encouraged to consider individuals' incomes when setting penalties, but there will be no specific formula. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said he had never seen so quick a collapse of government policy. 'Having spent weeks, if not months, robustly telling us that the Criminal Justice Act had a lot to commend it, you now equally robustly tell us today that you must scrap its central provisions.' Unit fines were introduced under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, the main thrust of which was to encourage more imaginative penalties and avoid the unnecessary use of custody. Mr Clarke, announcing a number of changes to the act yesterday, adopted a different emphasis  - the need to tighten the criminal law to give courts more powers to deal with offenders. Other changes will include relaxing restrictions on taking previous records into account, tightening the granting of bail, and increasing the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving from five to ten years. The decision to change the act so soon will dismay penal reform organisations and many criminal justice professionals. Only this week, the National Association of Probation Officers urged the government to consult widely before repealing any part of the act.</p>

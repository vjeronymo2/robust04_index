			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wall St savours Boston Chicken - The fast-food chain had a successful IPO Boston Chicken, a fledgling fast-food chain, became the new darling of Wall Street last week. It launched the most successful initial public offering in two years, as investors snapped up the shares in the belief that the company, a relative newcomer, would be more than just flavour of the month. The recipe that attracted investors to Boston Chicken is a promising marketing concept and an experienced management team. Analysts, however, questioned whether the willingness of small investors to take a risk was prudent. In last Tuesday's IPO on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York, the stock sizzled from the opening bell. With 1.9m shares, or about 10 per cent of the company, offered at Dollars 20 each, trading started at Dollars 45 1/4 , and the issue climbed as high as Dollars 51 before closing at Dollars 48 1/2 . At that price, the company, which two years ago operated only 33 restaurants, was valued at more than Dollars 800m. Ms Linda Killian, analyst at Renaissance Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut, said there had been much talk before the launch of the IPO, intensifying buying pressure from small investors who were excluded from the Dollars 20-a-share offering. The company, based in Chicago, started eight years ago with one restaurant in Newtonville, Massachusetts, just west of Boston, and has quickly grown to 175 locations. It was acquired by a group led by several former executives of Blockbuster Entertainment in March 1992. Chicken, of course, is no stranger to fast food. The new wrinkle pioneered by the Boston Chicken is roasting it on a spit, rather than frying it. The menu is rounded off with family-style side-dishes, such as mashed potatoes, corn bread and steamed vegetables. So the chain provides fast-food customers with healthy, back-to-basics options to burgers and french fries, while retaining snappy service and low prices. With Americans becoming more health conscious, the concept seems to have struck a chord and many industry observers believe it will grow in popularity. Sales of roasted chicken this year are expected to reach Dollars 2bn, compared with sales of fried chicken at Dollars 7.5bn, according to the annual Top 100 survey of fast-food restaurants conducted by Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication. Boston Chicken is emphasising take-away meals, which account for about 70 per cent of its business, a much higher proportion than at other chains. Mr Mark Stephens, chief financial officer, said a central pillar of their marketing strategy was to capitalise on the increasing number of take-away meals. Most analysts agree Boston Chicken has strong potential. However, in the light of its limited operating experience, many have raised questions over its stock-market value. As a result, the issue has started to lose some of its lustre. By the close of trading on Tuesday, the share price stood at Dollars 42. There is sufficient evidence to support a sceptical view. Revenues last year were a mere Dollars 8.3m, and the company posted a net loss of Dollars 5.7m. Even at Tuesday's Dollars 42 a share, the stock was trading at about 76 times estimated 1994 earnings of 55 cents a share. In 1995, net income is estimated by analysts at 85 cents a share. Mr David Lebowitz, senior vice-president and director of research at Republic New York Securities, said it was difficult to justify the current stock price. 'Boston Chicken is too young and too small to apply the normal yardsticks,' he said. In the short term, at least, Boston Chicken is poised for substantial growth. The company said revenues in the nine months of 1993 were Dollars 28m, against Dollars 5m last year, and it has become marginally profitable. Full-year turnover will reach Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m and Dollars 55m-Dollars 60m in 1994, according to Renaissance Capital's estimate. The management has outlined an ambitious expansion plan. The chain has tripled in size over the past year and within three years, the number of restaurants is expected reach 600, with locations in most leading US markets. Boston Chicken will finance the building programme with the Dollars 55m proceeds from the IPO, plus a concurrent offering of 900,000 restricted shares to management. Ms Killian said one of the pivotal elements of the chain's successful expansion since 1991 was its 'tight control of franchising'. Unlike most fast-food chains Boston Chicken provides a large portion of the development capital for new locations in the form of loan. The debt is later convertible into equity, giving the company greater control over the network. Mr Scott Beck, the company's chairman and a former vice-chairman of Blockbuster, used a similar financing scheme in the 1980s to develop the video-rental enterprise into the 3,000-store empire with annual revenues of Dollars 1.2bn. Clearly, many small investors are hoping for a repeat performance.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Jailed adviser is banned by SIB The Securities and Investments Board has indefinitely banned from the securities industry Mr Christopher Fallon, who is serving a nine-month prison sentence. Mr Fallon is the second person banned from securities or investment activities under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act. The first was Mr Roger Levitt, who was convicted of fraud charges and who received a non-custodial sentence. Mr Fallon, who operated Fallon and Co, based in north London, had presented himself as an expert in futures and options. But he was not authorised to conduct investment business. Last July, SIB, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, secured an injunction barring him from conducting investment business after it was discovered that he was giving advice. Mr Fallon then breached that injunction by taking Pounds 24,000 from two individuals. The watchdog then applied to the High Court for a prison sentence for violating the injunction. That request was granted last week, and he was jailed for contempt. The Pounds 24,000 has not been recovered and because Mr Fallon was not authorised to conduct investment business, the investors will not be allowed to make claims upon the Investors Compensation Scheme. SIB said it viewed the case as evidence that civil prosecution could secure more punitive terms for wrongdoers in certain cases than a criminal prosecution could. At least four other Section 59 cases are pending before SIB. Individuals charged in such cases have the right to appeal against a decision and seek a hearing.</p>

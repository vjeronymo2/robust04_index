			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading The gloomy mood seen in recent sessions in the derivative markets continued yesterday, once again sending stock index futures to drift lower in volatile trading, writes Joel Kibazo. Optimists appeared to have the upper hand at the openning as the June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,652, a small premium to the underlying cash market. That positive mood did not last for independent traders (locals) moved to sell the contract causing an early retreat in June. Sporadic buying was seen at the new lower levels which caused a turnround in the contract, sending it up to 2,660, the high of the day, but it was not long before the bears gained the upper hand sending June into retreat once again. Early falls on Wall Street caused a further decline and June eventually closed at the day's low point of 2,638, down 10 on the previous session and about 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover at 5,745 lots was again poor. There was a slight improvement in volumes in the traded options where total turnover reached 29,994 contracts. However, turnover in the FT-SE option at 9,913 was down on Monday's 12,875 contracts. BAT was the most active stock option. It traded 2,250 contracts with the August 750 puts particularly busy.</p>

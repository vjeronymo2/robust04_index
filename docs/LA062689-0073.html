			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> KCET'S 'TAKE FIVE' SERIES PLAYS BEAT THE CLOCK  </P> <P> If a comparison of their half-hour premieres is indicative, KCET's "Take Five:  Science" (debuting at 7:30 tonight on Channel 28) makes better use of its time  than its sibling "Take Five: Arts" (which debuted last Monday), even if  "Science" does take more liberties with the limits on that time.  </P> <P> The idea behind "Take Five" is to cover a single subject in five minutes, with  segments airing four days a week from 7:30-7:35 p.m. But occasionally KCET will  air compilations, where, it seems, the rules aren't quite so strict. There are  only four segments in tonight's initial "Science" half-hour, and one of these  -- on UC Santa Barbara anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon -- runs almost nine  minutes.  </P> <P> Perhaps it's only coincidence that the Chagnon piece is also the best of the  four -- a fascinating and even, somehow, reasonably comprehensive look at one  man's attempt to document and preserve an Amazonian tribe threatened by  everyone from shaman-degrading Christian missionaries to murderous gold miners.  </P> <P> Or perhaps it isn't coincidence. Five -- or even six or seven -- minutes is an  awfully small amount of time to cover something like headaches, the first topic  "Science" addresses tonight.  </P> <P> The strain shows: One moment we're being told about migraines, then the subject  switches to "cluster" headaches, stays there a while, gives way to a short  statement about "mind over matter" in combatting the pain, and then suddenly  it's over.  </P> <P> The other two segments fall somewhere between these extremes. A piece on the  origins of the moon benefits from some neat computer animation illustrating the  impact theory. The other segment, examining what makes certain athletes peak  performers, has a slow-motion shot of Dodger star pitcher Orel Hershiser doing  his stuff in shorts only, but it still doesn't leave much of an impression.  </P> <P> Produced and introduced by Roger Bingham (from KCET's defunct "California  Stories" series), "Take Five: Science" should prove interesting to keep track  of -- not only for its potpourri of subjects but also for how well it battles  that ticking clock.  </P></p>

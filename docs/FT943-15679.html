			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Turkish privatisation setback Turkey's privatisation programme suffered another setback with the constitutional court ruling late yesterday to cancel the recently passed enabling legislation which would have allowed the government to sell companies without having to seek parliamentary approval. The move will delay the programme at a time when Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, is trying to speed up the sale of state assets to bolster the balance of payments and avoid a debt rescheduling. The court decision means that separate legislation will have to be presented to parliament for debate in the case of the sale of every state company. 'Practically speaking, it means the policy is doomed,' said the deputy leading the appeal to the constitutional court to have the law annulled. Turkey was aiming to sell Dollars 2.5bn worth of assets this year, including companies in the oil refining and distribution sectors, the state airline, steel concern and the state telecommunications.</p>

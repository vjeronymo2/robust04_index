			<p>In      a phased response to international moves toward the imposition  of UN sanctions on North Korea, Pyongyang has declared that it  "will immediately" withdraw from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), but, apparently, not from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) (KCNA, 13 June).  Depicting the  withdrawal as a response to the IAEA Board of Governors' 10 June  resolution suspending technical assistance to the DPRK and  demanding the opening of two suspected nuclear waste sites that  Pyongyang insists are "military sites," a 13 June Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement declared that Pyongyang will  "hereafter" not be bound by the agency's "rules and resolutions."  It also declared that IAEA inspectors now in North Korea "will  have nothing to do any further"--a formulation that seems to fall  short of announcing their immediate expulsion.      The statement indicated that, despite its pullout from the IAEA,  Pyongyang does not, so far, consider itself to have withdrawn  from the NPT.  However, it said that no further nuclear  inspections will be allowed until "it has been decided whether we  return to the NPT or completely withdraw from it," an implicit  threat to ratchet up the crisis further at some future date.  In  addition, the statement implied that Pyongyang is ready to use  other means to further deepen the current crisis, reaffirming  Pyongyang's position of equating UN sanctions to a declaration of  war, an action, the statement said, Pyongyang would counter with  "expanded self-defense measures."  The statement also ominously  claimed without elaboration that Pyongyang "can" expand  "international cooperation" in "the realm of nuclear activities"-  -possibly a threat to cooperate with other states of  proliferation concern.

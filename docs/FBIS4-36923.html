			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy in  Sanaa today categorically refuted as "false" a report by a  french magazine that Iran had proposed to despatch units from  the Islamic Revolution's Gurads Corps (IRGC) to Yemen.    Referring the recent 'LE POINT' allegations, the embassy  said  such unfounded reports and commentaries are printed in some  Western papers with "quite clear objectives."    The embassy in its statement said Iran's clear stance  concerning the current developments in the brotherly Republic of  Yemen cannot be misportrayed through such propaganda.    The Islamic Republic of Iran supports a united Yemen, and  hopes that present disputes would be settled peacefully, it said.    "National sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal  affairs of Yemen should be respected in any solution," the  statement said.</p>

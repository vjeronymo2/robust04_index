			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (10): A family business - The country's political dynasties A QUICK glance at the list of members of Parliament suggests that Greek politics is still very much a family business. The present and former prime ministers, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis and Mr Andreas Papandreou, have a daughter and a son respectively in the House. This is not really a coincidence considering that both leaders launched their own political careers from similarly privileged backgrounds. Mr Papandreou's father was a centrist prime minister. Mr Mitsotakis's great-uncle, Eleftherios Venizelos, was Greece's leading modern statesman. Descendants of the old tzakia, prominent political families whose influence stretches back a century in some cases, are scattered around the front benches in Parliament. On the other hand, a political dynasty can be founded by present head of state, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, a schoolmaster's son from Macedonia who served as prime minister for 15 years. His youngest brother is a cabinet minister and two of his nephews are up-and-coming deputies. But the rumbles of complaint from members of Mr Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy party when he gave his daughter, Mrs Dora Bakoyannis, a junior ministerial post, were an indication of how attitudes are changing. As under-secretary to the prime minister's office, Mrs Bakoyannis is responsible for co-ordinating government activities. She took over her husband's parliamentary seat after he was killed by a local terrorist group in 1989. 'I've been working for Mitsotakis for years. Now I represent one of the poorest constituencies in Greece where a lot needs to be done,' she says. 'Politics is my life, and I'd like another cabinet job when I've got more experience.' Greek political parties have rarely outlived their founders, but both ND, established by Mr Karamanlis, and Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) may have put down strong enough roots over the past 17 years to survive changes that are inevitable in the next few years. Following Pasok's earlier example, ND constructed a more effective grassroots organisation during its years in opposition. More younger members of Parliament were selected originally as candidates on the basis of local popularity rather than connections with the party hierarchy in Athens. The frontrunner to succeed Mr Mitsotakis as ND leader, Mr Miltiades Evert, is a seasoned Athenian politician but not from one of the old families. As minister to the prime minister's office, he looks after civil service reform and makes a point of keeping a distance from the party machine. A year in opposition has taken its toll on Pasok. Funds are low and the old populist enthusiasm is gone, especially in the countryside where the party built its power base. Mr Papandreou's personal grip on Pasok has slackened, but there has been no attempt to unseat him. On the contrary, the start of his trial - in absentia  -for alleged corruption while in office brought a closing of socialist ranks. The succession battle could turn out to be a long drawn-out affair, given the doubts about Mr Papandreou's health since he underwent major heart surgery in 1988 and the number of potential candidates. Half a dozen former cabinet ministers are frequently mentioned, but it is not at all clear which of them would appeal to both radical and social democrat wings of the party. Potential contenders are keeping a low profile until the court reaches its decision, which may be several months away. 'The outcome of the trial will decide Mr Papandreou's political future,' says Mr Costas Simitis, a former economy minister and the leader of Pasok's social democrat faction.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / 'Real US' on offer in political package tour: Japanese tourists to pay for the chance to see democracy in operation A TOKYO travel agency has launched a group tour for Japanese who want to see how democracy works or, at least, to see how a US presidential election is conducted. In eight politics-packed days the tourists will view the site of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, marvel at Democratic candidate Bill Clinton's campaign office in Arkansas, and see the sights of the Cable News Network (CNN) studios in Washington. The climax will come on polling day, November 3, when the travellers are promised a front-row seat at the unfolding of history. As the brochure puts it, they will experience 'the real America' and see 'something completely unlike Japanese politics'. Mr Hideo Soshi, sales manager at Pacific Tour Systems, said the strongest selling point for the tour, a pricey Y598,000 (Pounds 2,900), is the opportunity to view close up a political system widely different from that of Japan. 'Our system is grey and unclear. In the US, politics is vivid and clear. Many Japanese are interested in seeing the real America and America seems to be at its most real during elections,' he said. Whether attracted by the real or the surreal, in the two days the US Presidential Election Tour has been advertised 10 people have applied for the 20 vacancies. Mr Soshi views the response as vindication of 'our unique, distinguished concept'. Japanese politics is certainly passing through one of its greyer phases, which could be an incentive to take a tour of the US political system. Since late last month Mr Shin Kanemaru, the country's most powerful politician, has refused to let prosecutors question him over a possibly illegal Y500m donation from a parcel delivery company. The prosecutors gave the 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party until today to appear at their office, although Mr Kanemaru has not left his house. He apparently keeps fit by walking his dog up and down the stairs, and amuses himself by playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance. Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister whom Mr Kanemaru claims to have appointed, is as much a spectator of events as will be the Japanese on the US Presidential Election Tour. He has made no public statement on the fate of Mr Kanemaru, who now holds no official title but still presides over the party's largest faction. Shrouded in this 'greyness', Japanese politics remains off the tourist track. But, as Pacific Tour Systems promises in its brochure, with its close-up of the White House and of Bill Clinton on the telephone 'the whole world will be watching' Washington on election night, and 'you will be there'.</p>

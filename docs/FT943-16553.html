			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Productivity the key measure for R&amp;D value Sir, Following the Department of Trade and Industry's recent ranking of countries by R&amp;D expenditure (Technology: 'R&amp;D Scoreboard', June 17), cries for increased R&amp;D expenditure by the UK have reached a crescendo. So two cheers for your editorial of June 20, 'Costly Research'. You did leave it to the final sentence, but at least you pointed out that what is really important is R&amp;D output, not R&amp;D input spending. Too few commentators stress the importance of R&amp;D productivity. The results of oil industry R&amp;D clearly illustrate the huge differences in productivity achieved by competing research teams. Although an aberration in the OECD Frascati guidelines means that most oil company R&amp;D is not actually counted as R&amp;D, it is possible to correct for this and to look at the true picture. Like their colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry, oil company scientists and engineers spend about 10 per cent of sales on research for new products  -in this case, new oil and gas fields. A Salomon Brothers report, 'Proved Petroleum Reserves of 30 Large Energy Companies', allows a calculation that, in the eight-year period 1983-90, research teams in the best performing quartile achieved an average productivity of 0.45 barrels found per dollar spent. The poorest performing quartile achieved only 0.10 barrels. There is no reason to think such spreads are special to oil researchers. Therefore, if UK research productivity is in the top quartile, calls to cut dividends and spend more on R&amp;D may indeed make good sense. But if our R&amp;D productivity is low, then it is likely to be far more cost-effective to maintain (or even reduce) our spending level while concentrating on improving the quality of R&amp;D management. It is R&amp;D productivity information, therefore, that the DTI should collect, control for quality and then publish. On the other hand, if top managements do not know the relative standing of their own R&amp;D productivity performance then I'm afraid we should fear the worst.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- U.S. trade negotiators were  expected to offer a compromise plan in insurance sector talks  Thursday [2 Jun] with a model for a unified licensing system,  Japanese officials said.    In the second day of insurance talks under a restarted  bilateral trade "framework," the American side was expected to  respond to Japanese complaints that state-by-state licensing  arrangements hinder the entry of foreign firms to the U.S.  market, the officials said.    U.S. officials could not immediately be reached for comment.    Japanese officials have said their demand for more  uniformity  in the U.S. insurance market was their only request in the  insurance talks.    A unified U.S. licensing model would thus open the way for  compromises by both sides. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  vowed "utmost efforts" Wednesday to reach agreement in the talks  in time for a July summit of major industrial nations.    In the agreement that got the talks back on track after  three  and a half months, both sides said they would seek to improve  access to both markets.    Before the breakdown of the framework talks in February,  U.S.  negotiators avoided specific discussions of U.S. market access  problems, saying they were willing to "consult" on U.S. market  conditions but not negotiate on them.    Indeed, the Japanese officials described the expected U.S.  unified licensing model as being for reference.    Each U.S. state supervises its own insurance industry,  unlike  Japan's nationwide standards. Tokyo has called this a barrier  to foreign entry, citing cases in which Japanese nonlife  insurers required nearly 30 years to receive licenses in all 50  states.    The U.S. wants Japan to go slow in deregulating the  foreign-dominated "third sector" of its insurance market --  including nursing care and disease coverage.    The insurance talks, the first in the framework's three  priority areas, began Wednesday in Tokyo.    Talks on automobiles and auto parts are to begin Thursday in  Washington, and talks on Japanese Government procurement of  medical and telecommunications equipment are to begin Friday in  Tokyo.</p>

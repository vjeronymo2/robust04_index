			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYARSKY ON L.A. COUNTY  </P> <P> Having known Bill Boyarsky for a good many years, I was disappointed in his  first effort as columnist in the Metro section ("Government by Five Soloists,"  Sept. 29). His column read as though he has been in hibernation for perhaps 8  or 9 years.  </P> <P> The balance of power on the Board of Supervisors has moved among the members  according to each particular issue. For example, the debate over contracting  out county services was settle in 1978 when nearly two-thirds of the voters of  Los Angeles County voted in support of this kind of government economy and  efficiency. Supervisors Deane Dana, Pete Schabarum and I supported the voters'  decision. It was opposed by Supervisors Kenny Hahn and Ed Edelman.  </P> <P> However, it was with the support of Dana and Edelman that I was able to push  forward with the construction of the new Olive View Medical Center. Schabarum  opposed this critically needed facility.  </P> <P> Dana, Schabarum and I opposed the distribution of bleach kits and so-called  clean needles in the fight against AIDS because we believe money is better  spent on drug education for our young people and in helping get addicts off of  drugs.  </P> <P> Regarding my interests in promoting healthy diets, the board acted unanimously  in 1981 with an order that improved the type of foods served in our probation  facilities.  </P> <P> The board has seen various alliances form and dissolve from time to time, and  this accrues to the benefit of all our citizens. Admittedly, we are five very  different individuals. At the same time, each of us was elected by a different  constituency and each of us has particular obligations to our district.  </P> <P> But the record would bear out the fact that we are extremely successful in  attaining a high degree of teamwork. For your information (and Boyarsky's), the  board is unanimous on approximately 95% of each weekly calendar.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D. ANTONOVICH  </P> <P> Supervisor, Fifth District  </P></p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Euro-sceptic who takes Chicago line Unlike one new minister swapped from eight different portfolios during the gestation of the new Italian cabinet, Mr Antonio Martino was always favourite for just one job - the one he got, foreign minister. The 51-year-old Mr Martino is a 'Euro-sceptic' and instrumental in bringing the ideas of the Thatcher-inspired Bruges group to Italy. However, it would be wrong to see Mr Martino as anti-European. Rather he is a European who has imbibed the free market economic teachings of the Chicago School to become according to one colleague 'more Chicago Boy than the Boys themselves'. He sees the Maastricht treaty and monetary union as constraints on a genuine single market. Unlike Mrs Thatcher, whom he admires, Mr Martino regards himself as an old-fashioned liberal. Though Forza Italia is the first political party he has joined, he was to his embarrassment a member of the secret Masonic lodge, P2( Mr Berlusconi was also a member). He says when he realised the scope of P2 he immediately renounced membership. He caught the attention of the prime minister-designate while venting his forthright opinions on Italy's over-regulated economy in the column's of the media magnate's daily, Il Giornale. For the past year he has been Mr Berlusconi's economic adviser and played this role throughout the elections. One of the mysteries behind the formation of this cabinet is the way once the elections were over his name did not surface as candidate for one of the three economic portfolios. Perhaps other members of the economic team were out of sympathy with Mr Martino's radicalism, or he himself preferred the challenge of the foreign ministry.</p>

[Krueger] I doubt that we are on a descent. But we have  problems with the economic climate which have a negative effect  on the research climate in Germany. The economic setting and the  state of the market are influencing the tempo of converting  research results into successful products. We aren't weak at all  in basic research. In gene technology or microelectronics, for  example, we still have a high international standing.    -- Then perhaps you are thinking of the fact that we are  falling behind the U.S. and Japan, with virtually no chance of  catching up?    [Krueger] No, the pinch only comes in converting knowledge  into products and markets. That has to happen more rapidly. And  a sometimes near-hysterical reaction to technical developments  in this country is a stumbling block.    -- Can you give examples?    [Krueger] Plenty of them. The high temperature reactor,  where  we were world leaders, was done in by a lack of political  acceptance. Or take the example of gene technology, where young  researchers see no opportunities because of the long wait for  approval and emigrate. Many things set the wrong mood, for  instance when scientists working in health research are  subjected to threats because they have to carry out experiments  on animals in order to help human beings.    -- But popular initiatives can't bear the whole blame for  the  crisis. Even in uncontroversial technologies the dynamics of  innovation are weakening in this country.    [Krueger] That varies a great deal from one industry to  another. Engineering, for example, is still innovative. In some  ways even too innovative, almost too perfect. That drives up  costs and weakens our competitiveness. Innovation at all costs  is not good. We often make complicated things, but the Japanese  usually make what is more saleable.    -- How can that be changed?    [Krueger] What is needed is a closer link between basic  research and industry. Maybe it would also be more efficient if  more basic research were conducted within industry itself. Often  the two sides no longer understand one another. In the last few  years a real language barrier has arisen and it has to be  overcome.    -- You took over the idea of a strategic circle from your  predecessor--a mini-MIDI or round of talks?    [Krueger] Neither one. I want to initiate a strategic dialog  between research, industry and politics on two levels with  differing goals. On the upper level is the strategic circle,  where the concerns are research processes and across-the-board  problems like acceptance, legal requirements, training the next  generation, the tempo of innovation and the like.    -- And the second level?    [Krueger] That is made up of several dialog circles in which  the nature of future research and development trends will be  discussed. They should come up with answers, for example to the  question of what technologies and products are of basic  significance for the future development of our society. These  circles will be made up of new experts in each case. Only the  basic structure will remain unchanged. Representatives of the  economy, science and politics will share their experiences,  enhanced by external studies and reports.    -- Which research areas do you think most significant?    [Krueger] Germany cannot afford to neglect any key area. For  example, we need to catch up in biotechnology and in almost all  application areas of microelectronics. In information technology  we have lost a lot of ground. I will pay particular attention to  software development, where we can draw on our knowledge of  systems.    -- And you hope to achieve this with antiquated support  mechanisms and structures?    [Krueger] We are already thinking of innovations. For one  thing, we have already developed concrete ideas about tax  incentives for research and development. We are discussing this  with the finance minister at the moment. In the new Federal  Laender we have set up a broad spectrum of programs which  provide a basis for the existence of innovative mid- level  companies.</p>

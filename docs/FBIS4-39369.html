			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 8 June TASS -- "Full merger of the Russian  and Tajik monetary systems can be achieved no sooner than by the  end of this year," said Tajik Economics and Planning Minister,  Rustam Mirzoyev, in an interview with ITAR-TASS. Mirzoyev  pointed out that not only a political decision to this effect  was adopted by the heads of the two countries, but a package of  documents, concerning the second stage of the merger, was worked  out and submitted to Russian colleagues.    The minister pointed out that there are no serious opponents  to the unification of the two monetary systems either in Russia,  or in Tajikistan. The process of the monetary merger is very  complex both technically and organizationally, he said. At the  same time, Tajik manufacturers should work hard to step up the  process. It is necessary to earn Russian roubles ourselves by  increasing supplies of industrial products and raw materials,  i.e. to give priority in exports policy to Russia, the Tajik  minister said.    According to Mirzoyev, Tajikistan faces severe cash  shortages  and the government is 170 billion roubles in debt to the  population. The remaining 25 billion roubles expected to arrive  from Russia as part of the 120-billion credit to Tajikistan will  not be enough even to pay pensions and social allowances, he  said.    Asked by ITAR-TASS if Tajikistan intends to introduce  temporary money for internal payments, the minister declined to  answer, saying that such problems are in the competence of the  Tajik parliament.</p>

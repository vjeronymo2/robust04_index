			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (12): Drive and energy - Sao Paulo / Guide for business visitors Sao Paulo may not be the capital of Brazil, but it has all the swagger of the country's most important industrial and financial centre, writes David Pilling. Cosmopolitan, chic, frenzied and sometimes violent, Sao Paulo has the hum of New York and the skyscrapers to match. Outside Brazil, this city of 17m people does not enjoy the grand reputation of Rio de Janeiro, and it certainly lacks the sea air and the fabulous setting. But for many visitors, Sao Paulo has a drive and energy they find appealing. For all its immensity, Sao Paulo is not an unfriendly place. Non-Portuguese speakers armed with a phrase book, a little Spanish or a knack for gesticulation will find most Paulistas ready to help. Because of the city's size and traffic snarl-ups, it can take considerable time to get between appointments. Midnight traffic jams are not unknown. Try to schedule meetings close to one another, bearing in mind that the city has several centres. Sao Paulo has a great night-life with bars, restaurants, music venues, theatres and cinemas showing English-language films. Without being paranoid, be on your guard and do not walk around aimlessly after dark.

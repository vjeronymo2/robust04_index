			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Opec clashes over ways to prop up oil prices MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries clashed at the weekend over ways to support sagging world oil prices. Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current president of Opec, has failed to find a consensus to address what one minister described as 'Opec's worst crisis since the price collapse of 1986'. Mr Ping continued his tour of Middle Eastern Opec countries to canvass opinion for an emergency meeting to agree a strategy for Opec when Iraq returns to the export market. Iraqi officials have been involved in negotiations with the United Nations over limited oil sales. Mr Ping met officials from the United Arab Emirates, the organisation's fourth biggest producer, yesterday afternoon. He said in Abu Dhabi that he might hold further talks today with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. His shuttle, which has already included discussions with the Saudi, Iranian and Kuwaiti oil ministers, was prompted by oil market jitters over the prospect of Iraq reaching agreement with the United Nations on a limited exemption to the oil embargo imposed after the Gulf war. Opec has already abandoned plans for an emergency meeting scheduled for Wednesday in Vienna in the absence of any agreement and amid increasing recriminations among its leading members. In particular, Saudi Arabia and Iran, the organisation's two biggest producers, are at loggerheads over the course the organisation should take. Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, is seeking an immediate meeting, with the backing of Algeria. But Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, has argued that a meeting would be pointless until it is known if, when and in what quantities Iraqi oil will return to the market. Although Opec, with the exception of Kuwait, agreed at its last meeting to adhere to an overall ceiling of 23.58m barrels a day, industry estimates put actual production well above 24m b/d. Mr Nazer on Friday placed the blame squarely on Iran for the present price slump, accusing Tehran of pumping 277,000 b/d more than its alloted share under the last agreement. Iran 'alone bears responsibility', he said. Iraq yesterday joined the fray, blaming the ruling families of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for undercutting prices. The oil market was fairly steady late last week in spite of the Opec disarray, but price stability remains fragile while the threat of Iraqi oil sales continues to hang over the market. Iraqi officials who have been talking to the United Nations about a possible one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil are still in Baghdad. But they are expected to resume talks in New York next week.</p>

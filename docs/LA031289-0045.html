			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASSROOM TV CAN BECOME A LESSON IN MEDIA CRITICISM  </P> <P> Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., wants to give 8,000 American high  schools $250 million worth of TV sets, video recorders and satellite dishes. In  return, the schools must promise to make "Channel One," Whittle's daily  12-minute newscast that includes two minutes of commercials, required viewing  for all students. How bad a bargain is it? Not bad at all, I think, if teachers  realize what Whittle and its advertisers have provided them: A free casebook  for a course in media criticism.  </P> <P> So far, the possibility seems to have been ignored. Education groups, including  the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Assn. and the  National PTA have already come out against the program, which premiered Monday  in a five-week test at six high schools, including one in Cerritos, Calif.  Peggy Charren of Action for Children's Television, a citizen's group, has  called the students a "captive audience" and the program "an advertiser's  dream."  </P> <P> Neither charge is entirely true. The students are required to come to school  and to view "Channel One"; in that sense they are indeed captive. But as  experienced television watchers, teen-agers know quite a bit about advertising.  They are not likely to take the ads very seriously -- unless, of course,  teachers ask them to take them seriously.  </P> <P> That is exactly what should happen. The commercials and the newscast ought to  become the focus of a daily discussion about the manipulative tactics of  advertising, the vagaries of a consumer culture, the uses and misuses of  imagery, the limitations of television news, and the power and reach of modern  communications. These are important lessons for any citizen of the electronic  age, and students are often eager to learn them. But such lessons will be lost  unless teachers go out of their way to encourage criticism and discussion.  </P> <P> A classroom full of listless teen-agers, dutifully attending to television as  one more routine in a dreary school day, may very well be an advertiser's  dream. Part of what makes a TV audience valuable to an advertiser is the  passivity and silence of the viewer. But anyone who has watched television with  a large group of friends knows how tempting it is to comment on the show and  poke fun at the commercials.  </P> <P> When we're surrounded by others we know and trust, advertising's attempts to  fill us with fear or promise us the world can seem ludicrously overblown.  Watching television together, we may still be an audience, but we also have an  audience -- each other. The impulse to talk back to the box for our own  amusement (and protection) is a natural one. A classroom, then, is an ideal  environment for talking back to television, and the fact that "Channel One"  carries advertisements only gives teachers and students more to talk about.  </P> <P> To offer the materials for a daily exercise in media criticism is not, of  course, the aim of Whittle Communications. There is no reason to think the  company has anything but its own profits in mind. Indeed, there is something  frightening in the decision by schools to subject their pupils to "Channel  One." It is one thing when students park themselves in front of the TV set at  home and choose to endure the ad. It is quite another when school, in effect,  sells access to its students' minds for a fee, especially when attendance is  mandated. What theory of custodianship gives school officials the right to  barter away the time and attention of their pupils? I can see none.  </P> <P> Christopher Whittle, chairman of the company that bears his name, has argued  that if government funds cannot meet the needs of the schools, then other  sources, like "Channel One," ought to be found. But surely Charren has a point  when she says that the proper solution to inadequate funding for the schools is  more government support, not the privatization of public education.  </P> <P> All of these objections must be admitted. But so must the opportunity Whittle  has unwittingly extended to educators. Whatever the circumstances that brought  them there, commercials do have a place in the schools, as objects of study and  targets of criticism.  </P> <P> Whittle doesn't apologize to teachers for trying to turn their classrooms into  just another profit center. Teachers shouldn't apologize for subverting the  goals of his program and instructing their students in the art of critical  viewing.  </P></p>

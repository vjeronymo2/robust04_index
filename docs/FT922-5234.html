			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Observer: Old cronies Which of the following boardroom moves is the more important for Britain's depressed property market? Last week Li Ka-Shing resigned from HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong Bank, and this week David Li, a somewhat younger member of the colony's movers and shakers club, steps on to the board of Chelsfield, Elliott Bernerd's privately-owned property company. Both men are wealthy, interested in property, and have strong British ties. David Li, the 51-year-old chief executive of Hong Kong's Bank of East Asia, and 47-year-old Bernerd go back a long way. Bernerd attended Li's 50th birthday party and Li bought a bit of Bernerd's Wentworth golf course and his bank co-managed a private placement of Chelsfield's shares. If Bernerd is to stand a chance of making a decent stock market debut later this year - and his PR machine seems to be in top gear - he needs more independent names than just Li's on his letterhead. The sight of a wealthy banker going on to the board of a company that his bank does business with, is not always the best buy signal. The potential conflicts of interest have to be set against the value of the business connections. By contrast, now that Li Ka-Shing has severed his ties with the Hong Kong Bank, he is far less restricted in what he can do especially when it involves the bank's troubled property clients.</p>

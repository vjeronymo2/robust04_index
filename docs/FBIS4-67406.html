			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 16 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia  branch of China International Airlines has grown trees by way of  aerial seeding on more than 700,000 ha of land in north China  over the past more than a decade years.    North China has vast arid or semi-arid areas, with scarce  vegetation and serious desertification. Forest cover in north  China is lower than 10 percent. The development of the local  economy has thus been seriously hampered.    Beginning in the late 1970's, the company was assigned to  shoulder the task of planting trees in north China through  aerial seeding.    As a result, the ecological environment, and production and  living conditions of farmers and herdsmen in those areas  selected for aerial seeding have shown marked improvement thanks  to painstaking efforts in the past decade, local officials told  XINHUA.</p>

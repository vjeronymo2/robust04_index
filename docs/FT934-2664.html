			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Pressure for Bank autonomy grows The government will come under pressure this week to cede greater independence to the Bank of England. The all-party Commons Treasury committee is expected to call for a degree of autonomy that would bring the Bank more into line with the New Zealand model, under which the government cannot directly determine the Reserve Bank's monetary policy. Its report, to be published on Thursday, will coincide with the publication of a private member's bill by one of its members, Tory MP Mr Nicholas Budgen, as part of his drive for greater Bank of England transparency. Mr Budgen, a leading Euro-rebel, said: 'The problem at the moment is that monetary policy can be changed without anyone knowing what is happening.' Mr Budgen argues that publication of monetary policy guidelines would give the Commons more, not less, control over the Bank. In New Zealand the government has a contract with the central bank specifying a target inflation range. Failure to achieve this can result in dismissal of the governor. Sir Robin Butler, the UK cabinet secretary, is to visit New Zealand next month and is expected to examine the workings of the Reserve Bank. Although Mr Budgen's bill has little chance of becoming law, it will add to the debate on the issue. It is due for a second reading on January 28. The Treasury committee is understood to have rejected independence as in Germany's Bundesbank, largely because it operates under such a different political system. The New Zealand system, however, is similar to that of the UK. While the committee's report stops short of recommending the New Zealand model, it favours giving the Bank autonomy.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Political jitters prompt sell-off and it did. After two months of highly respectable price rises, the gilt market last week went into reverse on fears about a poor showing for the Tories in the general election and a big rise in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the next two years. With all eyes focused on tomorrow's Budget, gilt investors suffered an attack of nerves, with buying pressure extremely subdued and many interested in swapping out of UK bonds and into those issued by other governments. As a result, prices of some types of gilt fell by as much as 2 points over the week. There was a consequent increase in yields. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is widely expected in his Budget to inject up to Pounds 4bn into the economy, partly through tax cuts, in a bid to revive the flagging economy and cheer up voters ahead of the election. While this might in theory be good for the Conservatives' re-election chances, a move of this kind is also likely to push up sharply the PSBR. That worries many in the gilt market, both because it could kick off a spell of inflationary pressures and also because a large amount of borrowing would feed through to large, price-depressing gilt issues over the next year or so. Such fears triggered a gilt sell-off, led by overseas investors. The Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing in 2008 fell from 99 at the beginning of the week to 97 1/8 on Friday night, for a yield of 9.34 per cent. The shorter-dated 10 per cent Treasury bond due in 1994 fell by a smaller amount, from 101 3/32 to 100 21/32 , yielding 9.65 per cent. Many observers believe that the PSBR will rise from about Pounds 12bn in 1991-92 to roughly Pounds 25bn in 1992-93. It could go up to Pounds 35bn in 1993-94, according to some projections. Many economists are not comfortable about such figures, particularly in the context of the Budget. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, says: 'A tax give-away when the public sector is swinging into deficit is causing some concern in the gilt market.' Others are more relaxed. Mr Roger Bootle, chief UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, says: 'While I would want to keep the PSBR under close scrutiny, a rising deficit is acceptable at a time when the UK is still in serious recession.' Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew follows a similar line. He expects the Treasury to have little trouble finding gilts buyers over the next year or so, even if gilt issues rise steeply, as many in the market expect. Some reckon issues could run to Pounds 30bn in 1992-93, roughly twice the level this year. Mr Roberts says: 'The markets take the view that there is plenty of time for the deficits to come down again later in the decade, after the economy has picked up.' However, in the frenetic political atmosphere ahead of the election, such calm, long-term considerations do not count for very much in the gilt market. One of the big talking points is the poor showing by the Tories in recent opinion polls. Many gilt practitioners view a Labour government as likely to kick off a still bigger borrowing spree and running into problems in keeping sterling steady within the European exchange rate mechanism - both developments being negative for the gilt market. Hence if the lacklustre results for the Conservatives from the polls continue, gilts may continue to slide. It was all different at the end of last year, with a strong demand for gilts from UK institutions and also, as figures from the Central Statistical Office last week showed, from overseas investors. An analysis of capital flows into the UK in the fourth quarter indicated that overseas investors bought Pounds 1.2bn of gilts in the final three months, after Pounds 540m in the third quarter.</p>

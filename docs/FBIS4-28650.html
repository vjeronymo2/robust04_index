			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa left Saturday for South Korea and China to hold talks  with his counterparts on ways to deal with a deepening crisis  over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.    Kakizawa is expected to use his talks Saturday with South  Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and South Korean President  Kim Yong- sam to reconfirm a determination among Japan, South  Korea and the United States to get tough on Pyongyang and  prepare punitive action against its secretive nuclear program.    South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and  Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, Japanese  Foreign Ministry officials predicted.    In Beijing on Sunday, Kakizawa will ask Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by the  UN Security Council against Pyongyang, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean  nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations.    Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials are counting on  the  powerful UN panel to move on the resolution as early as next  week.    Kakizawa and his South Korean and Chinese counterparts will  also take up other issues, including the summit of the Group of  Seven (G- 7) economic powers in Naples, Italy in July.</p>

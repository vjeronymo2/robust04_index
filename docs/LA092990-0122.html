			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY NOMINEE FOR U.S. BENCH GETS CONFIRMATION  </P> <P> In an action hailed by local legal and political leaders, the U.S. Senate on  Friday confirmed Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor's nomination  to the federal bench.  </P> <P> The confirmation, anticipated for months by legal observers, concluded a strong  campaign to see that a local jurist received the judgeship.  </P> <P> "He embodies all the qualities you want in a judge," said Thomas R. Malcolm,  president-elect of the Orange County Bar Assn. "Intellectually, he is supreme,  plus he has a very pleasing personality and demeanor and is a very hard  worker."  </P> <P> Taylor, 50, of Villa Park, emerged as a leader among a group of candidates for  the coveted post of U.S. district judge more than a year ago when local bar  associations and politicians brought his name to Sen. Pete Wilson, who later  recommended that President Bush nominate him for the lifetime position.  </P> <P> "He was one of the most popular choices in Orange County. All the judges and  lawyers are very happy (with the confirmation) and have backed him," Thomas  said.  </P> <P> Taylor's support was partially fueled by sentiment among the legal community  that Orange County has unfairly languished in Los Angeles' shadow and has been  slighted when judicial appointments have been passed out.  </P> <P> Alan Slater, executive officer of Orange County Superior Court, said Taylor's  confirmation "has been a long time coming."  </P> <P> "We're going to miss him. He's an outstanding judge and it's been a pleasure  working with him," Slater said.  </P> <P> Taylor will replace U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, a Los Angeles judge  who agreed to commute to Santa Ana until a replacement was chosen. Taylor is  expected to assume the position in mid-October, when Letts returns to the  federal court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Taylor could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> A third-generation Orange County resident, Taylor spent 20 years in private  practice in Newport Beach, specializing in business litigation, before he was  appointed to the Superior Court by Gov. George Deukmejian in June, 1986. Much  of his time off the bench is dedicated to lecturing and writing about business  law. He publishes a monthly business litigation newsletter.  </P> <P> A graduate of Santa Ana High School and UCLA School of Law, Taylor has  described himself as an enthusiastic traveler, swimmer, biker and gardener.  </P> <P> Other nominations confirmed Friday for U.S. District Court openings in  California were: David Levi of Sacramento in the Eastern District in  Sacramento; William Shubb of Sacramento, also in the Eastern District; and  James Ware of Santa Clara in the Northern District.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Catherine Gewertz contributed to this report.  </P></p>

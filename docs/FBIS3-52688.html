The source states that this legalization is in line  with the provisions of the new Mauritanian constitution which  recognizes labor union pluralism. The source adds that the  recognition has occurred after more than a year of legal battles.    The CGTM is based on the unique labor union movement that  has  existed in the country since its independence, that is, the  government-backed Mauritania Labor Union.    The leaders of the new labor union movement are mainly close  to the opposition. They are suggesting immediately undertaking  a large-scale campaign to install their sections in all the  country's socioeconomic and administrative sectors.</p>

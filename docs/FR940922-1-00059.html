Sanctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 179(a), if EPA finds that a state fails to make a submission required under the Act, one of the sanctions specified in section 179(b) is to apply unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after EPA's finding of failure to submit or incompleteness under section 110(k). Section 179(b) specifies two sanctions available to the Administrator: Withholding of certain highway funding under section 179(b)(1); and application of a 2:1 offset ratio to new or modified stationary sources of emissions for which a new source review permit is required under part D of title I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recently promulgated final regulations to implement section 179 of the Act, which specifies sanctions that are to apply where states fail to make a submission required under the Act. See 59 FR 39832 (Aug. 4, 1994). These regulations specify the order in which these sanctions will apply in the case of state non-compliance with provisions of the Act. These regulations do not, however, address the imposition of sanctions in the case of state failure to comply with a SIP call under section 110(k)(5) of the Act. Since EPA is proposing a SIP call in this rulemaking, EPA believes it is appropriate to propose the order of sanctions for purposes of failure to comply if the SIP call is promulgated as a final regulation. EPA believes that the general scheme promulgated for sanctions generally should also apply here. Under that scheme, EPA will generally apply the 2:1 offset sanction first and the highway finding sanction second. EPA believes the rationale for this approach in the sanctions rule applies with equal force here. In addition, EPA is considering whether the particular circumstances here that states must adopt the OTC LEV program by January 2, 1996 in order to comply with the two-year lead-time requirement prior to model year 1999 may merit acceleration of sanctions. That is, EPA requests comment on whether it should provide in the final rule that discretionary sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act would apply beginning immediately upon a finding of failure to submit the OTC LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Determination of Model Year <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing today to promulgate regulations determining, for the purposes of section 177 and Part A of Title II of the Clean Air Act, the definition of the term ``model year'' as it applies to motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines. This determination should remove any confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA is proposing this determination in this SNPRM because, if EPA approves the OTC's LEV recommendation, the OTR states will be required to adopt the LEV program under the provisions of section 177 of the Act. The definition of the term ``model year,'' in particular, the issue of when a model year begins, has been a major issue in the litigations that have resulted from New York and Massachusetts's attempts to adopt California LEV standards under section 177. These litigations have led to considerable confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA intends to remove this confusion by providing nationally consistent regulations providing detailed information regarding the term ``model year,'' including when such model years commence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 177 of the Act provides that any state which has plan provisions approved under part D may adopt and enforce California standards for any model year if such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year and if California and the state ``adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator).'' Section 202(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act defines model year as ``the manufacturer's annual production period (as determined by the Administrator) which includes January 1 of such calendar year. If the manufacturer has no annual production period, the term `model year' shall mean the calendar year.'' This definition of model year is repeated in regulations at 40 CFR &sect;86.082&hyph;2 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

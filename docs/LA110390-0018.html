			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS, RAMS TAKE MORE PUNISHMENT, THIS TIME FROM FANS  </P> <P> Once my anger subsided after watching the latest heavyweight championship  debacle, it became clear to me what the problem is and what the solution is.  </P> <P> Give the challenger a guaranteed $1 million. Give the champion a guaranteed $2  million. Give the winner the rest of the purse, be it $30 million, $50 million  or $100 million. Then you'll see how fast Buster or any other fighter will get  off the canvas after a knockdown.  </P> <P> SCOTT MAURER  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

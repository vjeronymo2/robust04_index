			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions AFTER A quiet period directors appear again to be busy buying shares in their companies. Selling still outweighs buying, but by a smaller ratio than has recently been the case. The largest buy of the week was in Granada Group. Charles Allen, who is in charge of the leisure division, bought 100,000 shares at 350p, more than doubling his holding. He and Gerry Robinson, the chief executive, previously bought stock in the autumn of 1992 at prices between 235p and 247p. Casket, the bicycles and clothing concern, announced strong interim results at the end of last year but has not been out-performing the market. Nevertheless Joe Smith, chief executive, and Ian Butcher, finance director, purchased a total of 236,825 shares at prices around 33p, increasing their share holdings sizeably. In November 1991 directors of ISA International, the information technology stationery company, bought a large amount of stock at prices between 52p and 64p. Almost 18 months later three directors, including John Heap, deputy chairman, and Richard Lindley, finance director, have sold approximately the same amount of stock for 105.5p. Each member of the board still owns a considerable number of shares. The Black family still has 30 per cent of Peter Black Holdings, the consumer product group. The recent sales by Thomas and Gordon Black, the joint chairmen, of a total of 4,600,000 shares at 170p were made on behalf of family trusts. At the time of the transactions Gordon Black announced that the family had no intention of disposing of any more shares in the near future.

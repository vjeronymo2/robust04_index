			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD PORT CONSIDERS COMPUTERIZED CARGO PROJECT;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: IF BUILT, THE COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM CALLED OMNIPORT COULD -- AT A  COST OF MORE THAN $80 MILLION -- TRIPLE THE 750,000 TONS NOW PROCESSED EACH  YEAR IN VENTURA COUNTY.  </P> <P> Oxnard Harbor District commissioners this week enthusiastically embraced a  proposal for an automated cargo-transporting system that could spin off more  than 2,000 jobs and bring about $530 million into Ventura County.  </P> <P> The system, which would be called Omniport Hueneme, would be one of five such  computerized terminals in the nation. The project proposed by CMT Systems of  San Francisco is estimated to cost between $80 million and $100 million.  </P> <P> "Omniport is a modern, state-of-the-art installation," Commissioner Ray  Fletcher said. "It's an unusual opportunity for the Port of Hueneme to join the  vanguard."  </P> <P> The district commissioners, who govern the Port of Hueneme, voted 4 to 0 to  look further into the proposal. Commissioner Cecil Schnelle was absent.  </P> <P> This fall the port completed construction of a $13-million wharf to expand  services.  </P> <P> But the Omniport system would allow the port to almost triple the 750,000 tons  of cargo it currently processes each year.  </P> <P> That would mean the port, constrained by its current boundaries and facilities,  could dramatically increase its $4-million gross annual income.  </P> <P> The Port of Hueneme now uses trucks with forklifts to transfer cargo to  shipside, where special gear loads it.  </P> <P> The computerized Omniport system would increase productivity by receiving  cargo, storing it and feeding it to the ship at a uniform speed.  </P> <P> The Port of Hueneme was chosen because it handles cargoes that are divided into  relatively small units, such as lumber and fruit, for which the Omniport was  designed.  </P> <P> It is estimated that the system could be in operation by 1995. But the project  must pass a series of hurdles before it is brought before harbor commissioners  for final approval.  </P> <P> Backers must perform environmental assessments, win support from various  government agencies and reach agreements with the Ventura County Railroad and  the Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co., a primary port user for the past 10 years.  </P> <P> However, Del Monte's terminal manager, James Dawson, sent the commissioners a  letter which questioned whether Omniport is worth the cost.  </P> <P> "I must insist the inconvenience and associated expense be reviewed," Dawson's  letter said.  </P> <P> The CMT proposal states that Oxnard Harbor District would pay 20% of the  project's costs. The remainder would be borne by CMT. In return, CMT would own  and operate the terminal, leasing land at the port from the harbor district.  </P> <P> Commissioners have not yet decided how they would finance the port's  expenditure, said William Buenger, deputy executive director of the port.  </P> <P> CMT is operating a similar facility in Houston that was completed in July,  1989. It is scheduled to complete construction of a terminal in Napier, New  Zealand, next month.  </P> <P> The Omniport Hueneme project has been under consideration for about a year.  </P> <P> "It means we have moved into the big time, and we will play a big part in the  economy of Ventura County," Commissioner Bob Jennings said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Textiles Will Get Into GATT `in 10 </F> Years'"]    [Text] New Delhi -- India's textile exports would have to  contend with a snail's pace integration of textiles into the  rule-based General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) system  for another ten years especially from its major trading partners  of the United States and the 12-member European Union (EU), the  Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman, Ashok Chugh,  said here Sunday.    In an interview to PTI [Press Trust of India] here on the  eve  of relinquishing his tenure as AEPC chairman, Chugh said though  a definite time-frame of ten years has been hammered out for the  abolition of import-quota regime embodied by the Multi Fibre  Arrangement (MFA), the process of integration of textiles into  GATT would be abysmally slow and in the case of EU and the US  this would be insubstantial till the end of the tenth year.    Elaborating on this point, Chugh said the EU has agreed only  for 1.4 per cent integration for the first three years, 6.9 per  cent in the next four years and 15.4 per cent in the last three  years. Thus, as far as EU is concerned, in seven years' time the  textile regime under the MFA would be freed only to the extent  of 8.3 per cent while the remainder 15 per cent in the last  three years.    He said with the EU only 23.7 per cent of the total textile  trade would be freed of the MFA and "virtually no growth has  been given to us and we could only hope that by the end of the  decade, the balance 76 per cent is freed at one go, which is a  fond hope."    Referring to India's textile exports to the United States,  Chugh said the integration phase ranges from three per cent in  the first three years, 10 per cent in the next four years and 32  per cent in the last three years. This meant, he said, 13 per  cent integration in seven years and at the end of the ten year  it would be 45 per cent and the remainder 55 per cent would be  `at one go after ten years, which is again a fond hope.'    Chugh charged the developed countries with using the ten  year  phase-out time to solve their recession faced by their textile  industry by offloading their obsolete machinery to third world  textile exporters who were in any case liberalising their  imports of capital goods for purchase provided to garment  exporters. He said if only the government could release the Rs  1.5 crore due to the council, it would apportion the sum for  footing expenses incurred by exporters in garment fair  exhibition abroad or for promotional work. He said in the past  AEPC used to foot 40 per cent of expenses borne by exporters in  trade fair participation abroad.    Referring to developments at home, the outgoing AEPC  chairman  said the government's recent move insisting on garment  quota-brokers to deposit one lakh nonrefundable sum with Rs  5,000 annual charges was challenged in the court. He said the  move designed to defeat quota frauds, only helped the  quota-brokers as they seemed to be dictating  exporter/manufacturer.    Chugh suggested the garment exporters must have a choice and  quota brokers should only be optional and wherever  self-certification as in the case of customs would do it should  be permitted.    Expressing concern over the sudden decline in non-quota  exports recently, the AEPC said this was due to abolition of  market development assistance (MDA).    Chugh also pleaded for providing ten categories of items for  export under non-quota entitlement (NQE) which was slashed to  five under the 1994-96 three-year garment policy.    He said non-quota exports had declined from 18 per cent last  year to 10 per cent now. Chugh wanted a separate joint secretary  in charge of garment exports so that exporters facing problems  could have an audience with the official to sort out issues.  This is necessary, he said, because garments exports alone  account for 15 per cent of the country's aggregate exports.    He was optimistic that the current year's target of garment  exports of Rs 10,500 crore would `surely be achieved,' provided  the government came forward to address the basic problems  plaguing exporters including changes in the AEPC set-up where an  IAS [Indian Administrative Service] officer with limited tenure  functions as director-general.</p>

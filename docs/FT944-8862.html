			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Sony to write off Pounds 1.67bn from Hollywood film arm Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company, yesterday counted the cost of its controversial diversification into the Hollywood film industry by announcing that it was writing Y265bn (Pounds 1.67bn) off the value of its US movie subsidiary. The write-off was the chief cause of Sony's decline in the first half of this year. It made a consolidated loss of Y279.9bn in the six months to September 30 against a pre-tax profit of Y56.6bn for the same period last year. Sony said that its core consumer electronics business and US music interests had fared well during the first half. However, it admitted that it would stay in the red with a pre-tax loss of Y205bn for the full financial year. Its shares fell in Tokyo and closed Dollars 3 1/2 down in New York at Dollars 55. The Sony announcement, following last month's row between Matsushita, another Japanese electronics group, and the management of MCA, its US entertainment subsidiary, highlights the problems faced by the Japanese in adapting to the different culture of their Hollywood subsidiaries. The Japanese 'invasion' of Hollywood was contentious from the start. It began in 1989 when Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures, and formed Sony Pictures Entertainment. It continued in the following year with Matsushita's Dollars 6.1bn acquisition of MCA. The Japanese, it was said, had 'gone to Hollywood and been mugged'. Sony yesterday conceded that 'in light of substantial investment' in SPE 'the business has not provided adequate returns'. It also said that 'additional funding will be needed to attain acceptable levels of profitability'. Industry estimates suggest that Sony has already invested Dollars 8bn in SPE (including the original Dollars 3.4bn offer price). Earlier this year, it effectively lent Y70bn to SPE through its music subsidiary. SPE fared relatively well in its first years. Its performance has since deteriorated, hitting a nadir with last year's Last Action Hero starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Sony studios, which were linked to the Heidi Fleiss sex scandal, were last month shaken by the resignation of Mr Peter Guber, their chairman. The Sony group mustered a 4 per cent increase in overall turnover to Y1,837bn in the first half from Y1,767bn, despite a 14 per cent fall in sales from its movie interests. Sony incurred a Y50bn loss on its movie interests at the operating level, which covers abandoning some films in development and providing for a number of outstanding lawsuits. The core electronics business benefited from cost-cutting and improved demand. Mr Barry Dargan, industry analyst at SG Warburg in Tokyo, said Sony's long-term outlook had improved after the writedown as the group had 'cleared the decks'.

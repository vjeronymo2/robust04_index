			<p>BFN     [Text] The British Government has assured the United  Democratic Front [UDF] government of increased British economic  and technical assistance as a way of helping it fulfill its  programs of poverty alleviation and better economic management.  The assurance was given in Blantyre today by the permanent  secretary of the British Overseas Development Administration,  Mr. (John Burke) when he held discussions with the vice  president, the Right Honorable Justin Malewezi and the minister  of finance, Hon. Aleke Banda. Speaking to MBC, Mr. (Burke)  said his government was pleased with the peaceful transition in  Malawi to a multiparty democracy and wishes to reaffirm its  support for this country. Mr. (Burke), however, pointed out  that further development aid will depend on the new government's  determination to tighten controls in public spending, crack down  on corruption, respect for human rights, liberalization of  markets, and other initiatives which, he said, are crucial to  all developing countries.    On his part, the vice president said the UDF government will  exercise prudence in its accountability of public resources, as  promised in its manifesto. Hon. Malewezi also disclosed that  the government has already ordered the auditing of books in the  civil service, a practice which, he said, was largely neglected  in the former government.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. TRADE DEFICIT DROPS SHARPLY TO $27.6 BILLION, LOWEST IN 4 YEARS  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit improved sharply in the first three months of the year,  narrowing to $27.6 billion for the smallest quarterly imbalance in four years,  the government said today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the imbalance between imports and U.S. exports  fell by 13.7% from a fourth-quarter deficit of $32.02 billion.  </P> <P> The improvement stemmed from a 5.7% jump in exports, which pushed sales of  American goods abroad to a record of $88.50 billion. Imports also hit a record  of $116.13 billion, but the 3.4% increase was smaller than the rate of export  expansion.  </P> <P> The big jump in exports reflected increases in sales of industrial products,  consumer goods and farm products. The 11% advance in farm exports put American  agricultural sales at $10.9 billion, the highest level in almost eight years.  </P> <P> The rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleum imports, which  shot up 18% to $10.8 billion, with the advance coming from the higher cost of  oil. Non-petroleum imports declined by $1.2 billion to $105.3 billion,  reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos.  </P> <P> The improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at the lowest level  since a $25.7-billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1985.  </P></p>

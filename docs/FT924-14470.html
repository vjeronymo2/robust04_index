			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Facing own financial guns Sir, The government of the Irish Republic has announced a support package for those Irish companies adversely affected by the recent sharp appreciation of the Irish punt against sterling ('The ERM and Maastricht', October 6). Among other measures, IPounds 25m of EC structural funds will be made available to 'underwrite exporters and those facing competition from the UK'. The UK is the second largest net contributor to the EC budget and so, as well as leaving the ERM with indecent haste, we are now suffering the further indignity of having our own guns turned upon us. Jeremy Archer, 100 Haldon Road, London SW18 1QQ</p>

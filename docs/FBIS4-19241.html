			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["J.L."-initialed report: "Sizable Improvement of Economy </F> in Western Germany"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 13 Apr -- The demand for industrial  products made in western Germany was much keener in February  than in January or in the last three months of 1993. This was  stated by the Bundesbank in its recent monthly report.  Different to the previous months, it was not only orders from  abroad that increased. For the first time domestic orders  significantly increased, too. Compared to the same period last  year, both the value and the volume was superior in February  1994. Production also increased sizeably in February. In the  January/February period, production was hardly lower than the  average of the last three months of 1993. In the main  construction industry, demand shot up more than 10 percent in  real terms in January within one year. Building production was  3.5 percent up in the first two months compared to last year.    The Bundesbank writes that in eastern Germany construction  orders were almost 50 percent up on January 1993. Building  production was about one-third higher than last year's level.  In the manufacturing industry, orders went up more than 25  percent over last year. There was an increase above the average  in domestic orders. However, even orders from abroad, which  were fluctuating strongly in the preceding months, were clearly  higher than in January 1993. Production increased by more than  20 percent within one year. "The importance" of hidden  unemployment has "significantly decreased": With a total of  135,000 people working short-time, this number is down 110,000  compared to March 1993. The number of people on schemes related  to labor market policy (further training and job-creation  programs) has dropped from 485,000 in March 1993 to 245,000.</p>

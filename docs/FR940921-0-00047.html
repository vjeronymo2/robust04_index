			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons just mentioned EPA is finalizing a two-fold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to refueling emissions for LPG vehicles. First, today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule includes a requirement that LPG refueling nozzles have no more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 2.0 cm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  dead space, as measured from the face of the nozzle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which seals against the vehicle receptacle ``O'' ring. Second, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling standard and SHED-based test consistent with the recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated ORVR requirement is being adopted for LPG-fueled light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The vehicle standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted for the difference in energy density between gasoline and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LPG, is 0.15 grams per dispensed gallon of fuel. This approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will ensure that the LPG vehicles will have refueling emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to those of other vehicles meeting the ORVR standards. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification testing waiver will be available for all classes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LPG vehicles to which this standard applies if the manufacturer can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate, through the use of development or other data, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle will meet the standard. For a complete discussion of how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 2.0 cm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for LPG vehicle refueling nozzles was derived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> please consult the summary and analysis of comments document for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This standard for LPG vehicles will apply to the same classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and model years as the ORVR rule (i.e., three year phase-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning with the 1998 model year for light-duty vehicles and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2001 model year for light-duty trucks). The requirement for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling nozzles will take effect January 1, 1998 for high volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations, with a two year extension until January 1, 2000 for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume stations (those which dispense less than the energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month). The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that this amount of leadtime for refueling stations will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for the replacement or retrofit of LPG nozzles during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal course of replacement or repair of in-use nozzles due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. LPG Tank Venting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel tanks for LPG vehicles currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a device known as a fixed liquid level valve, or outage valve,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proper fill level. This is a small orifice which can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opened during refueling in order to indicate that, upon the release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of liquid from the valve, the tank is filled and refueling should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stop. Although LPG tanks are now constructed with built-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatic shutoff devices to prevent overfilling, they still have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valves on them. The Agency proposed a prohibition on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-safety-related valves on gaseous-fueled vehicles in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the emissions of LPG from outage valves during refueling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received a variety of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressing concern about the proposal to eliminate outage valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from LPG vehicles. First, several commenters pointed out that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valves are required under the National Fire Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association standard 58 (NFPA 58), and that the NFPA code has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted by many state and local fire marshals as the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fire code. Second, some commenters stated that the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language as proposed precluded the use of all types of valves on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicles, including such things as manual fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutoff valves. Third, some comments were received expressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern that this requirement would preclude the use of liquefied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas (LNG) altogether due to the need to occasionally vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess pressure from LNG fuel tanks to prevent overpressurization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter expressed concern about the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement to LPG vehicles already in service and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of having to retrofit those vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency understands the apparent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict between its proposal and the requirements of NFPA 58. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that with the newer requirement in NFPA 58 for automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutoff (overfill prevention) mechanisms, the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valves on vehicle fuel tanks is obsolete, and should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from NFPA 58. Due to this conflict, however, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has chosen not to finalize its proposed requirements prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valves, but is working with the industry and NFPA to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement deleted from NFPA. While the Agency believes it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has the authority to preempt NFPA 58 as adopted by fire marshals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the adoption of the proposed requirement to eliminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valves, it prefers to work with the industry to remove that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement from NFPA 58 before superseding state and local law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through EPA regulation. Given that the proposed language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibiting non-safety-related valves is not being finalized, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other concerns expressed in the comments are alleviated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Agency is not finalizing the proposed requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning outage valves, they remain a concern as a source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. This is especially true for LPG vehicles which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to be certified as ILEVs. Thus, for any LPG vehicle, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above-mentioned refueling test procedure will be performed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage valve opened, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the outage valve or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other such gauges or valves would not be opened during refueling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use due to inaccessibility or other design features that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent or make it very unlikely that they could be opened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

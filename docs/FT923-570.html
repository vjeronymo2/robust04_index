			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Party 'lost touch' in the south-east A DETAILED analysis of Labour's dismal general election performance in the south-east offered a warning last night that the opposition cannot rely on the government's problems to bring a decisive change in its electoral fortunes, Philip Stephens writes. The study, published by the Fabian Society, indicates that Mr John Smith must oversee a radical shift in his party's policies and values if it is to achieve the breakthrough in the south-east needed to defeat the Conservatives. Written by Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, and based on research in five marginal constituencies in the south-east, it argues that the election result demonstrated that Labour had lost touch with the 'aspirant' working class whose support is vital to ensure election victories. It confirms other post-election research showing that Labour's tax and spending policies proved a fatal weakness in the 177 southern England seats outside London. It won only 10 of those seats. Labour was seen as the party of uniformity, which would stifle the ambitions of home and share owners, while the Conservatives successfully cultivated their image as that of 'opportunity' and 'choice'. As a move towards change, Mr Radice suggests abandonment of the Clause 4 commitment to public ownership. Southern Discomfort, Fabian Pamphlet 555, 11 Dartmouth Street, London SW1. Pounds 3.50.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> SCENIC HILLSIDE TO STAY AS IS, CITY SAYS  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday reassured South Laguna residents that it would not  allow development of a scenic, 235-acre parcel.  </P> <P> Several residents said they had received anonymous flyers warning that the  council would be opening the hillside for development.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city had been unable to negotiate a  purchase price for the land, known as the Esslinger Trust property and located  in Hobo Canyon, and that the council had specifically decided not to take the  issue to court. But he reassured the residents that the city would pursue  negotiations. The council also attempted to pacify the residents by voting to  set aside $1 million in state money for land purchases other than in Laguna  Canyon.  </P> <P> In other action Tuesday evening, the council agreed to spend $350,000 to repair  a bluff in Heisler Park.  </P> <P> The money will be used to construct a rock revetment to prevent further erosion  of the bluff where a major landslide occurred several weeks ago.  </P> <P> However, the council urged the staff to ensure that the revetment be built as  close to the bluff as possible so that it will not intrude in the tidal area.  </P> <P> This alternative may also allow for the construction of a bridge or the  reconstruction of a 20-foot stretch of sidewalk overlooking the ocean near  Jasime Street and Cliff Drive that slid two to three feet toward the ocean  several weeks ago.  </P> <P> A consultant and city staff members concluded that the shuffle board area near  the sidewalk was in danger of being lost if repairs were not made.  </P> <P> In choosing the rock revetment, the council rejected other alternatives such as  construction of a seawall or installing caissons to buttress the bluff.  </P> <P> City officials have estimated that the bluff has eroded 5 to 10 feet during the  last 40 years.

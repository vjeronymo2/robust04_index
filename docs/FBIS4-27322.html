			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago] </F>   [Text] Washington, 29 May -- After the resumption of  sector-by-sector negotiations in the Japanese-U.S. economic  framework talks, the question of whether "figures for the  future" should be included as objective criteria is expected to  be a focal issue once again. If the United States insists on  numerical indicators for such supplementary categories as the  increase in stores selling foreign products, which it is  proposing in place of "numerical targets," conflict may arise  again. This may even undermine the basic agreement already  reached at unofficial consultations on the "participation and  sales increases of foreign products." The following looks at  the points of agreement and remaining differences between Japan  and the United States on the eve of reopening the negotiations.  Points of Agreement [subhead]    According to sources in the Japanese and U.S. negotiating  teams, compared to the time that the framework talks broke down  last February, both sides compromised at the recent unofficial  meetings which resulted in the resumption of negotiations. In  the first place, the United States backed off on its demand for  "numerical targets" which set a specific amount of increase in  imports or sales until a specific point in time in the future --  the greatest stumbling block in the talks. It also did not ask  for a deadline for concluding the talks.    Japan also compromised on the issue of the objective of the  framework talks, giving up its stand of July 1993 that the talks  are meant to "effect an overall increase" in the participation  and sales of competitive foreign products in the Japanese  market, and accepting "sector-by-sector increases" in market  participation and sales as the negotiations' objective. While  some people are still negative about sales increase in  insurance, this is still a major concession on Japan's part  compared to its position last February that "we cannot promise  any increase in the future."    In short, the United States gave up its demand to set  numerical targets for imports and sales, while Japan compromised  on the framework talks' objective by accepting sector-by-sector  increases.  Differences and Ambiguous Points [subhead]    In previous sector-by-sector negotiations, the question of  the application of the objective criteria was not resolved.  Instead of insisting on its previous position that this should  apply only to "past results," Japan has now indicated a  willingness to accept the application of such criteria on the  number of dealers, past sales trends, and other "indicators" of  expanded market opportunities, which it opposed last February.    Taking advantage of this concession, the United States is  now  asking for the inclusion of "figures for the future" with regard  to the supplementary indicators which do not directly reflect  imports and sales, and this is considered to be merely a  roundabout form of "seminumerical targets." A typical example  of this is the proposal on figures for the future on the "number  of dealers of foreign products" and so forth in the negotiations  on automobiles and auto parts.    In government procurement -- for instance,  telecommunications  -- which is entirely under government control, the United States  may renew its demand to set future numerical indicators for the  "procurement volume" itself.    If the United States insists on such proposals and Japan  refuses stubbornly, saying "these are numerical targets," the  negotiations may break down again. However, certain U.S.  sources claim that "bringing up future numerical indicators  again for the supplementary categories is merely a negotiating  technique of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR)." They say that it is doubtful that the United States  will insist on such proposals at the risk of another round of  the depreciation of the dollar. It is possible that the United  States will compromise further on numerical targets at the  sector-by-sector negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> FLANAGAN, THE MUSICIANS' MUSICIAN, DRAWS A FULL HOUSE  </P> <P> Playing for a full house liberally sprinkled with admiring fellow pianists,  Tommy Flanagan opened Friday (and closed Sunday) at the Loa.  </P> <P> At 59, Flanagan has reached a level of acceptance as the musicians' musician.  His professorial mien belies his often bop-directed style, understated yet  always authoritative.  </P> <P> He leans toward lesser-known songs mainly by the be-bop pioneers: J. J.  Johnson, whose "Lament" was a high point; Tadd Dameron, represented by "Our  Delight," and Tom McIntosh, whose "With Malice Toward None" gave Flanagan a  chance to display his harmonic ideas as well as subtle dynamic shadings.  </P> <P> Sudden bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with  a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills.  </P> <P> He is technically flawless but never humorless, as witness the sly quotes from  "Salt Peanuts" in his version of an old Gillespie piece, the quasi-Cuban "Tin  Tin Deo."  </P> <P> Flanagan's manner on-stage is reserved; his announcements are often barely  audible, though he was heard paying tribute to Benny Carter, whose "When Lights  Are Low" was the opening song.  </P> <P> Flanagan's bassist, George Mraz, is as remarkable a partner as he could hope  for. Educated at the University of Prague, he has developed an astonishing  command that turns every solo into a model of creative artistry. During one  tune Flanagan suddenly began playing at twice the tempo, so that for Mraz it  became a double-Czech stomp.  </P> <P> Mraz and the young drummer Kenny Washington function as a formidable team,  working with Flanagan to present neatly crafted arrangements. In terms of the  warmth and unity established by the three, it was, to quote a Thad Jones song  played during this luminous hour, like old times.  </P></p>

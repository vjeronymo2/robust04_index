			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WON $1-BILLION PAYOFF FROM LOTTERY DURING YEAR  </P> <P> The California State Lottery hit the jackpot in the last fiscal year as  revenues reached $2.6 billion, lottery Executive Director Chon Gutierrez  announced Wednesday in San Diego.  </P> <P> Record-breaking fiscal 1988-89 lottery sales for the first time provided more  than $1 billion to the state's public education system, Gutierrez said. "We had  a terrific year, the best one yet."  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified School District is the second-largest recipient of  lottery money, trailing only Los Angeles schools, according to Lottery figures.  San Diego city schools will receive more than $20 million from 1988-89 lottery  proceeds, part of the $78 million due schools in San Diego County.  </P> <P> School officials have already included the anticipated lottery revenues in the  district's current $540 million budget, said Acting Supt. Cathy Hopper. The  money is not designated for specific projects, and is used simply to balance  the books, Hopper said.  </P> <P> By law, at least 34% of lottery revenues is earmarked for public education, but  that number rose to 40% last year, according to Gutierrez. The lottery awarded  half of its income to prize winners and spent 10% on expenses, he said.  </P> <P> The lottery's contributions to public schools rose by a third from the 1987-88  fiscal year, Gutierrez said. Lottery funds make up 3% of school budgets  throughout the state.  </P> <P> The lottery distributes money to the school systems based on their size. For  the fiscal year that ended June 30, districts earned $181 from the lottery for  every student enrolled.  </P> <P> Lottery surveys show that 60% of Californians played the weekly Lotto or an  instant game within the last month, according to Gutierrez. Although state  residents are still buying only a third as many tickets per-capita as players  in Ohio and Massachusetts, sales for July point to the current fiscal year  being another record breaker, he said.  </P> <P> However, Hopper said lottery experts have warned her district not to expect  another record-breaking year. "A lot of people have been telling us that the  lottery has peaked," she said.  </P> <P> Gutierrez disagreed. He said fully automated, self-service Lotto machines due  in San Diego within months, and a daily drawing game set to begin next year  will push sales higher.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (27): A basic guide for the visitor - Contacts are usually readily accessible - but make appointments before you travel, urges Bob Baker / Contacts Communicating with contacts in Guernsey, from almost any part of the world, is relatively straight forward by international subscriber dialling, facsimile or telex. The island's telecommunications are run by Guernsey Telecoms, an autonomous trading department of the insular government that has its own local directory inquiry service. From the UK and Jersey, calls to Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm need the prefix code 0481 and international calls need the code 44 481. Inward postal, freight and courier services are reliable with rapid delivery times on the island. The Bailiwick of Guernsey's postal services have been run since 1969 by the Guernsey Post Office, another autonomous trading department of the insular government. There are regular scheduled air passenger services into Guernsey from not only Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Southampton - with flying times of under an hour - but also from other UK regional airports and several European airports. A conventional, roll-on, roll-off passenger/car ferry service operates between Guernsey and Poole but the fastest scheduled crossings - 2 1/4 hours  -are from Weymouth by high-speed passenger ferries including a new passenger/car 'wave-piercing' catamaran. There are also various sea transport links into Guernsey from Jersey, Alderney, Sark, Cherbourg and St Malo. It is sensible to make prior appointments with contacts in Guernsey before travelling to the island and to be aware that scheduled air services can be disrupted from time to time by fog. Visitors travelling by sea will arrive at St Peter Port Harbour just a short walk or road journey from any St Peter Port destination. For those arriving by air there is bus service or a 20-minute car journey into town. Contacts are usually readily accessible, partly because the island is small. A leisurely drive around most of Guernsey along the coast roads takes only about 45 minutes - even when cruising below the maximum speed limit of 35mph. The Guernsey telephone directory, published annually each May, is an invaluable tool for anyone trying to contact not only individual residents or businesses but also official and voluntary bodies. Three pages containthe names and telephone numbers of official contacts within island government and public administration. This list is headed by members of The Royal Court of Guernsey, every local politician and parish official, plus the names and addresses of all States of Guernsey Departments. There is a Yellow Pages section at the end of the directory. In addition, there is a section explaining the island's public warning systems in the event of big disasters or emergencies, including nuclear accidents.

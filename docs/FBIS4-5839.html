			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai-Cambodian Problem"] </F>   [Text] It is certainly counterproductive for the Thai and  Cambodian Governments and their senior officials to use various  occasions to talk about problems between the two countries,  especially if they speak to foreign or Thai correspondents.  What results is continued misunderstanding. The fact that the  Thai side suggested that the Cambodian Government use diplomatic  channels to resolve misunderstandings between them, rather than  airing their opinions through the mass media, is a good idea.    The Thai suggestion should not be directed only at the  Cambodian Government, but the Thai Government itself should  carry out this suggestion even if the Cambodians do not heed it  and continue to accuse Thailand through foreign correspondents.  An example of the Cambodian accusation concerns assistance of  Thai soldiers to the Khmer Rouge during the fight for Pailin.  The Thai Government should resort to diplomatic channels to  deal with this issue instead of making rebuttals through the  mass media.    It appears that so far, the foreign media is prejudiced  against the Thai military on issues pertaining to Cambodia. The  way to erase this prejudice is to be open and to permit  inspection. For example, after using diplomatic channels the  Thai side should inform the media of its actions. The Thai  Government must act to remedy the wrong understanding of the  country concerned. Once such action has been taken, the Thai  Government should hold a major news conference to inform the  world of its actions.    The Cambodian problem will occupy Thailand and create  continual anxiety if Thailand ignores the problem. If the Thai  Government does not correctly handle the problem, Thailand will  continue to be on the receiving end of accusations arisen from  either prejudice or distrust. Therefore, the solution is to be  open, honest, and to allow inspection. The Thai Government must  give real priority to resolving misunderstandings with the  Cambodian Government and the media. It appears that we have not  done so. This could be because it was felt that the problem was  not that serious. It is an issue however, which will affect  international trust in Thailand.    The history between Thailand and Cambodia appears to be  repeating itself again. The current Cambodian Government  distrusts Thailand and accuses it of abetting the Khmer Rouge.  The Thai Government must make a concerted and prompt effort to  address this distrust. It must not ignore the problem because  peace in Cambodia will benefit Thailand, particularly the Thai  people along the border.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Way is cleared for Gold TV channel UK GOLD, the planned Pounds 30m television entertainment channel, now seems certain to go ahead. The new channel, which will be financed entirely by advertising, at least in the first year, will be broadcast by the Astra satellite system. A US television company has agreed in principle to underwrite the 65 per cent of the equity not held by the channel's founders, Thames Television and BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC. A deal being finalised with the unnamed company clears the way for a launch of UK Gold in mid November. Thames, which will cease to be an ITV company at the end of this year, will take a 15 per cent stake in the company, with an option for a further 5 per cent, and the BBC will have 20 per cent. The aim is for the rest of the equity to be held by four or five shareholders, but the underwriting deal means that the launch of the channel can now go ahead before all the shareholders are formally in place. The channel, drawing on the programme libraries of Thames, the BBC and other broadcasters, will be entirely devoted to entertainment. There will be no news, current affairs, sport or religious programmes. The programme schedules will include popular drama series, such as The Bill, and Eastenders, and comedies such as Porridge. A long-term programme deal has already been signed by BBC Enterprises and another with Thames will be complete within a few days. The programmes will be made available under existing agreements with Equity, the actors' union. The Independent Television Commission has indicated that UK Gold's structure is likely to be acceptable under the terms of the Broadcasting Act, which prevents the BBC being part of an ITC-licensed satellite channel. The BBC would be part of the UK Gold holding company but would not be part of a separate company that would hold the licence. ITV is still considering the possibility of launching a similar channel, ITV2, using its programme library. It is not clear whether ITV2 is anything more than an attempted spoiler. UK Gold's business plan suggests that it will initially get a 3 per cent share of viewing in homes that can receive satellite and cable television, rising to 5 per cent in six or seven years. Executives privately suggest that it may get 7 per cent or 8 per cent. Although UK Gold is seen as primarily an advertising channel, it may join one subscription packages of programmes now being planned for satellite television. Although UK Gold will be on a Europe-wide satellite, it will be available only in the UK because of restrictions in programme rights.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Observer: Stage-fright Why did the BBC suddenly lose its nerve about showing its economic editor's analysis of the causes of the UK recession on last night's Panorama? Whatever one might think about Jay, former son-in-law of a Labour prime minister and UK ambassador to Washington, he is no slouch when it comes to economics. Perhaps this was the problem. He knows so much that translating it into TV pictures isn't easy. Whether one subscribes to the conspiracy, or cock-up, theory about the programme, it is a bizarre affair. Jay is an old colleague of John Birt, the BBC's next director-general, and they pioneered a more in-depth approach to current affairs coverage while working on Weekend World at LWT. Samir Shah, the BBC boss who axed the programme, is another Birt protege from his old LWT days. Meanwhile, if Panorama - the BBC's flagship current affairs programme - cannot tackle such central historical subjects before the election campaign has officially even started, what are the chances of the broadcasters really testing the politicians once the race is on?</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HIRING DAY LABOR OFF STREET OUTLAWED IN REDONDO BEACH  </P> <P> Contractors who hire day laborers off the streets of Redondo Beach will be  subject to fines and possible imprisonment under a new ordinance adopted this  week.  </P> <P> The measure, which becomes effective Feb. 16, broadens an existing ordinance  that only penalized the largely immigrant workers who solicit employment on the  street. Now, both employers and workers face fines of up to $1,000 and jail  sentences of up to one year.  </P> <P> "By making employers equally liable, the new law gives us a more effective  means of dealing with the problem," said Redondo Beach Police Capt. Ray Graham.  </P> <P> While the new ordinance covers all public streets and sidewalks in the city,  its first application is expected to be along Artesia Boulevard in North  Redondo, where immigrant workers have gathered for years to await job offers  from cruising contractors. Merchants there have complained that customers are  scared off when the workers congregate on the sidewalks outside their stores.  </P> <P> Officials in adjacent Lawndale said Redondo's new ordinance will only push the  job-seekers across the street into their city. Bart Swanson, Lawndale's public  safety supervisor, said he gets "a lot of complaints" from property owners on  Lawndale's side of the border at Inglewood Avenue and Artesia. He said he has  seen as many as 120 workers gathered at or near the intersection.  </P> <P> If law enforcement officers from one city show up, the workers often cross the  street into the other jurisdiction, Swanson said. "They've gotten streetwise,"  he said. "It takes a coordinated effort to keep them from just moving back and  forth."  </P> <P> Early last year, Lawndale adopted its own ordinance against soliciting jobs on  the street, but it provides no penalties for employers.  </P> <P> Capt. Walter Lanier, commander of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lennox  substation, which provides law enforcement for Lawndale, agreed that the new  Redondo ordinance "could push the problem more into Lawndale." He said he plans  to talk with Lawndale officials about bringing that city's ordinance in line  with Redondo's.  </P> <P> "We have worked with the Redondo police in the past and will continue to do  so," Lanier said. He estimated that the cooperative effort led to more than 100  arrests last year, but acknowledged that the job-seekers keep coming back.  </P> <P> "When the numbers build up, we have a sweep operation," he said. "The activity  dies down awhile, then slowly builds up again. As long as employers keep  driving over there, the workers are going to continue to show up."  </P> <P> Graham, the Redondo police captain, said the city will use mailers, posters and  other means to advise potential employers that it has become unlawful for them  to hire workers who solicit jobs in the street. He said similar ordinances have  been tested in the courts and found to be constitutional.  </P> <P> Laborers' daily struggle, Page 9.  </P></p>

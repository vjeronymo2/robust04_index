			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Berezko under the rubric "The Arsenal": </F> " A Chemical Laboratory Under Armor"]    [Text] Those who once served in subunits of the chemical  troops will remember the equipment used for conducting radiation  and chemical reconnaissance, of course. It consisted of the  corresponding model of a BRDM [armored radiation patrol vehicle]  or Uazik. The new chemical reconnaissance vehicle (RKhM-4) is  based on the BTR-80.    The RKhM-4 is capable of conducting radiation and chemical  reconnaissance in difficult topographical and meteorological  conditions day or night. It is adapted for surmounting natural  and artificial obstacles and water barriers. It performs  reconnaissance effectively in temperatures of -40 to +40 degrees  C and at altitudes of up to 3,000 meters.    The equipment on the RKhM-4 makes it possible to measure the  gamma-radiation level in an area and the degree of radioactive  contamination of various objects and to perform constant,  automatic monitoring of the air. It can also perform a large  number of other missions to provide a complete and comprehensive  assessment of the radiation and chemical situation.    In peacetime the RKhM-4 can be used for reconnoitering the  situation along main pipelines and for mopping up following the  dumping of radioactive or chemical substances.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Technical Specifications of RKhM-4                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speed at which reconnaissance can be  |                                      |  |carried out (km per hour)             |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |radiation                             |30                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |chemical                              |10                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length of continuous operation withou-|24                                    |  |t replenishment of expandable supplie-|                                      |  |s (hours)                             |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew size                             |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

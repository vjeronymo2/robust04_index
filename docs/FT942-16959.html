			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs put Pittards in loss Pittards reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.81m for 1993 after restructuring and closure costs of Pounds 8.3m relating to its withdrawal from clothing leather production, writes Jean Marshall. There were profits of Pounds 853,000 for 1992, restated for FRS 3. Turnover amounted to Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 100.6m) with Pounds 100.5m coming from continuing operations. Before provisions, operating profits on continuing activities were Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 4.7m). The pre-tax result was after net interest costs of Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 2.11m). Losses per share came through at 35p against earnings of 0.7p but a dividend of 1p (2p) is proposed for the year. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said that wool sheepskin prices, which had been volatile during the early months of 1993, rose sharply in the second half and had continued to rise in the first quarter of 1994. However, the chamois division, although still lossmaking, performed appreciably better in the second half, he added. So far this year the group's factories had operated at virtually full capacity. In addition, there was an improving proportion of higher margin products in the sales mix. Net borrowings at the year-end were slightly lower at Pounds 15.3m.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (9): Popular option for many occupiers - Business Parks / Whatever the outcome of the town-centre versus out-of-town argument, we could soon see rising headline rents for the best office space The government is taking a tough stance on transport and the environment. And the debate on the relative merits of city centre versus out-of-town offices looks set to reopen. After PPG6 - the planning policy statement regarding out-of-town shopping development, which appears to have been unswervingly enforced in the light of recent decisions despite howls of protest from the superstore operators - it seems that PPG13, aimed at preventing further development in the green belt, is going to become equally significant to the future growth of business parks. The decision by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to throw out Lloyd's Register of Shipping's proposals to build a 350,000 sq ft headquarters at Bramshott Place at Liphook, Hampshire is being cited as a landmark case. Lloyd's chose the 50-acre site which already had planning for 100,000 sq ft  -essentially to replace the previous hospital on part of the land - after an extensive search which involved considering some 70 other locations across south-east England. The register's plans were fully supported by the local planning authorities and the local community which is set to suffer job losses as a result of Ministry of Defence closures. The fact that the amount of buildings proposed by Lloyd's far exceeded the existing permission was only one element in the secretary of state's reasons for turning down the application. With little public transport available locally, the new headquarters would clearly be heavily orientated towards car-users - with both staff and visitors driving relatively long distances to reach it. Despite all the time and effort - not to mention hard cash - that a disappointed Lloyd's has invested in Bramshott Place, it will not appeal. Danish developer Danbuild, the owner of the site, is now considering various options, says its joint agent Roger Saper of surveyor Jones Lang Wootton. John Batsford of surveyor Chesterton considers that from now on business park developers and funding institutions will look very carefully not only at public transport connections to prospective sites but also to the provision of additional on-site facilities (such as shops and restaurants) for staff. But while the longer-term trend - reinforced by government policy - may be back to the town centre, business park space remains a popular option - with a whole range of occupiers including banks, insurance companies, accountants and public sector agencies, all of whom employ significant numbers of clerical staff which it was traditionally considered were more attracted to jobs in town centres. The rate of business park development has slowed during the downturn over the past couple of years, in line with other commercial property sectors. Paul Ives at surveyor Erdman Lewis estimates that from a peak of 15m sq ft of business park space completed in 1990 the volume dropped to less than 2m sq ft in 1993. Today, construction is unlikely to begin without a pre-let in place. Arlington - with some 7.2m sq ft already developed, 8.5m sq ft with planning and a further 12. 9m sq ft at application stage - is the largest specialist developer of business parks in the UK. It is one of the few which have continued to build speculative space over the past year or so. At the Oxford Business Park - the old Cowley works - Arlington has just completed an office village of 32,000 sq ft in five units. Already, says agent Ian Warboys of surveyor Strutt &amp; Parker, solicitors have been instructed to proceed with letting documentation on behalf of two potential tenants. And At Hatfield Business Park, Arlington has just finished two warehouse buildings totalling 95,000 sq ft. The Hatfield Park epitomises the evolution of Arlington's philosophy which has moved from a mixed to an all-office environment and is now shifting back to a mixed-use park. However, Warboys emphasises that careful planning is necessary to house both office and industrial users on the same site. For example, large lorries need specially designed roads, parking and yards. On the other hand, no image-aware director of, say, a professional business wants to entertain clients looking out of his windows at warehouses and heavy vehicles. So different uses at all Arlington's new parks are sited in separate zones. Stockley Park at Heathrow, arguably the UK's first true business park, is still regarded as the flagship. But although there is planning for a further 600,000 sq ft, there is presently no new space available. And it seems that demand is predominantly for new space. The second-hand buildings at Stockley are failing to achieve premium rents says Richard Storey of surveyor Richard Ellis. Top rents at the height of the boom reached as much as Pounds 32 a sq ft. Rent obtained in the last major letting - to Reebok earlier this year - was Pounds 26 a sq ft. However, second-hand space on offer is going for less. Against this, Arlington reports that rents for second-hand space at its parks are holding up well - particularly at the successful Birmingham Business Park. And as for new space, Arlington's pre-let to KPMG Peat Marwick at Reading Business Park achieved Pounds 23-Pounds 24 a sq ft - which compares with about Pounds 18.50 a sq ft for high-quality offices in Reading town centre. In general, headline rents at good business parks appear to remain static. But there is evidence that landlords are taking a harder line on short-term break clauses in leases. And rent-free periods are becoming shorter. Whatever the eventual outcome of the growing in-town/out-of-town argument - and this one will run and run - we could soon see rising headline rents for the best office space; wherever it is.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 1230 GMT on 21 April, in its "Modern Closeup"  program, carries a 30-minute video report from the NHK studio in  Tokyo by NHK International News Department Correspondent Toshiro  Kishi and NHK newscaster Hiroko Kuniya on Kishi's visit to North  Korea to cover the celebration marking the 82d birthday of North  Korean President Kim Il-song as well as the situation in North  Korea.    Explaining how a group of NHK correspondents obtained visas  from North Korea to cover the celebration, Kishi states:  "Months after applying for them, North Korea issued our visas  on 14 April, just a day prior to the celebration. I heard that  North Korea issued our visas after long hesitation and much  agony." Discussing the stay of the NHK correspondent in  Pyongyang, Kishi said: "Our news coverage was severely  restricted."    After a video showing citizens, streets, and cars in  Pyongyang, Kishi continues: "Despite the reported oil shortages  in that country, the number of trucks and automobiles in  Pyongyang has grown since 1992, when I last visited the city."  The video shows a folk dance staged in Kim Il-song Plaza on the  evening of 15 April, with Kishi saying: "Most of North Korea's  wealth is concentrated in Pyongyang. Many foreigners frequently  visit the capital. Therefore, it is mistaken to assess all of  North Korea based only on Pyongyang."    Discussing the food situation in North Korea, Kishi states:  "I found no food shortages during my brief stay in Pyongyang."    Noting a visit by NHK correspondents to the border town of  Panmumjom, Kishi adds: "On my way to Panmunjom I saw some  factories emitting smoke, despite reports that many local  factories in North Korea remain idle due to a lack of energy."  The video shows a village near Panmumjom, then cuts to Kishi  interviewing North Korean Major General Yi Chan-nam of the  Military Armistice Commission. In the interview, Yi says: "Our  nation is in the highest state of tension." Asked why North  Korea is in such a situation, Yi states: "America is deploying  Patriot missiles to South Korea, and are saying they will resume  the Team Spirit exercises."    Discussing his impressions of Pyongyang, Kishi says: "I  found no evidence during my stay in Pyongyang that North Korea  was in a war atmosphere or on the verge of economic collapse as  reported by the Western news media. I felt that the citizens in  Pyongyang appeared more economically well off than when I  visited two years ago." Kishi notes: "North Korea issued visas  for us with the aim of showing the world that North Korea wants  peace, not war, and that North Korea is seriously seeking to  settle the nuclear issue." After Kuniya briefly explains how  North Korea has been trying to resolve the nuclear issue, the  video shows Kim Il-song meeting with foreign correspondents and  an interview with North Korean Major General Kim Yong-chol.  Following a lengthy video report on how the United States and  South Korea are going to deal with North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons, Kishi and Kuniya conclude the  program.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Papers detail espionage deals DOCUMENTS published today by the Public Record Office show that Queen Victoria's ministers employed correspondents of the Reuters news agency as government intelligence gatherers. The papers - released with the approval of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as part of the government's drive towards greater openness - indicate that the then prime minister Lord Salisbury cancelled the four-year, Pounds 500-a-year contract for 'confidential reports' in 1898. According to the Foreign Office, the papers detail expenditure on espionage financed by parliament in the years following the French revolution.</p>

These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, September 14, 1992, and January 28, 1992 respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles Area and the Ventura County Area. 43 FR 8964; 40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.222. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas.

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal;'' SCAQMD Rule 1179 ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations;'' and VCAPCD Rule 74.17 ``Waste Disposal Sites.'' These submitted rules were found to be complete on July 10, 1991, April 3, 1992, and November 20, 1992 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is intended to reduce the emission of VOCs from the ignition of charcoal in residential barbecue grills. SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is designed to inventory the sources of VOCs and odoriferous compounds from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Waste Disposal Sites,'' is designed to control emissions of non-methane organic compounds, including VOCs, from solid waste landfills through the use of flares and other control technology. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents which specify the minimum requirements that a rule must contain in order to be approved into the SIP. The CTG's are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182 (a) (2) (A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD Rules 1174 and 1179, and VCAPCD Rule 74.17 control emissions from source categories for which EPA has not issued a CTG. Accordingly these rules were evaluated against the general RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (section 110 and part D), 40 CFR part 51, EPA's ``Blue Book'' referred to in footnote 1, and against other EPA policy including the EPA Region 9_CARB document entitled ``Guidance Document for Correcting VOC Rule Deficiencies'' (published April, 1991). In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is a new rule which was adopted to reduce the emission of VOCs from the use of flammable materials to ignite barbecue charcoal. SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is a new rule which was adopted to inventory VOC and odoriferous compound emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Solid Waste Disposal Sites,'' is a new rule which was adopted to control emissions of VOCs from solid waste landfills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal'', Rule 1179 ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations'', and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Rule 74.17 ``Solid Waste Disposal Sites'' are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H.

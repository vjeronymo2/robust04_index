			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes heads for market with Pounds 90m tag Wainhomes, one of the 25 largest housebuilders in the UK, is poised to announce plans for a stock market listing, together with an offer for sale to raise money for expansion. The exact amount to be raised has still to be decided, but the issue is expected to value the group at about Pounds 90m. It will be the latest in a series of fund raisings by large and medium-sized housebuilders seeking to exploit the recovery in the private housing market. Nearly Pounds 500m was raised by UK housebuilders from rights issues alone last year, mostly to buy land. Last week Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder announced that it was raising Pounds 19.1m from a 1-for-4 issue at 88p a share. Wainhomes was formed in 1989 by the merger of three privately owned housebuilders operating mainly in north-west England. These were: Whelmar, a former housebuilding subsidiary of Christian Salvesen based in Chester; Wainhomes, based in Standish near Wigan and, Lanley which operated in the Preston area. The merged businesses have proved resilient during the recession, with pre-tax profits never falling below Pounds 5.3m for the year to March 31 1993. This compares with a peak of Pounds 8.6m during 1989-90. The company is expanding into other regions, including Yorkshire, Hampshire and Dorset and the south-east Midlands. Sales outside the north-west are likely to account for about 200 of the 900 homes expected to be built during the 12 months to the end of March. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to be about Pounds 6m, with turnover likely to exceed Pounds 70m. Net borrowings of Pounds 12m, representing gearing of about 25 per cent, are expected to be wiped out following the offer for sale. This will leave the group in a strong position to increase its landholdings of 2,400 plots, which at the current sales level is equivalent to just under three years' supply. The company in recent years has concentrated on buying small sites, which are less attractive to large volume builders. It believes this approach has enabled it to achieve better margins as well as providing more outlets. Institutions own 35 per cent of the shares. Another 33 per cent belongs to the family interests of Mr Bill Ainscough, owner of the original Wainhomes business. Mr Trevor Hemmings, former owner of Lanley, has a 17 per cent stake and 15 per cent is held by former managers of Welmar, which acquired the company in a management buy-out from Christian Salvesen. Following the offer for sale and listing, Mr Gavin Reed, vice chairman of Scottish and Newcastle brewery group, is expected to become non-executive chairman of Wainhomes. Mr Ainscough will become deputy chairman. Mr Ron Smith will remain chief executive.</p>

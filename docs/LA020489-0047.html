			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIC INSTITUTE ORDERED TO PAY $1 MILLION  </P> <P> A federal judge on Friday awarded nearly $1 million in attorneys fees to a  Contra leader, a former CIA official and others who were accused in a civil  lawsuit of mounting a guns-for-drugs scheme to aid the Nicaraguan rebels.  </P> <P> Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in June threw out the $24-million  lawsuit filed by the Christic Institute on behalf of journalists Tony Avirgan  and Martha Honey, saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their case. Defense  attorneys then filed a motion seeking to recover damages caused by the lawsuit.  </P> <P> King ruled in their favor again Friday, saying the institute and the plaintiffs  would have to pay the defendants $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in  court costs.  </P> <P> He said the suit was "based on unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from  unidentified sources with no first-hand knowledge."  </P> <P> Among the defendants in the suit were Adolfo Calero, a civilian leader of the  Contras, and Iran-Contra figures Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim, and  former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub.  </P> <P> Daniel Sheehan, a lawyer for the Washington-based Christic Institute, a liberal  public-interest legal services group, called the order a "legal disgrace" and  said it provided further evidence of King's bias in the case. "Obviously, we  are going to appeal this," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Confusion rules as Yeltsin takes scythe to soviets PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's plans to reform the system of soviets - the law-making councils in every village, town, district and region of Russia - yesterday touched off a mixture of anger, bewilderment, and resignation in the regions. The soviets system was developed by Lenin under the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets'. They had no real power under communism but, in more recent times, have clashed increasingly with parallel executive bodies known as administrations. The frightening sight of tanks pounding the Russian parliament has come as a clear warning to the soviets, many of which had backed Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary speaker, in his power struggle with Mr Yeltsin. Taking the hint, some have begun to discuss their own dissolution. 'Everybody understands that we must end this theatre of the absurd,' said Mr Vitaly Turkov, a spokesman for the Vladimir province council just east of the capital. Mr Vasily Cherepanov, deputy chief of the Perm council, said relations with the regional administration had been soured by the power struggle in Moscow and that his council would no doubt vote to dissolve itself. However, he did not think any new council system would last long because Mr Yeltsin would find in it a new 'enemy' to blame for worsening economic problems. A spokesman for the Chelyabinsk council, which appointed its chief as head of the administration in defiance of another governor appointed by Mr Yeltsin, hit out at the president's 'violation of human rights'. Although made from such a clear position of strength, Mr Yeltsin's announcement on Wednesday of impending changes also posed more questions than it answered. Most officials of the soviets agree they need reforming, saying for a start that regional soviets need to be cut back from 200 members to 10-15. They also agree they should not be involved in the day-to-day running of the regions. But nobody has yet spelt out what should replace them, nor is it clear whether all but the regional and some city soviets, would be abolished. Mr Vyacheslav Tyabotin, spokesman for the Novosibirsk regional administration, whose governor was sacked on Tuesday for opposing Mr Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament, said he believed a single regional soviet would be sufficient for Novosibirsk. He cited as absurd the existence of a soviet in even the smallest village. 'Endless contradictions in some soviets have turned many of them into big talking shops,' he said. But he and many others warned that haste in electing new councils in December, as Mr Yeltsin suggested, would bungle the reform of local government. Deputy prime minister Sergei Shakhrai, who specialises in regional and constitutional issues, has threatened to resign because, fearing a power vacuum, he wants gradual reform of soviets after a new national parliament is created. The reform of the soviets also has a direct bearing on attempts to transform Russia into a genuine federal state. Republics such as Bashkortostan, which sees its soviet as the national parliament, insisted that any reform must be decided together with federation members. Mr Yeltsin's announcement also leaves in the air how the upper chamber of a new Russian parliament would be formed. His initial plan was for it be to be a Federation Council comprising leaders of each region's administration and council. But Mr Nikolai Ryabov, head of the central electoral commission, said yesterday a lower chamber could be elected in December, and formation of an upper chamber decided later.</p>

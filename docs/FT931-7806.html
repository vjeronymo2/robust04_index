			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC attacks US claims over procurement bids THE EC yesterday hit back at 'misleading' US allegations that the Community is restricting US companies' access to public procurement contracts. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said that new single market legislation was opening up public procurement in the Community. He pointed out that since new procurement rules for utilities came into force on January 1, 163 contracts had been advertised for tender in the EC's Official Journal. A document leaked from the office of the US trade representative, now Mr Mickey Kantor, over the weekend claimed that bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.8bn) were offered to EC contractors under the Gatt government procurement code in 1990, compared with Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US operators. The US tactics have escalated the dispute between the US and the EC over public procurement ahead of the next meeting of trade negotiators in Brussels, set for March 11. The US has threatened to ban EC companies from bidding for federal contracts if allegedly discriminatory EC procurement legislation is not abandoned before March 22. EC negotiators said yesterday they were 'baffled' by the appearance of the US document, which they said had not been part of last week's public procurement negotiations in Washington. 'I can only suspect that the US has taken our numbers and added some of its own,' said one EC official yesterday. The officials admitted that, in absolute terms, the 1990 Gatt figures - the relevance of which the Community disputes - showed that the US was ahead. But they pointed out that between 1985 and 1990 the value of EC contracts open to competition increased by 104 per cent under the code, whereas the value of US contracts decreased by 30 per cent. New legislation would continue that trend, they claimed. The US is complaining that one of the laws - the directive covering the supply of equipment for utilities - favours EC manufacturers of telecoms and electrical equipment. The Community in turn has attacked 'Buy America' legislation which it says gives US manufacturers even more preferential treatment. The EC yesterday said the US claim that only Dollars 15bn of public procurement was covered by the Buy America laws was dubious as the figure did not include lucrative transport and energy contracts, which gave a 25 per cent price preference to US companies, and demanded local content of between 50 and 60 per cent. EC officials also emphasised that many US contracts called for 20 per cent of the work to go to US companies.</p>

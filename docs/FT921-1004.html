			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Chrysler rethinks Mitsubishi Motors shares disposal CHRYSLER, the US automotive group, is reconsidering a planned sale of shares in Mitsubishi Motors following a heavy fall in the Japanese company's share price caused by arbitrage selling. Bankers expected the international sale of 7m shares to be formally announced on Tuesday and priced at a fixed 2 per cent discount to the secondary market. The sale would raise around Dollars 37m for the US company at the share price of around Y700 (Dollars 5.2) which prevailed for most of this month. On Monday, however, Mitsubishi Motors' stock fell Y92 to Y612 against the background of a rising stock market. The Nikkei 225 stock market index rose 54.51 on the day. Morgan Stanley, which is favourite to win the mandate if the deal goes ahead, declined to comment on the reason for the sharp fall in Mitsubishi's share price. However, equity syndicate officials at other banks said the fixed discount pricing structure adopted for the deal was an invitation to arbitrageurs. By selling the outstanding stock and taking short positions, arbitrage traders can drive down the outstanding shares in the hope of picking up new stock at a cheaper price. The results of this type of arbitrage trading are particularly pronounced where routine secondary market activity is light. Daily trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where Mitsubishi Motors shares are listed, fell below 200m shares during February, the lowest level since the 1950s relative to the size of the market. Yesterday, Mitsubishi Motors shares recovered slightly and closed at Y635.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / A nation of highly profitable shopkeepers British retailers appear more vulnerable than many European counterparts to the growth of cross-border competition in the industry and may be less well-placed to expand into continental markets, says a study by the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, Guy de Jonquieres writes. The Europe-wide survey of retailers' financial performance finds that though British retailers generate exceptionally high sales and profits from their shelf space - most carry fewer days' stock than continental counterparts - they are much less efficient in their use of assets and labour. The institute suggests that UK retailers' high profits may mask inefficient personnel management. In a comparison of sales per employee in 1992-93 among almost 50 European retailers, Kwik Save, the best-performing British group, ranks tenth and Marks &amp; Spencer twelfth, while 11 of the 15 chains at the bottom of the list are British. 'One possible conclusion is that UK profit margins are good, but the ability of UK retailers to work their assets is well below that displayed by other European companies,' the study says. 'Questions might be posed as to how well equipped UK companies are to meet fierce margin competition.' The three worst performers, Boots, Burton and Sears, have sales per employee roughly one-eighth those of Kesko of Finland, the highest-ranked European retailer. Seven of the 10 European companies generating the highest profits and sales per square metre of store space are British. However, the study says UK retailers may have less growth potential than their continental competitors because of the difficulty in earning profits elsewhere in Europe that compare with those in their home market.

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Sell-off to value telecoms group at over Dollars 11bn: Share price to be announced next month for biggest Dutch privatisation issue on record Shares in the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications company are to be sold to investors early next month at between Fl 46 and Fl 52 each, valuing the company at Fl 21bn to Fl 24bn (Dollars 10.9bn-Dollars 12.5bn). The Dutch government, which yesterday released details of the long-awaited sell-off, said it would float up to 138.15m shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN), representing 30 per cent of its 100 per cent holding in the company. The banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro, will be allowed to sell an additional 20.72m shares if demand is heavy. If the shares are offered at the top end of the range and the banks exercise their option to sell the extra tranche of shares, the flotation could raise more than Fl 8bn for the state, At the lower end of the range, the shares would still be worth more than Fl 6bn, making the flotation the biggest in the history of the Amsterdam stock exchange. The price per share will be announced on June 6 after a book-building period among institutional investors. The subscription period opens the same day and runs until June 9 with trading in KPN shares expected to start on June 13. The price range of Fl 46 and Fl 52 is roughly in line with predictions by analysts, who had forecast a flotation price of between Fl 45 and Fl 55. About half the shares are likely to be sold in the Netherlands, with the rest divided among the UK, US and the rest of the world. Late last month, the banking syndicate announced that private investors would receive a price discount of about 5 per cent on allotments up to 75 shares. They will also be given preferential treatment in the allocation of shares, though details have not yet been released. Government officials said yesterday some 200,000 potential private shareholders had requested detailed information about the flotation. Mr Wilco Jiskoot, ABN Amro's senior executive vice-president for equity and merchant banking, said 'pre-marketing' talks had been held with 1,000 institutional investors around the world in the past three weeks. The company's first roadshow took place yesterday in Amsterdam. Roadshows will be held in more than 20 other financial centres in Europe, North America and East Asia. The shares are to be listed in Amsterdam and on Seaq International in London. KPN is expected to apply for a listing in New York by the time the government sells a second tranche of shares in two or three years. The Dutch state's eventual aim is to reduce its shareholding to about 30 per cent. Background, Page 22 Lex, Page 20</p>

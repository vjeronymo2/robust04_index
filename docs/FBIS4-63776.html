			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 21, 16-22 May </F> 94]    [Text] The Westron US-Ukrainian joint venture [jv], which  was co-founded by Kharkov's Khartron and the US-based Westinhous  Electric Corp., will manufacture automated systems for control  over technological processes, Valeriy Kazakov, Ukraine's deputy  minister for engineering, MIC [military industrial complex] and  conversion, disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM.    Within the broad framework of the Nunn-Lugar program (which  provides for the Ukrainian defense industry's conversion) a  pilot defense conversion project will be financed by the USA to  the tune of 5 million US dollars. Besides, Westinhous will  additionally allocate 20 million US dollars from its own funds.    Westinhous officers are presently in Kharkov to register the  jv and settle some technical problems.    The jv's automated control systems are supposed to be  mounted  at six power generating units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.  The US partner's contribution to manufacture of the first such  system will amount to 90 per cent of total costs, the last one  is supposed to be financed by the Ukrainian party by 90 per cent.    Meanwhile, as many an expert in Ukraine maintains, the US  party has been rather sluggish in implementing the Nunn-Lugar  defense conversion program.    A mixed US-Ukrainian intergovernmental commission is in  charge of the program's implementation. Its Ukrainian component  is headed by Mr. Kazakov. Its first meeting was summoned in  March 1994.    The latest visit to the USA by a Ukrainian delegation led by  vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov resulted, in particular, in an  agreed list of 35 Ukrainian defense enterprises to undergo  conversion.    On 26 May the list will be published in the USA to  facilitate  US partner selection for joint ventures to be set up in Ukraine  to assist in defense industry conversion.</p>

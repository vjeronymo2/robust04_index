			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Delors to seek Pounds 76bn jobs fund: 'Brussels bonds' will finance EU projects Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will present plans at next week's EU summit to spend more than Ecu100bn (Pounds 76bn) over the next five years on job-creating rail, road and telecommunications projects. The plans are expected to include a request to raise 'Brussels bonds' on the international capital markets, with the Commission playing a lead co-ordinating role. The aim is to raise cheap loans using the EU's favourable credit rating. It may provoke opposition from the UK and Germany, which remain wary of such 'off-budget' financing. It may also provoke hostility from the European Investment Bank, which has consistently rejected Brussels' arguments that plans for high-speed trains, roads and bridges are being starved of funds. Mr Delors, though, is said to be determined to press the case for annual investment of Ecu20bn-30bn in trans-European networks. Some of the money has already been earmarked within existing budgets, but officials said a new financial instrument was required to make Europe more competitive, forge common European actions under the Maastricht treaty and tackle mass unemployment. Those themes will feature in Mr Delors' white paper on employment, growth and competitiveness, which will be submitted to a special meeting of the Commission tomorrow before being presented to European leaders at the two-day Brussels summit starting on Friday. EU finance ministers have amended or blocked Mr Delors' proposals for creating soft-loan facilities to help small businesses, stimulate private-sector investment in infrastructure and create 15m new jobs by the year 2000. Now the Commission president plans a direct appeal to European leaders. He will point to Article 129 in the Maastricht treaty, which provides for interest rate subsidies to fund trans-European networks, and urge a joint approach. At this week's Franco-German summit, President Francois Mitterrand said he had agreed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the principle of an EU-wide borrowing plan. Mr Kohl however, said any proposal needed to be carefully studied. He noted that only half of an Ecu7bn fund created by the European Investment Bank had been allocated this year for trans-European networks. It was important not to create a 'new pot' into which money would be poured just for show. Commission officials were confident of defeating UK opposition to heavy capital investment. They noted the campaign of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, against the 1991 Urban Waste Water directive, which he claimed would cost Pounds 10bn. 'If you had this money available, you could mobilise private finance and help to reduce risk,' one official said. EIB experts argue that Brussels is underestimating the power of Green pressure groups to delay big road and rail projects. Packaging directive, Page 2 Call for competitiveness council, Page 24</p>

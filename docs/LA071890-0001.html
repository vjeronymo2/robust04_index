			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THESE UPDATED DELLAS WOULD GIVE PERRY MASON CASE OF THE  SHAKY KNEES  </P> <P> For three summers, the Friends of the La Jolla Library have encouraged  novelists manque to parody, ape or otherwise mimic a famous writer with San  Diego connections.  </P> <P> In the first two contests, the writers were Dashiell Hammett and Raymond  Chandler. Now it's Erle Stanley Gardner, author of 82 Perry Mason novels and a  resident of Temecula before his death in 1970.  </P> <P> A goodly number of contest entrants have tried to clarify the psycho-sexual  dynamic between Mason and secretary Della Street. Gone is the Gardner  reticence.  </P> <P> Several entrants even went revisionist, making Della more assertive and  seductive. Definitely a Della for the 1990s, dominating Mason and making him  love it.  </P> <P> Like this from "The Case of Fresh Strawberries":  </P> <P>  Deli Street, efficient, determined secretary of the successful, offbeat lawyer  Peary Mason, pulled her skirt over her shapely, businesslike knees...  </P> <P>  "Honestly, Peary, I think this strawberry thing is ridiculous. Only a  fruitcake would take a case like this."  </P> <P>  And this from an untitled submission:  </P> <P>  Della Street walked into the lawyer's office with a red rose clenched in her  teeth. ... Paul Drake's mouth hung open as Della donned a veil and the  (marriage) ceremony commenced.  </P> <P>  And from "The Case of the Crocodile Tears":  </P> <P>  Perry Mason's faithful secretary, long, lean and lanky Della Street, moving  with double-jointed ease, ushered a swizzle-stick slender woman into Mason's  leather-bound lawbook-lined private office.  </P> <P>  And from "The Case of the Patient Secretary."  </P> <P>  Della was pretty as a follies girl in a sheer pink dress that sent a glow to  her face. ... "If the ring pleases you, will you wear it, Della, my love?  (begged Mason)."  </P> <P>  The winners (first prize, $200) will be announced tonight after a showing of  the 1935 Perry Mason movie "The Case of the Lucky Leg," starring the mercifully  forgotten Warren William.  </P> <P> The contest entrants may find it a bit dull. Della doesn't have much of a role.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dodging Taxes, Cameras, Bullets  </P> <P> Covering the sunny city.  </P> <P> * Tax my patience.  </P> <P> Tax protester and perennial candidate Barbara Hutchinson has reconsidered: She  will be a write-in candidate against Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego).  </P> <P> She hasn't run for office since doing time in federal prison on a tax beef. But  the S&amp;L scandal and President Bush's "forget-my-lips" announcement have  pushed her too far:  </P> <P> "If I have to ride a white horse and wear a body-stocking and a blond wig to  get attention, I'll do it."  </P> <P> * Great moments in San Diego journalism.  </P> <P> Channel 8, trying to ambush interview a fleeing Bill Kolender in the  underground parking lot of the Union-Tribune building.  </P> <P> A U-T security guard sticking his hand in front of the camera.  </P> <P> * And that's the way it is: really polluted.  </P> <P> Walter Cronkite is in town today to film a video on Mission Bay pollution for  the San Diego Oceans Foundation.  </P> <P> * Dan Fouts has denied the leaked-out reports that he was once wounded by a  jealous husband. That hasn't stopped the media jokers.  </P> <P> Shotgun offense, bullet passes, arm like a rifle, etc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ghost Library  </P> <P> A San Diego City Council committee this afternoon debates whether to ask voters  in November to approve a bond issue to build a new central library and expand  17 branches.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago the tab was put at $109 million. Now it's $140 million.  </P> <P> Plus, the city manager says an additional tax increase will be needed for  operating expenses for the new buildings.  </P> <P> All of this before a site has been picked for a new central library.  </P> <P> Rising costs, an operating tax, site unseen? Is it likely that voters will give  the needed two-thirds approval for a bond issue?  </P> <P> "We've got to try," says bond booster Judy McCarty.  </P> <P> Other library lovers prefer a slimmed-down bond issue, and only after a site is  chosen. The discussion should fill pages.  </P></p>

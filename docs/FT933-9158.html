			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Youth Orchestras young and old - The Proms No doubt of the highlight of this Proms season so far. The appearance of the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra under its founder Claudio Abbado at the Albert Hall on Monday not only brought a richly concentrated account of Bruckner's Fifth Symphony but also the treat of Dmitri Hvorotovsky singing Musorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death in Shostakovich's 1962 orchestration. Hvorotovsky's approach may owe much to Boris Christoff's (and to Shalyapin's) model - a touch of histrionics in the outer songs, smooth sensuous lyricism in the central pair - but his burnished tonal range, effortless phrasing and sustained concentration were all utterly instinctive. The effect may have been generalised rather than specific, for he did not pay too much attention to the weighting of the words, but the sheer sound quality and vocal presence were overwhelming. The Gustav Mahler Orchestra convened for the first time in 1986; designed originally as a platform for young musicians from Eastern Europe, it is now open to East and West. The tonal blend is certainly the familiar international one, and with an age limit of 26 the orchestra has very much the feel of a professional band, yet one fuelled by an enormous sense of commitment and unity of purpose. Abbado's Bruckner has generally received less attention than his Mahler; he may have conducted the composer less consistently, but early in his career he made a memorable recording of the unfashionable Second Symphony. To some tastes his approach may now seem too interventionist; instead of the serene unfolding of the first movement of the Fifth a fairly brisk tempo was set for the introduction and there was an urgent prompting of each episode and transition. Yet Abbado's for detail is constantly engaging, and his ability to slot each figurative element into a comprehensive scheme paid huge dividends in every movement. The final pages, with the Mahler Orchestra's brass uninhibitedly prominent, were an authentic triumph. ***** On Sunday Britain's own National Youth Orchestra had brought one of its typically hefty programmes to the Albert Hall. It began and ended with Musorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, which both Radio 3 continuity and the Radio Times appear to have decided should be called Pictures from an Exhibition: Shura Cherkassky played the original solo-piano version at the start of evening - a mannered account, surprisingly drab by Cherkassky's standards - and the NYO under Matthias Bamert closed the concert with a glittering, extrovert Ravel's orchestration, propelled at a pace that was as hasty as the pianist's had been laboured. Cherkassky also appeared with the orchestra in Gershwin's Piano Concerto, in which he seemed much more relaxed, winningly shaping the work's store of melodies and evidently relishing the extra succulence which the NYO's over-size complement of strings brought to the textures. Bamert led the orchestra through the thickets of Gawain's Journey, the orchestral study fashioned from Birtwistle's opera. It was a remarkably assured account of a spectacular piece, and the young players took the solo roles - euphonium, flugel horn and oboe are allotted the vocal lines incorporated into the orchestral textures - with enormous relish.

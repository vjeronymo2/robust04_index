			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: AGM video welcomed Sir, As a partially deaf person and a shareholder, I have much appreciated the innovation by Hanson plc to make a video of its AGM which is distributed free to any shareholder asking for it. This is exactly what I have been waiting for and I hope other companies follow Hanson's lead. For the first time ever, I was able to follow the events perfectly, which previously I found difficult even when in attendance. I hope this innovative idea is here to stay and I would like to add one thing. All chairmen should try to emulate Lord Hanson's diction and delivery, slow and clear, a real compliment to his audience. Peter J Mugridge, 74 Miles Road, Epsom, Surrey KT19 9AD</p>

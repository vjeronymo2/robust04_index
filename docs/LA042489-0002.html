			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Siberia and Alaska officials were forced by fog and blowing snow to resort to  telephone diplomacy in their efforts to win approval for regular visits between  the countries by Eskimos. Gov. Steve Cowper and the Alaska delegation were  grounded in Nome, so he used a radio-telephone hookup to communicate with his  counterpart from the Magadan region of the Soviet Far East, Vyacheslav I.  Kobets. Kobets was on the ice pack at the international date line between the  Diomede islands. A largely symbolic protocol signed by Cowper calls for a  commission to oversee travel between the countries.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Steamed up over irons After the reunification of Germany, eastern households very quickly switched from their heavy, sometimes unsafe irons to new, lighter western versions with more features. Further south, Italian housewives might find themselves ironing 10 shirts a day. Anything that makes the chore easier, quicker and produces a better result will lighten their load. Sales of irons in Europe are rising in real terms even though volumes are flat or down slightly, a sure sign of a market demand for more sophisticated products. But, as often happens in the appliance industry, the approach to innovation falls somewhere between that of Japan and the US. Japanese iron manufacturers are using electronics to give users information considered of doubtful benefit in Europe - such as soleplate temperature. In the US, by contrast, the market is driven by price - what European producers scathingly call the 'Dollars 9.99 syndrome'. European irons are using electronics more as a means than as an end - to control product functions and improve safety. But national markets still vary. Italy is the most innovative, says Leon Ramselaar, ironing product manager at Philips. In the UK, says Ian Mackey, Tefal UK's marketing manager, consumers do not want too many buttons to press - believing there could be more to go wrong. Tefal, its sister company Rowenta, and Philips dominate the European iron market. When it comes to innovation, it is a 'nip and tuck affair'. Occasionally, a company will come up with a feature that is enough in itself to persuade consumers to buy, such as Tefal's replaceable anti-scale cassette introduced in 1990. Scale build-up can leave stains on clothes and the Tefal cassette system converts the calcium carbonate that causes scale to sodium carbonate as the water passes through it. Philips has now responded with a permanent anti-scale system. Other ideas might contribute to a purchase decision. Philips has just introduced a drip-stop system for steam ironing on its top-of-the-range irons. The idea, says Ramselaar, is to prevent the incomplete evaporation of water which can cause drops to slip through and stain silks. One important development is the 'ironing system'. Borrowed from commercial ironing, this links the iron by tube to a steam-producing unit which acts like a pressure cooker. The result is a lighter iron and more steam. Producers are cagey about future plans, but Tefal and Philips are working on 'quantum leaps' in technology. One possibility is to use ceramic hob technology to produce a new type of soleplate, ending the need for an element.</p>

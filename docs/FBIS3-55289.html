			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Trushkov article: "Edict Not Bound by Constitution"] </F>   [Text] It was dinned into both us and the world that the  Russian Federation Constitution would come into force the moment  it was published, that is, 25 December 1993. It is logical to  assume that Article 90 of this document came into force at the  same time. It says, in particular: "The edicts and directives  of the president of the Russian Federation must not contravene  the Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal laws."  Incidentally, it was made the Constitutional Court's duty to  monitor this.    But what fate befell it? First, the Constitutional Court was  preserved, and second, Section 2 of the new constitution  stipulates: "Courts in the Russian Federation administer  justice in compliance with the powers laid down by the present  Constitution. After the Constitution has come into force, the  justices of all courts in the Russian Federation retain their  powers until the expiry of the term for which they were elected.  Vacancies are filled according to the procedure established by  the present Constitution." The same document stipulates that in  all there are 19 Constitutional Court justices (since 13  justices were elected at the end of 1991, there are six  vacancies left), justices are elected by the Federation Council,  and the president submits nominations to the upper house.  Everything was provided for, no room for false interpretations  was left. But....    On the day the fundamental law officially came into force  the  edict "On Filling Vacancies for Federal Justices" appeared.  Already it lays down quite different norms. In particular, it  orders...the Ministry of Justice and the All-Union Congress of  Justices to submit independent lists of candidates for vacancies  in the Constitutional Court. But that is not all. The  president has stretched the number of vacancies by including in  it the positions now held by V. Zorkin and V. Luchin. Thus,  along with the new constitution, the Law on the Constitutional  Court has been contravened. This federal law says that  justices' powers can be terminated only at their request or when  they reach the age limit of 65.... But what we have here is  quite a different matter.    It seems that the brand-new, spick-and-span constitution,  even if it does contain unambiguous norms, does not protect  awkward customers from arbitrariness on the part of the  authorities. Of course, this is nothing new. The only new  element is that the authorities have shown contempt for the  fundamental law from the very first day it came into force.</p>

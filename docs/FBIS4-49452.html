			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A  responsible official of the Shenzhen Special Economic Region  [SER] Branch of the People's Bank of China [PBC] recently  revealed that the monetary situation in Shenzhen was stern, and  that solutions had to be found so as to overcome difficulties.    The stern monetary situation was reflected primarily in  three  facts: First, it was very difficult to achieve the task of  increasing bank deposits this year in Shenzhen. In the first  two months of 1994, bank deposits of all types decreased  sharply. Although there was a rapid rebound in March, the net  increase in the first quarter was only 2.2 billion yuan, against  the year's target of increasing deposits by 18 billion yuan.  This means that deposits will have to increase by 1.8 billion  yuan every month for the rest of the year, but Shenzhen has  never recorded such a rate of increase.    Second, there was a marked outflow of funds from Shenzhen to  other domestic areas because some large enterprises in Shenzhen  now are expanding their operations into other domestic areas,  and their deposits in Shenzhen are decreasing.    Third, the Shenzhen stock market has remained at a low level  for a long time, and the reform of the foreign exchange  management system and the opening of all localities in the  country has made it hard to attract Renminbi funds into Shenzhen.    The bank official said that the PBC branch is trying  actively  and by every possible means to overcome these difficulties. The  bank has laid down monetary control targets for various  financial institutions. Beginning in May, the whole city will  begin to operate according to the risk control model. This is  an item in the in-depth reform of the banking institutions, and  it is expected that the new mechanism will bring greater vigor  to the banks.    Major breakthroughs will be made in the construction of the  financial market in Shenzhen. The foreign exchange transfer  center will be linked with the nationwide network. Efforts will  be made to create conditions for putting the foreign exchange  brokerage center and the gold trading center into operation at  an earlier date. The construction of these markets will enhance  Shenzhen's finance and fund-raising functions.</p>

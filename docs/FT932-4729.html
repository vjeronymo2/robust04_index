			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: German advertising ban overruled by court - European Court The European Court of Justice has ruled that a price advertising restriction in the German unfair competition law infringes Rome Treaty rules on free movement of goods. The ruling confirms that the treaty may outlaw national marketing rules which are capable of hindering the sale of goods imported from other European Community countries. It makes no difference that the offending rule applies equally to domestic products. The ruling followed a reference from the Bundesgerichtshof in unfair competition proceedings brought against Yves Rocher GmbH. The German unfair competition law prohibits comparative price advertising which is eye-catching in the sense that it draws attention to a new price of a product by juxtaposing it with the old price. Yves Rocher had used this form of advertising to promote the reduced prices of its products made in France and sold largely by mail order through its subsidiary in Germany. Confirming earlier case law, the court said national legislation restricting or banning particular methods of advertising or promoting goods was capable of restricting the volume of imports since it affected the choice of marketing methods available to imported products. The fact that a business was forced to adopt a method of advertising and sales promotion in the member state concerned, and to abandon a method which it considered effective and which it used in other states, was capable of restricting imports. This means the national law will be precluded by European Community law unless it is justified as necessary to satisfy a legitimate public interest such as consumer protection or the prevention of unfair competition. The German government claimed the price advertising ban was introduced to protect the consumer since price comparisons frequently lead to mistakes by consumers. The consumer can easily be misled because he is not in a position to check the new price against the old. Advertising with price comparisons is also likely to suggest a price level which is more advantageous than necessarily justified. The court added that the national law must also be proportionate to the objective pursued. The court said the German law was not limited to price comparisons which were wrong but covered those which were right as well if they were eye-catching. It concluded that price comparisons were prohibited not because they were wrong but because they were eye-catching. It followed that all eye-catching price advertising was prohibited whether true or false. Accordingly, the ban went beyond what was necessary to protect consumers from misleading advertising. The ban went too far because it applied to price comparisons which were not misleading and which were true and therefore useful in helping consumers exercise choice. An examination of other national laws showed the consumer could be informed and protected by means less restrictive of intra-Community trade. The German government also argued that the ban did not infringe Rome Treaty rules because it had an insignificant effect on the free movement of goods. The court said except where the effect on trade was hypothetical, the intensity of the effects on intra-Community trade was irrelevant. C-126/91: Yves Rocher GmbH, ECJ FC, 18 May 1993. French restrictions on contact lens distribution upheld The court has ruled that French legal requirements that optical equipment can only be sold by qualified persons are precluded by the Rome Treaty. However, it said requirements that lenses should only be sold in business premises run by qualified opticians were justified under the treaty's exception for import restrictions resulting from national marketing laws intended to protect public health. In the absence of EC rules on public health, Community countries can make their own rules provided they are in accord with the treaty and are proportionate to the objective of protecting public health.

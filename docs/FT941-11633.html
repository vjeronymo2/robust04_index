			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Paramount Paramount's immaculately timed profits warning should help focus the minds of investors now that the final takeover bids are in. Whatever the longer-term visions of Viacom and QVC, Paramount's short-term prospects fall well short of the mountainous price either seem prepared to pay. Paramount's shortage of hits continues, with Addams Family Values and the Major Dad television show failing to capture the imagination. The market's view was made clear from the strong rally in QVC shares once investors decided its bid was inferior. Since cash will attract the arbitrageurs, it was curious that QVC chose to increase the cash element of its offer from Dollars 92 a share to Dollars 104, rather than matching Viacom's Dollars 107. Perhaps it was stretched, though it seems more likely that it is relying on the paper element of its bid to be decisive. That could be a mistake, as Viacom offers some guarantees for the value of the paper portion of its bid. However, even these 'final' bids may not be final, since the fiduciary duty of Paramount's directors could force them to consider further offers. And with the bids so finely balanced, neither QVC nor Viacom may have a majority of the shares by the deadline. If that happens the five-month saga will drag on. Perhaps then even litigious US investors may look fondly at the two-month sprint of the UK takeover system. UK shareholders, meanwhile, might wish that their informal code put the same pressure on companies to maximise shareholder value that the fear of the courts inspires in US directors.</p>

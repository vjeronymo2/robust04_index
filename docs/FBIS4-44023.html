			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Another Fine Mess"] </F>   [Text] It is an operation that has been denounced by the  Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], that is to say, by the  initial victims of the genocide it claims to be putting a stop  to, as well as by most of the humanitarian organizations  operating on the ground, and even by the churches. It is an  initiative that has been criticized by the OAU and to which many  of France's allies have given a muted reception. The least we  can say is that, even in the event of the Security Council  rubberstamping the operation, French intervention in Rwanda is  turning into a fiasco before it has even begun.    The fact is that Paris was not, initially, the ideal  candidate for such an intervention. As a former colonial power  suspected of having moved its pawns at the expense of its  Belgian competitor, even of defending this French-speaking  outpost, and guilty of years of complicity with the former  Kigali dictatorship, France has further aggravated its position  by its attitude in recent months.    Why, in April, was France happy to selfishly repatriate its  nationals and approve, together with everyone else, the  withdrawal of the 2,000 blue helmets from Rwanda at the very  time one of the worst massacres of this century was beginning in  that country? Why was France so slow in coming round,  coincidentally just as the RPF had won the upper hand on the  ground? Not only does France stand accused of, once again,  coming to the aid of the former power, but its initiative has  had the effect of returning prestige to African regimes that are  just as guilty, such as that of General Mobutu in Zaire.    It is nonetheless true that the "duty of humanitarian  intervention" in which Paris has become expert is a quite  legitimate and necessary notion and that what is termed, rather  pompously, the "international community," has once again  overwhelmingly failed in its mission. Some 18 months ago, the  aforementioned community spectacularly came together, led by the  United States, to act in the face of the famine in Somalia.    Somalia is still home to 18,000 blue helmets, whereas there  are only 550 in Rwanda. Given the estimated 500,000 victims of  the massacre, this amounts to one "peacekeeper" for every 1,000  persons who have died. Since then, hasn't there has been a kind  of a media saturation, tinged with a touch of racism ("let the  Africans kill each other")?    A few days ago, UN diplomats were seriously discussing  whether we should talk of "peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" in  Rwanda, or if the term "genocide" was appropriate. It is  possible that the five "conditions" laid down by Edouard  Balladur will be the start of a return to order. However, the  worse thing would be if the "international community" stopped  there. It, too, is responsible for this mess.</p>

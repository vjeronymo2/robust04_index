			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 KILLED IN GANGLAND ATTACK DURING LYNWOOD RIDE  </P> <P> Even by Los Angeles-area gangland standards, the shooting at California and  Sanborn avenues Sunday morning was a bloody piece of work -- a minute's worth  of gunplay in Lynwood that turned a car ride into a triple murder.  </P> <P> Victor Perez, 19, of Compton and two others died after gunmen pelted their  late-model Oldsmobile with bullets at 1:20 a.m. Sunday, authorities said. A  fourth occupant of the car escaped harm by ducking in the rear seat.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide investigators have not released the name  of the 17-year-old survivor, a Lynwood resident, and were trying to confirm the  identities of the other victims.  </P> <P> When the shooting started, Perez was driving at the tail end of a four-car  caravan en route to a nearby party, investigators said in a report based on  eyewitness accounts. As Perez negotiated a three-point turn, two other vehicles  approached -- a white Toyota pickup and a white, two-door Datsun.  </P> <P> Someone in the pickup yelled, "Where you from?" a common gang challenge,  detectives said. Before anyone responded, another person in the pickup opened  fire with a shotgun. Another man, armed with a handgun, bolted from the Datsun  and riddled the victims' car with bullets.  </P> <P> The assailants raced away as the sleeping neighborhood awoke to the horror  outside their doorsteps.  </P> <P> To Johnny Morris, 17, who arrived at the scene before deputies, it appeared  that the victims never had a chance.  </P> <P> "Both doors were shut," he said. "It looks like they were ducking, trying not  to get hit."  </P> <P> Street noise at the busy intersection is not unusual. That's why Tomas Padilla,  who rents a house nearby, wondered if the early morning cacophony had been a  traffic accident.  </P> <P> Not only did he find the carnage on the street, but also two bullet holes in an  outside wall of his house and seven more in a living room window -- just above  the top of the couch where he, his wife and 16-year-old daughter usually sit to  watch television.  </P></p>

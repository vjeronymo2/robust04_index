			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lvov Railroad Chief Heorhiy Kirpa by </F> Mykhaylo Vasylashko (Lvov-Ternopol-Khmelnitskiy): "The Problems  Are Ours; Is the Purse Moscow's?"; date and place not given]    [Text] Anyone who travels often by rail has probably  noticed improvements in passenger service on the Lvov Railroad's  excellent trains. People started talking about service in Lvov  when seasoned railroader Heorhiy Kirpa became chief of the  railroad half a year ago.    Heorhiy Mykolayovych set about finding solutions to problems  of passenger transport. But they can't be solved on the level of  one railroad. The financial crisis is a killer. Russia alone  owes the Lvov Line 32 billion rubles, 8 million Swiss Francs,  and 2.5 million U.S. dollars for passenger transport. Then there  are the debtors at home. For example, the Prydniprovsk Railroad  owes 290 billion Ukrainian rubles.    [Vasylashko] How did this happen?    [Kirpa] You'll recall what Lenin did first to create the  Soviet State. He took over the post office, the telegraph, and  the train stations. And any new regime in the world has first  taken over these key structures. Our own Ukraine has told the  world that it is independent, yet it has not yet taken over the  republic's railroads. Strange as it seems, we still do not have  a law on railroad transport, no haulage regulations, statutes  and other legal acts.    The Transport Ministry, Ukrzaliznytsya [Ukraine Railroad],  has existed for two years, and we have been waiting for answers  to many questions. Yet the economic situation, especially, is  getting worse. Our biggest trouble is that Ukrzaliznytsya has  failed to formulate its own legal status on centralized  payments, has not detached Ukraine's six railroads from the old  Moscow payment system, and has not set up its own center, which  it should and could have done. Worse, last May Kiev asked Moscow  to continue the payments. I chanced to ask about that in  Russia's Railway Ministry, where I had gone to deal with  problems of debt payment.    So much for our sovereignty. We run some kind of operation,  and our neighbor figures our money on the Big Brother principle.  Maybe he pays something if he feels like it. Of the 32 billion  [rubles], the Lvov people have received two billion, and the oil  products haven't been delivered either. Well, it's not  surprising: Ukrzaliznytsya isn't even able to exercise internal  control of payments, institute centralized fund accumulation,  and so on. In short, there is a Ministry but no full-scale,  planned state operation. It's no surprise, then, that something  bad is happening--something like a bazaar--on the railroads,  where discipline and order used to be so good. Conductors take  as much as they can from passengers, cashiers sell tickets  through fictitious persons.    Not only that, but even locomotive engineers are hauling  passengers now. I found out about it because of an accident in  which a passenger in a locomotive was injured by high voltage.  In fact, it's hard to name a single sphere where people aren't  trying to do biznes. It's the result of our economic  policy. Certainly we're doing our best to prevent such  violations. We are reorganizing the auditing system and  automating ticket sales so there won't be empty seats permitting  train masters to sell tickets on the train. But to restore order  we have to fight the causes, not the results. And that, I think,  is the state's department.    The Lvov railroaders are doing what they can to correct the  situation. For shunting operations they have taken more than 30  "revolution-era" steam engines out of mothballs and saved  considerable fuel and oil.    [Vasylashko] But isn't it true, Heorhiy Mykolayovych, that  the railroaders have gone so far as to engage in proletarian  expropriation of fuel and oil--for example the recent case in  Ternopol?    [Kirpa] Railroad transport is the only sector that isn't yet  paralyzed today. Since the state has given all appropriations to  the oil biznes--i.e. the Mafia--and we no longer get  anything on a centralized basis, there's a real danger that the  railroads will shut down, which means economic collapse. It's  out of concern for the state that we have to take such unpopular  steps. And we're retrieving money with those commercial prices.  Starting last October I overpaid the businessmen by 25 percent;  today it's 150 percent. I talked about that huge snag when I met  with Zvyahilskyy. Energy ought to be in the state's hands. Right  now the Mafia is cheating the state. Often, an oil tank car that  has just crossed the border will return to Ukraine, this time to  be re-directed somewhere to the south. What would you do in that  case? Stop the passenger trains? It's impossible, because  passenger traffic has almost doubled. Last year alone we  dispatched an additional 178 trains, and even that's not enough.  The railcar fleet is inadequate. We haven't had a car replaced  in two years.    Let's say we expect no favors from Kiev. We have already  made  a deal with the Northern Railroad to repair cars in Kovel, and  they will buy new ones with the money they make. That's how much  trouble railroaders all over Western Ukraine are in. Although  frankly, they're in somewhat better shape than other regions.  Anyway, without a state program they can't get out of the  crisis. And the Ministry and its leaders today have shown  themselves to be incompetent. After all, what kind of proprietor  is it that works and his neighbor counts his money? In such  circumstances, it is time for either the President or the  Supreme Council to undertake to nationalize the railroads.  Otherwise, we'll lose everything with the railroads and be  buried under the wreckage of sovereign Ukraine.</p>

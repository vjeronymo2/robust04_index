			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Privatising British Rail A POLL TAX on wheels? A privatisation too far? If anything is clear about the government's plans for breaking up British Rail, it is that they threaten to turn into one of the most controversial privatisations yet. With the few faint voices of support drowned by objections from every quarter, it is tempting to conclude that the government has got it badly wrong. Until last week's publication of the railways bill, the arguments about privatisation had turned largely on the issue of whether fragmentation of the railway was feasible. Many of the rail lobby's attacks on the proposals were lost on a public that cared little about the technicalities of divorcing track ownership from the running of the trains or franchising out the passenger services. Now, however, with the government signalling its determination to press ahead, passengers are rightly beginning to raise more down-to-earth concerns. Will fares go up? Will lines close? Will services be cut? Will investment slump? Above all, will the railways get better or worse? These concerns are justified. Railway privatisation is a voyage into the unknown: no other country has yet accomplished it (although Germany, for one, is pursuing a similar course to Britain's). Successive Conservative governments have dithered over it, fearing the political consequences of meddling with an organisation which, while maddeningly inefficient, ranks not much lower in public concern than the National Health Service. Need for action And yet, as the government has finally acknowledged in bringing forward its proposals, something had to be done. If the railways were working well, there would be an argument for leaving them alone. As it is, even with some of the highest fares in Europe, they are under-invested; passengers are still too often made to feel as though they are an encumbrance to the running of the railway, rather than the reason for it; and the trains do not run on time. Privatisation has already raised investment levels and transformed management in many other industries. It could do the same for the railways. But the question that lies at the heart of the public's worries is whether the government has chosen the right way of achieving it - not least since the proposals look so complex that almost no one outside the Department of Transport even pretends to understand them. Blindingly simple In truth, the plans are blindingly simple. Rather than attempt a wholesale privatisation, the government has reined back its ambitions in favour of something more pragmatic. On the passenger side, it plans to retain the tracks and, over a period of 10 years or more, contract out the operation of existing train services to private sector franchisees by competitive tender. If there is spare capacity left on the tracks, other companies will in some cases be allowed to run the odd train here and there in competition with services operated by the main franchisees. In principle, there seems little to fear from such a cautious approach. Ministers say loss-making passenger services (which is to say, nearly all those operated by BR) will continue to attract subsidies, so there is no reason why any should close. When the franchising authority contracts them out, it will be on the basis of today's service levels and fares, so there should be no big changes on either score; and beyond that, minimum services and maximum fares will be laid down for the duration of the franchise. Yet many issues remain to be resolved before the government can hope to win confidence in its proposals. Ministerial assurances about the franchising regime are not enough: still to come is the small print that reveals exactly how they will work. Similarly, the yet-to-be published plans for the track charging regime will be crucial to the prospects of attracting new services to the railways. Nor is it known how the government is to avoid a damaging hiatus in investment during the transition from the old regime to the new. Even if the government can satisfy its critics on these issues, it could still be blown off course by its own backbenchers in the present risk-averse climate. That would be more than a pity: for if the government gets it right, its plan presents the best prospect of providing Britain with the attractive and well-run railway it needs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its analysis of cost, economic, and environmental impacts, the EPA assumed that the 1991 NSPS and the standards being proposed today will not cause communities to alter their plans to construct new (or to use already constructed) MWC plants. Specifically, the EPA is assuming that its projections of how much MSW will be combusted in the year 2000, and the types and sizes of new combustors that will be used, will not be effected by the standards being proposed today. However, some communities, if faced with large compliance costs, may choose to delay or cancel construction, or to downsize MWC's, or to change combustion technology. These communities probably would expand landfilling, recycling, or source-reduction activities. If the standards do cause some communities to shift away from combustion, the result will be a general reduction of the cost impacts reported here. However, any such shifts caused by the standards, and the net economic and environmental effects of those shifts, are extremely difficult to project. This is in part due to the fact that environmental regulations for landfills, as well as landfill site location problems, will be exerting an opposite influence on communities_causing them to look with more favor on combustion alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has been able to quantify some of the benefits of the standards. The absence of sufficient exposure-response and valuation information precludes a comprehensive benefits analysis for many of the MWC pollutants. The EPA expects partial benefits for reduction of PM and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _primarily benefits from reductions in morbidity and mortality_to total about $160 million annually. However, recent evidence suggests the mortality reduction benefits of particulate matter controls may be higher than is assumed in this analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, based on the combined economic impacts analysis of both the 1991 and proposed NSPS, the EPA expects that no community will be significantly impacted by the proposed and 1991 NSPS. Since the incremental impact of the proposal over the 1991 NSPS is only one-seventh the total combined impact (based on incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted), the proposal is expected to have a very small impact on communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rationale for Proposed Standards for MWC Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section addresses the legal, technical, and economic basis for the proposed NSPS. The basis for regulating MWC's, for regulating the specified pollutants, and for regulating MWC's according to the specified size categories are discussed. The section also presents the EPA's approach in establishing the MACT floor and selecting MACT. Additionally, the section discusses the selected format for the proposed standards, the proposed performance testing and monitoring requirements, and the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

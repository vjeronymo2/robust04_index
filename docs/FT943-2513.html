			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Personal View: Plugged into the world's knowledge - US Vice-president Al Gore explains how a global information system will aid development The linking of the world's people to a vast exchange of information and ideas is a dream that technology is set to deliver. President Bill Clinton and I believe that the creation of a network of networks, transmiting messages and images at the speed of light across every continent, is essential to sustainable development for all the human family. It will bring economic progress, strong democracies, better environmental management, improved healthcare and a greater sense of shared stewardship of our small planet. To this end, legislators, regulators and business people must now build and run a Global Information Infrastructure (GII). We call upon all governments, in their own sovereign nations and in international co-operation, to build this infrastructure. The US will do its part. But the development of the GII must be a co-operative effort. It cannot be dictated or built by a single country, and it must be democratic. The GII will promote democracy by enhancing the participation of citizens in decision-making. And it will promote the ability of nations to co-operate with each other. It will also be the key to economic growth. The information infrastructure is to the US economy of the 1990s what transport infrastructure was to the economy of the mid-20th century. Approximately 60 per cent of all US workers are 'knowledge workers'. Computing and information networks have made US companies more productive, more competitive and better able to adapt to changing conditions. They will do the same for other nations. Digital telecommunications technology, fibre optics and new high-capacity satellite systems are transforming telecommunications. A fibre optic cable can carry thousands of telephone calls per second over a single strand of glass. In the past, it could take years to build a network. Today, a single satellite and a few dozen ground stations can be installed in a few months - at much lower cost. The economics of networks have changed so radically that a competitive, private market can build much of the GII. This is dependent, however, upon sensible regulation. In the US, we aim to build and maintain through the private sector a National In-formation Infrastructure of information highways. Our plan is based on the principles of: encouraging private investment; promoting competition; creating a flexible regulatory framework that can keep pace with rapid technological and market changes; providing open access to the network for all information providers; and ensuring universal service. Many of these are accepted international principles, which I believe can inform and aid the development of the GII. Today, many more technological options make it not only possible, but desirable, to have different companies running competing - but interconnected - networks, to make the telecommunications sector more efficient, more innovative and more profitable. To promote competition and investment in global telecommunications, we need to adopt cost-based collection and accounting rates. International standards are also needed to ensure interconnection and interoperability throughout the world. National networks must connect effectively with each other to make real the simple vision of linking schools, hospitals, businesses and homes. In order for the private sector to invest and for competition to be successful, it is necessary to create a regulatory environment that fosters and protects competition and private-sector investments, while at the same time protecting consumers' interests. In the US, we have delegated significant regulatory powers to an independent agency, the Federal Communications Commission. This is an expert body, well-equipped to make difficult technical decisions and monitor changing market conditions. We also need a flexible, effective system for resolution of international issues. Open access is another important principle. Telephone and video network owners should charge non-discriminatory prices for access to their networks. Countries and companies will not be able to compete in the global economy if they cannot get access to up-to-date information or communicate instantly with customers around the globe. Ready access to information is essential for training the workforce needed for high-tech industries. Countries that flourish in the 21st century will be those that have telecommunications policies and copyright laws that give their citizens access to a wide choice of information services. Protecting intellectual property is absolutely essential. The final and most important principle is to ensure universal service so that the GII is available to all. Hundreds of satellites in low earth orbit may soon provide telephone or data services to any point on the globe. Such systems could make universal service practical and affordable. Another dimension of universal service is the recognition that marketplace economics should not be the sole determinant of the reach of the information infrastructure. President Clinton and I have called for positive government action in the US to extend the GII to every classroom, library, hospital and clinic in the US by the end of the century. Schools and libraries in every country could be connected to the Internet, the world's largest computer network, in order to create a Global Digital Library. This would allow millions of students, scholars and business people to find the information they need, whether it be in Albania or Ecuador. The power of the GII will be diminished if it cannot reach large segments of the world population. There are those who say the lack of economic development causes poor telecommunications. I believe they have it backwards. A primitive telecommunications systems causes poor economic development. So we cannot be complacent about the disparity between the high and low income nations: in how many phones are available or in access to new technologies, such as high-speed computer networks or video conferencing. The US is committed to working with other countries on this matter. To overcome the barriers to GII development, industrialised countries can: use the GII for technical collaboration between industrialised nations and developing countries, and to help development agencies link experts from every nation to solve common problems; help nations finance the building of telecommunications infrastructure, through multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank; create programmes to train telecommunications professionals. USAID (the US Agency for International Development) and US businesses have helped the US Telecommunications Training Institute train more than 3,500 telecommunications professionals from the developing world. The GII could also be used to create a global network of environmental information, to help protect the environment. It can provide us with the information needed to improve dramatically the quality of life around the globe. By linking clinics and hospitals together, it will ensure that doctors have access to the best possible information on treatments. By providing early warning on natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, it can save thousands of lives. And by linking villages and towns, it can help people work together to solve local and regional problems, ranging from improving water supplies to preventing deforestation. To promote, to protect and to preserve freedom and democracy, we must make telecommunications development an integral part of every nation's development.</p>

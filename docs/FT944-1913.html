			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper falters at 5-year high The London Metal Exchange copper market yesterday tried the air above the Dollars 3,000-a-tonne mark and found it a little too thin. A strong recovery following a severe shake-out early in the week carried the three months delivery price to a 5 1/4 -year high of Dollars 3,005 in the morning; but by the close it had been pared back to Dollars 2,985.50 up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 48 on the week. That price was Dollars 107.50 above the low reached on Tuesday. An important factor in the market's renewed strength was concern about nearby supply tightness, which also resulted in a widening in the 'backwardation'  - the premium for immediate delivery  - against the three months price to Dollars 80 at one point from Dollars 50 at Tuesday's close. Traders said there was nervousness in the market ahead of next week's 'third Wednesday' option declarations. In spite of yesterday afternoon's retracement most dealers remained confident that a decisive break above Dollars 3,000 would come soon. 'Copper's fundamentals are strong and a 3.6 per cent growth in 1995 western consumption is forecast to cut stocks to five weeks supply by the end of the year,' said the Economist Intelligence Unit in its monthly World Commodity Forecasts, published yesterday. It said that pointed to a 26 per cent rise in the year's average price compared with the 1994 average. The EIU report was also bullish about the outlook for the other five base metals traded at the LME. It forecast that falls in western world production of aluminium and in imports from the former eastern bloc, plus a further 'healthy' rise in consumption, would lead to a 19 per cent increase in the price average for that metal. This week aluminium, like the other metals, shadowed movements in the copper market. It bottomed on Tuesday at Dollars 1,815 a tonne, for three months delivery, but yesterday touched Dollars 1,940, before closing at Dollars 1,923.50 a tonne, up Dollars 46 on the week. Nickel prices were again highly volatile. After losing Dollars 835 in the early sell-off the three months contract closed yesterday at Dollars 8,687.50 a tonne, down Dollars 177.50 on the week. The EIU report forecast that nickel's average value in 1995 would be 22 per cent ahead of this year's as Russian exports dropped for the fourth year in succession and western consumption grew. The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market yesterday repaired some of the damage sustained in mid-week, when heavy selling wiped about Dollars 350-a-tonne off nearby futures prices. The March position rose by Dollars 127 on the day to close at Dollars 2,635 a tonne, still Dollars 168 down on the week. The selling on Tuesday and Wednesday had been largely technically driven. It was also influenced, however, by a report from German statistics agency FO Licht putting world production in 1994-95 at 92.3m bags (60kg each), up from 91.1m in 1993-94, and consumption at 93.4m, down from 95.9m. Market sentiments had already been weakened by a US Department of Agriculture report last week that showed world coffee stocks were higher than the market thought. Technical factors were partly responsible for a Pounds 40-a-tonne jump in LCE cocoa values on Thursday. 'Short-covering has been the main dynamism but there was also a strong technical motivation,' one trader told the Reuters news agency.  ----------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium         -28,850  to  1,751,600 Aluminium alloy      +400  to  29,800 Copper             -3,525  to  299,875 Lead               -3,250  to  351,300 Nickel               -222  to  149,166 Zinc               -4,200  to  1,190,250 Tin                   +70  to  28,760  -----------------------------------------------</p>

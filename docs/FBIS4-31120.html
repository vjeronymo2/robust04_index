			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 2 Jun (TANJUG) -- Stojan Andov, president of  the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] assembly, arrived in Tirana today on a two-day official  and friendly visit to Albania, Radio Skopje reported from the  Albanian capital. This morning Andov held talks for one hour  with Pjeter Arbnori, president of the Albanian assembly. They  exchanged views on the cooperation between the two assemblies  and states and on the situation in the Balkans.    Arbnori said that Macedonia and Albania "cooperate well in  many domains," and that "they are very good neighbors." The  cooperation would be even better if the Albanians in Macedonia  were granted "all rights," Arbnori said.    Andov said that there were "many problems" between the two  states, but, he stressed, "a way of solving them has been  found." According to him, the problems connected with the rights  of the Albanians in Macedonia are dealt with in the institutions  of the system in line with the highest European standards on  minority rights, or even better. He expressed the hope that the  Macedonians in Albania would be granted the same rights and  freedoms.    The president of the assembly of the Former Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia today also had a meeting with Albanian President  Sali Berisha. Berisha said that he expected this visit to  contribute to the further development of cooperation between the  two countries and that he was happy that what he had agreed on  with President Gligorov during their meeting last month in  Pogradec was being realized. The Albanian president welcomed  the adoption of the law on the population census in Macedonia  and noted the need to develop traffic links between the two  countries, including the links with the port of Durres, which  should serve the Macedonian economy as well.    During the talks, Berisha also mentioned the position of the  Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija and spoke against forcible  changes to the border. Berisha thanked Gligorov for his  invitation to visit Macedonia and announced his visit to Skopje  in the near future.    During his talks with Berisha, Andov said that "essential  steps forward have been taken" in the cooperation between  Macedonia and Albania and that "there are no obstacles to the  development and strengthening of cooperation." According to  Andov, Macedonia and Albania are "linked in terms of their fate  and oriented toward one other."</p>

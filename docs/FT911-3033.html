			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Friendliness of a French guide VISITORS to France this summer will get a helping hand in finding their way around the country's cities, thanks to multilingual terminals which are being sited in railway stations. Developed by Mors, of Paris, in conjunction with the French national railway company SNCF, the kiosks - known as Kim  - give information such as local bus services and directions to banks and restaurants as well as train timetable and connecting service information. To use the service the passenger asks questions by pressing panels on the touch-sensitive computer screen, and the answers are communicated verbally. The machine responds in French, English, German and Spanish. Contacts: Mors: France, 1 49 39 42 00.</p>

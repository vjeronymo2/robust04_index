			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Yorkshire bus company buy-out SOUTH YORKSHIRE Passenger Transport Authority yesterday announced the sale of Mainline Group, its bus company, to an employee buy-out but complained it had been done under pressure from the government. Mr Jack Meredith, chairman, said: 'The authority has fought long and hard for seven years to keep Mainline a publicly owned company but ever-increasing government pressure has forced our hand.' The buy-out team is understood to be paying Pounds 1m for the company spread over five years. Mainline has a fleet of 880 vehicles and 2,640 employees and is the main bus operator in Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster.</p>

Vavra: "The Czech </F> Republic's Exports to the Visegrad Four Countries Last Year  Amounted To Almost 93 Billion Korunas"]    [Text] According to the Czech Statistical Office, the  Czech Republic returned a surplus foreign trade balance last  year with all of the other Visegrad Four countries.    Foreign trade turnover with Hungary increased by 15.9  percent, compared with 1992, while imports from Hungary  increased by more than 50 percent, compared with 1992. On the  other hand, exports to and imports from Poland declined, and  overall foreign trade turnover fell by 10 percent.    Exports to the Visegrad Four countries in 1993 amounted to  93.982 billion korunas [Kc], which is almost one-quarter of  their overall volume. Our imports from the Visegrad Four states  amounted to Kc79.270 billion (21.6 percent of Czech imports).  Naturally, Slovakia accounted for most of our turnover.  Exports amounted to Kc74.628 billion and imports to Kc65.017  billion. Goods worth Kc10.470 billion were exported to Poland,  while exports to Hungary amounted to Kc7.884 billion. On the  other hand, imports from Poland reached Kc9.273 billion and from  Hungary Kc5.003 billion.    The Visegrad Four countries will in the future be members of  the Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA), which  should commence operations on 1 January 1998. It will encompass  approximately 7,500 different commodities. These are divided  into three groups in accordance with the different periods of  time involved in breaking down the customs barriers. The first  group, where there is already no duty, concerns more than 2,200  products. From the point of view of the percentage of mutual  trade, these are less significant products, and removing customs  barriers should not influence their ability to compete. The  second group contains some 3,700 products. According to the  approved agreement, the current duty on these products will be  maintained this year; it will be reduced by 66 percent in 1995  and by the remaining 33 percent in 1996. The customs barriers  for the last, most sensitive, group will probably be removed in  the year 2001. Agricultural products are, in essence, exempt  from the CEFTA agreement. Only partial liberalization is  envisaged here in the future.</p>

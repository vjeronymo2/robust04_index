			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Austria fights Czechs' nuclear push - Prague is determined to sell electricity to the west CZECHOSLOVAKIA, despite intense opposition to its nuclear power stations by neighbouring Austria, aims to become an important supplier of nuclear-generated electricity to the west. Prague is determined to press on with an ambitious nuclear power programme while plans to expand atomic energy are being scrapped throughout eastern Europe. In so doing, it is relying on the widespread acceptance of nuclear energy among Czechoslovaks who face some of the worst air pollution in Europe. Mr Jan Jicha, deputy economics minister for fuel and energy, was recently put in charge of exporting electricity to the west. He noted that an agreement to sell nuclear-generated power to a German utility could serve as a model for the urgently needed modernisation of Czechoslovakia's existing nuclear power stations. A contract for the sale of 1,400MW of electricity from the Mochovce nuclear station, being built in western Slovakia, was signed with Bayernwerk in Munich. The electricity is to be delivered over four years, beginning in 1994. The revenue earned by selling electricity from Mochovce will be used to repay the costs of installing instrumentation and control systems supplied by Siemens which will bring the station up to western safety standards. This is a pattern to be repeated in the planned expansion of Czechoslovak nuclear power. But Austria is equally determined to see that Prague's nuclear energy plans are scrapped. Anti-nuclear groups in Austria and Germany charge Czechoslovakia with being the 'new utopia' of the German nuclear power lobby and say it is on its way to becoming Eastern Europe's leading nuclear energy producer. In eastern Germany, two Soviet-designed nuclear stations have been shut down, and resistance is strong to plans by German electricity companies to build new nuclear stations in the region. Austrian opposition to nuclear stations is so strong that Vienna offered Czechoslovakia DM500m (Pounds 170m) in free electricity if it shut down the two oldest and most troublesome Soviet-designed 440MW reactors at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear station in Slovakia. They are the same type of reactor as in east Germany's Greifswald atomic power station which was closed down last year after public protests. Austria would like to see two later-model reactors shut down as four reactors at the Dukovany nuclear power station in Moravia. But Mr Jicha said it was doubtful whether Austria could compensate for the loss of the nuclear power which makes up 27 per cent of total electricity generated in Czechoslovakia. He wanted to see this boosted to 40 per cent which compared with Sweden (50 per cent), Germany (38 per cent) and France (75 per cent). Ironically, the Czechoslovak government under Prime Minister Marian Calfa was originally opposed to nuclear energy. But it quickly changed its mind when the alternatives became clear. The northern Bohemia region of Czechoslovakia suffers from some of the worst pollution in Europe, because of its lignite-fuelled power stations. The cost of installing modern anti-pollution equipment would be far greater than phasing out the worst offenders and expanding nuclear power capacity, the government argued. The devastation wrought by the lignite-fired power stations in northern Bohemia explains why most Czechoslovaks, even those with reservations about nuclear energy, prefer it to generating electricity from soft coal. The two reactors under construction at Temelin in southern Bohemia are also to be brought up to international safety standards with the help of western companies. In addition, two reactors are to be installed at Mochovce and two 1,000MW reactors built at Temelin or at a site in Slovakia. Siemens or Westinghouse are expected to win the contracts, Czechoslovak officials said, and would form a partnership with Skoda Plzen, the only manufacturer outside the Soviet Union which produced reactors under a Soviet licence. Siemens is also negotiating with Skoda and the city of Plzen to build a 200MW high-temperature reactor for the supply of district heat to Plzen. The sale of nuclear-generated electricity to western Europe is regarded by Mr Jicha as indispensable if the nuclear programme is to be realised. In addition to Bayernwerk, PreussenElektra in east Germany would be a likely customer, as well as Italian and French utilities. Electricite de France (EdF), itself a major exporter of nuclear-generated power, had expressed interest in buying a stake in the Czechoslovak electricity company, but Mr Jicha said he believed it would be more advantageous for Prague to sell electricity on its own.</p>

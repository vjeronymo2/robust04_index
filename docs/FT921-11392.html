			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Guillotine was 'panic' measure - Education Bill ACTION taken by the government to curtail debate on the Education (Schools) Bill strengthened the belief that the general election would take place on April 9, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, suggested in the Commons last night. He said the 'panic' decision to invoke the parliamentary guillotine to ensure that the bill completed its passage through the Commons by 10 o'clock last night reflected ministerial anxiety over the as yet unannounced election timetable. Denying that Labour had mounted a filibuster to prevent discussion on the bill being completed by Wednesday night, as the government had planned, he emphasised that the longest speech, lasting just under 40 minutes, had been made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, criticised the bill as a 'crackpot' measure, and promised that it would be repealed by a Labour government. The use of the guillotine was approved by a government majority of 88 (271-183). The bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 134 (266-132), and now goes to the House of Lords.</p>

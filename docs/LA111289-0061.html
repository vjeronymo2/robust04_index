			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The latest issue of Traveling in Style magazine, compiled biannually by Travel  Editor Jerry Hulse, appeared in the Oct. 22 edition of The Times and brought  the usual assortment of "reviews" from readers. Herewith a sampling of their  comments:  </P> <P> Rita Ariyoshi's tantalizing article on posh Hawaiian vacations ("If Cost  Doesn't Count") had me drooling all the way to the 7-11 for a couple of Quick  Picks. Fifteen hundred dollars a night for a prime suite at the Westin Kauai is  one way to go, but I'll have to agree with Ariyoshi that the best vacation on  Kauai is in a rented beach house on pristine Hanalei Bay, where nature's beauty  is endless -- and priceless.  </P> <P> ANN JENSEN  </P> <P> El Segundo  </P></p>

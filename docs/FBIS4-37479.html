			<p>BFN     [Text] Mashhad, June 20, IRNA -- A bomb went off this  afternoon here in one of the crowded prayer halls in the  mausoleum of the Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him], killing and  injuring tens of people who had gathered there to commemorate  'Ashura.    Over 60 injured people have been transferred to the  hospitals  here. Most of the people who have been injured had come from  different cities all over the country to commemorate the  anniversary of the martyrdom of the Imam Husayn today which is  known as 'Ashura.    As a rule every year on this day, mourners flock to Imam  Reza's mausoleum to observe the mourning ceremonies for Imam  Husayn.    Imam Reza is the eighth imam and Imam Husayn is the third  imam of the infallible household of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)  [expansion unknown]. Both imams were martyred by the tyrannical  rulers of their times.</p>

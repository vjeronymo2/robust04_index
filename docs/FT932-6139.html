			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Beyond our Ken If any soothsayer told Mr Lamont to beware of ex-Cambridge chums wearing suede shoes, the warning came too late. But whatever cheer the sociable Mr Kenneth Clarke's elevation to the Treasury may raise with the beer-and-fags fraternity, it is unlikely to warm hearts much within the City. The whole incident is a mark of the weakness of the Major administration. That is ironic, given that it is barely a year since Britain was hailed in newspapers and City circulars as the sole haven of political stability in Europe. Given that the change was motivated by psychological perceptions rather than policy differences, it would be unwise to expect rapid changes. The new chancellor might in principle favour slightly lower base rates, but he is unlikely to startle the markets with any early moves. He may wait to see how the recovery develops over the summer, before moving in time for the party conference if the need arises. On spending, the additional political weight Mr Clarke carries may actually enable him to carry through larger cuts in the autumn than the wounded Mr Lamont could have managed. September will be crucial, with clearer indications on spending, interest rates and first-half corporate results all coming together. Meanwhile, both gilt and equity markets have been left on hold. Lost in yesterday's hoo-ha was the CBI survey which showed output expected to rise strongly in all sectors, particularly exports. The balance of payments crunch may be a little further off than the market thinks.</p>

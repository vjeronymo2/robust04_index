			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Management: Making it a game of skill, not of luck - The training ball is in the government's court. Tony Blair calls for a national policy / Training on Trial If there is to be a skills revolution in Britain, we need a national training policy, not a series of initiatives that come and go with each political whim. The possibility is there. Both sides of industry are united on what is required. It is now up to the government to define that consensus and give effect to it. The worst thing a Labour government could do would be to scrap everything that has been achieved and start again. Labour will retain Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), but will make them more broadly representative of their local communities. They should include senior personnel from local government and trade unions. This is not tokenism. Unless local industry works with local employees, local education providers and other public sector bodies, Tecs cannot succeed. My main difference with the government is that I believe Tecs need to operate within a clear national framework. This is not inconsistent with the maximum flexibility in the delivery of training services. The national policy framework would include the setting up of a national training body - Skills UK - to help deliver the policy effectively. It will involve government, employers, unions and others with an interest in training. Its work would include setting national targets for the upgrading of skills, which would be binding on government as well as industry. Labour would give a much higher priority to the development of the system of national vocational qualifications (NVQs). The Council for NVQs is doing its best, yet my impression is that NVQs are still not nearly visible enough, many employers are confused about their scope and impact, and there are genuine problems in their assessment and validity. There should be provision made for the training of those with special training needs who have suffered in the cuts from government support in the last two years. Labour would conduct an urgent review of how to balance concern that the large sums of public money spent by Tecs are properly accounted for; and investigate the frustration felt by many Tecs at what they see as over-regulation from central government. Simplifying procedures can make them more efficient. We will consider sympathetically the call by Tecs for three-year funding. These and matters such as the exchange and dissemination of ideas and good practice among Tecs and the strengthening of sectoral bodies in industry, are the role of national training policy. We also do not believe a voluntary approach to training will work. We favour legislation in two specific areas. Around 100,000 young people, possibly many more, leave school every year and go into work without any structured training. Five or six years later, they are in their 20s, unskilled and without a serious career to contemplate. Tens of thousands more receive training only of the most basic kind. This is a waste of talent that neither the individuals nor the country can afford. Labour has proposed legislation to prevent employers employing school-leavers without a proper training contract. Secondly, we believe all employers should make some minimum investment in training their staff or make a payment to the local or national training effort. No one wants to return to the old Industry Training Board grant-levy system, though such a system was perhaps better than nothing. The problem has always been to ensure that employers train, without bureaucracy outweighing the benefits. Labour's proposal is to establish a common standard definition of training expenditure. Companies would disclose training expenditure in their accounts. Those spending above a minimum level would pay nothing. Those spending below it would pay the shortfall to their local Tec or national body. A similar system has operated in France for more than 20 years with considerable success. Some years ago, we set the minimum contribution at 0.5 per cent of payroll. This is probably too low, and should there be strong support in industry for a higher target, we would respond favourably. In no sense is the minimum contribution a penalty. It simply sets a minimum responsibility and gives the company an option as how to fulfil it. Although very small companies would be exempt, there may be others which would prefer to make a payment to the Tec, which would be used to provide training services for that company and others within the Tec area. There would also be help for training those in work in our new fund, 'Skills for the 90s', set out at the time of the last budget. This was aimed at two areas: skill shortages and giving employed people the chance to acquire basic skills. The fund would operate flexibly with Tecs and others bidding for different programmes that would have different types of funding attached to them. The author is Labour's employment spokesman.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with EZLN Subcommander Marcos by Jesusa </F> Cervantes; from the "jungles of Chiapas"; date not given]    [Text] If Manuel Camacho Solis is removed from the Chiapas  peace negotiations, the National Zapatist Liberation Army [EZLN]  will break off its dialogue with the government, according to  the EZLN's Subcommander Marcos.    Asked about the latest turn of events in the nation,  including the slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio and the nomination  of presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon,  Subcommander Marcos said the government is either preparing for  the Institutional Revolutionary Party's [PRI] honorable defeat  or for a great electoral fraud.    As for the peace commissioner, Marcos said his removal would  bog down efforts to find a peaceful, political solution to the  armed conflict that began on 1 January. The subcommander said:  "The removal of Camacho from the peace talks would force a break  in the dialogue. If they bring in someone else, we would have  to approve him, just as we approved Camacho, subjecting him to  the same process. The worst part of all this, however, would be  that the whole process would drag on and on."    Marcos, who is in charge of the EZLN's military strategy,  said that at the start of the peace talks, the EZLN thought the  government would force it into a confrontation with belligerent  groups of businessmen and ranchers in Chiapas, while ordering  the Mexican Army to sit on the sidelines and watch.    "At that time, we thought there was a move afoot against  Camacho. We thought attempts were being made to force an impasse  in the dialogue and to force a break in the cease-fire in order  that the political cost would fall on Camacho at a time when  there was talk that he might decide to become a presidential  candidate," Marcos pointed out. "Then came the incident with  Colosio, and we thought there were plans to blame us for the  assassination, for ordering his assassination, or for creating  an atmosphere of violence leading to his assassination. We  thought military actions against us would start at that time,"  he added.    Subcommander Marcos argued that Colosio Murrieta's  assassination was ordered from within the government, which now  appears as the only entity capable of guaranteeing order and of  preventing this type of violence from continuing.    "The government knew of the attack; perhaps it knew about it  but allowed it to happen because Colosio's commitment to  security was too uncertain at a time when the country was not  calm," he said.    "On one hand, I think the state and Salinas greatly  benefited  from Colosio's death, but on the other, they were hurt by the  ensuing political instability and the loss of international  prestige, because they proved they were unable to protect their  own candidate. It certainly left Camacho Solis out of the  picture," Marcos said. He added that with the assassination of  the PRI candidate, the PRI not only took Camacho out of the  political picture, but it also recovered the newspaper headlines  -- an ideological priority. Finally, he said, the PRI came to  be viewed as a victim instead of an aggressor.    With Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's nomination,  Subcommander  Marcos said he believes it is doubtful that Zedillo will be able  to conduct a strong political campaign and win the election.  "When Colosio was killed, we thought it would weaken Camacho's  position and the government's alleged negotiating position, but  when Zedillo entered the race, it did not make sense because  with this candidate the PRI will not be able to fend off the  other contenders," he said.    "If the PRI continues with Zedillo, of whom nothing is known  other than the textbook scandal and the fraud committed in  Chiapas by his relatives, then only two things are possible:  Either the government is preparing for the PRI's honorable  defeat or it is preparing a very, very large fraud -- an  unprecedented fraud," he said.    What does not make sense, the subcommander said, is to plan  an electoral fraud, because then the entire nation would rise  up, the problem could no longer be blamed on the EZLN or Aburto,  and the war would definitely continue. If the PRI is trying to  open the door for democracy in the political arena, it should  have nominated a transitional candidate, and, in this case, the  logical candidate would have been Camacho Solis.    Marcos said: "If the PRI would ultimately decide to share  power or agree to a democratic opening in the electoral game,  the logical thing would be for it to nominate a transitional  candidate, in this case a solidarity candidate. The logical one  would be Camacho, despite everything the PRI might want to  impose on Camacho following Colosio's death."    He explained, "Camacho would be the logical candidate  because  he has insisted that he would maintain Salinas' economic  project." The subcommander said, however, that a political  change would lead to a change in economic policy, which would  contradict the neoliberals.    He added: "No one can be a political democrat and an  economic  tyrant. Reforms within the same general guidelines would have  to be made. Reforms in social spending and income distribution  would have to be made, but this would run against neoliberal  thinking," he said.    The subcommander said he doubts a Camacho Solis candidacy is  possible at this time: "I do not know if he will decide to run.  I have not seen him for a long time, but I think that  ultimately the decision will not be his to make. He is waiting  for a signal from someone, perhaps from a sector within the PRI  or Salinas himself. At any rate, he will let time pass, but I do  not think it will be until 21 July [date as published]."    Finally, as for the invitation presented to the presidential  candidates before Colosio's assassination to visit EZLN  territory, the rebel subcommander said the situation has changed  in accordance with what the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command has already announced. However,  Marcos added, it might be possible for the EZLN to obtain safe  conduct guarantees for its delegates so they can participate in  a meeting with the candidates or for the presidential candidates  to send representatives to EZLN-held areas.    Marcos said: "We had planned to invite the candidates here,  but we have changed our minds. This is because if they are shot  while they are in this region of the country, we would be blamed  for it. Can you imagine what would happen if they were to be  shot here?"    Marcos added: "What we could do is to request safe conduct  guarantees so that some committee delegates could participate in  a meeting at a certain place and talk with the candidates, or  for the candidates to send representatives so that they could  outline their positions regarding the agreements presented by  the government in case these agreements are accepted by the  EZLN."</p>

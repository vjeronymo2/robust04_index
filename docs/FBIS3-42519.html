			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Morgachev and Igor Vershinin: "The World </F> Market Is Interested in the `Know-How' of Russian Aerospace  Materials Science"; the first paragraph is an introduction; the  last three paragraphs provide general information]    [Text] The development of new materials with stipulated  properties is now considered throughout the world as one of the  key directions in technological progress, comparable in  importance information science and communication. The "leading  edge" of this development work is intended for aviation and  rocket-space machine building. Russian development firms have  strong technological positions in this field, which enabled them  relatively successfully to carry out the first stage of entry  into the world market: about 20% of the financing of the  programs is now accounted for by foreign contracts. The  representatives of the leading Russian enterprises -- NPO VIAM,  NPO Kompozit and others -- became frequent guests of Western  colleagues: in particular, a delegation of the NPO VIAM during  the past week held scheduled consultations with the Dassault  Company and other French partners. Our reviewer Sergey Morgachev  and our expert Igor Vershinin comment on the situation in this  market.    <FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-10A>           World market for aerospace materials </FIG>    <H5>  Results of Technological Race </H5>   Russian enterprises have a general advantage over Western  competitors with respect to metallic materials for aerospace  technology. In the case of ceramics one can speak in general of  parity, although the relation of capabilities with respect to  different types of materials is different. With respect to  composite materials, the United States has the general  advantage, although in this field as well some Russian  developments are entirely competitive.    Specialists point out the leadership of Russian firms with  respect to the strength and plastic qualities of alloys based on  aluminum, molybdenum and niobium with their high melting points,  as well as intermetallide compounds, and heat-resistant nickel  alloys. The All- Russian Institute of Aviation Materials (NPO  VIAM) stands out as the leading firm for conceptual development  work, whereas experimental production is for the most part  concentrated in the All-Russian Institute of Light Alloys (both  in Moscow).    Nowhere in the world is there an equal to Russian heat- and  erosion- resistant protective ceramic coverings based on silicon  and zirconium compounds and heat-shielding ceramics based on  quartz and carbon-carbon compounds. Many of these technologies  were developed in their time within the framework of the Buran  program. The principal enterprises working along these lines are  the NPO VIAM and the NPO Tekhnologiya. The United States, on the  other hand, leads the way in another key direction in work in  the ceramics field: development of construction materials for  engines.    Finally, Russian composite materials of the carbon-carbon  and  carbon- silicon carbide type, used for heat shielding of  construction elements, are of equal quality to American  products. The methods for producing these materials are  technologically more feasible, simpler than the corresponding  American methods. The key Russian firms working in this field  are the NPO Kompozit and the State Scientific Research Institute  for Graphite-Based Materials.

New work requires thoroughly adequate financing which can be  ensured only when the entire aerospace complex emerges from its  crisis and its domestic and foreign markets are restored. Direct  foreign contracts for the sale of technologies concluded during  the last year or two by Russian firms have proven their  practical worth but are no more than a tactical solution for the  problem of retaining their place among the world leaders of the  branch.    Among the partners who have already concluded contracts are  the following: NPO VIAM and the ONERA company in France  (coverings based on carbon and carbon-carbon materials); NPO  VIAM and Dasso in France (attachment parts from niobium alloys  with antioxidation coverings); NPO VIAM and the SEP company in  France (intermetallide materials of the nickel-aluminum and  titanium-aluminum type); NPO Tekhnologiya and the ONERA company  in France (fibrous quartz-based heat-shielding materials); NPO  Kompozit and the CSIRO company in France (carbon-based  composites); NPO VIAM, NPO Tekhnologiya and Beijing Institute of  Aviation Materials (nickel and titanium alloys, including  equipment for their production, construction ceramics). It is  assumed that the financial receipts from foreign contracts in  1993 will amount to about 1/5 of total amount of income for the  firms engaged in development work on aerospace materials.    Negotiations and consultations are now underway for  concluding contracts between the NPO VIAM, NPO Kompozit, NPO  Tekhnologiya and Rolls Royce in Great Britain, Goldschmidt G.A.,  MTU Munchen (Germany), United Aircraft, United Technologies and  Dow Corning in the United States, and the Indian Space Agency.  In addition, Russian developers of such materials evidently will  receive subcontracts in connection with the Russian- American  project for the orbital station Alpha. For the time being it has  not come to the handing out of these orders, but hypothetically  the priority in such awards will be to the Kompozit enterprise  as the firm traditionally belonging to the rocket-space complex.    The Russian presence in the world market is gradually  expanding. American companies, not interested so much in Russian  technologies as in the economic optimization of their projects  by cooperation with Russia, are ready to place orders in Russia  for finished products, including the development and production  of materials. With respect to West European companies, they  specifically covet Russian technologies (which they need, in  particular, in connection with work on the HERMES and HOTOL  spaceplanes).  <H5>  World Market </H5>   The world market for materials for aerospace machine  building  by the beginning of the 1990's was about 15 billion dollars  (including Russian production in world prices); about 1/3 of the  volume of this market was accounted for by Russia. This share,  unquestionably, has now undoubtedly decreased due to the general  economic crisis in Russia. The United States is taking the  leading role in the market. The principal group of goods, as  before, remains metallic materials, despite a tendency to their  being squeezed out by ceramics and composites (see diagram).  <H5>  Aerospace Materials </H5>   The creation of modern types of aviation and space equipment  requires the development of materials having enormous resistance  to mechanical loads, high pressures, aggressive media, high  temperatures and multiple changes in operating mode.    Most of the market is accounted for by metallic materials:  based on aluminum (covering of wings, structural and reinforcing  components), nickel (heat-resistant components of gas turbine  engines), iron (reinforcing components), titanium (structural  components, skin and attachment components, lines), materials  with a high melting point -- molybdenum, niobium, tungsten  (nozzles, control surfaces, structural and attachment  components), intermetallide compounds (high-temperature units).  Ceramic materials (based on graphite, oxides, carbides, borides)  are used as coverings of metals for their protection against  oxidation, wear and erosion, and also as heat-shielding  elements, and in the future -- as engine components. Composite  materials (a combination of materials of the type metal-ceramic,  ceramic-ceramic, polymer-polymer) are used as components of the  skin, propellers, compressor blades, ailerons, other control  surfaces and chassis, for the skins of rockets and in structural  components of fuel tanks.</p>

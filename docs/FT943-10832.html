			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Court radio ruling shows loophole Further consolidation of the commercial-radio industry seems possible after a High Court judge yesterday approved a scheme designed to circumvent the existing provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990. The broadcasting industry has been awaiting the ruling over the legality of the Radio Authority's decision to approve a scheme allowing Emap, the media group, to have a stake in eight large metropolitan licences - two more than allowed under the act. The judgment appears to expose a loophole in the 1990 Broadcasting Act which might require legislation to close. Under the scheme Emap, which runs the commercial stations Radio City and Kiss FM, proposes to extend the number of licences it holds from three to eight by taking over Trans World Communications (TWC). To get around the upper limit Emap devised a new corporate structure to enable two of its licences to be 'warehoused'. The scheme - sanctioned by the Radio Authority - involves a 'deadlocked' company being set up with Emap and Schoders, its merchant bankers. Each would own 50 per cent of the share capital of the new company which would hold the two Radio City licences. Mr Justice Schiemann yesterday dismissed an application from Guardian Media Group, which publishes The Guardian newspaper and holds 20 per cent of TWC's shares, for the Radio Authority's decision to be subject to judicial review. Guardian argued that the authority had acted beyond its powers in approving an 'artificial device' designed to evade the restrictions. The judge ruled, however, that under the proposed structure Schroders would not be a nominee of Emap nor act under its control. He also ruled that the Radio Authority had not acted outside its powers. Parliament could have legislated to prevent such schemes being devised but it had not done so, he ruled. The authority was therefore entitled to approve Emap's scheme. The judge refused Guardian Media Group leave to take its case to the Court of Appeal. Lawyers for Guardian said it would consider making its own application for an appeal hearing. The Radio Authority yesterday made clear that it would reserve its views on any similar schemes until after any possible appeal and after it had consulted its members. The Radio Authority wants to simplify commercial radio ownership rules which are based on a point system linked to the size of stations. TWC said last night that it was considering its position and would give its advice to shareholders in due course.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the CSCE mission in Georgia, Aleksandr  Tsvetkov, has described the situation in South Ossetia as  extremely complicated. Since the deployment of peacekeeping  forces a year ago, none of the parties have taken a step to  begin a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. He has  expressed the mission's concern over the trends of ethnic  confrontation that have aroused lately as well as an  administrative and political isolation.    The head of the mission named the return of refugees to the  places of their permanent residence as one of the most  complicated problems. According to the data possessed by the  CSCE, these include 11,000 ethnic Ossetian refugees staying in  the territory of North Ossetia and 7,000 ethnic Georgians  accommodated mainly in the territory of Gori Rayon.    Commenting on the issue of elections to the State Nikhas  [supreme soviet] held in Tskhinvali recently, the head of the  mission has said that their results have a significance for the  determination of internal political arrangement of forces in the  region. According to him, until the newly elected body starts  to work, it will be difficult to form an opinion whether a  policy carried out by Tskhinvali authorities toward the Georgian  leadership since the beginning of the conflict is undergoing any  changes.    We expect both sides to take actions directed toward the  settlement of the conflict, said the head of the CSCE mission.  For our part, we can assist in inviting experts of  international standards on handling ethnic conflicts and  national problems.</p>

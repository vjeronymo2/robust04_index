			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CSUN'S PILE STEPS FORWARD WITH TOP TRIPLE JUMP MARK  </P> <P> Lolita Pile of Cal State Northridge is reluctant to concern herself with  statistics because pressure tends to increase along with the numbers.  </P> <P> Asked her personal bests, she answers in estimates.  </P> <P> But her attitude may change -- whether she likes it or not -- after she won the  women's triple jump with a personal best of 42 feet at a quadrangular track  meet Saturday at UCLA.  </P> <P> After all, it's not often that a Northridge athlete produces a national-best  outdoor mark -- Sylvia Dyer of Abilene Christian jumped 42-8 1/2 indoors -- but  that's what Pile, a diminutive (5-4 1/2, 110-pound) junior dynamo, did at Drake  Stadium, helping the Lady Matadors to a third-place finish.  </P> <P> UCLA, the defending NCAA champion, scored 96 points to win the women's meet,  followed by Cal (38), Northridge (34) and Azusa Pacific (2).  </P> <P> Janeene Vickers, a UCLA sophomore, won three events (100-meter low hurdles, 400  meters and 400 low hurdles) and ran legs on the victorious 400 and 1,600  relays.  </P> <P> In the men's triangular meet, the two-time defending NCAA champion Bruins  scored 98 points to beat Azusa Pacific (50) and Northridge (43).  </P> <P> Although it's true that many of the nation's leading triple jumpers -- such as  Sheila Hudson of Cal and Wendy Brown of USC -- have yet to jump outdoors this  season, Pile's mark is still noteworthy. It improved her school record (40-8  1/4) by more than a foot and qualified her for the NCAA Division II  championships in Hampton, Va., in May.  </P> <P> "I knew it was a good jump," said Pile, who had three jumps better than 40 feet  and five jumps measuring 39-9 3/4 or better. "But I figured it was a 40-foot  jump, 41 tops. . . . I was really surprised when they said 42. It just felt so  easy."  </P> <P> Pile also teamed with Carol Collier, Alicia Bell and Mary Coleman to place  third in the 400 relay. Northridge clocked 47.17, missing the Division II  qualifying standard by 0.07 seconds.  </P> <P> Coleman also placed fourth in the women's 400 in 56.00 seconds, a tenth of a  second shy of the Division II standard.  </P> <P> Pile's performance overshadowed a superb double by teammate Darcy Arreola, who  won the 3,000 meters in 9 minutes, 27.9 seconds, and came back 35 minutes later  to win the 1,500 in 4:20.36.  </P> <P> Both times were season bests for Arreola, the defending Division II champion in  both races. She displayed strong finishing kicks in each race.  </P> <P> In the 3,000, Arreola ran the final 400 in 68.3, surging past runner-up Laurie  Chapman of UCLA with 300 meters left. In the 1,500, she sped past UCLA's Laura  Chapel with 250 meters to go, running a 64-second last lap.  </P> <P> "She's really running well right now," CSUN Coach Don Strametz said. "Her 1,500  was really impressive when you consider that it started 30 minutes after she  finished the 3,000."  </P> <P> Tyrone Jeffries, Walt Stewart and Jerry Gilmore led Northridge in the men's  meet.  </P> <P> Jeffries won the 400-meter intermediate hurdles in 52.73, placed third in the  110-meter high hurdles in 14.49 and ran a 47.1 anchor leg in the 1,600 relay as  Northridge placed third (3:15.3).  </P> <P> Jeffries' efforts in the hurdles missed the Division II qualifying standards by  0.07 and 0.13 seconds, respectively.  </P> <P> Gilmore won the long jump with a personal best of 24-5 1/2 but missed the  Division II standard of 24-7 1/4.  </P> <P> Stewart, who jumped a personal best of 7-0 1/4 last week, won the high jump at  7-0.  </P></p>

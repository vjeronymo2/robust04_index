			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Shares still attuned to bond trends - New York Equity investors are entering a potential minefield this week, with a batch of signals on inflation laid out before them and fears over the direction of monetary policy running rampant. 'We're not going to have a lot of fun,' says Mr Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at AG Edwards &amp; Sons, a St Louis securities house. 'We just had the first truly nasty week of a correction. The market is going to lose sleep over the weekend thinking about it, and the bears will be licking out their chops on Monday morning.' As last week's action demonstrated, shares are still closely attuned to bond market trends. The results were not pretty. The Treasury market went into a mid-week tail-spin, haunted by real and imagined signs that the Federal Reserve was poised for a second strike on interest rates, three weeks after the first. Shares followed bonds down, ignoring the completion of a fourth-quarter reporting season that brought news of a 60 per cent gain in corporate earnings and solid evidence of continued growth in the current three-month period. By the week's end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a 47-point net decline to 3,838.78, including Thursday's 51-point rout, triggered by the collapse of Bell Atlantic's proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc. Mr Goldman believes the market will suffer more losses this week, no matter how the bond market performs. 'In a correction, bad news is bad, and good news is bad, too,' he says. Mr Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York, agrees that Wall Street will probably have to navigate some choppy activity over the next five days. But he sees shares continuing to 'feed off' the bond market and links a further slide in prices this week to developments there. 'Investors are spooked by high interest rates,' he says, adding that the anxiety is likely to abate in the next few weeks. Reassurance will depend on more data suggesting the economy is no danger of overheating, beginning with Tuesday's purchasing managers' index, a good leading indicator of the economy's pace. The week will culminate with Friday's report on the February employment trends. Analysts are looking for an increase of 150,000 in payrolls last month. If their estimates prove accurate, Mr Cardillo believes shares could return to stability, although February's cold weather may provide an excuse to explain away a favourable reading. If the forecast proves to have been timid, however, a big sell-off is possible. On a bright note, bargain hunters are expected to give a lift to telecommunications and cable stocks, which were battered last week when Bell Atlantic's announcement raised an unexpected detour in the development of the 'information superhighway'. The sector's rebound was already evident on Friday, when the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index clearly outperformed the large-cap indices.</p>

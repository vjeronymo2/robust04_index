			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Syria delays troop pull-out Syrian troops will not leave Beirut until the country has completed all political reforms foreseen in the 1989 Taif peace accords, Syria's vice president responsible for policy in Lebanon said yesterday, Lara Marlowe writes from Beirut. Mr Abdel-Halim Khaddam's remarks, broadcast on Radio Monte Carlo, confound hopes that Syrian troops would redeploy to east Lebanon before the year end. Mr Khaddam said Lebanon had failed to abolish its sectarian system of government - in which political positions are alloted according to religious affiliation - which in his view was the most important Taif reform.</p>

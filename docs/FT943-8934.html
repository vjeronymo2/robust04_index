			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Tokyo minister forced out in row over war A Japanese cabinet minister was forced to resign yesterday after saying that the country did not intend to fight a war of aggression in the 1930s and 1940s and suggesting that the parts of Asia it occupied benefited from the experience. South Korea and China protested at the comments by Mr Shin Sakurai, director general of the Environment Agency, which he made on Friday and withdrew the same night. His political future became the subject of a weekend tussle between the Liberal Democratic party and the Social Democratic party, the dominant members of the three-party coalition that took power at the end of June. Mr Sakurai is the fourth Japanese cabinet member in eight years to be ousted because of revulsion in the region over an attempt to put a better gloss on Japan's wartime role. His departure highlights the lack of contrition among right-leaning Japanese over actions of the imperial army, as well as ideological strains in the coalition of convenience grouping the conservative LDP, the left-wing and traditionally pacifist SDP, and the reformist New Harbinger party. LDP leaders, while disavowing Mr Sakurai's views, appear to have sought his retention in cabinet after he apologised for having said the war led to independence for Asian countries which had been under the European colonial yoke, 'popularisation of education and increased literacy' in those nations, and their subsequent economic success. Eight to 10 government ministers, most if not all from the LDP, are expected today - the 49th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of the second world war - to pay homage at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni shrine. The shrine commemorates Japanese war dead and contains remains of a number whom the western allies classified as war criminals. The weekend episode precedes a South-East Asian tour later this month by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister. It comes as Japan is debating a wider international role for its Self-Defence Forces, which replaced the imperial military after US post-war occupation of Japan. A government advisory panel on Friday presented Mr Murayama with a report recommending that the country 'should extricate itself from its security policy of the past that was, if anything, passive, and henceforth play an active role in shaping a new order' in the world. This would include deploying weapons in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The government, like its predecessors, is meanwhile agonising over whether and how to compensate those forced to work for the imperial army in occupied countries, including so-called comfort women required to provide sex for troops. According to one report, the administration is contemplating a Y100bn (Pounds 646m) aid fund for the victims, about 50 of whom gathered in Tokyo at the weekend to press their case. Mr Murayama, the SDP leader, is a lifelong socialist who only on becoming premier acknowledged the legitimacy of the Self-Defence Forces as part of a policy compromise with the LDP. At 70 he is old enough to have had his pacifism motivated by direct recollection of the war, and this weekend drew the line at serving alongside Mr Sakurai, 61, whose stated impression of the era was so different. Mr Sakurai's comments, in answer to a question at a press conference, were denounced by South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party as 'tantamount to blasphemy against Asian countries subjected by Japan to numerous pains and sacrifices' and by China as a distortion of history. In May Mr Shigeto Nagano, justice minister in the then government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, resigned after implying that the 1937 massacre of Chinese civilians in Nanking by Japanese soldiers was a fabrication. Mr Nagano was from Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party.</p>

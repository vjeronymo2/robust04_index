			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political affairs desk reporter Kim Chae-hong: </F> "Russia's `Rude Diplomacy' and Our Countermeasures," from the  "Reporter's Eyes" column]    [Text] Blind points in the government's diplomacy on Russia  have been revealed in the wake of President Kim Yong-sam's visit  to Russia slated for 1 June. The incidents that recently showed  the blind points in ROK-Russia relations are, in general, two:  One is the 20 May IZVESTIA report that "there is a possibility  that Russia will supply weapon parts to North Korea," and the  other is Russia's diplomatic rudeness in the postponement of the  ROK-Russia joint economic committee meeting--scheduled to be  held in Seoul on 20 and 21 May--by unilaterally breaching the  agreement with the ROK. These diplomatic blind points were  revealed after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to Russia  from 13 to 15 April and after Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's  visit to Russia from 28 April to 3 May, respectively. Thus,  voices raised criticizing the government for problems existing  in implementing its foreign policies.    One should consider that sale of weapon parts is deeply  related to Russia's policy on the Korean peninsula, going beyond  a mere happening. To increase the North Korean battle strength,  under the circumstances in which North and South Korea have not  achieved a peace mechanism, cannot but be defined as a hostile  act against us. Russia established diplomatic relations with the  ROK and has maintained a friendly atmosphere with us to date  while using $1.57 billion of money we offered as a loan.  However, heated debates took place between the two nations  regarding the method of loan payment, as to whether to pay it  with raw materials or weapons. Amid such debate, the issue of  supplying weapon parts to North Korea was raised.    Russia put forward a logic that by supplying weapon parts to  North Korea, it can "exert influence on North Korea." This logic  is the same as the response that Russia showed when our Defense  Ministry demanded in July 1992 that "the article on military  alliance specified in the DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty on  Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance should be  amended."    Article 1 in the DPRK-Russia treaty stipulates that if North  Korea is invaded by outside forces, the Russian Armed Forces  shall automatically interfere in this. Although Russia admits  that this article, an outcome of the Cold War era, is not  appropriate at the present stage, it refused to amend the  article. Instead, Russia has informed the North Korean side  verbally of the abolition of the article pertaining to its  automatic interference. But Russia has not amended the written  text of the article. This is the very status of relations  between North Korea and Russia. This means that whenever  necessary, the validity of this article can be recovered at any  time. Our government pointed out the following four issues as  major impending problems between the ROK and Russia: First,  payment of economic cooperation loans; second, defection of  North Korean loggers; third, compensation for downing the Korean  Airline passenger plane; and fourth, the land of former Russian  mission in Seoul.    It seems that Russia's military security policy toward the  Korean peninsula should be included in pending issues to be  discussed with the Russian side when President Kim Yong-sam  visits Russia.</p>

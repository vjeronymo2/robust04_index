			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Staple defends staff and his predecessor's record IN SPITE OF criticism of the Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of the second Guinness trial and its handling of the Blue Arrow prosecution, the new director appears relaxed about the SFO's ability to do the job. At a press conference yesterday following publication of the SFO annual report Mr George Staple mounted a staunch defence of the competence of his staff and the record of his predecessor, Mrs Barbara Mills QC, now the director of public prosecutions. Before the Roskill fraud trials committee report, prosecution of serious fraud was a problem. The SFO had changed that, Mr Staple said. The SFO's conviction rate rose last year from 63 per cent to 66 per cent. The office prosecuted 58 people in 28 trials. Twenty defendants were jailed. Nevertheless, he admits to the strains on his department of coping with the burgeoning of cases of detected fraud. The increased value of the cases being reported has led to the raising of the SFO's limit for taking on new cases from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m. This is in spite of a big increase in the SFO's budget, which rose from Pounds 13.2m in 1990-91 to Pounds 17.8m last year and Pounds 21.2m this year. Much of this increase was a result of having to mount the BCCI and Maxwell inquiries. 'If we had the funds no doubt we could prosecute more cases - there is a lot of serious fraud about,' Mr Staple said. 'But that is up to the government. I feel we are doing enough to be a real deterrent.' Confronted with the debate on how regulators and the legal profession should best tackle the problems of combating white-collar crime, Mr Staple believes that because the SFO is less than four years old it is not the time for fundamental change. He rejects an enhanced regulatory role for the office giving it powers similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. The existing demarcations between the SFO, Department of Trade and Industry and the Stock Exchange work well at the moment and should not be tampered with, he said. There are changes to trial procedures which he would like to see to counter some of the criticism of the length of recent cases. The defence should be forced to disclose its hand at a much earlier stage. That would allow the prosecution to refine its case thereby reducing the overall length of the trial. He denied that this would amount to a further erosion of a suspect's right to silence. A procedure for agreeing non-contentious evidence in advance of the trial would also save time, he said. But he rejected the suggestion that the SFO itself could make the greatest contribution to cutting the length of cases if it abandoned its approach of throwing the book at defendants and concentrated on the best six or 10 counts. 'The SFO is bound by the Crown Prosecution Services' code which requires us not to charge people on the fringes of a cases only the people at its core,' he said. 'And, equally, we are required not to overload the indictment. But we can't be put in a straitjacket. These cases are big and they are complex. Justice often requires a number of defendants and a number of charges.' Mr Staple did not reject out of hand the introduction of some form of plea bargaining in serious fraud cases.</p>

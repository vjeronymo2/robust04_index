			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article by Georgian Republic Procuracy Press </F> Service: "Defective Work Style and Its Deplorable Results. In  the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry They Don't Care  About the Legality of Juridical Acts, Which Seriously Hurts the  Common Cause"]    [Text] It is a fact that there are many problems and  shortcomings in Georgia's agriculture now, and the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food Industry has contributed its "share" to  this, but right now we will only discuss one defective aspect of  its activity--the legality of juridical acts issued this year  and last by the Ministry's officials.    The Procuracy's General Oversight Administration  recently examined the question, and it appears that the legality  of such acts is of no concern to the Ministry's officials. The  chronological sequence of orders is grossly violated, and  revisions, additions, erasures, and wrong numberings are made to  them regularly, on the basis of somebody's wishes or  highhandedness, and so on. Most surprising is the fact that  orders signed by Ministry officials have had changes made to  them by lower-ranking officials. No one knows why this is.    Often, orders signed by Ministry officials have comments  written by other persons. Sometimes, in addition, separate  documents are written which cancel juridical acts, although the  reason is not given, nor are they signed. The rule is that a  given act can only be cancelled by issuing a new order. Examples  of such highhanded action include the cancellation of the former  Agriculture Ministry's order of 27 August 1992 and the former  Food and Processing Industry Ministry's orders of 5 and 7  October 1992, and so on.    People in the Ministry also resort to what is known as  stopping orders. And it's done in funny ways. In particular, a  hand-written note is inserted in the orders book in place of the  juridical act that has been removed. Unfortunately, these notes  are written by technical personnel or even secretaries and  typists.    Officials of both the Ministry and its subsidiary  enterprises  and organizations often cancel previous orders with the terse  note "cancelled" instead of issuing a new order. It is left  vague just what the grounds were and why it all happened; just  try to guess.    Especially deplorable is the fact that the Ministry does  issue orders, but the stipulations are not fulfilled, as a  result of poor follow-through discipline. For example, a  Ministry executive order cancelled the Gori Outfitting Depot  Director's order and directed him to return to the proper  quarters 421,000 rubles' worth of fixed assets, vehicles, and  implements that had been turned over to another organization  without the Ministry's permission, and to show the value on the  balance sheet. According to the balance sheet it submitted, the  enterprise had done everything, but in fact it had not. To this  day, neither the fixed assets nor their value have been returned.    The same route has also been taken by organizations under  the  Ministry. The Sakkonservi [Russian Gruzkonserv] Association  issued an order transferring the uninstalled and unused  machinery and equipment of the now-abolished Tkviavi Canning  Plant from its own books to be distributed to other enterprises,  but it never followed up on its order. All that fine equipment  has been left out in the open; it is rusting and being stripped  and wrecked.    Juridical acts that are taken arbitrarily are hurting the  country materially. The Ministry's executives most generously,  and illegally, provided assistance to apparatus personnel. In  the course of several months, they spent 9 million rubles on  this. They often issued unlawful juridical acts giving lump-sum  assistance by way of exception. Money was given in this way to  outside persons as well. Meanwhile, the orders do not specify  the type of incentive or the reasons for it.    There have been many cases of using disciplinary punishment  not provided for in the labor law against Ministry workers and  employees. These constitute gross violations of the Code of  Labor Laws of the Georgian Republic. For example, the Ministry  issued an order by which the head of the Republic Association of  Specialized Livestock Complexes was given a stern reprimand and  a final warning--yet the law does not call for a final warning  as a disciplinary punishment. Unfortunately, there have been  many such cases.    Ministry officials (Minister Otar Kvesitadze) and certain  association executives sometimes fail to carry out court  decisions. For example, the Tbilisi Mtatsminda Rayon Court's  rulings calling for the immediate reinstatement of G.  Burdzhanadze, the director of the Kvemo Chala Prepared Food  Plant (Kaspi Rayon), to his post, were never complied with. Even  though the rulings were sustained by the City Court.    There are also instances of illegal orders in the case of  transferring workers and employees to other jobs. Unprecedented  in this regard is the use of transfer procedures to appoint  Juridical Administration Head I. Lomtatidze to the post of head  of the Disputes, Methodology, and Codification Department and,  simultaneously, the deputy head of the Juridical Administration.  This was without his consent, which is impermissible. There are  too many such cases.    Other violations and improprieties have also been found in  the Ministry. Many orders are issued to abolish enterprises and  installations without even indicating which law or normative act  serves as the basis for the liquidation, whether a liquidation  commission has been created, what specific measures must be  taken to dismiss workers and employees legally, find jobs for  them, and so on. That's what happened, for example, to the  Vivariumi Scientific-Control Center for Veterinary Drugs. The  land it occupied, and its buildings, were turned over to the  Gldani State Farm, but the relevant documents say nothing about  laying off its workers and employees or finding other jobs for  them. The same thing happened in the case of the transfer of a  training-methods office to the Institute for the Training and  Upgrading of Qualifications of Food Industry Leadership  Personnel.    The disrespect which Ministry officials have for the law can  be seen clearly by looking at cases in which depreciated cars  have been sold to certain officials. This improper practice is  rooted in the past and still persists. In July of 1992, an order  was written with an enclosure by which retired and depreciated  GAZ-24 vehicles were sold to certain officials. This constituted  an evasion of the law, in that the vehicles were sold to persons  who had been using them, whereas according to a decree of the  Georgian government the right to buy such vehicles was to be  given to personnel recommended by the labor collective and, as a  rule, a general assembly had to decide whom the car could be  sold to. Especially surprising is a recent Ministry order by  which a vehicle was given as a gift to one enterprise official  (?!).    Some juridical acts have to do with cases of damage to the  state, on the basis of which officials and materially  responsible persons have been dismissed, except the question of  recovery of the damages has been "left out" and no measures have  been taken.    There is no end to unlawfulness in the Ministry. This is due  to the fact that some bureaus in the Ministry often conduct  inspections and document audits in a superficial and low-quality  manner and issue orders that are equally meaningless and fail to  properly evaluate and react to serious legal violations.    One graphic example of this is an order of 2 August which  has  to do with the findings of an audit of the economic-financial  activities of the Ministry's Administration of Management and  Service Organizations. Along with numerous legal violations it  points out that four years ago the Administration (which was  then the Saksopkvebservisi [Russian Gruzselpishcheservis]  Association), sold the Vazi Hotel for 40,000 dollars. Of that  sum, 16,700 dollars went for charity work and other activities,  while the bank has blocked the remaining 22,000 dollars in its  account to this day.    For some reason, this order--and the audit document that was  written prior to it--"failed" to observe legality of the sale of  the hotel, the proper use of the money, why the bank has blocked  the 22,000 dollars, and so on. In fact, other republic control  departments have deemed the sale of the Vazi illegal, and the  currency realized from the sale is subject to be deposited to  the budget, because the building was not depreciated and was not  to be sold; moreover, the government had not given its  permission. As for the charity, 8.8 [as printed] pounds sterling  were given, totally wrongly, to send a few students from the  Foreign Language Institute to attend a London college for a  month; the students have nothing to do with the Ministry.    Pursuant to the duties of the republic Procuracy, a number  of  rayon procurators made a selective inspection of the juridical  acts of certain enterprises and organizations and agricultural  and agroindustrial administrations subordinate to the Ministry.  On the basis of the inspections, 114 juridical acts were  protested as being illegal, 21 representations were submitted,  and three reports were sent to local boards.    These and many other cases we have material on show clearly  that in terms of ensuring the legality of juridical acts, the  Ministry's work style and methods are unacceptable, and its  practices are faulty and intolerable.    The practice of issuing illegal juridical acts is also  fostered by the fact that most orders throughout the system are  prepared without the participation of a juridical service.  Orders are written by various officials and even by ordinary  workers. They are not stamped by officials of these bureaus or  even by ordinary legal staffers. Often, in fact, they are not  even aware of the issuance of particular juridical acts.    The republic Procuracy has stated that the deplorable  situation in the Ministry is giving rise to grave consequences  and having a very destructive effect on the country's  agroindustrial complex and the safeguarding of the legitimate  interests of the state, society, and the citizen. In this  connection, a representation has been submitted to the Ministry  and the appropriate report has been sent to the Cabinet of  Ministers.</p>

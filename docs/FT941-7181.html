			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Renison puts blame for tumble into red on weak prices and demand Renison Goldfields, the Australian mining company which is 40 per cent-owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday reported a net loss of ADollars 15.3m (USDollars 11m) in the six months to end-December, down from a ADollars 10.4m profit in the corresponding period of 1992-3. Operating revenues were ADollars 276.4m, compared with ADollars 330.9m a year earlier. The move into the red was blamed on weak prices and demand. Renison said that tin prices were more than 20 per cent lower than a year ago while copper was down by 15 per cent, and that prices for titanium dioxide feedstock products were also depressed. The effect of these significantly lower prices was partially offset by strengthening zircon and gold prices, and the Namara open-cast coal mine made a ADollars 6m profits contribution, meeting its contracted sales since the mine started up. But, although there were no abnormals charges in either first-half period, the latest results do include ADollars 3.8m of restructuring costs, related to both the exploration division, which was overhauled during the first half, and the head office. Renison said yesterday that the changes to the exploration side would mean more effort being expended on exploring for gold, base metals and mineral sands in specific regions of Australia. Offshore activities would 'concentrate on the identification of advanced exploration targets'. Its Canberra exploration office is being closed and the division will be managed from Perth. Both the mineral sands and the tin interests were loss-making in the first half as was the Mount Lyell copper mine. On the gold front, the group's interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea - which was reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent at end-February 1993 - contributed ADollars 35.7m, compared with ADollars 40m last time. Mr Tony Cotton, the Hanson director who was appointed deputy chairman of Renison in October, will become chairman of the company on March 1. He takes over from Mr Max Roberts, who is retiring.</p>

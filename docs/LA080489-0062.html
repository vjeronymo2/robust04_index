			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NO GOING BACK' ON BATTLE AGAINST ISRAEL, ARAFAT SAYS  </P> <P> PLO leader Yasser Arafat defended the principle of armed struggle Thursday,  calling it a "legitimate weapon" against Israeli occupation and a stepping  stone toward the creation of a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> "There's no going back on the course which it (the Palestinian people) has  taken," Arafat told a general congress of Fatah, the largest group in the  Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> The five-day congress is Fatah's first since 1980; its main tasks will be to  elect new leaders and review overall strategy. The meeting opened under tight  security in central Tunis with Tunisian President Zine Abidine ben Ali as guest  speaker.  </P> <P> Arafat, under pressure to approve violence outside the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip, said the PLO has condemned terrorism because it believes in justice  and does not want to adopt the same methods Israel uses against Palestinians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renounced Terrorism  </P> <P> Arafat renounced terrorism last December as part of a PLO peace initiative  based on the idea of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories, alongside  Israel within its pre-1967 borders.  </P> <P> The PLO leader, in green military uniform and traditional black-and-white  headdress, defended the principle of armed struggle, however, saying it had  laid the foundation for Fatah's political achievements.  </P> <P> "As the legitimate weapon against the Israeli occupation, it gave us a  distinguished position in the forefront of the struggle of the world's  liberation movements and won us international support," he added.  </P> <P> But the intifada -- the Palestinian uprising now in its 20th month -- has  opened new chances of peace, Arafat said.  </P> <P> "With it, a new stage began. . . . It has brought realistic possibilities that  the Palestinian people might achieve what they have been deprived of since the  partition (of Palestine) in 1948 -- a Palestinian state," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticizes U.S. Response  </P> <P> The Palestinian leader criticized Washington for what he called a half-hearted  response to the PLO initiative and reluctance to make political concessions to  the movement.  </P> <P> Washington opened a dialogue with the PLO in December, but it has bogged down  in argument over the Palestinian response to Israel's plan for elections in the  occupied territories.  </P> <P> Arafat again rejected the Israeli election plan in its present form, saying the  Israeli government's real motives were to sabotage the peace process,  legitimize its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and delude international  public opinion.  </P> <P> The plan envisages elections for local councilors who would eventually  negotiate on the final status of the territories.  </P> <P> "The PLO has said any temporary measures must be linked . . . with a final  settlement based on ending the Israeli occupation, self-determination, national  independence and a just settlement of the refugee problem," he said.  </P></p>

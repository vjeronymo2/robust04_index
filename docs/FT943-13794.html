			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium Aluminium-producing countries meeting in Australia this week could be forgiven for feeling satisfied with their efforts to return the market to balance. Since production cuts were agreed at the end of January, the aluminium price has risen by about 25 per cent. It has regained the level prevailing in 1991 before imports from the former Soviet Union caused meltdown. Within the last month stocks held on the London Metals Exchange have finally started to fall. With 2.5m tonnes of metal still held in LME warehouses, though, the equilibrium looks fragile. Most producers are probably operating at a profit and will not want to see the metal price driven substantially higher. Another spike upwards could discourage industrial users from using aluminium in place of other, less volatile, metals. But without the prospect of further appreciation, investors who bought aluminium for capital gains will have little incentive to hold on. There must be the danger of liquidations and a sharp price correction until the stock overhang has been reduced. Since there seems little hope of bringing Middle Eastern and Latin American countries on side, progress in reducing stocks depends on the determination of western and Russian producers to stick to cuts already announced. Even though demand in the US and Europe has picked up faster than expected in January, consumption within Russia is still falling. Holding production down now that the price has recovered will require great discipline.</p>

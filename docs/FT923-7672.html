			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Drop in food prices cuts inflation A SHARP drop in seasonal food prices was the main reason behind the fall in retail inflation to an annual rate of 3.7 per cent last month. Although the prices of seasonal foods normally fall at this time of year, July's drop of 9.9 per cent was steeper than expected and brought the year-on-year rate of inflation for seasonal foods to minus 9.8 per cent. The fall was mainly the result of cheaper fresh fruit and vegetables, particularly salad foods. Prices of potatoes and home-killed lamb also fell. According to the Central Statistical Office a number of price increases that were made in July last year were not repeated this year and summer sales for clothes, shoes and certain household goods continued. A fall in mortgage interest payments between June and July also contributed to the drop in the overall index from 139.3 in June to 138.8 last month. High street summer sales, which cut prices by more than the sales last year and were spread over a wider range of products, led to a monthly drop of 4 per cent in clothing and footwear prices - the sharpest fall for any July since records began in 1914. Prices of furniture and electrical goods also fell as sales continued. The biggest month-on-month rise for any component of the index was in house-hold services, which rose by 1.1 per cent. That reflected higher premiums for house contents insurance and an increase in trade union subscriptions. Prices of some other goods crept up, in particular do-it-yourself materials which increased after special offers earlier in the year and contributed to the rise in the housing element of the index. That rise was only partly offset by the fall in mortgage interest payments between June and July. Service-sector inflation remained significantly higher than food-price inflation. It was also well above producer-price inflation for manufactured goods, which was 3.4 per cent last month. The annual rates of inflation for leisure services, personal goods and services and motoring expenditure fell in July. Although car insurance premiums rose last month, price increases for second-hand cars were not repeated this year leading to no change in the index for motoring expenditure.</p>

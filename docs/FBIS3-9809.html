At the beginning of the news conference, SRI Director Virgil  Magureanu referred to several aspects of the activity of the  institution he is heading in the period since the previous news  conference last November. He pointed out the positive changes  that have occurred in the institution's image, after the  election of the SRI director by the vote in parliament and after  the important adjustments made in the regional and central  leadership of the institution, which is the third stage of SRI's  restructuring. Virgil Magureanu considered the setting up of  the parliamentary control commission of the SRI activity as a  new stage in his institution's relationship with the parliament  and the public at large.    Among the problems currently facing the SRI, Magureanu  referred to personnel policies. Regarding the SRI report on the  December 1989 events, a report which he forwarded at the  beginning of this year to the parliamentary commission  investigating those events, Magureanu said that the release of  this report to the press will depend on the commission's  president, Valentin Gabrielescu.    Regarding the activity carried out by the SRI in recent  months, Magureanu said that, despite certain sensationalist  nuances presented in the press, it was assessed as, quote, a  normal activity, which does not necessarily mean a routine one,  end quote.

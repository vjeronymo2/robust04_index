			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state at the </F> Ministry of National Defense, by Ralu Filip; place and date not  given: "Without Reform, the National Security Cannot Be Ensured  Either"]    [Text] National security represents one of the  fundamental requirements of each country and each nation and  Romania is no exception to this rule. Taking into account what  is currently happening in Europe, in certain countries that are  in our immediate neighborhood, and our geopolitical position, it  is only natural to try and find out whether we are safe, if we  can or cannot ensure our national security, and also, what  domestic and external factors might threaten our country.  Therefore, we turned to Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state  with the Ministry of National Defense, who granted us an  interview on this issue:    [Filip] Recently, two documents have been issued: "The  Integrated Concept for Romania's National Security" and  "Romania's Defense Military Doctrine." What can you tell us  about these two documents?    [Pascu] The first draft of "The Integrated Concept for  Romania's National Security" was compiled by experts  representing all institutions that have responsibility in  ensuring national security, in accordance with a modern and  multidimensional understanding of the concept of security. This  first draft was submitted to the Supreme Council of the  Country's Defense [CSAT] and was reviewed after the  establishment of the Partnership for Peace and the statute of  associate partner offered to Romania by the Western European  Union. It is the duty of the Ministry of National Defense and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to finalize the document. As  far as the "Military Doctrine on Romania's Defense" is  concerned, it was drafted by a group of experts in the Ministry  of National Defense and discussed later within the CSAT, a  council in which other institutions that have a role in ensuring  the military defense of the country are also represented.    [Filip] What was the starting point for the integrated  concept for national security and on what is this concept based?    [Pascu] The concept is based on a careful examination both  of the international situation, in areas that are farther from  or closer to Romania, on the profound transformations that have  taken place and continue to take place in the respective areas  and at home. The major conclusion of this examination, which is  also the fundamental requirement of the efforts to ensure  national security, is that currently and for quite a long time  to come Romania has no allies and no dependable security  guarantees. In addition to this, being in the middle of a  process of domestic transition, this process has inevitably  reduced the capability to ensure our own security alone, in a  situation in which we are located in an area characterized by a  high degree of potential conflict.    [Filip] What are the major reasons for Romania's lack of  security?    [Pascu] I believe that the most important reason is the fact  that, if until 1989 the threats against Romania's security, as a  member of the Warsaw Pact, were clearly outlined and were mainly  external, today they have lost their distinctness and the major  danger is the possibility that internal weaknesses might be  exploited. The "Integrated Concept..." assesses the internal  high risk factors among which we can mention Romania's economic  situation, the social costs of transition, the decline in the  society's cohesion, the emergence and increase of new  unconventional risks (misappropriation and smuggling of weapons  and ammunition, drugs, illegal migration, smuggling of all kinds  of products, group violence, and all kinds of terrorist actions,  and so forth) as well as the deterioration in the quality of the  environment....    [Filip] Excuse me for interrupting, but what is the  connection between the environment and national security?    [Pascu] This is the first time that this element has been  included in the concept of national security. The quality of  the environment can affect our security by damaging over the  long term people's health and their natural living conditions.  How? Through toxic wastes, disturbance of the ecological  balance, accidents, and sabotage in important economic  facilities, including the nuclear one.    [Filip] What measures are envisaged to cope with all the  domestic risk factors?    [Pascu] In general, we need the concerted action of all  political and social forces to ensure the consolidation of the  country. The national interest is above the interest of  political parties or other types of social groups. We need a  structural and functional consolidation in the democratic and  constitutional framework of the state, of the central and local  public authorities, of public institutions, and political and  social pluralism. I am referring to the need to ensure  efficiency and the continuity of the process of  economic-structural reform, to introduce the market economy, and  to ensure the proper functioning of the national economy, also  in special situations (war, natural disasters, or nuclear  accidents). In conclusion, one can say that there is a direct  connection between the reform process and national security. The  success of reform cannot be ensured without national security  and in order to ensure security we definitely need to bring the  reform to a successful conclusion.    [Filip] What are the major external risk factors?    [Pascu] As has already been mentioned, the danger of armed  aggression from the outside has been considerably reduced,  however, the danger generated by foreign interference and  pressures on Romania continues to prevail. I would like to  repeat, the exploitation of the domestic situation is the major  risk. That is why the "Military Doctrine for Romania's Defense"  clearly states that "combined aggressive actions, that is, the  organization and deployment of foreign military forces on the  grounds of potential domestic aggressive actions, represents the  most dangerous type of actions."    [Filip] Nevertheless, would you please enumerate a few  external risk factors?    [Pascu] The emergence and intensification of certain  conflicts or other forms of tension and the presence of certain  areas with a higher level of political and military instability  in Romania's proximity also increase our risks of insecurity.  The state of tension and major crises in areas neighboring  Romania can endanger internal stability through the emergence of  massive waves of refugees, through the economic consequences of  the act of suspending economic relations with certain countries,  as a result of the conflict, or through losses provoked by the  observance of certain decisions of international bodies to which  we also belong.    [Filip] Does not the stability plan adopted recently in  Paris reduce the number of external risk factors?    [Pascu] The stability plan, according to the intention of  its initiators, is a process of preventive diplomacy. Except  that I personally believe that to qualify this plan as  "preventive" also indicates that attempts are made to anticipate  certain negative states of affair. However, if they have not  occurred so far, it means that this is due to the action of  certain factors that might be perturbed precisely by this  attempt to anticipate them. There is a saying in German:  Better is the enemy of good. In other words, let us try not to  provoke certain situations by attempts to prevent them....    [Filip] But what about the agreement on the reduction of  conventional weapons and troops in Europe? Is it a risk factor  or a guarantee for Romania's national security?    [Pascu] In connection with this accord, one can say that,  even at the time when it was concluded, it no longer reflected  the situation that generated it. For example, in the  NATO-Warsaw Pact military balance, Romania was considered a  country of secondary importance and the limits established for  our country reflected this statute. But now, one can say that  all the countries that were members of the Warsaw Pact have  become countries of major importance, considering the increased  degree of insecurity in the common area where they are situated.    [Filip] And does it affect us?    [Pascu] The accord represents the basis for military  security on our continent, at least for the time being. There  has already been pressure from some signatory countries (Russia  for example) to modify certain stipulations regarding  deployment. I believe that in spite of the aforementioned  shortcomings, the act of abandoning the accord would result in  unforeseeable negative consequences for European security and  for each country respectively.    [Filip] There are some who believe that the Partnership for  Peace as well as the Paris Accord in reality would aim at  achieving Romania's disarmament, the dismantling of our military  industry, and placing Romania clearly in a position of  inferiority. What is your opinion of all this?    [Pascu] I am glad that you use the expression "there are  some who believe" because a great number of "stories," some more  interesting than others, have been circulating and will continue  to circulate about Partnership for Peace. This is also  happening in other former Warsaw Pact member countries. I do  not doubt that the military industry in developed countries has  a certain interest in attempting to overcome current  difficulties by delivering weapons to the Eastern markets.  However, at the same time, I would like to stress that the  Partnership for Peace is a competition in which all of the  competitors' security factors, including the military industry,  are being maximally used. Moreover, at least as far as Romania  is concerned, the position adopted -- which reflects a strategy  in this area -- is to maintain the capacity of military  production in spite of participation in the Partnership for  Peace.    [Filip] Taking into account the competition that has been  created, Romania's position, and the military production  capacity, how do you regard the budget allotted to the Army? Is  it a risk factor against national security?    [Pascu] Yes and no. Yes, because it cannot be increased to  the level of our requirements at the moment for tangible  reasons. No, because it is designated precisely to counteract  risks against security.    [Filip] Romania's geopolitical position raises problems.  Some nations are afraid of a possible invasion from the  direction in which Romania is situated, others regard positively  Romania's geographic location. It is certain that the chance to  play a military and political role in the area brings us both  advantages but also disadvantages. What do you think about that?    [Pascu] I would proceed from the assessment made by  General Joulwan, commander of NATO forces, when he visited  Romania. He said that Romania "is an important country in a  strategic area." Certainly, this is a double-edged situation, as  you very well remarked. However, I believe that, if there is  enough political maturity and political skill -- which Romania  in general has never lacked -- the positive part will prevail  over the negative part.    [Filip] The visit paid by General Grachev generated various  reactions, some affirming that Russia is trying to maintain its  influence over Romania. In general, our political leaders are  reserved when it comes to our relations with Moscow. Why?    [Pascu] General Grachev's visit also emphasizes in a way the  same thing that General Joulwan said, namely that Romania is an  important country in a strategic area. If we were to evaluate  things strictly from a technical viewpoint, than it becomes  clear why Russia does not wish to completely lose its influence  over its former allies. However, at the same time, the  reservations that you are talking about reflect a certain need  for serious and credible proof from Russia that the efforts it  is making so as not to lose completely its influence over its  former allies does not mean the old Soviet behavior. In  general, not only in the case of Romania, Russia's behavior is  carefully observed and examined, precisely in order to be able  to distinguish those changes for the better that the Russian  political factors are emphasizing in their dialogue with us,  former allies.    [Filip] Will we join NATO regardless of Moscow's position?    [Pascu] A first aspect that I would like to stress here is  that this move of Romania's has no greater or lesser importance  for Russia than in the case of other countries. The second  aspect would be that the problem of including all former Warsaw  Pact countries in NATO is subordinate to another goal, which I  believe is more important for Russia, namely that of obtaining  relations of strategic partnership with the Atlantic Alliance.  That is the reason, at least in theoretical terms, why Russia  could give in as far as the association of certain former allied  countries to NATO structures is concerned, if, by paying this  "price" it could obtain more easily the statute of "strategic  partner." As a matter of fact, NATO is also engaged in  discussions with Russia on this issue, trying to achieve a  weakening of Russia's resistance on the issue of the association  of certain Eastern and Central European countries to its  structures.    [Filip] Given your position and the information that you  possess, do you believe that we can set our minds at rest as far  as the future of Romania's national security is concerned?    [Pascu] Apart from unforeseeable events, which unfortunately  will continue to appear in the near or more distant future, I  believe that, even if we talk about the medium and long term, we  can set our minds at rest on this issue and also on Romania's  integration in European and Euro-Atlantic security structures.</p>

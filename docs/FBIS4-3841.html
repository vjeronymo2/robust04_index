			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton warned the Bosnian Serbs today that they "should not  doubt NATO's willingness to act" on wider air strikes in the  former Yugoslav Republic.    In a joint press conference with visiting Greek Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly after NATO's fresh ultimatum  for the Serbs, Clinton said Serb acts in Gorazde "justify firm  action."    Papandreou, meanwhile, expressed Greek concerns and  reservation for the NATO decision for fear of wider violence,  although it did not vote against it.    "It's a fire that can spread very fast," Papandreou said.  "On the Balkan peninsula, we have really dynamite on our hands,"    Under the NATO ultimatum, the Bosnian Serbs should stop  their  assault immediately and pull out their heavy weapons before  12:01 A.M. Sunday (local time) from a two miles radius from the  center of Gorazde, one of six U.N.-designated "safe areas," or  risk NATO air strikes.    The NATO decision also demands that the Serbs allow U.N.  Peacekeepers and medical personnel into the enclave, which had  been under intensive Serb attacks in recent weeks.    Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Papandreou also discussed  Athens'  relations with Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia.    For his part, Papandreou offered that Greece would lift its  economic embargo on the land-locked Macedonia and stop blocking  its membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE), provided that Macedonia change some articles in  its constitution.    As for the Republic's name, which resembles that of the  Greek  province of Macedonia, Papandreou said, it would set aside for  further negotiations.    Clinton, expressing understanding for Greece's "legitimate  concerns" while calling for the end to the Greek economic  blockade on Macedonia, said he was hopeful that an agreement  would soon be reached.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Marudai Food to increase ratio of cross-holdings MARUDAI FOOD, a Japanese food processing company, said yesterday it would raise its ratio of cross-shareholdings by encouraging banks and insurance companies to raise their exposure in return for lifting its own stakes in some of the financial institutions involved. The move comes at a time when many Japanese companies are reducing such links. Japan's cross-shareholding system has been under pressure following the collapse of stock prices and the slowing of the economy. A fall in bank share prices in recent months was blamed on a weakening of that system as troubled industrial companies cashed in long-term hold - ings. Marudai plans to lift its ratio of stable shareholders from the present 55.3 per cent to around 60 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4 (c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. Parish's alkali grass was included as threatened in this notice of review. On December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), the Service published an updated notice reviewing the native plants being considered for classification as endangered or threatened. Parish's alkali grass was included in this notice as a Category 1 species. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service has on file substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. The November 23, 1983, supplement to the plant notice of review (48 FR 53640) reclassified Parish's alkali grass as a Category 2 candidate. Category 2 species are those taxa for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there are insufficient data to support listing proposals at the time. Parish's alkali grass was included as a Category 2 species in the 1985 and 1990 notices of review (50 FR 39525, September 27, 1985; 55 FR 6183, February 21, 1990). The most recent plant notice of review (58 FR 51144; September 30, 1993) upgraded this species to Category 1 status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 1 year of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. Because Parish's alkali grass was included in the 1975 Smithsonian report, which was accepted as a petition, the petition to list this species was treated as being newly submitted on October 13, 1982. From 1983 to 1993, the Service made the required 1-year findings that listing Parish's alkali grass was warranted, but precluded by other listing actions of higher priority, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Biological data supplied by Phillips and Phillips (1991) fully support the listing of this species. Publication of this proposed rule constitutes the final 1-year finding for this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the criteria and procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Puccinellia parishii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hitchcock (Parish's alkali grass) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parish's alkali grass is vulnerable to alteration of the hydrologic flows upon which it depends through water diversion and impoundment, and groundwater pumping. The development of these fragile spring habitats could eliminate the already small populations of this species. One population near Tuba City, Arizona, occurs in a mesic canyon bottom used since the late 1800's for farming. The canyon bottom is divided into a series of plots that are farmed by individual families (Hevron, pers. comm., 1993). Water is drained from the canyon bottom each spring by two lateral ditches and a central drain. It takes about 4&hyph;6 weeks for the area to dry out enough to be farmed. Farming practices such as burning, herbicide use, and plowing regimes may have impacted this population of Parish's alkali grass because the grass is present in some farm plots, but absent in others with apparently similar soils and drainage. Plants of Parish's alkali grass have been observed plowed up within some plots (Hevron, pers. comm., 1993). Threats to this and other sites within the Tuba City area include farming of seep habitat, construction, recreation, and water diversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Livestock have access to most of the currently known sites of Parish's alkali grass, but apparently do not graze the species. However, trampling by livestock occurs at the Grant County spring and in the Tuba City area. Livestock hooves produce surface disturbance that can develop into gullies, increase soil erosion and surface water runoff, reduce or eliminate the soil seed bank, open up the habitat to invasive weedy species, and lessen the ability of Parish's alkali grass populations to recover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most severe types of surface disturbance and habitat alteration occur when heavy equipment is used within spring or seep habitat. The San Bernardino County spring complex was changed from a natural spring into several water impoundments presumably used by livestock. Although no further construction is currently planned for this site, it is near the community of Lucerne Valley, which is undergoing an accelerated rate of development. One population of Parish's alkali grass in the Tuba City area occurs on a hillside that has been partly leveled by a bulldozer, possibly for house construction. Such habitat alteration can cause permanent changes in the soil microhabitat, severe soil erosion, loss of the soil seed bank, and eventual decline or loss of the population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No economic uses for Parish's alkali grass are known. However, low population numbers make this species vulnerable to overcollection by both scientists and rare plant enthusiasts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

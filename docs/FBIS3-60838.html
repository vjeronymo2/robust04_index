			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rifat Saeed: "Al-Zulfiqar: Past, Present, and </F> Future"]    [Text] Before we detail the past and future of the  al-Zulfiqars, it is important that the readers know that there  has been no difference in the activities of these invisible  forces since the fall of former Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto in 1987, and now. There seem to be no difference in the  formation of al-Zulfiqar and its influence, the Punjabi-Pukhtoon  Alliance, G. M. Syed and the Sindhi Nationalist Organization,  and the formation of the MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] and Iltaf  Hussein's political style. All these organizations play a role  in the same drama and are instruments in the hands of the same  force.    After Murtaza Bhutto's return to Pakistan, it seems that  armed terrorism in this country has ended, and political  terrorism has started. Dr. Qadir Magsi, leader of Jiye Sindh  movement, is talking about establishing law and order in Sindh  and getting rid of the robbers after his mysterious release from  jail. Murtaza Bhutto, the head of al-Zulfiqar, talked before and  after his arrest about ending al-Zulfiqar's activities and of  his desire to play the role of a patriotic political leader.  Meanwhile, Iltaf Hussein, leader of the MQM, is giving up  communal politics and is talking about a united national  political movement. It seems that some of these forces are  moving the energy of armed terrorists toward political  terrorism, in order to show the nation that they have taken away  weapons from the terrorists and have included them in the  national political mainstream. The one and only purpose for this  plan is to continue using their followers in their future  political activities, so that our nation is not self-reliant in  the political and economic arenas. These forces wanted to  maintain their control in the name of establishing law and order.    When Benazir Bhutto took power in 1988, there was the  possibility of Murtaza Bhutto's return; however, she tried to  keep Murtaza Bhutto scared for her own vested interests, and  gave the impression to her younger brother that if he put his  foot on Pakistan's land, it would mean signing his own death  sentence. This way, Benazir Bhutto put in Murtaza Bhutto's mind  a fear of intelligence agencies and other top agencies in our  country. Thus, he could not dare return home in the past. During  this period, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and Mustafa Khan, who are both  traitors and were involved in conspiracies against the army,  managed to return home, and even to become Cabinet members.    A special aspect of the cases against Murtaza Bhutto is the  legal loopholes involved in these. According to legal experts,  Murtaza Bhutto perhaps will not be punished in any of the cases  against him; however, intelligence agencies have proof of  Murtaza Bhutto's involvement in terrorism. If these are  presented in court, then Murtaza Bhutto will be in serious  trouble. However, these agencies may need Murtaza Bhutto's  services for some reason, and it would be impossible to present  proof of his involvement in terrorism. According to high-level  police officials, there are 72 witnesses listed in connection  with the case registered in Ferozabad, but 15 years have passed,  and some of these witnesses have died. Others have retired, and  some of them will not be willing to testify against the brother  of the prime minister. It is feared that Murtaza Bhutto will win  in the legal wars, because in Pakistan witnesses and proof are  very important in criminal cases. The most important fact is  that the judge of the special court where the case against  Murtaza Bhutto is registered has been transferred. He was a  former judge in the Sindh High Court.    How and when was al-Zulfiqar established? PPP [Pakistan  People's Party] supporters and opponents have different opinions  about it. When the late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto fell from power and  was arrested on 16 September 1977 at Larkana, he, after a  decision in the case against him for murdering Nawab Mohammed  Ahmed Khan, understood the seriousness of the situation and sent  both his sons--Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Shah Nawaz Bhutto--abroad.  In the end Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to be hanged.  General Zia rejected even his last appeal for mercy. On that  day, Murtaza Bhutto decided to establish al-Zulfiqar and declare  General Ziaul Haq his target. Among the targets of al-Zulfiqar  there are many VIPs, as well as prominent politicians, judges,  and high-level civil and military officers. The first target of  the al-Zulfiqar was the hijacking of the PIA [Pakistan  International Airlines] Boeing PK 326 on 2 March 1981. This  plane was going to Peshawar with 148 passengers in it, including  three women. This plane was hijacked to Kabul. When the  hijackers sent their demands to the government of Pakistan, it  was learned that they were members of the al-Zulfiqar terrorist  organization, whose leader was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's son,  Murtaza Bhutto. This plane was in the hijackers' control for 13  days, and 54 persons were released from jail, as per the demands  of the hijackers, and sent to Damascus. There were only three  hijackers. These included Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, and  Arshad Ali. In an interview with international media, Murtaza  Bhutto admitted that Salam Allah Tipu was his man. Murtaza  Bhutto was in continued contact with the hijackers, who were  following his instructions. Hijacker Tipu, at Murtaza's  instruction, shot Major Tariq Rahim in the neck at Murtaza  Bhutto's command and threw his body out of the airplane onto the  runway. He later sent a message to the control tower to pick up  Tariq Rahim's body. An important member of the hijacked plane's  crew said that he still trembles when thinking about this  hijacking incident. He also said that it seemed that the Kabul  government was supporting the hijackers fully. Otherwise, it  would not have been possible to have control of the hijackers  for such a long time. The PIA hijacking was registered as FIR  211-81 on 2 March 1981 under 120-B, 364,302,109 PPC at Crime  Circle I. In this case, Malik Ayub, son of PPI Manager Malik  Ghulam Sarwar; Saif Allah Khalid; Isa Baloch; and Nasir Baloch  were arrested while Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali,  Murtaza Bhutto, and Shah Nawaz Bhutto were declared absconding.  The four persons listed above were given death sentences, which  were later changed to 25 years of hard labor after their  appeals. Later, Malik Ayub's father, Sarwar, and Saif Allah's  father, Mohammed Ali Johar, managed to contact Ziaul Haq. They  managed to get a pardon from him. However, Nasir Baloch refused  to ask for any kind of pardon, and he was sentenced to be hanged.    The notorious al-Zulfiqar terrorists, Salam Allah Tipu and  Nasir Jamal, and Arshad Ali were accused of murdering a Jamia  Karachi student and member of Islamic Jamiat-i tulba, Hafiz  Mohammed Aslam, six days before they hijacked the plane. This  report was registered under FIR 47-8, Explosion Act, case number  302-34 PPC 3-5, at Gulshan Iqbal Police Station. Tipu himself  has admitted to murdering Aslam while talking from the control  tower. The same day (26 February 1991), these three people were  also involved in a robbery in the Bahadarabad region. This  robbery was reported under FIR 35-81 as case number 17 (3) (EHO)  at the Bahadarabad Police Station.    The terrorists of al-Zulfiqar also robbed a showroom on  University Road in New Town on 13 November 1980. Saif Allah  Khalid, Hanif Patel, Mohammed Tariq Cheena, and Salam Allah Tipu  were all involved. This was registered in the New Town Police  Station as case number 17 (3) (EHO), under FIR 43-80.    On 19 March 1981, the New Town police arrested Saif Allah  Khalid at Crescent Motors on University Road and registered case  number FIR 81-54 under 307-33-34 PPC.    On 30 November 1980, Saif Allah Khalid, Hanif Patel, and  Salam Allah Tipu were involved in a robbery and theft of a  government rifle, and the case was registered under 17 (3)  (EHO), case number FIR 534-80. They were arrested and were  sentenced in a military court. Similarly, a sub-machine gun with  60 cartridges was recovered from another al-Zulfiqar terrorist,  named Islamuddin, on 24 April 1982. This case was registered as  FIR 222-82, under Article 13D, at the Liaqatabad Police Station.    On 20 November 1981, the police received information about a  flat in the federal capital area, stating that some al-Zulfiqar  terrorists were hiding there. The police raided the flat the  terrorists fired at the police resulting in the death of one  police officer, Aslam Kiani, and one terrorist, Lala Asad.  Rukhshar Qureshi was arrested. This case was registered as  568/81 under 302/224/225/218 Penal Codes at the Liaqatabad  Police Station. Later, these terrorists were sentenced in the  Military Court.    On 14 November 1980, al-Zulfiqar terrorists Saif Allah  Khalid, Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali, and Hanif  Patel seized a government car, tag number GT 1877, from one Dr.  Yusuf, and used it in a robbery incident. The case was  registered as FIR 125/80 under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the  Gulshan Iqbal Police Station.    Accused Saif Allah Khalid and hijacker Arshad Ali joined  Lala  Asad and Lala Aslam in robbing a showroom at gunpoint on Sharah  Qaideen on 14 February 1981. This case was registered as 59/81  under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the Ferozabad Police Station.    Murtaza Bhutto has also admitted to murdering Zahurulhasan  Bhopali. Ayaz Samon, Ilias Saddiqi, and Javed Malik were also  involved in this murder. Ayaz Samon was later hanged, while  Ilias Saddiqi was killed on site by his friend's bullets. This  case was registered at the Ferozabad Police Station. The police  personnel at Brigade arrested an important PPP leader, Masrur  Ahsan, and recovered proof of anti-national activities from his  person.    Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Aftab Ahmed Meman, was  arrested by the Gulbarg police, and weapons were recovered from  him. He admitted before a magistrate that he was a member of  al-Zulfiqar, and that he was given the responsibility of  assassinating an important person. He said that he was arrested  before he could do his job. This case was registered at the  Gulbarg Police Station as FIR 330/81, under 13 D Penal Code.    Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Ghulam Mustafa, was arrested  by Quetta's Crime Branch Police at the border when he entered  Pakistan from Afghanistan. He was presented before a magistrate  first class, where he admitted that he was an active member of  al-Zulfiqar and had returned after involvement in some  subversive activities in Kabul.    The story of al-Zulfiqar's terrorist activity is very long  and scary. Now that the leader of this terrorist organization  has returned to Pakistan, the government and other forces should  make sure that these terrorists are punished, and that they do  not find ways to avoid punishment. The details of the terrorist  activities of al-Zulfiqar given above were gleaned from a report  at the Ferozabad Police Station. Murtaza Bhutto has admitted to  more than one terrorist act staged by his organization,  al-Zulfiqar. It was learned after the arrests of most of the  members of his organization that Murtaza Bhutto used to come to  Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony of his members after  they had finished training. Murtaza Bhutto, after the airplane  accident in which General Ziaul Haq was killed, admitted in an  interview with international news media that he had attacked  Ziaul Haq six times, all without success.  <H6>  List of Hijackers Involved in PIA Hijacking on 2 March 1981 </H6>   The following suspects are living abroad and are sought by  inspector general of police, Sindh on their return to Pakistan.    1.

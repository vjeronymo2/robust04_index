			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMITTEE REJECTS LAND SALE  </P> <P> The Assembly Transportation Committee on Monday narrowly rejected a proposal to  allow the city of Hawthorne to purchase for $2,000 surplus state-owned land  that the state Department of Transportation figures is worth about $4.4  million.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) failed on an 8-5 vote, one short of the  nine required, to gain approval for his legislation. The committee, however,  agreed to reconsider the legislation at a later hearing.  </P> <P> Hawthorne has sought for the past six years to purchase the vacant property,  two narrow parcels along Glasgow Place, next to the San Diego Freeway near  Rosecrans Avenue, and turn it into parks and parking areas. City officials said  the land, near the Holly Glen neighborhood, is zoned for open space and is not  suitable for development, partly because of its proximity to the freeway.  </P> <P> The Department of Transportation opposed the bill, maintaining that state law  requires Caltrans to sell land at fair market value. Caltrans officials said  the land could be sold for about $4.4 million and developed for residential and  commercial purposes.  </P></p>

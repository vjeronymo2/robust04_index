			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P>  HALIM OPENS SERIES  </P> <P> To close the first day of activity at the UCLA Piano Festival and Competition,  Eduardus Halim, a winner of the Young Concert Artists International Auditions,  made his Southland debut Saturday evening in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium. His  playing, alas, fell far short of expectations.  </P> <P> In the all-Romantic program leaning heavily on transcriptions, the  Indonesian-born pianist brought splash and glitter but little depth to his  playing. He over-pedaled almost constantly, and as a result delivered unfocused  performances almost devoid of detail. While he dispatched an impressive array  of notes, his playing so lacked clarity that it became the musical equivalent  of the din at a very large, very loud party.  </P> <P> Not all of Halim's playing was loud: The 28-year-old Juilliard graduate did  display a remarkably wide dynamic range. But there was little shape to his  playing, and he appeared to have no concept of how to shape a melodic line.  </P> <P> Most successful was Schumann's "Humoreske", Opus 20 (the only  non-transcription), where Halim capitalized on the work's myriad contrasts. His  playing, however, exuded no discernible spontaneity.  </P> <P> The Liszt transcriptions that made up the second half -- and the encore --  received flashy, often bombastic and entirely superficial performances. The  pianist showed a capacity for fast finger-work, but rhythmic unevenness and  technical errors detracted. The university's Steinway, moreover, sounded overly  bright.  </P> <P> Halim opened with murky readings of three Bach/Busoni chorale preludes.TERRY  McQUILKIN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 KYODO -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  repeated his opposition Monday [27 June] to international  pressure to improve human rights, calling such activities an  interference in China's internal affairs.    During a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the first  implementation of the "five principles of peaceful coexistence"  in foreign affairs, the Chinese premier said China would  continue to oppose interference in its internal affairs "under  the pretext of human rights."    "The affairs of a country should be managed by its own  people  who have every right to choose their own social system and  course of development suited to their national conditions," Li  told a gathering of foreign emissaries at the Great Hall of the  People.    But the premier added "developed countries have the  responsibility to help the underdeveloped ones shake off  poverty" and blamed an "irrational international economic order  and exchange of unequal values" for the difficulties developing  countries face.    Li said more funds, technology transfers and favorable  economic policies from developed countries would lead to  economic growth and social stability in the developing world.    The five principles are "mutual respect for sovereignty and  territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in  each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and  peaceful coexistence," Li said.    The principles were first implemented in 1944 in joint  statements issued by India, Myanmar [Burma] and China.    They have been China's unilateral guiding principle in  foreign affairs ever since.</p>

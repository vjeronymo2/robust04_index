			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ciga stock to resume trading SHAREHOLDERS in Ciga, the troubled Italian luxury hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan, will today have the chance to indicate for the first time their reaction to this week's announcement of a L700bn (Dollars 425m) capital increase and restructuring plan. Under an unprecedented ruling by the Consob stock market and companies watchdog, shares in Ciga can now only be traded once a week, on Fridays. The ruling followed a long period of suspension and almost normal trading last week. The new rescue plan, prepared by Mediobanca, involves the injection of fresh capital, a partial moratorium on interest payments and the conversion of some bank debt into equity. The new cash will come from Forte, the UK hotels group, which will contribute L80bn in liquidity and also L300bn in the form of Italian hotel assets. Further details are expected to emerge after a Ciga board meeting early next month. Ciga warned this week that if the proposals, which have received a hostile reception from some creditor banks, are not accepted at a special shareholders meeting on January 20, it might have to go into temporary receivership. Italian bank creditors, which have lent more than L1,000bn to the loss-making group, are expected to approve the proposal. However, foreign creditors, particularly those which have lent to Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company which controls Ciga, have been more hostile. Barclays, a lender to both Ciga and Fimpar, recently came out strongly against the plan. Opponents claim counter-offers by other hotel groups, such as an expression of interest from the US Hyatt group, have not been adequately considered by Mediobanca.</p>

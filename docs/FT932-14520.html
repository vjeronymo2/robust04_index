			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Fiat may co-operate with Milan magistrates ITALY'S political corruption scandal is poised to take a dramatic new turn, with signs of an agreement by Fiat, the country's biggest private-sector company, to co-operate voluntarily with Milan magistrates. The accord, hammered out between magistrates and the group's lawyers at a lengthy weekend meeting, could see Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, testifying before magistrates this week. This represents a climbdown by Fiat, which has been increasingly implicated in allegations of bribes over public-sector orders. At least seven senior executives have become embroiled in the investigations, including Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief operating officer and chief financial officer respectively. Before the weekend agreement, magistrates appeared poised to issue a stream of further cautionary warrants, including some for unspecified Fiat managers. It is believed the warrants, covering contracts for the Enel state electricity generating authority and the state railways, have been temporarily rescinded. Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, admitted at the weekend his company's involvement in doubtful practices. He told a conference of the Confindustria employers' federation in Venice: 'At Fiat, too, some episodes of incorrect mixing with the political system have been discovered.' However, Mr Agnelli tried to draw a distinction between individuals and companies drawn into the corruption scandal: 'It is desirable that the inquiries should define as soon as possible the real significance of the episodes concerning us or other companies, and distinguish between those who have been serious industrialists and those, by contrast, who have based their fortunes almost exclusively on systematic collusion with the politicians. 'Fiat's heart is that of a company commited to free and strong competition in the marketplace.' It remains to be seen how Fiat will co-operate with magistrates. The inquiries have touched four areas of its activities: construction, with investigations of the Cogefar-Impresit building arm; railway equipment, notably for the new Milan metro line; gas turbines, with allegations of bribes to politicians on Enel orders; and buses, where the group's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary is being probed for alleged payments for orders from the city of Milan.</p>

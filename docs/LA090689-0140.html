			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LOGGING OKD DESPITE OWL CONCERNS  </P> <P> A federal appeals court today opened the gates to logging of 500 million board  feet of timber on Bureau of Land Management land in western Oregon despite a  desperate fight by environmentalists claiming spotted owls would be endangered.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had barred logging within two miles of  known nesting sites of the northern spotted owl while the appeal was pending.  </P> <P> The unanimous three-judge panel ruled today that a congressional rider attached  to an appropriations bill by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) in 1987 precluded  environmentalists from challenging authorized timber sales on the basis of  claims that new information showed impacts to wildlife.  </P></p>

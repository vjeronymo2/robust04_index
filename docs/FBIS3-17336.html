			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Ivanov report from St. Petersburg under the </F> "Money" rubric: "St. Petersburg's Budget Approved Without City  Assembly. City Treasury's Expenditures To Exceed Revenues for  the First Time"]    [Text] The St. Petersburg government has hastily approved  the city's budget for 1994. It is planned that the city  budget's annual revenues will be 2,116,772,000,000 rubles [R]  and expenditures will amount to R3,607,993,000,000 in 1 February  1994 prices. Hence, city hall has envisioned for 1994 a budget  deficit of nearly R1.5 trillion.    It is expected that social spending will account for 40  percent of budget expenditures, nearly the same share as the  maintenance of the municipal infrastructure. The maintenance of  government authorities will require 1.5 percent of the entire  budget expenditures. Another 14 percent of St. Petersburg's  budget appropriations will be channeled to finance investment  projects. The share of expenditures on the municipal  infrastructure will rise 1.5 percent, that of social and  cultural spending will be up 0.5 percent. According to city  hall, the maintenance of government authorities will be less  costly for the city's taxpayers -- specialists from the  financial committee managed to reduce the share of expenditures  on the maintenance of bureaucrats by 0.1 percent.    According to assessments by city hall's financial committee  specialists, implementing the budget approved by the city  government will be a hard task. By comparison with other  Russian Federation components, St. Petersburg's overly  cumbersome economy, prone to inertia, is impeding the city's  transfer to new principles of budget formation, but city hall  expects to cope with the problem.</p>

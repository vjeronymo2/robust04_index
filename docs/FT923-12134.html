The bank, mainly owned by Saudi shareholders, said it set aside no funds for provisions in the first six months of 1992, against SR46m in the same period a year ago. Net profit for the first half of 1990 was SR247.71m. Total assets climbed to SR48.94bn in the first half of this year, from SR42.84bn a year earlier. Deposits rose to SR26.05bn from SR24.74bn. Operating income fell to SR1.69bn from SR1.74bn. The bank offered 8m shares worth SR3.8bn to the Saudi public in January in the biggest flotation in the kingdom's history. The share offering, which boosted paid-in capital tenfold to SR2bn, was more than three times oversubscribed.</p>

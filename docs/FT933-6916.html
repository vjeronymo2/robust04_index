			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / BAe computer staff to strike over jobs threat A SECTION of staff in the military aircraft division of British Aerospace will tomorrow stage a one-day strike in Lancashire against what unions say are plans to 'sell their jobs' to one of three US companies. The strike, which will involve about 450 computer and information technology specialists and other staff, will affect factories in Warton, Preston and Samlesbury where BAe makes the Tornado ground attack bomber, the Hawk jet trainer and parts of EFA, the European Fighter Aircraft. The Manufacturing Science and Finance white-collar union said yesterday that BAe wants to 'outsource' up to Pounds 250m of information technology work. The union claimed this would remove the company's ability to control its own information technology systems and pose a threat to national security. Mr Frank Coulton, chairman of the MSF branch for the three factories, claimed secrets of military aircraft design and know-how would be given to a foreign company, even if the US was an ally. MPs sponsored by MSF and GMB/Apex, another union involved, are to raise the issue with the government. Outsourcing - where a company contracts out formerly in-house services  - has been growing in the recession, with computer bureaux offering economies of scale and savings in functions such as warehouse management, stock control, invoicing and debt collection. The work usually involves large numbers of small transactions. BAe said investigations on outsourcing had been under way for several months as a part of a general review of efficiency and cost reductions, but no decision had been made. It said detailed tenders for the work had been sought from an IBM-DEC consortium, Computer Science Corporation, and EDS-Scicon. All three bidders are US companies. BAe declined to say what work would be involved, but MSF said its negotiations with BAe suggested it was all mainframe computer activity, including some computer-aided design and manufacture, as well as routine clerical and management systems. BAe workers would be transferred to the contractor if any outsourcing is agreed. Mr Coulton said: 'They are trying to sell people and their know-how. We refuse to be sold. 'Our members have voted 11 to one to show their feelings with this one-day strike. We felt we had to act before a formal offer on outsourcing was put to us. Once the company has decided to do it, it would be difficult to make management change its mind, and much tougher industrial action would be needed.' BAe said the outsourcing investigations did not involve Rover cars or the group's construction business, only aerospace. About 15 factories would be involved throughout Britain. Exact numbers were 'imprecise' because no decision had been taken on what exactly might be outsourced, but MSF said about 2,000 jobs would be affected. The Lancashire factories - established in the second world war beyond the range of German bombers - employ about 11,000, about 3,000 of whom are MSF members, working in range of high-technology professions and trades.</p>

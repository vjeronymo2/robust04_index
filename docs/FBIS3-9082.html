A total of five million  pounds will be provided now and seven million pounds later,  Major said.    The Bosnian Government has estimated the cost of  reconstructing Sarajevo at 3.1 billion dollars.    Major, in Sarajevo Friday for talks with Bosnian  Vice-President Ejup Ganic and the British commander of UN troops  in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, briefly toured a  water pumping station in the city and visited a position held by  a Scottish contingent of UN troops. On his arrival in Sarajevo  from the central Bosnian town of Vitez, the headquarters of the  British contingent in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), Major  vaunted the "chance for peace" in the region and said more UN  troops would be needed soon to monitor the emerging ceasefires.  He later left the city by helicopter to return to the southern  Croatian port of Split, before returning to London.</p>

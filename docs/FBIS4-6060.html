			<p>BFN     [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 16 (AFP) -- Armoured  vehicles and thousands of police and military officials were  deployed Saturday in Medan, North Sumatra, one day after labour  protests turned into ethnic violence against the Chinese  minority, a military official said.    "Four batallions of police and military officials remain on  alert here in anticipation of anti-ethnic-Chinese  demonstrations," Medan Military District Commander Lieutenant  Colonel Agus Ramadan told journalists.    This adds up to about 2,600 security personnel.    "The demonstrations might peak on Monday or Tuesday,"  Ramadan  said.    Tens of thousands of workers staged demonstrations in Medan  Thursday and Friday, demanding an investigation into the  suspicious death of one of their colleagues last month.    The battered body of Rusli, a worker of Rubber industry PT  Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he  had led a workers protest in March. But officials did not  investigate his death.    Workers also asked for better conditions and higher wages,  as  well as the right to organize in independent labour trade  unions. The government only recognizes the official All  Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI).    Violence erupted on Friday when security forces tried to  stop  the demonstration, which was heading to downtown Medan.    Some angry demonstrators then pelted shops, factories and  vehicles, witnesses said. The violence appeared aimed at ethnic  Chinese, who are often the target of jealously because of their  general economic success.    An estimated 40 to 50 shophouses and six cars were burnt, at  least 150 shops and houses were destroyed, sources told AFP.    Ramadan confirmed one ethnic-Chinese businessman identified  as Juli Kristanto, or known under the Chinese name Wok Joe Lip,  53, was killed Friday, but declined to give details.    Ramadan said that 120 people were a.nested for their alleged  involvement in vandalism, murder and arson.    On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw nine armoured vehicles  parking along the main residential areas inhabited by many  ethnic Chinese. A journalist of Medan-based WASPADA daily said  by telephone that dozens of other armoured vehicles were  deployed on the suburban areas.    Most of the shops, private banks, private ethnic-Chinese  schools were closed in that city of 1.5 million, whose ethnic  Chinese community makes up one third of the population.    Lieutenant Colonel Ramadan said that the anti-ethnic-Chinese  demonstration was prompted by workers' dissatisfaction over the  annual bonus which was given before the Muslim celebration of  Idul Fitri in March. There was also news of a  430-million-dollar scam at a state bank involving ethnic Chinese  businessman Eddy Tansil.    Demonstrators also protested against the involvement of the  military in labour disputes, the chairman of the independent  Jakarta-based Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), Mukhtar Pakpahan,  told a press conference Saturday.    SBSI, insisting the strike should be the last option for  workers, was behind the first strike on Thursday, Pakpahan said.  But, he added, "other parties have made use of the situation  the following day, creating chaos and violent demonstrations."    Pakpahan called on the government to stop using security  measures as away of dealing with labour.    "SBSI urges the government not to use the security approach  and [word indistinct] actions to handle strikes," Pakpahan said.</p>

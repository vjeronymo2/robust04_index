			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / State of the Art: The verbiage of creativity that is. . .mad, bad and dangerouse to use - Words, words, words] / In the current buzz-words pertaining to the arts, 'post-modernist' could well be classed as jokey, backward looking or - amazingly - just plain original FOR AS LONG as anybody can remember, buzz-words have cropped up in art-critical chat and then, sooner rather than later, faded ineluctably away. Remember 'plastic', from Goethe to Ruskin - or in musical commentaries 'serialist', from the original Schoenberg school until the time when the composer Berio remarked candidly, 'You can 'serialise' anything]' Since ours is not a time of consistent, well-defined fashions or methods in the creative arts, the critical buzz-words are prudently high-level: structuralist or post-structuralist, modernist and post-modernist and deconstructionist. Those terms are not much of any kind of muchness, for they have been hijacked from quite different areas of discourse. Even in their original homes, they were never sharply defined. But at the outset, certainly, the first two and the last named critical methods or stances, especially in Lit. Crit.; whereas the other pair came into current play as labels for artifacts inspired by special artistic persuasions (usually combative), much like 'pre-Raphaelite' or 'Parnassian'. 'Structuralist' is easy enough, though still wonky. The great French linguist Ferdinand de Saussure had propounded a deep distinction between la parole and la langue: what we actually say, and the language-system that makes it possible for us to say it. Like the American linguist Chomsky later, he argued that when we tell each other things we must trade constantly upon language-structures, unaware of them though we generally are. When the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss began to discern plausible deep 'structures' in human conduct, too (though of quite different kinds, to some sceptical eyes) 'structuralist' analysis became a vogue. The idea was that there were real hidden structures in human doings that could be illuminatingly winkled out, through close observation, and described. And if in communal language and social practices, surely also - more idiosyncratic, of course, and more defensively concealed - in novels, plays, poems, films? What a 'structuralist' novel or play might be, however, is anybody's guess, when every art-work is supposed to embody unadmitted structures. Some critics use the word as if it were synonymous with the old-fashioned 'formalist' (damaging in Stalinist times), something like '(too) consciously concerned with formal proportions and markers'; or again, to report telltale echoes of the infinitely self-aware, ironical litterateur Roland Barthes, or of the 'structuralist' psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's sweeping presumptions. 'Post-structuralist' is easier, at least on the critical side. The post-structuralist French critics were the ones who suspected that all those grand, hidden 'structures' in talk, life and literature were generated merely by the structuralists' rhetoric itself. Jacques Derrida has led the attack by subjecting structuralist metaphors and rhetorical tropes to reductive analysis: 'deconstructing' their metaphysical constructions, exposing their self-justifying formulas. On his procedure any text, whether expressly 'creative' or just critical, is to be read - never interpreted] - purely through its own literal terms, treated as hermetic. Any supposed authorial intentions are irrelevant (authors are notoriously bad witnesses for those), and so is any assumed historical or social context. A text is just an ecrit but it can display a unique ecriture - suggestive fingerprints, ways of putting things, a betraying concern with certain kinds of detail - which may reward examination (ie prompt some new texts, subject to all the same reservations). Nonetheless it is its own sole witness, and it is never really 'about' anything else at all. Once more, we know what a deconstructionist analysis will look like, but not a 'deconstructionist' art-work. Again a provocative term has done a sideslip: a work of fiction that deliberately flaunts its scaffolding, or a visual piece with a knowing commentary attached, may now be called 'deconstructionist' - though such devices go back a long way before structuralism or deconstructionism. Initially 'modernism' and 'post-modernism' were more straightforward, at least (and maybe at most) as terms for postwar British architectural aspirations. A Modernist architect hereabouts is austerely concerned with self-contained form and actual function, eschewing all 'traditional' echoes except where they have a rightful contemporary application (though he or she probably harbours great respect for the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier). A post-modernist is happy to play around, arguing that buildings should be fun in up-to-date terms, whether those prompt neon glitz, eclectic pastiche - as long as it comes in inverted commas - or pure one-off whimsy (TV-AM's giant eggcups in Camden Town). In other countries, however, such architectural divisions were never so clearcut; and in the other arts any modernist/post-modernist distinction is a matter of intuitive freehand sketching (though American Lit. Crit. has, I believe, its own peculiar canons for assigning poetry and criticism to one camp or the other). To count as 'post-modernist' it may be enough to be inconsequently jokey, or knowingly backward-looking - or just plain original, highly unlikely as that will always be.</p>

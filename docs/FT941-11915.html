			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US plans crackdown over financial services The Clinton administration yesterday said the open US financial services market should no longer be 'free' to countries which do not give 'fair treatment' to US banking and securities firms overseas. Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, told a House banking subcommittee the administration would support the proposed Fair Trade in Financial Services Act and use it to supplement efforts to open markets in the Uruguay Round and the Japan negotiating framework talks. 'The US does not intend to target under this legislation existing operations of foreign companies established within the US,' he said. 'We believe that any policy should be focused on limiting access to new firms or new opportunities.' An opening of the Japanese huge financial services markets is of particular importance to the expansion and global competitiveness of US firms. The administration wants the treasury secretary to be able to grant market access to individual companies. The act will be used to complement US multilateral, bilateral and regional efforts to gain access to foreign markets on equal terms with domestic firms.</p>

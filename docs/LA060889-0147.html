			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: SOUTHLAND'S TRACK DOMINANCE CONTINUES  </P> <P> The dominance of Los Angeles City and Southern Section athletes was illustrated  in last weekend's State high school track and field meet at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Athletes from these two sections won 18 of the 31 boys' and girls' events, and  finished second in 13. In team competition, Southland teams Hawthorne and  Dorsey went 1-2 in the boys' competition, and winner Pasadena Muir finished  just ahead of Oxnard Rio Mesa in the girls' competition.  </P> <P> With his most recent title, Hawthorne Coach Kye Courtney tied the state  coaching record for team championships with seven, and moved into the top spot  in the boys'-only category with his sixth title.  </P> <P> And Courtney has a strong group of runners returning, among them three from the  record-breaking 400-meter relay team. The Cougars ran a state-record 40.24  seconds in a preliminary heat Friday night but finished second in the final,  then were disqualified for an illegal baton pass.  </P> <P> The leadoff runner, junior Chris Alexander, who also plays tailback on the  football team, finished fifth in the 100 meters, running 10.68, and also was  impressive on the 1,600-meter relay team, which also finished second.  </P> <P> Multi-talented junior Anthony Smith, who ran the second leg of the 400,  finished fifth in the long jump, with a leap of 23 feet 11 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> The Cougars' third runner, sophomore Erik Allen, was the surprise of the  season, finishing fourth in the 200 meters in 21.53.  </P> <P> The bad news for Courtney is that anchor Curtis Conway is graduating.  </P> <P> Conway, who will be at USC on a football scholarship in the fall, has been a  mainstay for the Cougars since his freshman year, reaching the state meet each  season.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Conway finished his prep career by running personal bests in every  event he competed in.  </P> <P> In winning the 100 meters, Conway had to recover from a slow start and catch  Barry Smith of San Francisco Mission, who had set a state record in his heat  Friday. The victory was Conway's first individual state title and his time of  10.42, just missed Smith's record of 10.41.  </P> <P> "I was real emotional after that race, probably the most I have ever been,"  Conway said. "I knew it was my last high school 100 meters and that I had  finally achieved what I had been working for all of these years."  </P> <P> In the 200 meters, another slow start cost Conway, and he finished second to  Smith, who ran the second-fastest time in the country this season, 20.89.  </P> <P> Conway also ran impressive legs on the Cougars' two losing relay teams.  </P> <P> In the 400-meter relay, his come-from-behind anchor run that almost caught  winner Long Beach Poly and Andre Green, went to waste because of the  disqualification.  </P> <P> And in Conway's last high school running event, the anchor leg of the  1,600-meter relay, he could not catch Dorsey's Beno Bryant, his former Junior  All-American football teammate.  </P> <P> Bryant ran a smart race in protecting Dorsey's 10-meter lead, making Conway run  hard to close the gap to four meters and then pulling away in the last 100  meters. For Bryant, the City 400-meter record-holder, the victory finished a  perfect night.  </P> <P> Despite a groin pull, which prevented him from running on the Dons' third-place  400-meter relay team, Bryant won the individual 400 meters in 47.52 and was  timed at 46.3 on the anchor leg of the 1,600 relay.  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Muir Coach Jim Brownfield also has a young but  experienced team returning.  </P> <P> Leading the way for the Mustangs figures to be junior sensation Inger Miller,  who finished second to Rio Mesa senior Angela Burnham, the two-time defending  state sprint champion, in the 100 and 200 meters.  </P> <P> Miller also anchored both senior-less relay teams, which won the 400 and  finished second in the 1,600.  </P> <P> Also returning will be sophomore Taminika Terry, who contributed with a  fifth-place finish in the 200.  </P> <P> There will also be several individual state champions returning at other  schools.  </P> <P> Junior Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica won the 100-meter low hurdles with a  wind-aided time of 13.69. She also finished sixth in the 100 meters in 12.04.  </P> <P> Junior Kim Toney of Atascadero won the 800-meter title, defeating defending  champion Kathi Roldan of Visalia Mt. Whitney, with a time of 2:09.33, second  best in the country this season.  </P> <P> Sophomore jumper Juliana Yendork of Walnut won both the long and triple jumps,  with leaps of 20-2 1/2 and 41-10, respectively. In the preliminaries Friday,  she went 42-6 3/4 in the triple jump, which made her the third-best prep  performer on record.  </P> <P> Freshman Twila Sims of Lompoc gave a preview of her potential in the 300-meter  low hurdles, winning in a national-best time of 42.54. It was the fastest time  ever run by a freshman.  </P> <P> In the City baseball finals last Thursday night at Dodger Stadium, Kennedy of  Granada Hills kept alive the San Fernando Valley's streak of 4-A Division  championships.  </P> <P> Kennedy's 4-3 victory over Palisades, gave the Valley its 17th consecutive City  title. Most of the players on either team were not even born when Venice, the  last non-Valley winner, won the title in 1972.  </P> <P> In the 3-A Division, Franklin defeated Bell, 3-2, in eight innings, thanks to  its football team.  </P> <P> Franklin baseball Coach Rick Campbell credited the seven players who had played  on the Panthers' football team for his team's winning attitude.  </P> <P> "They played on this year's undefeated regular-season football team and on both  City championship teams," Campbell said. "They just know what it takes to win."  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Other Southland state track and field champions: Mark Wilson of Covina Charter  Oak, who won the high jump with a leap of 7 feet; Angela Rolfe of Dorsey, who  won her third consecutive 400-meter title in the country's fastest time this  season, 53.97, and Rayna Cervantes of Montebello, who won the 3,200 meters in  10:32.95.  </P></p>

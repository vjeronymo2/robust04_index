His performance clearly delighted the many campaigners in Bonn trying to get German promoted to a full working language in Brussels. If it's true that Sir Leon has ambitions to succeed Jacques Delors at the top of the Commission, then his tour-de-force in front of Chancellor Helmut Kohl can't have done him any harm.</p>

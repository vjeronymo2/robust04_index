			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Yugoslav dissident Milovan Djilas by </F> Alessandro Curzi; place and date not given: "After Bosnia  Anything Goes"]    [Text] [Curzi] You recently talked about three kinds of  fascism -- the Serbian, the Croatian, and the Muslim -- and  about the threats of contagion to huge areas of our continent,  our Europe. But Europe seems to be distracted, concerned solely  with its many various forms of selfishness. A strong right-wing  tide exists in many countries. In Italy there has been talk  about changing, shifting our country's borders eastward. What  would you like to say to the Italian people now, in this  situation?    [Djilas] I said there is a typically Balkan kind of fascism  that I consider worse than the Mediterranean fascism, because it  is full of racist elements. And it is racism not against  colored people but against neighbors, similar people. More  precisely, they do not embrace fascist ideology, but they use  fascist methods. Of course, the protracted war in Bosnia and  the existence of the methods I mentioned encourage the Right  throughout Europe. Today the Right is enjoying a definite  recovery almost everywhere, and especially in central Europe,  France, and Germany. With regard to the question of borders,  though I do not presume to give any advice or issue any  messages, I would tell the Italian people that any change in  this regard could have unimaginable and even catastrophic  consequences for Italy.    [Curzi] In the former Soviet empire people seem already  tired  of post-communism -- especially in Poland and Hungary. The  leader of the Right, a member of the Hungarian parliament, told  me that there is no longer any fear of communism. What do you  think motivates those people? What options will be taken in the  years ahead?    [Djilas] There are many factors that influenced those  elections. The countries that experienced the socialist  revolution, such as Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, now have  the greatest difficulties -- more so than the countries that  were under the domination of the Soviet Union itself. These  difficulties are due above all to these countries' ethnic  structure; and let us not forget that the Soviet Union, now  Russia, had strong imperialist tendencies. It will take a long  time to overcome these tendencies; there must be a different  kind of society that does not need imperialism. Russian society  has not yet reached this stage of development; it is still a  bureaucratic society with major problems regarding social  changes. As for Hungary and Poland, the Left was victorious,  but they are not Stalinist communists. The victory was won by  reformist communists and young people who want freedom and  social justice. Communism is a great movement that has always  embodied different currents, but with the victory of Stalinism  all these currents were eliminated, destroyed. We can say that  Lenin's communism will never return, or will only return with  minority groups. These groups exist in Serbia too, but they do  not have a major political role. So the victory in Hungary and  Poland can be explained in terms of those peoples' desire to  salvage and develop certain values that existed during the  communist era and that could be destroyed by a sudden transition  to capitalism. This is the most important reason. Also, the  parties of the Right and center have not proposed anything new;  indeed, their ideas date back to the period before World War II.  However, new ideas have been put forward by the Polish and  Hungarian socialists. I believe that what happened in Hungary  and Poland is a good thing because it tends toward democracy and  free trade.    [Curzi] I would like to ask you another question, concerning  ideology. Is it possible, on the eve of the year 2000, to still  have hope in your ideals, the ideals of a socialism with a human  face that will truly bring democracy throughout Europe and  throughout the world?    [Djilas] The ideals of democratic socialism have never been  formulated in a determined manner. I spoke in general terms,  that is, I am in favor of democracy -- but the kind in which  social problems are resolved. I believe that in Scandinavia  they have been fairly successful in this, but we must not  underestimate what has been done in the past 50 years in  Germany, France, and Italy in the field of social affairs --  health, the right to education, and so forth. We live in Europe  or, rather, "you" live in Europe, and I live here in Yugoslavia,  where there is war; whereas in Europe nobody's life is in  danger, nobody dies of starvation, and nobody is homeless or  unable to study. Europe today is ideologically almost entirely  social democratic, which means that the threat from the Right is  even greater and that, unless we halt it, the consequences could  be tragic. It is necessary to halt the right-wing extremists,  who are opposed to the parliamentary system or in favor of  limiting social rights.    [Curzi] With regard to the terrible war that is devastating  the former Yugoslavia, what responsibilities does the West bear;  what should Europe and the United Nations in particular do to  resolve the problem and to initiate a peace that will be truly  honored by the tormented peoples of the former Yugoslavia?    [Djilas] The war in Bosnia has prompted -- or, rather,  revealed an internal crisis that already existed. The West's  failure to respond brought about an extraordinary situation:  After Bosnia anything goes. It is enough to be strong and to  have a little political circumspection, and anything is  possible. The international laws that govern conflicts and  relations between states and peoples no longer apply. So unless  order, by which I mean international order, is restored, the  entire system on which all the Western values were built will  continue to crumble. Nobody wants to do anything concrete.    [Curzi] I would like to ask you a personal question. Could  you tell me a happy memory and a sad memory from your life? Let  us start with the sad one, so that we can end this interview on  a hopeful note.    [Djilas] My most tragic memory -- not even bad, but tragic  --  was the death of my wife last summer. Throughout the years of  persecution, isolation, and my son's exile, we became a single  person. That was the most difficult moment in my whole life.  My worst memory concerns my conduct when my case was discussed  by the Central Committee. Indeed, it was very different from  how I would have liked.    I recovered very quickly, but I had to pay for my mistake.  That is how it is. If you are consistent and believe -- and I  have always believed in communism -- you have to first throw  yourself into the mire and then if you can, you stand up again  and continue. As for my fondest memory, it is difficult to say.  I think it has to do with my son, who spent 10 years in exile  -- our meetings and then at last his return to Yugoslavia. I  really think those were the most beautiful moments of my life.  But I do not think that my life has been difficult or tragic.  I chose my destiny. I decided everything, or almost  everything. Of course, nobody can decide everything: I was  also subject to conditions. Be that as it may, I made my  decisions, and when you decide on your own, it is not easy.</p>

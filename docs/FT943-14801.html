			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / China 'may be third' in defence spending China spends twice as much on defence as it admits and may lag behind only the US and Russia in total defence outlays, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based defence think-tank. It believed China's defence budget this year was worth about Yn100bn (Pounds 7.5bn), nearly twice the Yn52bn Beijing said it planned to spend. The extra funding came from other parts of the state budget and the military's commercial activities, the IISS added. Depending on the method used to establish the 'purchasing power parity' of China's defence spending, the country's current spending equalled between Dollars 28.5bn and Dollars 45bn (Pounds 18.2bn-Pounds 28.7bn). This compared with the Dollars 6bn Beijing says it spends based on market exchange rates. The findings were presented at a conference on the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong. Even at the lower dollar end of its estimate, expenditure this year represented a sizeable military effort. In relative terms it is surpassed only by the US, Russia, Britain, France, Japan and Germany. China possesses a 'crude and lethal' nuclear war fighting capability together with 'a potentially effective conventional capability under some conditions'. The IISS reckoned Beijing would spend up to Dollars 6bn this year on strategic nuclear forces, against Dollars 50bn in the US and Dollars 2.3bn in Britain. But 'China is a nuclear power whose global reach seems only a matter of time.' It questioned if China got value for money from its defence spending, and if the inheritance of a Soviet-style defence establishment would retard development of a modern military capability. Another threat to its fighting capability is the PLA's extensive involvement in entrepreneurial activities. Prof Ellis Joffe, the leading PLA expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that over the past two years the military's involvement in business had got completely out of control. 'Traditionally the PLA has been involved in economic activity, but never on this scale and never for profit,' he said. 'No army can function properly if corruption in it is widespread.'</p>

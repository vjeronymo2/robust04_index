			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shen Haixiong (1957 3189 7169) and </F> correspondent Zhao Renchun (6392 0088 2504)]    [Text] Hangzhou, 30 May (XINHUA) -- Some Zhejiang peasant  entrepreneurs with strategic vision have worked to open up  markets in the central and western parts of the country, and the  Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and government have taken  measures to support local town and village enterprises in doing  so.    Hangzhou's Wanxiang Group has decided to appropriate 100,000  yuan for soliciting "westward-bound" strategic plans from across  the country. According to the enterprise group's  "westward-bound plan," it will invest 100 million yuan in  developing markets in central and western China. Before this,  hundreds of Zhejiang's town and village enterprises had already  established enterprises in central and western China. Xiaoshan  City's Hangmin Industrial Corporation, in the richest village in  Zhejiang, has invested 20 million yuan in the last two years to  establish a few textile dyeing factories in Henan's Zhengzhou  and other localities. The corporation's president, Zhu  Chongqing, said gaining a foothold in the central and western  parts of the country had expanded his company's markets and  added new assets to the company.    The sales of industrial products of Zhejiang's approximately  700,000 town and village enterprises total 240 billion yuan  annually, accounting for two thirds of the province's total  industrial sales and 11 percent of the total sales of the  country's town and village enterprises. The province also has  more than 280 large enterprises, each of whose annual output  value exceeds 100 million yuan and whose annual exports exceeds  30 million yuan.    An official of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Town and  Village Enterprises said: Due to lack of energy and raw and  processed materials in the province, local enterprises are  unable to get necessary resources locally. Moreover, because  the major products of local town and village enterprises are  daily consumer products, inland markets have become increasingly  important to us. According to a survey report, the petroleum,  coal, steel products, cotton, and other important materials  currently needed by Zhejiang's town and village enterprises'  production are primarily supplied from the central and western  parts of the country. And, at least more than 100 billion yuan  of the province's annual sales of industrial products comes from  central and western China.    Since the state called for promoting economic and  technological cooperation and exchange in 1993 in an organized  and planned manner between the eastern and western parts of the  country, some farsighted town and village entrepreneurs of  Zhejiang have begun to set their eyes on gaining a foothold in  the central and western regions of the country, deciding to  develop cooperation with these regions to seek common prosperity.    The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and government have  fully approved such moves by local town and village enterprises,  and quickly set up a leading group for coordinating cooperation  between local town and village enterprises and regions west of  the province, to ensure that local town and village enterprises  gain a foothold in these regions. So far, the group has  proposed to local town and village enterprises nearly 100  cooperation projects with Xinjiang, Henan, and other localities.  Cooperation on many of these projects has begun.    Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have entered the  central and western regions using three major approaches: The  first approach is by way of contracting or leasing, that is,  Zhejiang's town and village enterprises contract or lease  loss-making enterprises in central and western China and then  use their more skillful management to improve these enterprises'  economic performance. So far, at least more than 100 town and  village entrepreneurs from Zhejiang have settled down in central  and western China. After contracting to run a state-owned  Chinese medicine factory in Shanxi's Taiyuan, a peasant  entrepreneur from Zhejiang's Wenzhou boldly adopted new  management mechanisms to run the factory, enabling the  debt-ridden "long-established" enterprise to regain vitality  before long. The second approach is by way of joint business  operations, that is, Zhejiang's town and village enterprises,  making use of their better technology and management expertise  and the rich resources and lower wages in central and western  regions, establish new enterprises in these regions and sell  their products locally. The Shijia Sports Wear Company in  Zhejiang's Cixi established a factory in this way in northern  Anhui. The third approach is by way of establishing energy and  raw and processed materials bases and sales outlets in central  and western China. For instance, more than 20 town and village  enterprises in Zhejiang's Huzhou have established energy bases  in Shanxi -- a major energy-producing province -- and assisted  local enterprises to improve storage, transportation, and  processing equipment. Realizing that the country's western  region borders some Central Asian nations, many town and village  enterprises in Huzhou have jointly established trading companies  with enterprises of the region, enabling them to use border port  cities as their "jumping boards" for entering Central Asian and  European markets. The Bosaidong Garment Company in Huzhou's  Zhenxi Township was a little- known enterprise; but, since it  set up a few "trade windows" in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang last  year, its products have quickly entered East European countries,  enabling the company's per capita tax payment and profit to  reach 10,000 yuan last year.    Zhejiang's town and village entrepreneurs who have  established enterprises in the central and western parts of the  country said their opening up markets in central and western  China was an economic move based on market demand and prompted  by mutual economic benefits and that the purpose was to enable  the eastern and western parts of the country to enjoy common  prosperity through reaping common economic benefits.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moises Castillo Zeas] </F>   [Text] Matagalpa -- Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the  Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], has rejected the  Gonzalez-Helms amendment recently approved by the U.S. Congress  on the return of property to U.S. citizens in Nicaragua within  90 days.  <H5>  Santa Emilia Assembly </H5>   Ortega addressed an assembly of peasant leaders meeting at  the Santa Emilia School, 18 km north of Matagalpa, to discuss a  peasant proposal that will be presented at the FSLN special  congress to be held in Managua.    The former president said that the only way to stop this  threat is "for all Nicaraguans to join in a common front and  tell the United States that this is not feasible because it  would create greater instability in the country."  <H5>  Search for a Solution </H5>   However, Ortega added, we must find a solution to this issue  without affecting the country's interests because paying the  compensation they are requesting ($600 million) is totally  unacceptable.    The FSLN leader added that during meetings of the Superior  Council of Private Enterprise [COSEP] it has been said that the  COSEP would not agree to a policy of compensation because it  would worsen the country's economic problems.    Daniel warned that this threat will force the executive to  seek solutions. Ortega warned that "that the decision could  result in serious problems in the search for the country's  stability."  <H5>  Somoza Family Benefited </H5>   The former president stressed that these measures will  benefit the family of the late dictator Anastasio Somoza because  they are gringos "since they have requested U.S. citizenship and  will now come and claim their properties."    The Sandinist leader said that for the government to put an  end to this property issue it must recognize Laws 85, 86, and  88. He said that these are valid and legitimate laws. Ortega  recalled that the government had specialists in legal matters  brought in to review the aforementioned laws, who found these to  be flawless and thus gave their approval. Ortega added that had  the government found a flaw in these laws it would have  abolished them immediately.  <H5>  The Problem in the Countryside </H5>   Meanwhile, hundreds of peasant leaders in the northern  sector  of the country gathered at the Santa Emilia School to reach an  agreement on the problems experienced by the countryside that  will be presented at the FSLN special congress next week. At  this moment, hundreds of peasant leaders are studying various  proposals such as the legalization of property, the distribution  of agrarian deeds, financial assistance, technical assistance,  land, participation by women, and other issues that will be  discussed at a meeting scheduled for 0900 on 16 May at the Santa  Emilia School.    Jose Gonzalez, FSLN political secretary in Matagalpa, said  that the FSLN National Directorate will be present at this  peasant meeting. The meeting will also be attended by peasant  leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the UNAG [National Union  of Farmers and Cattlemen], the ATC [Farm Workers Association],  and others who can offer ideas aimed at solving the problems  encountered by the countryside.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jim Cheung] </F>   [Text] Sensitivity surrounding this week's anniversary of  the events in Tiananmen Square forced the government to refuse  entry to Chinese dissidents wanting to visit Hong Kong, Governor  Chris Patten said. He defended the government's decision to ban  two Chinese scholars--Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming--from attending  June 4 commemorative activities in Hong Kong.    Mr Patten said people should not be allowed to use the  territory to criticize what is happening elsewhere at "sensitive  moments." His comments implied that the government would  consider a further ban on Chinese dissidents during other  politically sensitive periods. "I think there is a difference  between the freedoms that we all exercise here and at sensitive  moments," he said on his return from Britain. "There are just  some moments--you know it as well--which are more sensitive than  others."    The two outspoken Chinese dissidents, who are now in the  United States, were reportedly denied visas by the British  Consulate in New York upon the Hong Kong Government's  instruction.    Mr Patten also rejected comments by Chinese officials who  attacked the government for allowing exiled labour activist Han  Dongfang to stay in the territory. "It's a problem they have  created, not us," Mr Patten said.    Mr Han was refused entry into China when attempting to  return  home last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) and new party Sakigake, which both quit the ruling  coalition last month, agreed Monday [16 May] to initiate policy  talks, officials of the two parties said.    The talks will cover Japan's response to North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms program, tax system reform and rice  prices, the officials said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura reached the agreement in a meeting Monday, they said.    The SDP, the country's no. 2 opposition party, left the  coalition late last month in protest over the establishment of a  large parliamentary group that excluded it.    Sakigake earlier declared that it would not take cabinet  posts but will cooperate with the cabinet of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata for some time, keeping its distance from the  coalition.</p>

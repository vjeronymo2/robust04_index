			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The documentary is not dead - Television Television's autumn season is bringing with it a veritable catalogue of new factual series which, at first glance, may seem to give the lie to those of us who predicted that Britain's new rules for television would produce a fiercer ratings war than ever and a slide in quality. Over a period of some years it has been argued in this column that the disastrous Tory legislation on commercial broadcasting combined with an attitude of impatience bordering on contempt towards the BBC, and the demand that all broadcasting become more market oriented, would rob us of some, or even all, of the small percentage of programmes which could be described as truly outstanding. Such misgivings have been ridiculed by some within the industry who felt that new brooms were needed to rid British broadcasting of what they saw as its cosiness and snootiness and that more attention should be paid to the ratings and less to the preferences of the chairman's wife. The effects of such attitudes upon drama within commercial television are already becoming clear. Not only does it now seem improbable that ITV will ever again produce series such as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In The Crown but, more ominously, those running ITV no longer aspire to such heights nor see any point in doing so. The pinnacle of their ambition today is represented by Frank Stubbs Promotes, a good, workmanlike series, pleasant enough to watch but quickly forgettable - the Saumur of television drama. It seems that no one in ITV is interested any longer in producing Champagne, let alone Krug. Such ideas would be seen today as laughably elitist. When I presented the final edition of This Week and wondered whether we would see its like again, scoffing and head patting was the reaction from some of ITV's new mandarins. What made me think, they asked, that the programme replacing This Week would not be as good or even better? Why did I not wait and see? On Thursday, having waited, we saw the first edition of The Big Story which, we are assured, will be giving 'in-depth insight' into 'the week's top story'. And what did ITV consider last week's top story: the Arab/Israeli peace plan? Bosnia? No. The most important question of ITV's week was: Is Wacko Jacko a pervert, the very question that was obsessing the tabloid newspapers. During the programme the presenter talked on the phone to Michael Jackson's sister's agent. 'I mean the problem, to be serious on this Dennis, is that we don't pay for interviews', he said. 'We're a current affairs programme looking at this in a kind of serious fashion - ' at which point the producer, who clearly had a sense of humour, inserted the noise of a camera shutter and banged up a picture of Jackson's sister from her Playboy photo spread. Viewpoint, which has brought us such memorable documentaries as Adrian Cowell's Decade Of Destruction from the Amazon jungle and Antony Thomas's recent excellent expose of the 'Satanic abuse' industry, is about to follow This Week down the ITV drain, as is First Tuesday. In their place ITV's new central programme commissioners will give us The ITV Documentary, with programmes from a wide variety of sources. It is hard to see how this ad hoc system can possibly replace the protective enclave which Central Television (and ATV before it) provided for some of Britain's best documentary makers who received support, sometimes for years, as they brought Viewpoint programmes to fruition. However, again we are told not to be so pessimistic, to 'wait and see'. We cannot do anything else, of course. What we are already seeing in the autumn season is that a lot of the more interesting material is coming from the BBC. Inside Story on BBC1 began a new series with a programme about prostitutes and pimps which looked at first as though it might be in pretty much the same tabloid category as the Wacko Jacko piece. But it turned out to be a grim revelation of the desperate circumstances of many young (and no doubt not so young) girls who are forced by blackmail, violence and, ironically, the need for a show of affection, to work the streets and then hand over virtually all the money they earn to some parasitical man. Another BBC1 production, The Skipper, offers a six-part series on a subject which lies at the heart of the British documentary tradition: fishermen. Since we had such purist works as Deckie Learner and A Life Apart from Mike Grigsby in the 1960s, and the first British documentary, Drifters, from John Grierson, no less, in 1929 (a silent, and the only documentary that the father of the genre ever actually directed on his own) it takes a certain amount of chutzpa to launch into the subject again now. However, producer Jeremy Mills has found one of those television naturals, not entirely unlike steeplejack Fred Dibnah, in Cornish skipper Roger Nowell. He admits to lying to his own brother if he finds a good shoal, and it seems clear that the billing does not refer to him as a 'buccaneer' for nothing. This looks like being not just an informative series, but entertaining. Unfortunately the same can probably be said about Kenneth Baker's Memoirs which began on BBC2 on Saturday. It is all very well to have Kenneth Clarke, Chris Patten, Malcolm Rifkind and other old political chums (and occasionally foes, as with Ken Livingstone) reminiscing about the days when headmistress Maggie terrorised the corridors of power. However, we might have hoped for something a little more informative than a lot of sniggering and 'Do you remember how she used to . . .' exchanges. The two most interesting new series are both concerned with movies and movie makers: BBC2's Hollywood UK and Channel 4's DW Griffith: Father Of Film. In both cases the fascination lies less in the process of film making and more in the social implications, though in the case of Griffith one might wish otherwise. Since it really is true, for once, to say that this was a man whose work was seminally important, it would be interesting to have heard from Kevin Brownlow and David Gill (the world's greatest champions of silent cinema, here working as documentary producers) much more about precisely how Griffith achieved some of his technical effects; after all, he was virtually inventing them. Instead too much time has been devoted to his racism, which nobody should deny, but which is about as important as, say, the slavery practised by the 'democrats' of ancient Greece. Birth Of A Nation is, unmistakeably, a racist movie, but does anybody suppose for one moment that if Channel 4 was to screen a 1915 film about tribal conflict in Africa or murderous feuding between Indian castes that it would feel it necessary to wheel out a polytechnic lecturer at the start to tell us what to think? That is what it did last week before their screening of the superb Brownlow-Gill restored Birth Of A Nation. As for Hollywood UK, its exploration of the moods and mores of the swinging sixties is peculiarly compelling, partly because it all feels such an amazingly long time ago. There are, of course, the films themselves - when we talk about the English cinema boom of that period it is easy to forget that it included not just Room At The Top and A Taste Of Honey but also the Bond movies and works such as The Charge Off The Light Brigade. This series, produced by Charles Chabot and Rosemary Wilton, goes into all that, but, even more tellingly, it finds out from Richard Harris and Julie Christie, Lindsay Anderson and Frederic Raphael, how they felt at the time and how they feel now about that extraordinary outburst of creativity. It is an excellent series, and no doubt there will be others this season. Perhaps it is silly to object if it begins to appear that the BBC really might one day dominate the high ground of broadcasting, as it has so often asserted that it should, while ITV sticks more and more firmly to the dictates of the market place. The trouble is, surely, that so far there has been only the very beginnings of a much greater shift: we ain't seen nuthin yet.</p>

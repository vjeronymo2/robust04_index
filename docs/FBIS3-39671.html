			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Feb 20 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys today said his peace initiative on Bosnia was  based on a non-military principle and did not reckon on the use  of foreign armies there.    Talking to journalists aboard a plane en route to Turkey, he  said that an analysis of the situation in Bosnia had shown that  the possibility of a peaceful settlement in the area was almost  equal to zero.    In Bosnia, each of the three warring parties to the  conflict,  the Catholic Croats, the Orthodox Serbs and the Muslims, has its  supporters abroad to whom it trusts, Baudys said and added that  his initiative ensued from this very prerequisite.    Baudys's initiative, presented at a press conference in  Prague yesterday, envisages the creation of a UN executive  goodwill committee which would oversee the peace process in  Bosnia and in which selected countries, such as Russia, Greece,  Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy, would participate.    According to Baudys, Bosnia would be administered by a  police  force and an unbiased UN committee with powers freely obtained  from the three hostile parties for a definite period of time.    Baudys said he was open to any discussion concerning more  detailed information or variants to his proposal providing the  world community showed interest in it.    He confirmed he had not consulted the initiative with  government or parliament but only with a group of his friends.  He, however, did not elaborate whether the group included some  government members, for instance Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec.    Baudys said he expected to get first foreign response in  Ankara.</p>

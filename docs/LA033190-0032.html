			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON HIGH SCHOOL SPIRIT  </P> <P> I was disconcerted to read Lonnie White's article (March 20) expressing the  opinion that Loyola High was accepted into the Southern California regional  basketball tournament instead of Crenshaw because we spent more money  publicizing our team.  </P> <P> As a senior at Loyola, I serve as the varsity basketball statistician. The  statistic booklet, which "hyped the Cubs' season," was personally compiled  during my free time away from schoolwork.  </P> <P> Loyola's record justified the team's inclusion in the tournament. Don't  downgrade the hard work of Loyola's student-athletes. We earned our way in, we  did not buy it in.  </P> <P> SCOTT SPENCER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

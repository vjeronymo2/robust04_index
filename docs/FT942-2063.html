			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chains side behind Renold's advance to Pounds 6m Renold, the chain and gear manufacturer, more than doubled its dividend after reporting a fivefold increase in profits. For the year to April 2, pre-tax profits were Pounds 6m on sales of Pounds 130m, up from a previous Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 125m. The shares closed yesterday up 4 1/2 p at 145 1/2 p. Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the group had succeeded in bringing in the profits and generating significant cash with little increase in sales. At least Pounds 4m of the increase in sales represented currency gains. There were modest signs of recovery in Europe, which he hoped would lead to increased volumes this year. 'There is some fire in the order book at the moment,' he said. The profits were struck after Pounds 1m of redundancy costs, mainly in Germany, compared with Pounds 1.4m last time. They were helped by a turnround in the Milnrow gears business after two years of losses. However, chains remain the group's chief earner, accounting for 60 per cent of sales. Productivity gains and marketing focused on higher margin goods were behind the strong improvement in the UK, said Mr Cotterill. The fact that most of the profits increase arose in the UK, where tax losses are available, led to a substantially lower tax charge of 18 per cent, compared with 50 per cent last time. Capital expenditure was Pounds 3.5m, below depreciation of Pounds 5m. Mr Cotterill said spending would increase to Pounds 5m this year, much of it at Holroyd, which makes rotors used in air conditioning and refrigeration. Holroyd has won a long-term contract with a leading US compressor manufacturer, commencing next January. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.4m, and gearing was reduced from 23 per cent to 2 per cent. Earnings per share were 7.4p (0.9p). A recommended final dividend of 1.8p gives a total for the year of 2.5p, up from 1p.</p>

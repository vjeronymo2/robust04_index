			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks and Small Companies: Lessons of the 80s spark policy review - The relationship between banks and small businesses is in upheaval. With 80,000 company failures last year and a similar number forecast for 1993, lenders are seeking a fresh approach to overdrafts, loans and equity finance. FT reporters assess the lending pressures on companies and banks HIGH STREET banks are reviewing their policies on lending to small and medium-sized businesses as the size of problems from their 1980s lending strikes them. This is leading to some fundamental changes in policy. One change is that banks are becoming more restrictive in the overdraft facilities they offer. Because many of these overdrafts were used as a substitute for equity capital in the 1980s, banks are now encouraging fixed-term loans instead. Such changes have led to fears of a 'credit crunch' for small businesses, but banks deny that they are withdrawing credit. They say they are merely trying to ensure that loans are used for working capital rather than equity. Banks argue that small business lending is more risky than they had appreciated before. They believe they require a combination of higher pricing and more information on how loans are used if they are to remain in the market. Fixed-term loans are useful as a monitoring tool because a bank can see immediately when interest payments are not met, rather than having to watch movements in overdrafts closely to detect underlying patterns of cashflow. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland, this week tried to stimulate a debate about small-business financing by arguing that the government, banks and businesses had to form a partnership to stimulate new forms of equity finance. Mr Pearse's suggestions included a Pounds 67m 'loan support scheme' to provide subsidies to cut the price of banks' medium and long-term loans to 1 percentage point over base - rather than the current 2 to 3 points. He also argued that this scheme for manufacturing industry could be supplemented with a 'manufacturing support scheme' which would try to attract individuals to offer equity capital to small, local companies by giving them tax breaks. Mr Pearse believes financing for small companies in Britain should to be re-thought in comparison with countries such as Germany, where only 14 per cent of small-business debt is in overdraft form, compared with 58 per cent in Britain. Ms Jane Bradford, National Westminster's head of small business services, says banks are increasingly limiting small businesses' access to overdrafts because of their experience with bad debts from lending in the 1980s. 'Small businesses have been over-reliant on overdrafts. They have met long-term financing needs with short-term borrowing,' says Ms Bradford, whose bank is lending about Pounds 11bn to small businesses. The confusion has proved problematic for NatWest as it tries to clear up a mass of poor lending which originated in the late 1980s. It has found that many overdrafts in theory provided for working capital have turned into loans. NatWest and Barclays are the two biggest lenders to small businesses. Some 55 per cent of the bank's lending in the sector is in the form of overdrafts, and 45 per cent in loans with fixed terms. The bank's problems with small-business lending were shown this week in its 1992 results. Of a Pounds 1.3bn provision for bad debts on lending in its UK branch business, 47 per cent related to loans of less than Pounds 50,000. It is now trying to limit overdrafts to cases where they are clearly going to be used to day-to-day working capital. It wants businesses to accept term loans, often on fixed interest rates, for machinery, premises and vehicles. NatWest is also trying to clean up permanent overdrafts by converting them into loans. It regards clearly defined forms of lending as essential to allow the bank to monitor what happens to its money more closely. NatWest says businesses seek overdrafts believing they will be cheaper because of their flexibility. Many have been unable to reduce overdrafts because cashflow has not met projections. A report on equity finance will appear in next week's UK Companies pages.</p>

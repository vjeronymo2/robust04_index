			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European sector soars as crisis in Russia abates EUROPEAN government bond markets soared yesterday, spurred on by renewed buying interest as the Russian crisis appeared to abate and investors were able to focus once again on the favourable economic background. ITALIAN government bonds climbed more than a point as investors took the view that Europe's high-yielding bond markets are likely to see the most scope for interest rate cuts. 'There's been quite a push from the big US houses who are hoovering up Italian bonds,' noted one Italian trader. The Liffe BTP futures contract broke through the resistance level of 117.50 to hit an all-time high of 117.53, ending the day at 117.49 to give a gain of 107 basis points. GERMANY also hit an all-time high yesterday, with the futures contract bursting through an important resistance level which triggered further bouts of buying in the futures market. 'We've seen the market hit the 99.20 resistance level five times recently: this time it has broken through resistance and this is clearly a buy signal,' said one dealer. The Liffe futures contract moved from a low of 99.03 to a high of 99.45 before closing at 99.39. Volume was heavy with about 109,000 contracts traded. Few dealers expect the Bundesbank to ease official interest rates at this week's council meeting - the first with Mr Hans Tietmeyer as president. At yesterday's repo the Bundesbank left its two-week fixed rate repo unchanged at 6.70 per cent, while the 35-day variable rate repo result will be announced today. UK government bonds took their cue from Germany, and the rally in gilt prices enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its tap stocks. The Bank exhausted an Pounds 800m tranche of 9 per cent stock due 2011, which was announced on Friday. It also sold out its index-linked stock (Pounds 250m of 4 1/8 per cent stock due 2030) which was issued on September 14. Dealers said that the gilt market continued to be supported by yield curve plays, with investors borrowing at the short end to buy longer-dated issues. The long end of the market witnessed the strongest gains with the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rising from 116 1/2 to 116 27/32 to yield 7.24 per cent. FRENCH government bonds also hit new highs, with the December notional bond contract on Matif reaching a peak of 124.14. It slipped back to 124.02 on late profit-taking, up 0.26 point from Monday. The central bank's announcement that it plans to auction between FFr13bn and FFr15bn of 10-year and 30-year OAT's on Thursday, against market expectations of between FFr18bn and FFr20bn, also lifted sentiment, one trader said. HEALTHY domestic buying buoyed the Japanese government bond market yesterday as investors shrugged off concern about the political situation in Russia and took encouragement from a successful auction of long-dated stock. The futures market outperformed cash bonds: the December futures contract rose from 113.30 at the opening to end at 113.49, up 0.44 on the previous day's close. Dealers noted a favourable response to yesterday's auction of 20-year bonds. The Ministry of Finance accepted bids for Y350bn of 20-year bonds with a 4.7 per cent coupon. The average accepted price was 100.45, giving a yield of 4.656 per cent. US bond prices weakened slightly across the maturity range yesterday after the Treasury announced an unexpected increase in the size of the weekly bill auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 103 11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent. Prices opened mixed, and traded quietly until mid-afternoon when they suddenly turned down after the Treasury said it was upping the size of next weeks' bill auction from Dollars 23.6bn to Dollars 25.6bn. The scale of the increase surprised dealers and analysts, and expectations that the fresh supply would pressure prices lower quickly undermined market sentiment. Technical considerations apart, attention yesterday was primarily focused on this week's September employment report, which will provide the most up-to-date view of labour market conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The world in 1993 continued  to head toward an unsteady and unpredictable direction with no  effective solutions for nagging problems but there were also  hopeful signs for the future, the Foreign Ministry said in an  annual report released Friday [13 May].    The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said the  international community was unable to find effective measures to  solve sluggish economic conditions among industrialized nations,  regional conflicts such as those in the former Yugoslavia or  North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development.    Steps to end proliferation of mass destructive weapons or to  solve turmoil in the former Soviet Union were also unavailable,  the report said.    But bright prospects also appeared as a result of  international cooperation on a new framework for peace and  prosperity, it said.    The report cited encouraging developments such as the birth  of a new Cambodia, the historic agreement between the Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel and the successful  conclusion of the seven-year-long Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks.    Seeking solutions to international problems through  multilateral means is becoming increasingly important in the  post-Cold War era since economic, environmental and nuclear  nonproliferation issues are often intertwined, the paper said.    It cited the need to strengthen the functions of the United  Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan, the  United States and Europe which share common values of democracy  and market- oriented economies and whose combined gross national  product accounts for 70 percent of the world's GNP.    Japan, for its part, should carry out, in cooperation with  other countries, diplomacy that is both "active and creative" to  build a new international framework because it now has great  influence not only economically but also in the political and  global fields, it said.    The report also said Japan also has an increasingly  important  role as an industrialized and democratic nation in Asia to  promote democracy and market-oriented economies worldwide while  preventing religious and ethnic conflicts.    While conceding that in some ways the Japanese people are  not  yet fully aware of mounting international expectations toward  their country, the blue book said notions are taking root that  Japan should contribute more actively to ensuring peace and  prosperity in the world while at the same time not seeking to  become a military superpower.    Japan's cooperation during the Persian Gulf crisis and  participation in the UN-led peacekeeping operations in Cambodia  helped develop that attitude, it said.    Japan also intends to continue efforts to improve its  Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing nations in  quantity and quality because the ODA is an important method to  fulfill its international responsibility and roles, the report  said.    Regarding its relations with the U.S., the blue book said  the  two nations reconfirmed the importance of bilateral ties as new  governments emerged on both sides of the Pacific.    It predicted, however, that disputes between Tokyo and  Washington may intensify over trade and economic problems as a  result of the failed bilateral trade framework talks in February.    Despite the two governments' agreement that the collapse  should not affect bilateral cooperation on political, security  and global aspects, voices of concern and dissatisfaction toward  each other can be heard in both nations, it said.    Efforts by both sides are essential to improve bilateral  trade relations, but in Japan's case, it should make efforts to  boost domestic demand while voluntarily taking measures to ease  access of foreign goods, the report said.    The year 1993 also saw active moves regarding regional  cooperation and regional unification, such as the start of the  EU, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the holding  of an informal summit meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations, the report said.    But such regional cooperation should be in line with the  activities of the UN and the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), it said.    On the global economy, the blue book cited the need to work  on serious global unemployment while tackling new problems such  as improving the compatibility between trade and the environment.</p>

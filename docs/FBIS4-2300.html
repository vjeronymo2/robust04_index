			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P.K. Wu and Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, April 7 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan Salt  Works has entered into a joint venture with an Indonesian  company to produce refined salt, Taisalt Vice President Wang  Chih-han said here Thursday [7 April].    Wang, currently in Indonesia as part of a state enterprises  delegation, signed a memorandum of understanding for the venture  with his Indonesian counterpart Muchji Rusnosuprapto at the  Grand Hyatt Jakarta Thursday.    On hand to witness the signing ceremony were Taiwan  delegation leader Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and  Vice Chairman Yeh Man-sheng of the Economics Ministry's  Commission of National Corporations.    The plan calls for construction of seven refined salt  plants.  The first such plant will cost around US$15.15 million with  Taiwan's technology investment not exceeding US$7.2 million.    Estimated annual production of the first salt plant will be  60,000 metric tons, Wang said. He added that six more plants  will be needed to meet Indonesia's annual salt demand of  500,000-600,000 metric tons.    Refined salt, which costs less in Taiwan but is cheaper to  produce in Indonesia, is in great demand in the Southeast Asian  country.    Some 30 million Indonesians suffer from thyroid diseases due  to a lack of refined salt, Yeh said. Increased foreign capital  and technical assistance is needed to boost salt production  here, he added.    The Taiwan delegation arrived in Jakarta April 1 and will  return to Taipei April 9.</p>

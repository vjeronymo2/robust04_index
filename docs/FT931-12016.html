			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Yeltsin to defy US on missile sale PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday pledged to go ahead with a controversial deal to sell missile technology to India despite protests from the US. Mr Yeltsin, who has been accused by nationalists at home of kow-towing to Washington, used the occasion of a three-day visit to India to state his determination to pursue an independent foreign policy. Mr Yeltsin said Russia would not 'backtrack' on the agreement which became public last year to supply India with cryogenic engines for rockets. He suggested that the US, which has punished India for the deal by banning space technology co-operation, should react to the agreement with 'commonsense'. Mr Yeltsin said his visit to India, following trips to Seoul and to Beijing, showed that Russia intended to pursue a balanced foreign policy with equal regard for both the west and for Asia. He said that immediately after gaining power, he had paid more attention to the west, because of the need to deal with the US on issues such as nuclear disarmament. But now Russia had to 'maintain a balance in relations with the west and the east,' said Mr Yeltsin. During his visit to India, Mr Yeltsin and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, signed a friendship treaty and various economic and military co-operation agreements.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Seoul to curb Kim mourning The South Korean government is to crack down on leftist organisations planning to hold mourning ceremonies for the late North Korean President Kim Il-sung, whose funeral is scheduled for tomorrow. The announcement follows the firebombing of six police stations in Seoul on Thursday by radical students protesting at the arrest of student organisers after they praised President Kim. Student organisations have also said they will send groups conveying their condolences to Pyongyang, after North Korea announced it would allow South Koreans who wanted to pay homage to Mr Kim to cross the heavily fortified demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas. North Korea yesterday resumed propaganda attacks against the South after suspending them following the president's death. It criticised South Korean President Kim Young-sam for raising tensions by placing the country's military and police on alert after the announcement last Saturday of Mr Kim's death. It compared the 'rude' actions to 'setting a fire at a funeral home'. 'Despite the fact that even the US president and Japanese prime minister expressed their regrets over the death of President Kim Il-sung, only Kim Young-sam. . . is acting recklessly,' declared the state-controlled Radio Pyongyang. South Korean officials have privately criticised US President Bill Clinton for offering condolences over Mr Kim's death in what was seen as a diplomatic gesture to maintain US dialogue with the new North Korean leadership. Suggestions by members of the main opposition Democratic party to send a South Korean condolence mission to Pyongyang in an effort to improve relations have been condemned by the ruling Democratic Liberal party.</p>

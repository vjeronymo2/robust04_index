			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> CHP WARNS ON CAR-POOL VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol warned today that three officers will work  overtime to ticket solo drivers and illegal lane changers in the car-pool lane  that opens Wednesday on a section of the northbound San Diego Freeway from  Westminster to Seal Beach.  </P> <P> And those tickets will cost twice as much. A new state law took effect Jan. 1  doubles the minimum fine for lane violators to $100, and sets the maximum fine  for repeat offenders at $500.  </P> <P> Orange cones blocking motorists from using the completed, 4.5-mile section  between Springdale Street and Interstate 605 will be removed late tonight, so  that commuters can start using the lane Wednesday morning, officials said.  </P> <P> Capt. Mike Mikita said that, beginning immediately, the CHP will assign two  extra officers to work overtime during the day and a third at night to  ticketing solo drivers or those who enter and exit the special lane across the  four-foot buffer area and double-yellow line that separate it from regular  traffic. The CHP will also add another regular "beat" officer on the route for  daytime enforcement.  </P> <P> "There's no grace period," Mikita said.  </P> <P> Mikita said he expects some traffic congestion Wednesday under the I-605  overpass in Seal Beach, where the car-pool lane gradually merges into a regular  traffic lane.  </P> <P> Background story, Part II, Page 1.  </P></p>

Since January this year, six costly accidents have taken  place in coal mines, much heavier than in the same period last  year in terms of frequency and casualties. Each accident caused  more than 10 deaths.    In the latter half of January, four gas and coal-dust  explosions took place in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hunan and Guizhou  Provinces.    Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, attributed the  frequent accidents to the chaos in management and inadequate  equipment in coal mines as well as the poor quality of the  employees.    "The root cause for this is that some officials put profits  before security," he said.    He called on all coal mine operations to launch an  inspection  movement in February and March to avert gas and coal-dust  explosions.    Township coal mines and those small mines split from the  major state-owned coal mines, the major accident-makers, should  be rectified, he said.    Li Boyong, minister of labor, also told XINHUA that 84 major  accidents causing ten or more deaths at one time took place in  China last year, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year.    He said the situation this year allowed no optimism, adding  that no efforts should be spared to ensure safety in production.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Memory of shapes past - The potential of an 'intelligent' biocompatible alloy Nitinol, a biocompatible 'memory' alloy developed in the early 1960s and recently further investigated for space applications, is showing potential for use in minimally invasive surgery. This 'intelligent material', composed of an almost 50:50 mixture of nickel and titanium, has the capacity to memorise a particular shape. It expands or contracts when heated and returns to its original shape when cooled. After being deformed through bending, stretching and compression, it then needs simply to be subjected to a predetermined temperature - in medical applications, to that of the body. Shape memory properties of certain materials were first discovered in the 1940s. Yet it was in 1962 that William Buehler, a materials researcher for the US defence department, discovered those of nitinol. He used it for the coupling of hydraulic pipes in jet aircraft, and this same system is still used on the US F-16 fighter aircraft. The other shape memory materials - copper, or polymer-based - have a more limited usage than nitinol since they do not exhibit such a range of movement and are not generally biocompatible. However, they are cheaper to produce (about Pounds 100/kg as opposed to about Pounds 500/kg for nitinol). A particularly elastic version of nitinol was the first to appear in a medical application in the mid-1970s. It was used in dentistry to make orthodontic bands to straighten teeth. The elasticity and shape memory capacity of the material applies a constant tension on the teeth and avoids the repeated visits to the dentist which are required to re-tighten the more common stainless steel bands. Another established application in medicine is for use as 'clot-catching' filters in large blood vessels. Nitinol has also been used as urethral and tracheal stents (mechanical devices which open out and reinstate the cross section of fluid-carrying vessels). It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that the full medical capacity of nitinol began to be realised. Tony Anson, an engineer at the Brunel Institute for Bioengineering in the UK, has played an instigating role. He became familiar with nitinol while carrying out research for the European Space Agency into its use for making 'linear actuators', or moving devices, for Biosample, a space bioprocessing facility. His work with nitinol brought him into contact with David Jenkins, orthopaedic consultant at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, who asked him to investigate the material's potential in orthopaedic applications, in particular for the correction of backbone deformity. This research inspired a host of other potential uses for nitinol, including bone repair staples and plates, soft tissue pins to repair torn ligaments, vascular connection systems to join fluid-carrying vessels and other types of stents for use in arteries and veins. The use of nitinol for bone repair staples is in clinical trial at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary and the results look positive, according to the researchers. These staples were designed for non-complex long bone fractures. However, researchers in the medical profession believe that by changing the scale of the staples they could be used on any of the bones in the body. These staples are put into pre-drilled holes on either side of the fracture. The heat of the body warms the staple, which then changes to its memorised shape, pulling the bone ends together. A compressive setting of the bone at the fracture site is achieved. According to Anson: 'Such a treatment of broken bones may improve the strength of the union, reduce the time taken to effect the repair by 25 per cent, and is still one-third of the cost of presently available devices.' Experimental work into the use of nitinol for vascular connection systems is under way at the Brunel Institute for Bioengineering. 'The connection device is essentially a hose clip,' explains Anson, 'and the whole connection procedure takes no more than 30 seconds and is leak free.' This method of joining blood vessels together could be advantageous in coronary bypass operations where up to an hour is spent in suturing. Sam Andrews of Charing Cross Hospital, London, is researching a minimally invasive technique for repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms (swellings of the main artery). Nitinol lends itself well to minimally invasive surgery because it can be introduced into the body as a narrow wire and, once inside, it can assume its memorised shape. In this research, the nitinol is used as a stent to hold a fabric patch, or dacron graft, in place. The dacron graft is wrapped around a nitinol wire and fed into the aorta. When it is surrounded by blood, the nitinol warms up and expands to reform its memorised shape stent. Evidence shows that such stents hold grafts firmly in place and do not migrate. Compared with traditional invasive surgery, the minimal access operation involves only a tiny incision next to the patient's groin, instead of a cut down the front of the body. Nitinol also has non-medical uses in thermal control systems, for mounting components in integrated circuits and as underwiring in brassieres. Typical thermal control applications are found in kettle switches, on showers and mixer taps (which switch off at a particular temperature to prevent scalding), and on fire doors - such as those at York Minster (which close when the temperature rises in the case of fire). In the latter case, it is the strength of nitinol which is being exploited - a 3mm diameter nitinol wire forming a spring of 2 1/2 cm diameter can move a force of 30kg. The use of nitinol for mounting is exploited by the French company Souriau. Its system, which avoids complicated soldering, uses split shape memory sockets: these are wide open at low temperatures and close firmly around the component parts at ambient temperature. Repair of such circuits is easy; it is enough to cool the joints for the pieces to be taken apart. Nitinol underwiring in bras is currently being commercialised by Japan's Wacoal at its factories in the US, Asia, France and Belgium. In contrast to traditional bras, Wacoal's do not lose their shape, even after repeated machine washing. The nitinol needs simply to be warmed by the body temperature for the original preconfigured shape to be recovered. Over 3m Goodup bras, a popular Wacoal model with nitinol underwiring, are sold in south-east Asia annually. The bra is one of the biggest markets for nitinol at the moment, according to Tony Michael, of Memory Metals, one of two companies in the UK that market or process nitinol. About 30 to 50 tonnes are produced annually for the global market by Furakawa of Japan, and Raychem and Special Metal of the US.</p>

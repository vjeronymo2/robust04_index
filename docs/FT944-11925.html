			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium thrives on phone connection Booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones has helped the price of palladium to double in the past year. The precious metal is needed for the multi-layer ceramic capacitators used in these telephones, as well as in a wide variety of other electronic equipment such as personal computers and the new wide-screen televisions. Yesterday in London palladium reached Dollars 160.35 cents a troy ounce at one stage, its highest level for five years. The steady rise over the past 12 months was spurred by genuine demand because the palladium market was not liquid enough for speculators to take much interest, said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. Apart from demand from the electronics industry, which was battling to keep up with soaring sales of mobile telephones, car makers were using much more palladium in automotive anti-pollution catalysts, where it was being substituted for more-expensive platinum. According to Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum group metals marketing organisation, last year about 4.13m ounces of palladium was produced. Russia accounted for 2.3m ounces, South Africa 1.4m, while the rest was provided by North America. Mr Smith said it was widely assumed in the market that the Russians would sell heavily from stocks once palladium reached about Dollars 150 an ounce in order to keep the price down. They feared other metals would be substituted by the Japanese electronics industry once Dollars 150 was reached. He said the recent weakening of the US dollar meant that the yen price of the metal was 'not unbearably high'. Nevertheless, Russia remained the 'wild card' in the market as it must be assumed that its stocks were high, given that palladium was mainly used in Russia for military purposes and military spending there had dropped dramatically. Another analyst insisted that there was no substance in rumours that the Russians were withholding palladium to keep prices rising. There were shortages of palladium in the prefered form - the powder used by the electronics and autocatalyst industry - but the market had enough ingot, or solid, palladium, the only type supplied by Russia.</p>

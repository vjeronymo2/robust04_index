			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / People: Hoping to crack ICE Christopher Woodgate, who has quit as chief executive of London's IMI Securities, is one stockbroker who believes that institutional fashions are going full circle. He is betting on the swing back towards old-style partnerships by setting up ICE Securities. A few years ago, London's established broking partnerships were swallowed up by large, mostly well-capitalised banks. Now, Woodgate thinks that boutiques like ICE, which opens for business in September, may once again be the way to woo clients in niche markets. Woodgate, a veteran of several new broking ventures, set up IMI Securities, which specialises in Italian and Austrian stocks, in partnership with Italian financial services group Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, five years ago. Before that, he had been one of the founding partners of Carnegie International, the UK securities arm of Nordbanken of Sweden. Roger Cunningham, previously senior dealer at IMI Securities, is joining Woodgate in the new agency broker and research operation which will concentrate on Italy and Central Europe, hence the name. ***** Meanwhile ex-Morgan Stanley man Guido Manca, who had recently joined as IMI Securities' head of sales, has been appointed chief operating officer of IMI Securities. ***** Sir Paul Fox, former managing director of BBC Network Television, has joined a new international advisory committee set up by International Sports, Culture and Leisure Marketing of Lucerne. The company is the marketing partner for sponsorship and marketing rights for the Olympic Games and other international sporting events. Apart from Sir Paul, once editor of the Sportsview television programme on BBC and a keen horse-racing fan, the other members of the new committee are Luca di Montezemolo, president and chief executive of Ferrari, the sports car-maker, and Thomas Wyman, former president of CBS, the US broadcaster.</p>

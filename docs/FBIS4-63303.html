			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "LDPR Faction Launches Boycott of </F> Duma Sessions"]    [Text] The State Duma's morning plenary session 20 May  began with a long-expected action: The LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] faction (60 deputies) walked out of the hall of  sessions as a protest against TV journalist N. Svanidze's  well-known report on the "Podrobnosti" ["Details"] program.    A similar threat had been delivered at the previous session.  But on that occasion the LDPR faction in the event decided to  participate in the Duma's work in exchange for the chamber  leadership's agreeing to send a letter to the RTR [Russian  Television and Radio] leadership, suggesting that N. Svanidze be  dismissed.    However, V. Zhirinovskiy, who returned on the eve of the  session from a tour of the country, evidently proved to be not  satisfied with this decision, and withdrew his faction from the  hall anyway. Neither the persuasion of the Communists and the  Agrarians, nor even a decision to submit as the first item on  the agenda a draft Duma resolution on the creation of the  house's own television and radio broadcasting service, was of  any avail. At the same time V. Zhirinovskiy announced that his  faction is suing V. Svanidze for 560 million rubles. It was  also announced that writs are being issued against Ye. Gaydar  and IZVESTIYA for the publication of the "Russia's Choice"  leader's article on V. Zhirinovskiy. The session also  repeatedly heard calls for all Russian television journalists to  be deprived of their accreditation. However, these calls did  not meet with support.    However, by walking out of the Duma's hall of sessions the  LDPR faction did not manage to achieve its main goal -- to wreck  the quorum. On the contrary, supporters of the formation of yet  another parliamentary television company found themselves facing  the risk of remaining in the minority, since the "Russia's  Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] factions  categorically opposed this idea.    The main part of the debates was devoted to allegations from  supporters of parliamentary television of the nonobjectivity of  media coverage of legislators' activity. In the opinion of  representatives of factions -- notably the Communist Party --  the creation of a Duma television and radio broadcasting company  would rectify the situation, since it would give all deputies  the opportunity to address voters directly on two state  television channels. If the decree is adopted, television  viewers could have the opportunity to hear roughly 30 minutes'  of speeches from the State Duma deputies every day.</p>

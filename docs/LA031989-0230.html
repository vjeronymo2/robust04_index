			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF NEW HOMES IN '88 SET FAST PACE  </P> <P> Sales of new homes throughout the Southland in 1988 continued at an  unprecedented pace while production expectations for 1989 soared to another  high.  </P> <P> The 18th annual Times survey of residential construction of a seven-county  Southern California area reveals high optimism among home builders, who project  a 29.5% increase in sales during the current year. Actual sales in 1988  increased 21.2% over 1987.  </P> <P> Builders, although wary of rising interest rates affecting their sales and  conscious of a possible year-end slowdown, nevertheless expressed confidence in  offering their firms' projections for 1989 to The Times. (See accompanying  story.)  </P> <P> The survey showed 1988 to be the fifth consecutive year of housing production,  topping sales and projection marks established during the hectic period of  sales and construction in the 1977-81 span, based upon an index devised by The  Times Marketing Research Department.  </P> <P> Because participation in the survey is voluntary and the number of firms taking  part varies every year, an index of median sales and projected sales has been  computed for all participating firms in each of the 18 Times surveys.  </P> <P> By making the 1971 median sales and the 1972 median sales projections (both  from the first survey) equal to 100.0, the median sales and projections from  each survey have been compared to this base, creating an index. (See Page 23).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upward Trend Continues  </P> <P> This allows for an overall trend comparison rather than a dollar comparison,  which would not be meaningful. The median for actual 1988 sales for the 194  firms reporting sales was $29.6 million. The median projection for the 190  firms projecting sales for 1989 was $28.9 million. The indexes show the trends  from 1971 and 1972.  </P> <P> The 1988 sales volume index of 321.7 marks an all-time high as the upward trend  continues with a 22.7% increase over the previous survey.  </P> <P> The index for 1989 projections is 225.8, which is 7.4% higher than the 210.2  figure projected for 1988.  </P> <P> But some things didn't change. The William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach and Watt  Industries of Santa Monica repeated their respective places as leader and  runner-up among the record 194 companies participating and ranked in 18th  annual survey.  </P> <P> Lyon reported sales of $655.5 million; its 1987 sales figure was $506.3  million. The company exceeded its 1988 sales projections of $577 million by  $78.5 million, building a total of 4,564 units -- 34% of them single-family  homes, 53.4% apartments and 12.6% condominiums.  </P> <P> Total Southland sales -- in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside,  San Bernardino and Kern counties -- hit the $11.4-billion mark for the 194  reporting firms. That was a 21.2% increase over the $9.4 billion figure  recorded by 177 companies in the 1987 survey.  </P> <P> In major shifts among the builders, Barratt American Inc. of Irvine advanced  from 19th place in last year's ranking to 8th in the new survey, while Pacific  Scene Inc. of San Diego dropped from 9th to 62nd place.  </P> <P> Hampton Development of Valencia, ranked 194th (last place), is expecting the  largest gain in sales this year -- 1,700%. It had only $300,000 in 1988 but has  set its sights on a $5.4-million goal in 1989. RWR Development Inc. of Van  Nuys, ranked 124th, is projecting the largest dollar increase, $152 million  from $17.4 million in 1988 to $169.4 million in 1989, a 873.6% jump in home  sales.  </P> <P> Seventh-ranked Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. of Los Angeles predicts it will  have the second largest dollar increase, $150.4 million, from $249.6 million  last year to $400 million in 1989, up 60.3%.  </P> <P> The Southland builders produced 74,402 housing units last year -- up only 1%  from the 1987 output of 73,652 units, even though there were 17 more firms  reporting building activity in the current survey.  </P> <P> Of that output, single-family construction represented the largest number --  36,316 -- or 48.8% of the total, up slightly from the 48.1% reported for 1987  construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Single-Family Homes  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad recorded the largest number of single-family homes, 1,833,  built last year. That figure accounted for 90.5% of the firm's total production  while third-ranked Lewis Homes Group of Companies of Upland completed 1,580  single-family homes, 68.7% of its 1988 output.  </P> <P> Of the 190 firms that reported sales for 1988 and projections for 1989, 80%  (152 companies) forecast an increase in their production, expressing a bit more  optimism than the 79.5% of the 171 builders who made projections in the  previous survey. Apartment construction totaled 27,601 units, or 37.1% of all  building activity during 1988, slightly below the 1987 figure of 38%. The Lyon  Co. built 2,439 apartment units, topping the field and that figure amounted to  53.4% of its total output.  </P> <P> Eighty-one developers (41.8%) reported building apartment units last year,  compared to 73 firms, or 41.2%, in 1987. Among the 81, 27, or 33.3%,  constructed apartment units exclusively. A total of 74 firms (38.1%) built  condominiums during 1988. That was a drop from the previous survey's 41.2%.  There were 10,485 condominium units built, representing 14.1% of all housing  units built last year. In 1987, the corresponding figures were 10,303 or 14%.  Griffin Homes of Calabasas, ranked 18th, led all builders in this category,  producing 746 units, or 51.7% of the total.  </P> <P> Among the 194 firms' plans for this year, 164, or 84.5%, plan some activity in  single-family homes and 66 companies, or 40.2%, of the builders plan to build  single-family units only. Seventy-seven, or 47%, will build apartments and of  those, 19 builders, or 26.7%, will construct apartments only. In the  condominium category, 82 builders, or 42.3%, plan to build such units and of  that number, only five, or 6.1%, will build condominiums exclusively.  </P> <P> Thirty-one builders, or 16%, plan building activity in all three housing types  this year.  </P> <P> Completed and unsold inventory at the end of the firms accounting periods  totaled 4,429 units, an increase of 1,022 units from the previous year's survey  count of 3,407. Well over half, or 62.9% of the 194 companies, reported no  inventory at the conclusion of their accounting periods.  </P> <P> Calmark Development Corp. of Los Angeles, ranked 27th, had the largest number  of unsold units, 1,248. Century West Development Inc. of Santa Monica, ranked  51st, was second, with 740 unsold units.  </P> <P> A marked increase in the production of manufactured housing is expected this  year, although the total numbers involved are still quite small. Eight  companies expect to build 1,118 units this year, a jump of 204.6% from the 367  units forecast for 1988.  </P> <P> The No. 1 ranked Lyon Co., after producing 729 manufactured housing units last  year, or 70.2% of that total, does not plan to build any such units this year,  having sold its interest in a manufacturing firm, Golden West.  </P> <P> Eight firms built 1,039 manufactured homes during 1988, representing 4.1% of  the survey participants. In 1987, four (2.3%) reporting firms produced 2,338  units. Although the number of firms involved in manufactured housing doubled,  the total number of units built dropped by more than 50% from 1987-1988.  </P> <P> In the solar-equipped units category, 18 builders, or 9.3% of all firms taking  part in the survey, plan to construct housing units or pools equipped with  active solar-energy systems this year. Last year, 10.2% of 177 firms reported  plans to use solar systems. This year, one firm reported it will use the system  for pools and spas only.  </P> <P> Pardee Construction Co. of Los Angeles, ranked 15th, anticipates using the  largest number of solar-equipped units this year, 1,024 divided among 608  apartments and 416 condominiums. Weinstock Construction Corp. of Studio City,  ranked 78th, is a close second, with 953 units planned, 53 in single-family  houses and 900 in apartments.  </P> <P> As has been the case since the beginning of the survey, a number of firms -- 12  this year -- submitted incomplete information on the single-sheet form and  could not be ranked. And again this year, many firms failed to meet the  deadline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Participation Rate  </P> <P> The survey revealed that 119 companies participated in both the current and  17th annual survey, a 61.3% participation rate compared with the 65.5% figure  between the 16th and 17th surveys.  </P> <P> Of those 119 companies, sales increased for 78 firms, declined for 40 and  remained the same for one. Sales totaled over $9 billion, up 21.4% from the  previous year's total of $7.4 billion for companies reporting two consecutive  years.  </P> <P> The largest percentage increase among firms participating in the consecutive  surveys was for the Tom Egerer Development Co. of Manhattan Beach, ranked  142nd, up 475% from $2 million in 1987 to $11.5 million in 1988. Western  Capital Development Inc. of Los Angeles, ranked 176th, experienced the largest  percentage decrease, 75.7%, from $14 million in 1987 to $3.4 million in 1988.  The Lyon firm had the largest dollar increase of $149.2 million for a 29.5%  increase over 1987. The largest dollar decrease was $153.9 million reported by  Pacific Scene Inc. a drop of 75.1%.  </P> <P> Among those 119 companies, 117 made projections for 1988. Fifty-one, or 43.6%,  topped their predictions, 64, or 54.7%, did not and two firms, or 1.7%, exactly  met their 1988 forecast.  </P> <P> In 1988, the 119 firms participating in 1987 and 1988 built 55,157 housing  units, 1.3% fewer than the 1987 total of 55,865 and 54, or 45.4%, of them built  more units in 1988 than in 1987. Fifty-nine companies (49.6%) built fewer units  in 1988 than in 1987, while six builders (5%) built the same number. In last  year's survey, 56% built more units while only 42.2% built less.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technical Support  </P> <P> Technical support for the 18th annual Times survey of residential construction  in Southern California was provided by Claudia Brennan, VC Hines and Clif  Tanaka of the Times' Marketing Research Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> BUILDING LEADERS  </P> <P> Note: This table

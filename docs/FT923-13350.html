			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / N-weapon initiative announced THE White House yesterday announced that the US would no longer produce plutonium or highly enriched uranium and that it would seek commitments from other nuclear powers to halt production of key ingredients of nuclear weapons, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The statement, made as the Democratic convention was opening in New York, was presented as part of a broad initiative to discourage the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The US has not produced weapons-grade plutonium since 1988 or enriched uranium since 1964. The US Energy Department said the significance lay in the fact that it was the first time Washington had made a formal commitment to ending production of these materials. Mr Lee Feinstein, deputy director of the Arms Control Association, said the move was long overdue and would focus on the prevention of production, rather than elimination of missiles. The initiative includes a number of proposals to strengthen international actions against those who contribute to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles that deliver them.</p>

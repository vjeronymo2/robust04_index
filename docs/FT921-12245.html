			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait calls for OPEC production curb The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries must cut oil output to prevent sharp falls in crude prices as Kuwaiti production continues to climb and Iraq looks to resume oil sales to an already glutted market, Mr Hamoud al-Rqobah, Kuwait's oil minister, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Kuwait. He said it was difficult to say how much Opec must trim output by but its ministers should agree on an effective formula when they meet in Geneva on February 12.</p>

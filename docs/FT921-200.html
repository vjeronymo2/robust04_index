			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Haiti warns Aristide supporters HAITI'S military rulers have threatened to arrest parliamentarians who try to ratify an agreement which would let President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown and sent into exile in September, return to the country. The threat follows a ruling by Haiti's supreme court on Friday that the agreement, negotiated a month ago by Mr Aristide, a group of Haitian parliamentarians and the Organisation of American States, was invalid and could not be implemented. The court's ruling, following submissions by the army-backed government, and the subsequent threats to the legislators, has scuttled any hopes of an early return by Mr Aristide, and has strengthened the hand of the army in the Caribbean state of 6.5m people. A statement on state-controlled television said any challenges to the court's decision would be 'a grave crime of rebellion and outrage'. It followed criticisms by some legislators of the supreme court's decision, and indications that they were willing to convene a session of the assembly to ratify the agreement in defiance of the court's conclusion. OAS members, including the US, are under growing pressure to rethink their policy towards Haiti. They have been embarrassed by the resilience of the military authorities in the face of an international economic embargo. The OAS had placed much hope by the accord, which it brokered last month.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Renewed dollar weakness forces Treasuries lower Early declines in US Treasury prices yesterday pushed yields to 2 1/2 -year highs, but a recovery in the dollar following Federal Reserve intervention helped the market bounce off its lows. Prices, however, remained firmly rooted in negative territory. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 93 9/32 , yielding 8.093 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.960 per cent. Early gains following market-neutral economic news were quickly overtaken by events in the currency markets, where the dollar sank to post-1945 lows against the Japanese yen. The renewed weakness in the dollar unnerved bond market investors, who fear it will deter foreign investors from buying US assets, and contribute to inflation. At one point, the long bond's decline was sufficient to push the yield up to 8.11 per cent, its highest level since May 1992. Prices sprung back later after the Fed intervened in the currency market wiping out early morning losses. The success of the Fed's actions encouraged bond investors, who had previously feared the central bank was unwilling to protect the US currency. The concern over the dollar overshadowed earlier economic reports. The Commerce department reported no change in its index of leading economic indicators for September, and revised its August reading downward to an increase of 0.5 per cent from the 0.6 per cent figure reported last month. The government also announced that factory orders declined 0.2 per cent in September, a sharp turnround from the 4.7 per cent surge in orders reported for the previous month. Taken together, the data was broadly neutral for market sentiment. Later in the day, prices see-sawed, but the mood of the market remained downbeat. This was partially a reflection of investor nervousness before tomorrow's all-important October jobs report. The market's concern is that a stronger than expected report could provoke an immediate interest rate increase by the Fed. The US dollar's woes and further declines in Treasuries depressed European government bonds yesterday. Federal Reserve intervention to support the dollar on the foreign exchanges prompted a modest bounce, but most markets closed lower on the day. 'There's no great deal of focus on European fundamentals these days,' said Mr Ifty Islam, international economist with Merrill Lynch. 'With the US payroll data dominating, the bond markets will still very much eye the foreign exchange and Treasuries markets.' German government bonds ended the day nearly  1/2 point lower, but well above their lows. The December bund future on DTB closed at 88.76, down 0.55 point but off its 88.56 low. In the morning, prices firmed on a leak pointing to lower than expected September industrial output data. The official numbers were indeed lower than forecast, but the data were accompanied by a warning that the rate could be revised upwards by two percentage points next month, causing the market to slip back. Bunds are expected to remain dogged by continuing currency and interest rate jitters in the US and before next week's new 10-year supply data. Dealers said many investors were unwilling to build up significant positions as the end of a difficult year approaches. Although UK government bonds recouped some of their earlier losses, they closed about  3/4 point lower. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 100 1/2 , down  23/32 on the day. Early in the day, gilts slipped on the growing feeling that Tuesday's gains on the back of the Bank of England's inflation report had been overdone. The weak US bond market put a further damper on gilts. Italian bonds were hit by the upheaval in the currency markets, with the weak dollar pushing the lira to an all-time low against the D-Mark. This coincided with renewed speculation that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was about to resign - rumours which were swiftly denied. However, the fact that currency weakness was enough to spark rumours of Mr Berlusconi's demise highlights the degree of political unease in Italy, dealers said. Swedish bonds fell on disappointment over the government's budget package. The yield on the 11-year bond rose 11 basis points to 11.20 per cent.</p>

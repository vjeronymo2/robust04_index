			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] THE STAR    Electoral Commission on Voting Disruption -- Johannesburg  THE  STAR in English on 20 January in a page 14 editorial welcomes  the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] message that "it  will not tolerate attempts to disrupt voting during the  election." However, "the IEC warning that it will exclude from  the final tally votes from areas where disruption has taken  place is understandable, but this may not be enough to  discourage interference. Rather, it risks playing into the  hands of those intending to halt the process through  intimidation and violence."    'Wrong' To Dismiss Right-Wing Threats -- A second editorial  on the same page says details "are scanty" of the Afrikaner  National Front (AVF) plan to implement its own transitional  authority on 29 January. "On the face of it, this  'implementation' looks like one more angry rally, another bit of  right-wing theatre. Still, it would be wrong to dismiss as  entirely empty the threats coming from the Right as the election  draws closer." Public servants "have some potential to disrupt  the country's administration. And it takes only a few crazies  of the armed Right to cause more serious havoc."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Concern Over ANC Economic Statements -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS  DAY in English on 20 January in a page 4 editorial believes  foreign confidence in South Africa's potential "is growing in  line with domestic" confidence. However, the "diversity of  opinion" within the ANC regarding its economic statements "has  led to understandable uncertainty and concern over what the  party can deliver while maintaining its appeal to a broad  constituency if, as expected, it wins an absolute majority in  April. For the present, strategy is focused on winning this  year's election. Though attention has been paid to longer-term  economic possibilities, electioneering has led to a significant  element of economic populism forming part of the ANC's electoral  platform. The question is, can sterile populism be dropped  quietly after April and replaced with the fiscal policies,  incentives and social stability needed if the present  conditional optimism is to continue?"  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   PAC Leadership Divided Over Armed Struggle -- "The PAC,  which  has come in from the cold to take part in constitutional  politics, is running into heavy weather both at home and abroad  because of its equivocal attitude to violence and the alleged  terrorist operations of its military wing, APLA [Azanian  People's Liberation Army]," declares a page 4 editorial in Cape  Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 January. The Tanzanian  Government said it would no longer allow the PAC to "wage armed  struggle from bases on Tanzanian territory," and now Zimbabwean  President Mugabe "is under pressure to order APLA to close its  training bases in Zimbabwe." CAPE TIMES says the Zimbabwean  Government, "with its close links to the PAC, would do well to  bring home to the confused and apparently divided leadership  that they cannot have it both ways."    ANC Mines Policy -- A second editorial on the same page says  the ANC's proposals for state ownership of South Africa's  mineral wealth "should not rekindle nationalisation fears nor  various other alarms associated with centrally-planned  economies." CAPE TIMES believes the "thrust of the ANC mines  policy appears unexceptionable, ensuring mining operations are  conducted to the benefit of all." Unfortunately, the ANC policy  "begins to go wonky when it comes to the call for the mining  industry to develop innovative ways of creating black-owned  mining houses. In the 1990's it makes more sense for government  and the market place to look after that one, hopefully through  the benefits of a growing economy based on free market  principles."</p>

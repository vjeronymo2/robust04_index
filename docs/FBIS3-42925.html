Of this,  52.7 percent of the turnover was with the distant foreign  countries and 47.3 percent with the nearby foreign countries.  Export declined by 9.8 million, to a sum of $361 million. The  relative share of deliveries of machinery and equipment declined  from 60 percent in 1992 to 43 percent in 1993, while the  relative share of raw goods and materials increased from 25 to  34 percent, and of fuel--from 7 to 17 percent. Among the nearby  foreign countries, Ukraine was in first place among the  importers ($101.6 million), while Iran ($23.4 million) was the  leading importer among the distant foreign countries. In the  words of Aleksandr Balashov, deputy chief of the oblast  administration foreign economic relations department, export in  1993 was 11.5 percent below what was predicted. This was  associated with limitations imposed under quotas and licenses,  stoppages by major exporter enterprises due to non-payment,  which were complicated by customs control on the border with  Ukraine, as well as early (November) freezing over of the Rostov  and Taganrog ports. Import to the oblast increased by 17.4  percent in 1993, to a sum of $477 million. Ukraine accounted for  almost one-fourth ($111 million) of the overall volume of import  (metal products and equipment). Imports from the distant foreign  countries were comprised primarily of food products and TNP  [consumer goods]. Germany was in first place among these  countries ($91 million).</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> MINOR HORSES CAUSE A MAJOR FLAP  </P> <P> Horses called Stick It to Me, Persian Amber and I'm Early are not likely to be  familiar to the casual racing fan, but their names have been crossing desks at  the California Horse Racing Board offices in Sacramento all year, in a  complicated dispute that involves board members, track stewards and  investigators, chemists, owners, trainers and state and private veterinarians.  </P> <P> The undistinguished careers of Stick It to Me and Persian Amber are over, their  combined earnings amounting to $575, but the status of their owner, Skip  Chernov, and his former trainer, Steven Rothblum, is unclear.  </P> <P> Santa Anita stewards say that Rothblum is appealing a six-month suspension for  testing positive for cocaine on the day he testified at a hearing regarding I'm  Early. Henry Chavez, chairman of the racing board, said Chernov will receive a  hearing before an administrative law judge, after Chernov appealed a stewards'  ruling that suspended his owner's license for not paying Rothblum's bills.  </P> <P> Chernov and Rothblum had a falling out at Santa Anita last winter when Chernov  accused Rothblum of directing veterinarians to nerve-block the legs of Stick It  to Me and I'm Early. Racing board investigators concluded that there was no  evidence to support the charges.  </P> <P> In the I'm Early investigation, Gerald Frey, a veterinarian who treated the  6-year-old mare, was fined $200 by the stewards and put on probation for more  than three months. It is illegal to treat horses with most medications less  than 48 hours before they are scheduled to run, and Frey could not produce  records that showed his injection of a joint-lubricating fluid was outside that  time frame. The lubrication is sometimes given to sore-legged horses but is not  supposed to be injected less than two days before they race.  </P> <P> All of the horses involved are bottom-of-the-line claimers. Stick It to Me and  Persian Amber, who suffered career-ending injuries in the same race at Santa  Anita last March, were retired as 4-year-old maidens; I'm Early has won only  one race.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Chernov's repeated protests have aroused Chavez's sympathies. "I  didn't like the way he was handled," the racing board chairman said. "He got a  runaround, and that is unfortunate. Very few owners cooperate in our  investigations, but he was one who did. The ruling against him came from the  Del Mar stewards, and there is some question whether this case could even be  within their jurisdiction, since two of the three stewards there were not  involved in the original case."  </P> <P> The morning after Stick It to Me broke down, Chernov said he asked the Santa  Anita stewards to test the filly to see if she might have run with a local  anesthetic that is used illegally to block the nerve endings in a horse's leg.  A racing board investigator said the horse was tested the day after that, and  the result was negative.  </P> <P> "The stewards were more concerned about whether I was going to pay my bill  rather than what happened to the horse," Chernov said. "They tested the horse  45 hours after she raced, and a full day after I asked them to. Then they only  tested for one drug, and there wasn't enough sample left to do any further  testing."  </P> <P> Ed Stetson, supervising special investigator for the racing board, said the  postrace test couldn't have been used as evidence, anyway, because there was no  surveillance of the horse between the time she ran and the time the urine  sample was taken.  </P> <P> Chernov, 52, has been in racing since 1975, owning horses for the last three  years in California. He was a rock concert promoter in Providence, R.I., in the  1960s and '70s and in 1971 owned the New England closed-circuit television  rights to the first fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.  </P> <P> That fight grossed more than $1 million, but six years later Chernov was broke  and trying to break a drug habit. He suffered a heart attack in 1976 while  watching morning workouts at the old Narragansett track in Rhode Island and  twice has had open-heart surgery.  </P> <P> During his short time owning horses in California, Chernov has been physically  and verbally active. He said he once got into a fistfight with one of his  trainers. Before this year, he went before the stewards with charges that his  trainer cashed a bet on a horse that was running against their horse -- a  violation of racing rules -- and there was also a squabble about a trainer  refusing to turn over a horse's registration papers after Chernov fired him.  </P> <P> "Chernov has had eight trainers out here," said Pete Pedersen, a Santa Anita  steward. "An owner is entitled to change trainers as often as he wants, but  having that many in just a few years is unusual.  </P> <P> "Maybe he's been right about some of the things he's brought up, but we've  investigated everything and we're not satisfied that any of his charges are  legitimate. He can't say that we haven't listened to him, because he's had many  a day in court. I think he was so hopeful about the horses he had, and when  they didn't work out, he was bitterly disappointed.  </P> <P> "There are more downs than ups in this game. It seems to me that he's picked  many of his trainers because they worked for less. In racing, it's the same as  anything else, you get what you pay for."  </P> <P> When Stick It to Me cracked her knee and Persian Amber chipped a bone in her  ankle, Chernov put them on a van to Oregon, where they were scheduled to be  bred.  </P> <P> Chernov choked over the words as he related what happened to the two fillies.  "The farm manager told me they were so packed with steroids that they were  infertile," Chernov said. "I've found a home for them. I gave them away. I  didn't get one dime for them."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Summer Squall, one of the country's top 3-year-olds, will make his first start  against older horses tonight. The Preakness winner is a 2-1 favorite in the  $500,000 Meadowlands Cup at 1 1/8 miles. Also in the 11-horse field are Beau  Genius, who has won six straight races, and Mi Selecto, who won the stake last  year.  </P> <P> Seven horses, including the Charlie Whittingham-trained pair of Ruhlmann and  Lively One, are entered in Saturday's $200,000 Goodwood Handicap at 1 1/8 miles  at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. Ruhlmann has been assigned top weight of 123  pounds. Others running are Festin, Triteamtri, Edipo Rey, Asia and Miserden.  </P> <P> Home at Last, winner of the 1 1/4-mile Super Derby, will be shortened up to six  furlongs for the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Belmont Park on Oct. 27. Home at Last  beat his stablemate, Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, in the Super Derby, and  Carl Nafzger, who trains both colts, is planning to run Unbridled in the  Breeders' Cup Classic. . . . Also expected to go in the Sprint are Corwyn Bay,  who won Wednesday's Ancient Title Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita, and  Prospectors Gamble, who finished fourth.  </P></p>

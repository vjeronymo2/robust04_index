			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  presented to the Sejm on Friday some positive trends that  surfaced in the Polish economy in the first quarter of 1994. He  mentioned, among other things, a 15 per cent growth in real  budget revenues as well as a growth of hard currency reserves  and stressed that if these positive trends prevailed it would  mean that Poland was coming out of recession faster than the  industrialized countries of Western Europe.    Simultaneously, Pawlak pointed out that good economic  results  can be wasted due to excessive consumption and economic  disorganization. He stressed in this context that strikes in the  power generating sector increased the production costs.    The prime minister declared that the government has always  intended to abandon administrative methods of controlling wages  but too much haste was connected with the risk of higher  inflation.</p>

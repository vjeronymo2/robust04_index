			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Supreme Soviet to allow sacking of workers for indiscipline The Supreme Soviet has also amended labour legislation to permit managements to fire workers who are guilty of indiscipline without the agreement of the trade unions. The agreement is a compromise, following a veto by President Mikhail Gorbachev of an earlier Supreme Soviet decision to allow managements to fire workers freely. The new decision lays down that unions must be consulted, and that their veto will remain where the labour code has not been breached - as over redundancies. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian Federation leader Boris Yeltsin yesterday met heads of 14 of Russia's 16 autonomous republics to try to further unify the nation, news reports said. The two have put aside their bitter political rivalry in recent days. The republics represent about 20m of the 147m people in the huge Russian republic. At the meeting, it was decided that the autonomous republics would sign the Union Treaty as equal subjects, the Interfax news agency reported. The Treaty is Mr Gorbachev's plan to redefine the relationship between the central government and the republics.</p>

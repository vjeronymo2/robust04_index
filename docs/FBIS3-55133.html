Skvortsov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Sergey Filatov, head of the presidential  administration today met U.S. senators.    Democratic Senator Sam Nunn and republican Senator Richard  Lugar represent those of America's political forces that support  President Clinton's course toward large-scale economic  cooperation with Russia. It is they who drew up the law on  financial and technical assistance to Russia and the CIS  countries in carrying through conversion and elimination of  nuclear weapons.    Today the conversation was about the new Russian Parliament  and how its work and interaction with the president will be  organized.    Filatov said that the line-up of forces has already been  determined. Now work with the factions is underway and  questions of personnel and the agenda are being determined. The  election results and the progress of reforms in Russia, plus  questions of security, disarmament, and development of  cooperation, will also be at the center of attention at the  forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the two countries in  Moscow next week.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Continental drift It must certainly be gratifying for the government to see British inflation fall to 3.7 per cent. For financial markets the slower rate of price increases is of limited interest as long as monetary policy is constrained by what happens in Germany. In that context, yesterday's 39 point jump in the FT-SE may owe more to July's 1.3 per cent fall in German wholesale prices, though the London market is probably deceiving itself if it believes that this will lead to a speedy cut in D-Mark interest rates. ERM membership was always likely to shift London's focus away from Wall Street and align it more closely with continental Europe. The period since the FT-SE peaked on May 11 is a telling example of how far this process has gone. London has fallen by 14 per cent, broadly in line with both Paris and Frankfurt. The Dow is down by less than 3 per cent. It is almost certainly no coincidence that prices rebounded in all three European centres at once yesterday. Yet Frankfurt's rally was the least convincing of the three, amounting to less than half a per cent. Investors there apparently believe a falling rate of headline inflation is not in itself enough to convince the Bundesbank to relax. The central bank remains concerned about the credibility of its efforts to control money supply, still growing at around 8.5 per cent. This week it has been draining liquidity from the local money market. That said, yesterday's FT-SE advance gives some indication how smartly London could rebound when the Bundesbank does decide to move. Whether it will then still be marching in time with the Frankfurt equity market is less clear. That will depend on whether the latter is more sensitive to lower interest rates than to a weak economy and disappointing corporate earnings.</p>

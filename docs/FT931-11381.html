			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Barclays offers 1.5% pay rise BARCLAYS Bank yesterday offered its 65,000 clerical staff a salary increase of 1.5 per cent in line with the government's public-sector pay guidelines, but said it intended to cut their entitlement to paid sick leave. At a time when both Lloyds and National Westminster banks have proposed pay freezes, Barclays believes it has made a 'fair' offer. But Mr Rob MacGregor, assistant general secretary of Bifu, the banking union, denounced the offer as 'derisory' and accused Barclays of 'making the sick help pay for it'. Clerical salaries range from Pounds 6,219 to Pounds 18,675 and Barclays is offering flat-rate increases of Pounds 120 a year for the lowest clerical grade up to Pounds 240 for the highest. Staff with less than two years' service will have their sick-pay entitlement cut from two months to two weeks from July 1. Other staff will have their entitlement reduced too, but by less. Paid sick-leave entitlement for the 20,000 staff who have worked at Barclays for more than 12 years will be reduced from six months to 24 weeks. The bank also plans to drop its Pounds 300 to Pounds 900 London 'loading' payments for new recruits. The payments were introduced a few years ago to attract new secretarial staff when the labour market was tight. Staff will still receive a London weighting allowance. About 1 per cent of staff will not receive any rise because of poor performance. Barclays said staff were 'well aware of the difficult conditions under which the bank is presently operating'. It added that it did not intend to alter its offer, but further negotiations are to be held on February 11. Bifu is seeking a 5.5 per cent pay rise for its members at Barclays and the bank's staff association wants 3 per cent. Print workers yesterday lodged a claim for a 'substantial' wage increase and a rise of one week, to six, in annual holiday entitlement. Last year employers, who had wanted a pay freeze, agreed a two-stage deal. The GPMU, the printworkers union, claimed that a high proportion of the industry was still busy and productivity had increased substantially.</p>

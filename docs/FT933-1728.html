			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Merger talk lifts US bank's shares THE PROSPECT of the largest regional banking merger yet seen in the US led to a surge in the share price of Fleet Financial, New England's biggest banking group, yesterday. Coming a day after the announcement of a near-Dollars 1bn merger of the second and third largest banks in Wisconsin, Marshall &amp; Ilsley and Valley Bancorp, the suggestion of a bid for Fleet added strength to claims that US regional banking groups are entering a period of accelerated consolidation. The jump in Fleet's share price was prompted by a report that NationsBank, the North Carolina-based institution which has grown by acquisition to become the US's fifth largest bank in terms of assets, was preparing a bid. Mr Thomas Hanley, a highly-regarded banking analyst at CS First Boston, said he understood NationsBank was preparing a bid at a premium of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent above the current Fleet share price. Both banks refused to comment yesterday. Any NationsBank approach to Fleet would potentially run foul of the Southeast Compact, an mid-1980s agreement which permits interstate banking in 13 states in the South Eastern part of the country but limits the ability of banks based in the region to expand elsewhere. The compact requires banks in the region, such as NationsBank, to maintain 80 per cent of their assets in the area. Fleet had assets of Dollars 47bn at the end of last year, making it the US's 14th largest banking group, compared with NationsBank's Dollars 118bn. Its strong position in the North Eastern part of the country makes it one of the most attractive acquisition targets for banks looking to develop national networks. Fleet's shares were up Dollars 2 at one stage, at Dollars 34 1/2, before falling back to close at Dollars 33 7/8.</p>

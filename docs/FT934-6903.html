			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Unit trust sales up sharply to record The unit trust industry had its best October on record last month, with net sales reaching Pounds 845.9m. They were up from Pounds 668.6m in September and far higher than the Pounds 37m in October last year. It is already a record year for the industry, with October's figure taking net sales for the year to Pounds 7.8bn. That compares with Pounds 6.3bn in 1987, the previous record for a calendar year. The 27 per cent increase in net sales over the month was caused mainly by strong retail demand according to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif). Net sales to retail investors were Pounds 575m, up from Pounds 411m in September. The increase in institutional net sales was less marked, from Pounds 257m in September to Pounds 271m. Retail interest in unit trusts has been sustained by relatively low interest rates, and further increases in net sales of unit trusts are likely if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, cuts base rates further. Mrs Victoria Nye, director of communications at Autif, said: 'As long as interest rates are low, we expect unit trusts to become increasingly attractive to private investors looking to increase their returns over the long term. Another cut in base rates will put more pressure on the investor looking for income.' A number of new fund launches in the international growth sector in October made these the best-sellers to retail investors, but Mrs Nye did not expect this to be sustained. The second most popular funds, and the most popular in the year to date, were UK balanced funds which offer a mixture of bonds and equities. The least popular continued to be Japan funds. The highest net inflow from institutions was into UK Smaller Companies funds. The highest net outflow among institutions was from European and Japanese funds. Gross sales of unit trusts in October were Pounds 1.6bn and re-purchases Pounds 756.4m. The number of unitholder accounts has increased steadily over the year from 4.35m in January to 4.89m last month.</p>

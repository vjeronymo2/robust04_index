			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): A cash compromise for worriers - Money market funds remove risk and give a good return, but there are some snags / Unit Trusts IN THE US, money market funds are one of the most common ways for the private investor to hold his liquid resources. In the UK, they form less than 0.5 per cent of the unit trust market. One reason is that the British investor is wedded to his building society, where an account is easy to understand, simple to operate and has offered an attractive return. In contrast, many investors find the idea of investing in a unit trust confusing and risky. There are no unit trust shops in the high street, where they can pick up a leaflet; the names of fund management groups are not well known. So what is a money market fund? In simple terms, it is a fund which invests in the short-term debt of banks and other leading financial institutions. Because of this, the fund is always likely to offer a competitive rate, with a gross return similar to base rates. Individual building society accounts may offer higher returns from time to time, but they offer no guarantee of doing so over the long term. Many investors have found, to their cost, that an attractive building society rate is quietly cut a few months after they open the account. The fees on a money market unit trust are low. Most have no bid-offer spread, and annual management fees are under 1 per cent. The interest earned by the trust rolls up, so that the price of the units increases. So if you bought 1,000 units at 100p, and the return was 10 per cent, then your units would be worth 110p. There is no such thing as the ideal product, so what are the potential drawbacks of a money market fund? The trust invests in the deposits of banks and other financial institutions. If the banks became insolvent, that could cause the unit price to fall. However, the fund managers screen the banks very carefully to avoid this, and no significant problems have occurred to date. Indeed, in some ways, money market unit trusts have extra safeguards. If you invest in a building society which goes bust, your maximum compensation is 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. If a money market unit trust goes bust, you are covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which repays the first Pounds 30,000, and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. Unlike building societies, trusts cannot pay interest gross. Non-taxpayers will have to wait and reclaim the tax. Access to your cash can be delayed. You will have to go through the normal unit-selling process, which can take a couple of weeks. However, Fidelity's trust offers a chequebook for those who keep more than Pounds 5,000 in their account. Other trusts may follow suit as the market develops. Tracker funds on the scent of higher returns UNIT TRUST managers are in buoyant mood. Total funds under management exceeded Pounds 60bn for the first time in May. The Unit Trust Association inferred that investor confidence was returning. However, unit trusts still have problems. The patchy performance of world stock markets over the past five years has ensured that unit trusts do not look as strong as they might. Managers have little control over this. But their performance, relative to market indices is a different matter. And even the bid/offer spread is not enough to explain unit trusts' underperformance. According to Finstat, over the five years to July 1, the average UK General unit trust rose only 7.9 per cent, while the FT-A All Share index rose 29.0 per cent. Growth funds dropped 3 per cent, while the FT Ordinary Share index rose 9 per cent over the same period. Even over 10 years, UK General funds are up 366 per cent, while the FT-A All Share has increased by 440 per cent. Active fund management does not, on this evidence, seem to be worth paying for. This has led to the increasing popularity of 'index' or 'tracker' funds, which make no attempt to out-perform the index. Instead, they choose stocks deliberately to replicate the index as closely as possible. Their relative performance shows that they do better than most actively managed funds. For example, the James Capel UK Index fund is 21st out of 95 in the UK General sector over two years, with growth of 5.3 per cent; and Norwich Union's Index Tracking fund (19th) is up 5.4 per cent. Royal Life UK Index Tracking is 24th with growth of 5.0 per cent. Gartmore eases the load, Capel spreads the burden THESE FUNDS are ideal for lowering charges, as the costs involved should be less than for an active fund. Gartmore realised this, and followed the lead of Lazards and Murray Johnstone by cutting front-end charges on its UK Index Trust. It will now have no initial charge and an annual charge of only 0.5 per cent. There will still be a bid-offer spread of 1.9 per cent, which will reflect the costs incurred by the fund in share dealing. The fund is now one of the lowest charging trusts in the market. At the start of May, the average bid-offer spread in the UK General sector was 5.9 per cent, and in the UK Growth sector 6.1 per cent. Annual fees were normally 1 to 1.5 per cent. The investor who backs the Gartmore fund thus has a 4 per cent head-start over rival trusts (because of the lower initial charge) and a lead of 0.5 to 1 per cent a year, because of the lower annual charge. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. James Capel is also alive to the marketing opportunties of tracker funds. It is offering a portfolio service, allowing investors to switch between the company's six tracker funds - which cover the UK, UK smaller companies, America, Japan, the Far East and Europe. Initial charge will be 4.25 per cent, while the annual management charge for the portfolio service is 1 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 10,000.</p>

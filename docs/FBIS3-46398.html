			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Ho-teh (2621 4421 1795): "In Exclusive Interview, </F> British Representative to Joint Liaison Group Davis Says PWC  Cannot Be Mentioned in Same Breath as JLG"]    [Text]An Agreement Can Be Expected at Next Meeting on  Stonecutter's Navy Base    During an interview with Hong Kong journalists yesterday,  Hugh Davis, chief representative of the British side of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG], who has been in Hong  Kong for just four months to take up his new post, told our  newspaper that the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region is only an organ of study and consultation for the  Chinese side on the Hong Kong issue. It cannot be mentioned in  the same breath as the JLG.    During the interview, which lasted an hour or so, Davis  revealed that after two months of consultations, the Chinese  side has agreed to discuss with the British side the draft  regulations on the Airport Corporation. At the next experts  meeting of the defense and security group, Davis was quite  confident that the Stonecutter's Navy base issue will be  resolved. But he also admitted that it was a mistake that the  agreement reached between China and Britain on the Court of  Final Appeal had not won the support of Hong Kong's Legislative  Council [Legco]. However, such things often happened under a  democratic system.  <H5>  JLG Carrying Out "Underwater Activities" </H5>   Sino-British relations have become strained due to the  dispute over Hong Kong's political structure. It can be said  that the JLG is the only British organ in contact with the  Chinese side at present. But recently, the Chinese side has  made active preparations for setting up a second stove--the PWC.  The work and matters discussed by the PWC are almost the same  as those of the JLG. Has the JLG changed its functions then?    Davis admitted that the work of the JLG has progressed  slowly. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  JLG's function is to serve as a channel for communications  between China and Britain. However, the PWC is only a research  organ offering opinions to the Chinese side on matters affecting  Hong Kong. Therefore, both cannot be mentioned in the same  breath.    Davis emphasized that several international agreements,  which  had nothing to do with major issues, were adopted by the JLG at  its 28th meeting last December. The Chinese representative told  him that because of the political reform issue, it was hard for  the meeting to make any progress. He described Sino-British  relations at that time as being at the "tip of the iceberg."  Even so, the JLG had still carried out some "underwater"  activities.  <H3>  Guo Fengmin Was Informed of the Allocation of Funds for the  Airport on 15 December </H3>   Referring to the new airport issue, Davis said he did not  understand why the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman said the day  before yesterday that there had been no diplomatic contacts  between China and Britain on this issue. He said that on 15  December last year, he had personally informed Guo Fengmin of  the airport fund allocation scheme, and, 10 days ago, Alan Paul,  a member of the British side, had also presented a Legco  document on the plan to the Chinese side, hoping that the  Chinese side would discuss the issue with the British side or  give its opinions. Even this week, he had also made telephone  calls to the other side time and again, but the latter did not  give a definite reply.  <H3>  The Chinese Side Hints that a Meeting of the Airport  Committee May Be Held in March </H3>   Davis said he did not know when the airport committee  meeting  could be held, but disclosed that the Chinese side had agreed to  discuss the draft airport regulations with the British side  after a two-month consultation period. This indicates that the  meeting could possibly be held in March.    However, are the differences between both sides too big to  reach any agreement on the airport issue? Davis did not think  so. He stressed that in any talks, there is room for both sides  to take flexible measures. Therefore, the possibility that both  sides may change their stand should not be ruled out. The most  important thing is for the Chinese side to sit down and talk.    When asked whether this indicated that the British side  might  make concessions on this issue, Davis said it was unwise to say  that one would make concessions before sitting at the  negotiating table.    The Hong Kong Government will submit a bill on the Court of  Final Appeal to Legco. An agreement has already been reached by  the JLG on this bill, but it will not win the support of Legco  and other legal institutions. When asked whether this had been  erroneous assessment by the British side, Davis admitted that it  had been a mistake. However, the possibility of a similar  occurrence in the future could not be ruled out, he said.    He explained that under a democratic system, the  orientation of the administrative authority can not definitely  be endorsed by the legislative organ and the intentions of the  Legislative Council could not be clearly foreseen. Although the  British side believed that the agreement was not the best one  and had told the Chinese side this, under a situation where the  Chinese side was willing to talk, this was the only choice. In  the end, however, the matter should still be decided by Legco.    On the issue of the definition of a permanent resident,  which  the Hong Kong people are worried about at present, Davis said  this was a complicated and difficult issue. He was glad to see  that the Chinese side had attached increasing importance to this  issue recently.    He also said that both sides have agreed in principle that  Laurence M. Y. Leung, director of the Immigration Department,  will pay a visit to China. But the timing of his trip had not  been decided. So far, no response to this had been received.    Although certain headway has been made in the last few  rounds  of meetings on the issue of the Stonecutter's Island navy base,  which were held by the defense and security groups under the  JLG, no agreement had yet been reached. However, Davis said an  experts' meeting would be held very soon. If things go on  smoothly, he was quite confident that an agreement would be  reached. Both sides would bring their seals to the next meeting  and be ready to sign the agreement.    When asked why he was so sure of this, Davis refused to give  further details. He also refused to admit whether the British  side had made any concessions on the size of the future  Stonecutter's base for the People's Liberation Army. He only  stressed that both China and Britain had the common intention of  reaching an agreement.  <H3>  Realizing Importance of Patience After Four Months in His  New Post </H3>   Having been in his new post for four months, Davis said he  was still at a learning stage. His predecessor, Anthony  Galsworthy, had advised him to be "patient." Now he had begun  to realize the importance of being "patient." After taking up  his new job, he also discovered the seriousness of his  responsibilities, which have a bearing on the smooth transition  of Hong Kong in the future.    The only thing that had disappointed him was the slow  progress of the JLG's work. He said he would feel distressed if  things continued to go on like this.</p>

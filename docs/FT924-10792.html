			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: UK rules on insider dealing attacked - ISOCO Conference THE UK government's proposed legislation on insider dealing was attacked yesterday at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) conference by Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management, writes Norma Cohen. The directive, as proposed, defines inside information as any which 'may affect a company's business prospects'. It is intended to correspond to a more vaguely-worded European Community directive barring insider trading. Mr Myners said that that proposal leaves far too ambiguous a definition to enable fund managers and securities analysts to do their jobs. 'I believe that, unless these uncertainties are addressed by a more focused definition, we are likely to make the job of the securities analyst and portfolio manager almost impossible to perform,' he said. 'Uncertainties about what constitutes insider dealing are unacceptable,' he added. Mr Myners also pointed out several obstacles to a genuine cross-border business in investment management, both within the EC and further afield. First, inconsistencies in accounting conventions and access to information have hampered genuine cross-border investments because analysts in one country cannot easily understand the value of companies in others. He noted that under UK accounting, pharmaceuticals company SmithKline Beecham has negative net worth of Pounds 300m while under US accounting rules its shareholder funds are Pounds 3.5bn. 'This is a nonsense and something must be done about it,' he said. Also, French and German companies regularly make use of provisions and extraordinary items to smooth earnings, he added.

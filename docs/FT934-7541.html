			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Property: Building on trust - The impact of property owning charities Development trusts are treading where private sector property companies dare not venture. The trusts - property owning charities - are making a big impact in the regeneration of urban and rural areas, traditionally no-go areas for property companies. But the trusts are a fragile breed: of about 100 in England and Wales, probably 10 are financially self-sufficient. In many cases trusts behave like property companies, trying to develop and exploit assets to generate income. But the purpose behind the creation of trust assets is infinitely varied. A trust may be set up to support the business plans of young people, as in the case of Foothold Trust in Llanelli, south Wales, to hasten improvements on a housing estate, as in the case of Queens Pythian Development Trust in Liverpool, or to encourage wealth creation, as in the case of Moss Side and Hulme Community Trust in Manchester. Instead of distributing profits to shareholders, the trusts funnel their surplus back into the community in the form of grants or new schemes. The majority of trusts are registered charities. They reflect local ambitions and aim to respond to local needs. Because social and economic needs are more acute in poorer or derelict areas, the opportunities to tap potential investment targets are not immediately obvious to private sector companies: a town office development points towards easier profits than a mixed development in a bleak suburb or on a ramshackle estate. The existence of a trust frequently reflects a community group trying to fill a business gap in a way which provides a spin-off for the locality. In Birmingham, for example, the St Peter's Urban Village Trust started when a local group organised a financial package in 1985 to buy a Church of England training college and its grounds, which could not find a commercial buyer. Other trusts started because of historical quirks. The largest and oldest with about Pounds 20m of assets is the North Kensington Amenity Trust. It started in 1970 when local authorities sought to placate a community angered by the building of the overhead A40(M) in west London by offering to give over for community use 23 acres of land beneath the motorway. Similarly, community opposition to office development plans on the south bank of the Thames eventually led to Coin Street Community Builders - a coalition of local residents - winning ownership of 13 acres of riverfront land from the Greater London Council. Ownership of land and buildings is the key to financial self-sufficiency for trusts. The problem for younger trusts is the difficulty of setting up an adequate asset base. Ms Angela Monaghan, director of the Development Trusts Association, which brings together about half the trusts in England and Wales, says there are three main problems. First, it is now more difficult for local authorities to dispose of land at less than the highest price offered; authorities have to sell to the highest bidder unless the environment secretary agrees otherwise. Second, some types of grant aid, such as regional selective assistance, are not available to registered charities. This may prove of less significance following the government's announcement this month that it is to consolidate its urban spending programmes. Third is the shortage of development finance. Trusts are not taken seriously by financial institutions. 'There is a finance gap,' she says. The gap has widened since the collapse of the property market in 1989 and does not look like improving until the market revives and banks overcome their ambivalence towards property lending. It is doubtful whether today it would be possible to obtain a 100 per cent mortgage of the type provided to St Peter's by National Westminster in 1985. As a result, trusts have been pushed back on to an increasingly financially constrained public sector for support, encouraging them to win a role in established programmes such as City Challenge, which funnels government funding into closely defined geographical areas. If trusts can hang on they may find their futures secure as the successors to such programmes, which generally are of limited duration. 'They are operating in marginal areas where they require some public-sector finance to make them work,' Ms Monaghan said. 'If they're not given support, through revenue or capital assets, they won't become self-sufficient.' Even when self-sufficiency has been achieved, the line between failure and financial stability is slim. North Kensington Amenity Trust, for example, is negotiating with the Department of Transport, its freeholder since the demise of the Greater London Council, on its ground rent. The department is obliged to charge a commercial rent. Previously the trust paid peppercorn rent. Payment of a commercial rent would wipe the trust out. St Peter's trust in Birmingham has been in modest financial surplus, Pounds 40,323 in the year to last April; it makes its money from workshops, offices, student accommodation, a youth hostel, shop and social club, while providing a centre for sports and cultural activities. But St Peter's trust has to find Pounds 74,000 to meet new environmental health regulations on its student accommodation. It is still searching for the cheapest finance. Such demands for higher expenditure have come when market conditions have increased the vulnerability of the trusts. Like their private sector peers, they have had to cope with a shift in the balance of power from the property owner to the occupier as demand for space has dropped during the recession. At North Kensington trust, rental income for the year to last April was marginally higher than the year before at Pounds 866,778. At St Peter's, income for the 12 months to April was slightly lower than the previous year at Pounds 323,491. These overall figures hide big changes. Office rents at North Kensington trust are down to Pounds 9 a square foot from a high of Pounds 20 sq ft in the late 1980s. The trust has a waiting list for craft workshops, but instead of being able to lease the space, it is obliged to license the space for six- or nine-month spells. At one stage St Peter's had a third of its workshop space vacant as small companies succumbed to recession. Now it has only one, but it has refused to discount its Pounds 3.50 rental. The trusts need a revival of economic activity and a return of business confidence, the necessary precursors of a wider demand for space, as much as any property company.</p>

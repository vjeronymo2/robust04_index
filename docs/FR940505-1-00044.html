			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, we see the development of the final federal implementation plans due in February of 1995 as a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> real  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> opportunity for local communities, in conjunction with federal and state authorities, to build air quality plans that can be successfully implemented. Optimally, this process will also provide state and local authorities with workable ideas and strategies that can be incorporated into the 1994 ozone plans, thus facilitating recision of all or significant parts of the FIPs. Through the enhanced notice and comment process each participant_state, local, federal, and every interested member of the public_will have the opportunity to take responsibility where it should be taken, and to work cooperatively where it can be done. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Solicitation of Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposals contained in today's NPRM will be accepted throughout the public process described above. EPA expects to hold public hearings in early July, 1994 and expects that the deadline for written comments will be approximately 30 days after the public hearings. EPA will give notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the public hearings and public comment deadline as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior to the hearing dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA encourages the public to participate both through formal hearing and written comments as well as in the informal workshop and focus meeting forums described above. Workshops will be held in each FIP area in mid to late March 1994. Throughout today's NPRM, EPA has encouraged the public to comment on specific issues and alternatives. We expect that these issues will be appropriate for further examination in informal workshop and focus meeting forums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background and Proposed SIP Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Description of the Affected Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sacramento Area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sacramento area includes all of Sacramento and Yolo Counties, the northeast portion of Solano County, the southern portion of Sutter County, and all of El Dorado and Placer Counties except for the Lake Tahoe area. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The population of this area is approximately 1.6 million, and is projected to increase to 1.9 million by 2000 and 2.2 million by 2005. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The annual personal income of the area exceeds $30 billion. The economy is dominated by agricultural, commercial, and service sectors, with almost no heavy industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> At the time EPA's FIP obligation arose, the Sacramento nonattainment area did not include any portions of El Dorado and Sutter Counties. These portions were added in revised designations promulgated in conformance with the 1990 Amendments. See 56 FR 58694, 56726 (November 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Population projections for 2000 and 2005 are based on the latest SACOG data and do not yet include estimates from the northeast portion of Solano County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mobile sources, particularly motor vehicles, are the dominant source of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the Sacramento area. By 1999, mobile sources will account for approximately 50 percent of VOC emissions and over 90 percent of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. Industrial, commercial, and residential solvents and coatings are also significant sources of VOC, contributing almost 30 percent of VOC emissions in 1999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Violations of the ozone NAAQS occur in the Sacramento area from as early as April through mid-November, although most violations in recent years have been confined to the warmer months of June through October. The Sacramento ozone design value at the time of classification was 0.16 ppm (based on 1987&hyph;1989 data), substantially above the NAAQS for ozone, which is 0.12 ppm, measured as a one-hour average. Over the period 1990&hyph;1992, the design value was still 0.16 ppm. For this 1990&hyph;1992 measurement period, only four areas had a higher design value: South Coast (.30 ppm); the Southeast Desert area, immediately to the east of the South Coast (.23 ppm); Houston/Galveston (.21 ppm); and San Diego (.17 ppm).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this design value, the Sacramento area was classified as ``Serious'' under section 181(a) of the Clean Air Act, with an attainment deadline of no later than November 15, 1999. See 56 FR 56728. However, according to EPA's most recent national air quality and emissions trends data (through calendar year 1992), the area also has the eighth largest number of average expected exceedances of the ozone standard in the country (9.0 days). <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Outside of southern and central California, only the Houston and Philadelphia areas have a greater number of expected exceedances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The average estimated number of exceedances is the number of days the 0.12 ppm standard was exceeded on average at the site recording the highest second maximum 1-hour concentration, after adjustment for incomplete or missing data days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This unusual frequency of exceedances_coupled with the absence of easy-to-control pollution sources, the immense emissions reductions needed, the rapid population growth predicted for this area, and the possibility that some of the ozone violations in Sacramento may be due primarily to transport of pollution from the south and southwest_suggest the appropriateness of a bump-up to a ``Severe'' classification, in accordance with the provisions of section 181(b)(3). See discussion below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Urban airshed modeling suggests that a 40 percent reduction in current levels of VOC coupled with a 30 percent reduction in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions would be needed for attainment. As displayed in a table included in the Sacramento FIP attainment demonstration (see section III.H.3.a.), other combinations of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions also could yield attainment, but in EPA's judgment the 40:30 option appears to have a greater potential to minimize dislocation and inequities among source categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ventura Area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Ventura area includes all of Ventura County, which lies on the California coast between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties. The 1990 population was 660,000 and is projected to increase to 840,000 by 2005. The County ranks third in California in petroleum production and 17th in the Country in agricultural income. Twenty-five percent of the work force commute to jobs in Los Angeles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura's emissions inventory is less dominated by the mobile source component than is Sacramento's. For the year 2005, mobile sources account for approximately 40 percent of VOC emissions and 70 percent of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. The ozone season extends from April through November, but very few violations have been recorded before June.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Head of State Eduard Shevaradnadze by Nato </F> Oniani; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Good morning. We are presenting the  chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, Eduard  Shevardnadze's radio interview. Batoni Eduard, Russian Defense  Minister Grachev's visit to Tbilisi was apparently the past  week's major event. Yet another concrete step was taken in the  handling of the Abkhazian conflict.    Considering recent developments could you please give yet  another answer to a question you have been asked before. How  interested is Russia in the settlement of the Abkhazian  conflict, I mean the Russia that celebrated the day of the  declaration of its sovereignty yesterday and has just begun to  apprehend its sovereignty and independence? You have also  answered the next question before but it is more interesting to  hear an answer today: Could this kind of settlement of the  Abkhazian issue cause irritation in the West and especially in  the United States?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. With regard to  Russian Defense Minister [Pavel] Grachev's visit to Georgia, you  know that I highly appreciated it especially because apart from  this visit there were two rather significant telephone  conversations with the Russian president, one at the beginning  of the visit and the other after it. As you know, Mr. Yeltsin  has already issued a edict on the deployment of peace-keeping  forces in Abkhazia. In our second telephone conversation he  confirmed that by signing the document he showed his  understanding of the seriousness of the obligations Russia and  the CIS are taking in providing assistance pertaining to this  mission.    The UN Security Council is to meet soon. Provided the  Security Council passes a resolution on expanding the mandate of  its observers to which Russia's consent already exists, we shall  be seeing quite interesting developments. The very deployment  of troops will be related to preliminary measures on  mine-clearing on roads, crossroads, bridges, and simply in a  certain area and this is rather a laborious and risky job. This  work, I mean the deployment of the troops, will apparently begin  on the 15th or 16th [month not stated].    I have said that we are dealing with a very interesting  case.  Why? One on hand, we have the CIS and Russia's peace-keeping  mission as a regular organization, and on the other hand, a  powerful institute of UN observers and the [UN] Refugee  Commissioner's office whose activities will constitute a  significant factor. Thus, the CIS, the Russian troops with a  peacekeeping mission, the international control, and a very  important team from the Refugee Commissioner's office which will  provide refugees returning to their homes with as much material  and financial assistance as possible.    For a country in our situation, this is an optimum variant.  I would say an optimum and, taking into consideration this  factor, an interesting variant.    I had three substantial and rather lengthy talks with  Grachev. We considered almost all aspects of our relations  including the situation in Caucasia through the spectrum of  Russia and Georgia. We considered the present situation in the  Georgian armed forces and the situation in the Russian troops  stationed in Georgia. I have to say that they are grateful to  the population of Georgia and the authorities who created normal  living and service conditions. We have also considered  important issues of mutual relations, especially Russia's  participation in the building of Georgian armed forces. You may  be well aware that without that we will not be able to create  our national army.    We have often emphasized that Russian-Georgian cooperation  and mutual agreement by no means contradicts the interests of  other countries. On the contrary, it is directed toward peace  and stability in Caucasia and even a broader region. In my  opinion, stability meets the interest of Georgia as well as  Russia and other countries. This was the topic of my telephone  conversations with Mr. Boris Yeltsin. These conversations were  a logical continuation of positive moves in Russian-Georgian  relations which started after the Russian president's visit to  Tbilisi.    As for the final part of your question, I have already said  that a unique pattern of the settlement of a conflict is being  created. [passage omitted] We can see the cooperation, mutual  understanding, and mutual respect of Russia, the CIS, the  Western countries, Georgia's friends [words indistinct]  including the United States. In the event the plan is  implemented, I think this experience will acquire great  significance for the future, for the settlement of other  conflicts.    Speaking of irritation, I consider this unfounded. I was  gravely concerned by symptoms of confrontation between the  United States and Russia which were seen recently. Fortunately,  the leaders of the two states demonstrated sufficient wisdom and  prudence to prevent these symptoms from transforming into real  confrontation. The situation is quite normal at the moment and  these two great states act in an atmosphere of mutual  understanding. The settlement of the Abkhazian conflict may  become a model for the implementation of new international  relations. To speak of changes in a post-cold-war period, this  may become a concrete and very characteristic example of the  cooperation of the international community in handling a  conflict. I also pin great hopes on UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali [words indistinct]    [Oniani] Batoni Eduard, last Sunday could be described as a  day of elections. Despite the fact that certain circles  expected something extraordinary from the elections, they were  held in a calm and normal atmosphere in Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku,  and Tsalenjikha. On the other hand, there were certain excesses  in Rustavi. Grave violations were observed. Unsealed boxes  containing papers were brought to some polling stations. Armed  units appeared in the city and they exerted pressure on voters  and even on members of the electoral commission. The chairman  and some members of the commission were forced to flee from  Rustavi and arrived in Tbilisi. This abnormal situation was  observed in Rustavi at about 1800.    [Shevardnadze] The elections in Samegrelo, with such an  active participation of voters -- according to official reports  over 60 percent of voters came to the polling stations [words  indistinct] -- were a great success. I would like to thank the  citizens, the authorities, the electoral commissions of Zugdidi,  Chkhorotsku, and Tsalenjikha as well as the Committee for  Emergency Situations in western Georgia. [passage omitted] I  congratulate all the elected candidates. [passage omitted]    As for what happened in Rustavi, this is very regrettable.  However, I am not pessimistic. This event could be considered  as a lesson for the citizens of Rustavi as well as for all of  Georgia. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, the day of elections  turned out to be very difficult. I want to draw one conclusion  from this case. I am saying this for everyone to hear and  everyone should consider it for the future. When money and  force govern elections, elections have nothing to do with  democracy [words indistinct]. This must be taken into  consideration by all parties, all political forces, and all who  intend to participate in elections in the future. This must be  remembered by all. [passage omitted] The citizens of Rustavi  and the electoral commission will be able to look into the case  and make the appropriate decisions. [passage omitted]    [Oniani] In your previous interview you said that materials  about the illegal activities of political parties and officials  would again be published in the press. Certain facts were made  public last week, too. Now, if we draw certain conclusions from  those and previous publications and assemble the links into a  chain, the question of who will be next arises. This question  arises also because the scale of corruption indicates that it is  not only one or two people who are involved in this criminal  activity. There are indications that the topic of a struggle  against organized crime and corruption will be given priority at  tomorrow's parliament session. Last week, your address to the  parliament was made public. The address called for drafting  laws and adopting measures to fight this kind of crime.    [Shevardnadze] I do not know what the parliament will  discuss  tomorrow but I would say that the publication of individual  facts should be welcomed. [passage omitted]    The main point is to create a system of fighting against  corruption. It is essential to ensure state control and  coordination of the system, to create a legislature taking into  account all the changes that have occurred in recent years.  [passage omitted]    I appealed to parliament to expedite the drafting of laws  and  make decisions on the fight against crime, and I hope they will  do it as they did with drafting economic laws whose effects and  signs of implementation we can already see. [passage omitted]    [Oniani] Processes that have been under way in our republic  lately are a cause for optimism. Several important documents  have been issued. An idea has been initiated in Kutaisi in  connection with strengthening the coupon. They have created  their own methods. The edict regarding the savings bank is also  of a great importance. You have already talked about this but I  think there may be some news about that because the process has  started.    [Shevardnadze] I am grateful that you brought this issue  forward. I would like to express my ardent support for  everything done in Kutaisi. This is an autonomous way of  managing a city, its economic and financial spheres. [passage  omitted] I issued a special edict which gives the Kutaisi  leadership more rights and possibilities to make large-scale  decisions on certain issues. I have to say that the Kutaisi  authorities have interesting plans about how to make the coupon  stronger, although some people might say that it seems very  difficult to imagine how this can be done in an individual city.  [passage omitted]    I also issued an edict granting the Tbilisi mayoralty  expanded rights and I can already see how the city has changed.  We can speak of the city's artistic and creative life and many  other things and all these result from conferring the right to  take an initiative to the local authorities.    Taking into account the slight easing of the situation, I  can  say that the time has come for bold experiments. In this  connection I would like to thank you for reminding me of the  issue of the savings bank. It is a great thing as an  experiment. This was initiated by the president of the bank  together with his colleagues. [passage omitted] What is the  point [of the savings bank experiment]? The point is that  banking is being transferred to a market economy. Depositors are  becoming shareholders, or rather owners of the bank. When the  bank's president suggested that the state should reduce its  share to the minimum in favor of depositors, I agreed to the  idea. In this case a depositor becomes not a simple shareholder  but a serious owner. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRATEFUL EX-GI'S SON BUYS AND FIXES UP LEGION HALL  </P> <P> Out of work and far from his family after the end of World War II, a  Japanese-American ex-GI was turned away from other American Legion halls  because of his race. But he ate Thanksgiving dinner at Beverly Hills Post No.  253.  </P> <P> The memory of that meal was still warm four decades later, when his son heard  about Post 253's plight: Faced with the need to put on a $50,000 roof that the  post could not afford, its commander was offering to surrender the bunker-like  meeting hall to developers in exchange for space in a new office building, but  there were no takers.  </P> <P> The son, who asked that his family not be identified by name, sent a copy of  the story to his father, now a prosperous Northern California businessman.  </P> <P> The father consulted with his brothers, fellow veterans of the 442nd Regimental  Combat Team, a largely Japanese-American unit that fought with distinction in  Italy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Welcome Exception  </P> <P> "These guys went straight from the (internment) camps to the front lines," the  son recalls. As Japanese-Americans, they were not welcomed everywhere when they  came home, but the Thanksgiving dinner on Robertson Boulevard was an exception.  </P> <P> "My dad and uncles said, 'These people let us in!' So I bought the property for  a substantial amount of money."  </P> <P> The sale was recorded April 24. But there will be no new building. Instead, the  American Legion post will retain control of its meeting hall for five years,  paying rent of $1 a month.  </P> <P> The new owner already has sent workers to install the new roof, paint the walls  inside and out, and put in a new kitchen and bar.  </P> <P> After five years, he plans to take control of the building and convert it into  a restaurant or some other venture.  </P> <P> "I'll think about it then," said the buyer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meeting Place Assured  </P> <P> But the veterans will be able to keep meeting within its nine-inch-thick  concrete walls at least one Monday a month until the year 2014, if there are  enough of them around to keep the post going.  </P> <P> The Legion's bylaws require that veterans must have served in wartime to be  eligible for membership. By 2014, even the youngest of the relatively few  Vietnam vet Legionnaires will be nearing old age.  </P> <P> "You can't ask for anything better. When you've found an angel, you don't need  a developer," said Ruth Langes, a Coast Guard veteran who is adjutant of the  post. She also chairs the board of the Beverly Hills American Legion Community  Clubhouse Inc., a separate legal entity that owns the meeting hall and its  6,612-square-foot lot on Robertson Boulevard.  </P> <P> The post has been meeting there since the building was erected in 1937, but it  came into its glory days during World War II, when Marlene Dietrich sang for  servicemen and Red Skelton drew crowds there with impromptu performances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Years of Neglect  </P> <P> That period of prosperity was followed by years of neglect. The World War I  vets who founded the organization grew old and died, many of their younger  comrades from World War II turned their attention elsewhere and Vietnam vets  hardly joined at all.  </P> <P> "That's why this makes sense for us," said the 31-year-old buyer. "Most of  these guys won't be alive in 25 years, and at the end of 25 years the building  is mine. . . . When I'm 50 years old, it's going to be worth a lot."  </P> <P> Purchased from the city of Beverly Hills for $10 in 1936, the land was recently  valued at about $1 million.  </P> <P> But it had little appeal for developers, because the Legion's demand for space  on the ground floor would have meant a drastic reduction in rental income from  an office building or other commercial development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zoning Restrictions  </P> <P> Any project would have been further complicated by zoning regulations, which  limit construction to three stories or 45 feet in height and require two  stories of underground parking.  </P> <P> "You're never going to be able to tear that building down. It's not economical  to tear it down," the buyer said.  </P> <P> Although sales records indicate that the full price of the property was  $200,000, the real estate agent who arranged the deal said that future payments  will bring the total cost to nearly $1 million.  </P> <P> For now, the new paint job and other improvements are bringing back some  members who have not been seen around the meeting hall for years, Langes said.  </P> <P> "We're getting quite a crowd at our monthly meeting, which is beautiful," she  said. "This last time we had 25 people in there, which is more than we've had  in ages."  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills group has 326 members. But it is expected to increase to more  than 500 in June, when it is scheduled to be merged with the Palomar post,  which now meets in a Knights of Columbus hall in downtown Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The trial of eight anti-abortion activists charged with trespassing during  protests at San Diego-area clinics began Friday amid a continuous stream of  objections from prosecutors and defense lawyers.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Gregory Anthony and Daniel Winfree said Friday in San Diego  Municipal Court that the protesters were involved in "peaceful political  activity" -- an exception to the city code under which the activists were  cited.  </P> <P> The trial is considered a prelude to the cases of 134 activists who have been  charged with more serious misdemeanors stemming from protests April 8, 29 and  June 10. The first of those trials begins next Wednesday in Municipal Court,  involving eight activists charged with conspiracy.  </P> <P> If convicted of the trespass charges, the eight now on trial each could be  sentenced to a maximum of a $250 fine. The case resumes Monday before court  Commissioner James L. Duchnick.  </P></p>

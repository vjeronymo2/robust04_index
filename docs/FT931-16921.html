			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Overspend by BBC may rise to Pounds 90m FEARS ARE growing that the potential overspend at the BBC is substantially more than previously admitted publicly. The BBC has conceded that because of 'a series of reporting and control failures' there had been an overspend of Pounds 38m in 1991-92 at BBC Television. The overall BBC budget was, however, balanced by the end of that financial year. In addition, BBC Television has ordered Pounds 20m cuts to deal with a potential overspend in this financial year but admitted that the total would be higher. A further Pounds 12m in savings has already been asked for. Senior BBC staff believe the total involved over the two years might be more than Pounds 90m, although the figure is not confirmed. There are concerns that no one knows precisely the state of BBC Television finances and whether all the 'reporting and control failures' have been dealt with. A governors' audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the BBC governors and a former chief secretary to the Treasury, found there was no evidence of fraud. As a result of the overspend, the BBC is believed to be approaching its Pounds 200m borrowing limit. The issue will mean a difficult debut for Mr John Birt, the new BBC director-general who has taken over from Sir Michael Checkland. Mr Birt is looking for a Pounds 50m contingency fund, partly in case there are any unexpected recurrences of financial difficulties in the 1993-94 financial year. The atmosphere of cuts and savings at BBC Television will make it more difficult for Mr Birt to realise his vision of a BBC which offers a more distinctive service which is less reliant on cheap, imported programmes. Distinctive UK-made programmes will cost more than imported programmes. Mr Birt hopes to make substantial savings through Producer Choice. The scheme gives producers the right to buy services in the external market if they are more cost-effective.</p>

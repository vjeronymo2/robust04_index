			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Dubovskiy, under the rubric "Opinion": </F> "Russian Aftershock Inflation: How They Explain It and What They  Plan to Do About It"]    [Text] Psychologists have a well-known recommendation: if  you are tired of a small boy's endless "why's," tell him:  because the perpendicular. The child will be stymied, and the  questions will run out. If this doesn't help, distract him with  a toy, and in the extreme case give him a slap. This  psychological device is being applied rather successfully now to  the mass consciousness.    Why has our country--a world exporter of energy that has  freed itself not only from the burden of state orders for the  military-industrial complex (nearly 20 percent of the GNP) but  also from its role as donor to contiguous regions (another 20  percent of the GNP)--fallen into utter impoverishment instead of  flourishing economically? we ask yet again. Because, my dears,  reforms have to be paid for, the agitprop warriors among our  advisers, experts, commentators, and film directors have  replied. Who must we pay and why isn't everyone paying? we ask  again, puzzled.    The first parts of scenes like this are often played out now  in the SMI [mass information media] when talk begins about the  persistent aftershock inflation that has been going on for more  than two years now, to the incessant music of promises of  financial stabilization by the end of the quarter, the year, or  the decade. A whole bouquet of agitprop replies to questions as  to the causes of inflation has already been gathered.    An almost mystical and therefore extremely convincing  response is contained in the president's message to parliament:  "When price liberalization was deployed, the inflationary energy  that had been building up for years burst to the surface." The  flame of Vesuvius and Hiroshima, the wail and moan of the  citizens! Right away we see that the Great Reformers had nothing  to do with it. If someone is guilty, then it is Granddad Lenin  and Trotskiy the Jew.    A very scientific "political-economic" answer is offered by  M. Delyagin (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 24 February 1994): "The basic  source of structural inflation is not the tendency of domestic  prices toward world prices but the sale of inefficient  monopoly-status enterprises in the processing industry." Also:  "This is an inevitable process, the natural consequence of  profound structural disproportions in the economy." From the  standpoint of psychology, the reply is fairly successful, since  in the mass consciousness a monopoly is a terrible thing from  which you have to expect the very worst. He doesn't do as well  with his proofs, which for some reason are cited in the form of  two examples that relate to export-import restrictions, not  inflation.    M. Delyagin evidently does not understand that if the export  of oil is restricted by a special license quota and the export  of processing industry goods is not restricted by anything, then  the dynamics of their domestic prices have to be different. In  exactly the same way, restrictions on the import of sugar  inevitably lead to domestic prices exceeding the world price.  The history of foreign trade relations is full of such examples  of divergences between world and domestic prices, from the  "bread laws" in England in the first half of the nineteenth  century, according to which taxes were levied on the import of  grain in order to support high domestic prices, to the so-called  trade war between the United States and Japan going on today,  which consists of the constant review of mutual restrictions on  export-import operations.    If we are talking about so-called inefficient enterprises,  then ignorance in tax assessment and foreign trade policy could  bring even the most efficient branch to a halt, as happened  recently here with the production of vodka. An increase in the  excise from 0.85 to 0.9 raised the price of vodka by 50 percent  and made it uncompetitive in comparison with imported vodka. It  took the loss of hundreds of billions of rubles in excise duties  for the authorities to realize this and correct their mistake.  This example brilliantly illustrates the extreme superficiality  of conducting propaganda discussions about Russia's inefficient  processing industry in isolation from an analysis of taxation,  export-import restrictions, wages, and transportation costs.    Actually, in agitprop political economy, it is all right to  disdain not only the realia of life but also statistical facts.  We are told as if it were an achievement that in the years  1992-93 the purchasing power of the dollar in the Russian market  fell by a factor of more than 12. Weekly observations of this  indicator by the FinIst AO (joint-stock company), which are  widely published in the business press, and the assessments of  other independent sources give a figure closer to 5. Not a bad  difference, is it?    This is the question that should be asked: If the  explanations for inflation cited are nothing but psychological  devices for working on the mass consciousness, then is it  impossible to espy the author's intent? The plan set forth below  has been tested with the help of a model based on real  statistics.    The January price jump of 1992 not only moved the economic  system to a point of equilibrium between supply and demand but  destroyed, along with the population's savings, the circulating  funds of enterprises, without which production is impossible.  Instantly, money became a bottleneck, as a result of which, at  the new point of equilibrium, the economic system became less  productive and, accordingly, the tax base narrowed.    Simultaneously, the government transferred part of the  state-owner's traditional income to private  structures--commercial banks and export-import firms. This was  done in order to create a social base to ensure support for the  government.    The loss of state budgetary income and taxes immediately  created a deficit that had to be covered by the emission of  "extra" money. That is how aftershock inflation got started.  Inflation ate into enterprises' already meager circulating  funds, the volume of nonpayments grew to a quarter of the GNP,  and it became necessary to carry out a mutual debt cancellation  and compensate for the inflationary loss of circulating funds  with credits, which required an additional emission of payment  means.    The nightmare of what was going on was added to by the  organization of the ruble zone, in which more than ten Central  Banks were already competing in emission.    Therefore Ye.T. Gaydar is formally correct when he says that  rates of aftershock inflation have been determined by the  amounts of credit compensation for inflationary losses of  circulating funds and by the deficit in the state budget for the  financing of social systems. However, he says nothing about how  aftershock therapy was started with his direct participation and  why over the last two years all possible levers for  stabilization have not been employed.    The political intention or mistakes in January are quite  specific: the carrying out of a total price jump in a poor  market without land outside the cities, real estate, or the  means of production; the uncontrolled liberalization of foreign  trade and foreign currency operations; the transfer of state  income to private structures; the absence of a set, controllable  mechanism of behavior for the directors of state enterprises;  and the organization of the ruble zone.    Actually, these mistakes could still have been corrected,  inasmuch as all reserves and levers of management were still in  government hands. In order to evaluate these reserves, let us  use official data, although they sometimes look simply  anecdotal. For instance, it has been reported (ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA, 8 February 1994) that in 1993 the state budget deficit  was 7 percent of the GNP and credits were 19 percent of the GNP.  These figures correspond to an average monthly rate of inflation  of about 13 percent, therefore they remain wholly on the  conscience of the Ministry of Finance, if such a concept is  allowable for a ministry.    If we are to believe the data of Goskomstat (State Committee  for Statistics), then Russia's positive foreign trade balance in  1992 totaled about 35 percent of the GNP (approximately 20  percent was attributed to donor assistance to the former  republics of the Soviet Union and 15 percent to the flight of  hard currency capital abroad). In 1993, the same balance totaled  approximately 23 percent of the GNP (12 and 11 percent,  respectively). In these figures lies the quintessence of  everything that the government has done. Here is the ruble zone,  and the "humanitarian" supplies to friendly regimes, and the  transfers of state income to private structures. The amounts of  this foreign trade balance are such that it undoubtedly could  have covered any real deficit in the state budget and,  accordingly, cut off the road to inflation. Ye.T. Gaydar is  correct when he writes that the inflationary rivers of the  Central Bank dump into foreign commercial banks. He merely  forgets to mention that it is the flight of capital to foreign  commercial banks that is causing the inflationary flows out of  the Central Bank, and the government has not only failed to  fulfill its obligation to construct a dam on the course of these  flows but has actually taken down what barriers there were.    What have the government and the Central Bank done in 1993?  To the credit of the Central Bank, with the introduction of a  Russian national currency, the ruble zone was eliminated, but  the government continued to supply virtually free resources to  the former republics of the Soviet Union, although it did reduce  their volume by about 40 percent. Simultaneously, the government  compensated with the help of loans for some of enterprises'  inflationary losses, thus attempting to avert a collapse. The  decline has continued, however, and the corresponding narrowing  of the tax base has eaten into the economies made on donor  assistance to the former republics. The government has utilized  one other reserve: it has simply failed to pay salaries. Now the  1994 administration has to pay the debts of the 1993  administration.    Today three basic economic scenarios that are still possible  without freezing prices and incomes are being examined. The  first, harsh scenario proposes carrying out stabilization by  liquidating the state budget deficit and compensation credits to  enterprises at the expense of a final destruction of social  systems and the processing industry. It is this scenario that 7  percent of the voters voted for in the elections of 12 December,  and the Russia's Choice faction represents it honorably in the  State Duma.    The second scenario proposes a continuation of the policy of  the latter half of 1993, that is, moderate selective  compensation credits to enterprises and a continuation of the  financial suffocation of the social systems, accompanied by a  curtailment of donor assistance to the former Soviet republics.  According to this scenario, the economic decline must continue  and, accordingly, the tax base will narrow. The drop of national  income into the state budget will have to be compensated for  either by new emission, that is, increased inflation, or at the  expense of further cuts in donor assistance to the former  republics. This development, however, cannot continue for more  than a year, since the sources of its existence (allowable  amounts of inflation and cuts in donor assistance) will come to  an end. Real stabilization is not to be seen here.    Finally, the third scenario proposes quick stabilization at  the expense of total utilization of all the above-described  reserves, that is, a simultaneous halt in the flight of capital  and in donor assistance. Carrying out this scenario requires not  only a strong but also a well-qualified government, which Russia  has not had since the days of Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin.    It goes without saying that each of these scenarios risks  specific social and political consequences (strikes, civil  disobedience, sabotage, a change of regimes in contiguous  territories, separatism, requests for reunification, and so on).  Therefore, each of these scenarios could be cut short or altered  by sufficiently powerful social groups.    In conclusion, I want to emphasize that what has been said  here, the ideas and assessments, are by no means unique. Various  experts using various methods have, independently of one  another, come to the same conclusions at various times.  Therefore I will conclude with a quotation from an article by an  economic advisor to the Labor group in the British Parliament,  John Rossi (DELOVOY MIR, 21-27 February 1994): "Crisis has come  about only because, in complete contradiction of its national  interests and economic logic, Russia has allowed an export of  capital in the amount of approximately $30 billion at the very  moment when it had a large international indebtedness and a huge  demand for resources for capital investment into its own economy  and for financing the budget deficit."</p>

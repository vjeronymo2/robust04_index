			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Estonian Interior Minister  Heiki Arike said at a press conference today some changes in the  structure of the country's police forces will be made in the  near future.    Arike maintained Estonia is in the clutches of a confidence  crisis which involves also the Interior Ministry and the police.    "The specific functions of some departments have not been  defined clearly enough," the minister claimed. "This often gives  rise to situations where a department, to establish its  superiority to others, withholds vital information."    Arike said the Estonian police currently employs about 1,000  detectives and only 600 officers; that is, more men are engaged  in investigating crimes than in preventing them.    The interior minister pointed out the need for setting up  economic security structures. The Estonian economic police so  far works on an elementary level, he claimed.    Italy and Finland have offered Estonia assistance in  training  policemen investigating economic crimes. Italian experts are  now in Estonia to prepare study plans for a seminar in March.    Arike said the authorities are also considering the  formation  of a special police unit to trace illegal aliens in Estonia.    The interior minister regarded policemen's knowledge of the  Estonian language as a major problem. Under a government  decree, all policemen who haven't by Feb. 1 passed the language  exam are to be dismissed. Only those non-Estonian-speaking  policemen's labor contracts may be extended who have a higher or  a special police education.    "The dismissal of a great number of policemen at once is  very  dangerous," Arike said. "Those people know well the structure,  the equipment and capacity of the police; if they should go over  to crime, it would have terrible consequences."    The minister said the new head of the Police Department will  be appointed within a month. At present Chancellor of the  Interior Ministry Gero Kartau is the acting director general of  the Police Department. Former director Igor Amann was dismissed  on Jan. 14.    Arike said his ministry pays much attention also to  regulating the relations between the ministry leadership and  departments, and defining the functions of the ministry's  subdivisions.</p>

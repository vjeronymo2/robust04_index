			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Insurers hold bonuses static More insurance companies announced their 1994 bonus rates for with-profits policies this week. The general trend is still for static or slightly lower bonuses, although a few insurers have announced special additional bonuses for longer-term policies. Actual maturity values for policies paying out this year are mostly lower for 10-year terms, but there are both slight increases and minor cuts over 25 years. Many insurers have warned that bonus rates are likely to fall over the next few years, as investment returns are expected to be lower. Guardian Royal Exchange, which no longer sells with-profits endowments, is the lowest payer so far: the maturity value of a 10-year policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, is Pounds 4,952, while a 25-year policy is worth Pounds 44,379. Sun Alliance is better, at Pounds 6,115 and Pounds 52,640, both of which are up a little from last year. Scottish Mutual has increased payouts over both 10 and 25 year terms. The 10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,785, up 2.6 per cent, and the 25-year figure is Pounds 63,205, up 14.7 per cent. Commercial Union improved its 25-year pay-out by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 65,599, the highest 25-year pay-out announced so far this year, while its 10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,807, down 5 per cent but still better than average. The highest 10-year pay-outs so far are from Royal London, at Pounds 7,198, and the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses, at Pounds 7,060, though it revises its rates in April. NPI, which specialises in pensions business, has cut pay-outs by an average of 5 per cent. A sum of Pounds 10,000 paid into a 10-year single-premium pension plan, for a man retiring at age 65, would now be worth Pounds 35,508, down 10 per cent, while a 25-year policy would pay Pounds 169,366, up 2 per cent.</p>

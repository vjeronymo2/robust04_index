			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan peaks again after remarkable quarter - Taipei is up by more than 50 per cent this year as the 'Big Hands' return The new Chinese lunar year has brought an end to a three-year slump in the Taiwan stock market. Its weighted index hit a new 1993 high yesterday, up 153.45, or 3.2 per cent to 4,948.62 on interest rate hopes. This leaves it up 7.5 per cent on the week, and by 57 per cent since its 1993 low on January 9. Turnover has returned to levels unseen since the heady days of 1989. Yesterday it was an active TDollars 77.65bn (USDollars 3bn) against Thursday's TDollars 74.67bn. As far back as March 4 it hit TDollars 99.3bn, a sign that Taiwan's speculative retail investors, and so-called 'Big Hands', had finally returned. The atmosphere could not have been more in contrast with the despondent days of 1992, and while short-term profit-taking will continue, the index looks set to go higher. The catalyst for the market's resurgence was the short-term resolution of the political rift that had been threatening to tear apart the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party. February's resignation of the ageing conservative premier, Hau Pei-tsun, and his replacement by an acolyte of the more liberal President Lee Teng-hui, has put an end to government dissension, temporarily, and within the public arena. Mr Hau was one of Chiang Kai-shek's mainland supporters who came over from China in 1949, and he was the figurehead of the traditional right wing of the party. He openly opposed the reformist and pro-business approach of the country's first Taiwan-born president, Lee Teng-hui, and Hau's demise is seen, therefore, as a positive sign for the stock market. The easing of the confrontation may be superficial, but no further political confrontations are likely, at least until the party congress in July and August. This has been enough to trigger a significant recovery in share prices, although the rally has had a very narrow base. The banking sector, which represents close to 35 per cent of the market's capitalisation, has accounted for the bulk of the stock market's gains. This partly reflects the stronger fundamentals of the sector which, historically, has benefited from a higher interest rate environment. It was spurred further by the fact that the appointed premier, Lien Chan, is a big shareholder in the three provincial government-owned banks. Following the market's meteoric rise this year, SG Warburg Securities now estimates that the TSE index is trading on a 1993 prospective price-earnings ratio of 31. The figure is inflated by the extremely high p/e's of the banking stocks, and by the aggressive depreciation policies of Taiwanese companies, but it still appears expensive compared with other markets in south-east Asia. Hong Kong is on a 1993 p/e of 10.9, and Thailand is on 13.4, according to Warburg forecasts. However, Taiwan is finally back on an upward economic growth track, following lower gross national product growth of 6 per cent in 1992. Greater optimism is demonstrated by Formosa Plastic's announcement that it is to go ahead with a new USDollars 7.5bn naptha cracker plant. Electronics exporters, meanwhile, have experienced a strong pick-up in orders from the US, but the sector has been dogged by the US Special 301 investigation, which is likely to give rise to some caution for the entire stock market. Talks between the US and Taiwan over copyright protection have broken down, and Taiwan has until April 15 to make sufficient concessions, or the US will establish retaliatory tariffs on a hit list of export products, which could cost the island up to USDollars 1bn. Another focus of attention will be the impending quasi-official talks between Taiwan and China, which are due to take place in Singapore during April. The discussions between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits are likely to address the contentious issue of direct investment and transport links between the two 'countries'. An agreement on direct links would be positive for business and equities, and many observers expect that an agreement will be finalised during 1993. A number of brokers are confident that the index will hit 6,000 by the year-end. But in a market which is dominated by short-term trading, psychological resistance at the 5,000-level is a more immediate concern, and a period of consolidation is on the cards.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Tax-efficient ways of topping up income - Planning Your Pension MORE THAN 90 per cent of employees will retire on substantially less than a full pension, yet only one in ten takes positive steps to improve their position. The most tax efficient method of topping up a lacklustre occupational pension is through the company's own additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme or through a free-standing AVC (FSAVC) available mainly from life offices. AVCs and FSAVCs can only be taken out by employees who are members of an occupational scheme. If you are self employed, or an employee in non-pensionable employment, you can invest in a personal pension. Traditionally, AVCs have appealed to those employees in the run-up to retirement, but FSAVCs in particular are now being sold to younger people. These employees should remember that normally AVC and FSAVC funds are locked away until retirement. If you want a tax efficient investment but need easier access to your money, you should look at Tessas and Peps. AVCs and FSAVCs benefit from most of the tax breaks granted to occupational and personal pensions, namely full tax relief on contributions, tax free growth of the fund and, with some AVCs, tax free cash. Employees can contribute up to 15 per cent of salary to their main pension and AVC combined. Since most schemes require employee contributions of about 5 per cent, this leaves plenty of scope for top-up provision. Employers cannot contribute to your AVC. Some employees will be caught by the earnings cap, restricting main pension and AVC contributions to 15 per cent of a maximum salary of Pounds 75,000 for the current tax year. The cap applies to employees who joined a new occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989 and for new members who joined an existing scheme after June 1 1989. Before considering an AVC, it is important to understand how a company pension works. Under a typical final salary scheme your pension builds up at the rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40/60ths or two-thirds final salary (subject to the cap, where applicable). A minority of occupational schemes are run on a money purchase basis, where contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement which is used to purchase an annuity. If you are in one of these schemes (known as contracted-out or contracted-in money purchase schemes) the provider will advise you the need for AVCs although you should always seek a second opinion from an independent source. There are several reasons for a pension shortfall: Career breaks due to periods of unemployment or time out to have children. Pension transfers following a job change tend to reduce the value of the benefits. Poor accrual rates - for example where a scheme builds up at the rate of 1/80th per annum rather than 1/60th - can leave a pension shortfall. Employees in the public sector should note that under their '80ths' scheme the tax free cash lump sum is in addition to the pension. This makes it equivalent to a private sector '60ths' scheme where the tax free cash is deducted before the pension is calculated. Integrated schemes include the value of the state pension in the two-thirds maximum. If you want to receive the state pension, on top of your two-thirds final salary pension, you will need AVCs to achieve this. Non-pensionable earnings: company schemes commonly base an employee's pension contributions and final pension on basic salary and do take into account overtime, bonuses, commission etc. If these form a significant proportion of your total remuneration you may need AVCs to bring your pension more in line with your earnings. Early retirement: if your company pension scheme assumes a normal retirement age of 65, and you plan to leave early, you are likely to suffer an actuarial reduction in your pension for each year of service missed. Company AVC schemes By law, with a few minor exceptions, all occupational schemes must offer AVCs. This is usually the simplest and cheapest option. Tax relief is awarded immediately at the individual's highest rate while the administration is handled by the employer, who may also absorb any provider's charges involved. Most company schemes - whether run on a final salary or money purchase basis  -delegate the AVC arrangement to an insurance company or building society. Generally, the AVC provides a money purchase fund at retirement but some schemes, particularly in the public sector, provide 'added years'. Added years provide extra pension which, in the public sector is index linked. Until April 1987, employees who wished to take out AVCs had to commit themselves to a fixed contribution for at least five years. Now, in theory at least, there are no restrictions. Moreover, in the past if you overfunded your scheme you lost your contributions but since 1989 excess contributions have been refunded, less a tax charge. The benefits you can take under a company AVC scheme have changed over the past five years. Where AVC contributions began before April 6, 1987 the whole fund can be taken as tax free cash. This means that the pension from the main scheme is not reduced to provide the tax free lump sum. However, where contributions started after this date the whole of the accumulated fund must be used to purchase an annuity - there is no tax free cash. FSAVCs Free standing AVCs were introduced in October 1987 to provide a more flexible alternative to the in-house scheme. Most of the features for AVCs apply to the free standing variety but there are important differences. In particular since the contract is between the employee and the provider, the employee has to bear all the charges. Also, while basic tax relief is awarded at source, higher rate relief must be claimed through the end of year return. On the plus side, however, is privacy. Unless you are contributing over Pounds 2,400 to your FSAVC, your employer is not involved. FSAVC providers reckon this is useful if you are quietly planning for early retirement. But probably the most important advantage of FSAVCs over the in-house variety is investment scope. Traditionally employers have provided deposit-style building society accounts where the contributions build up tax free. Deposit-based AVCs are ideal for an employee with just a few years to go to retirement and seeking maximum security, but they are not so good for longer term investments. Some of the big occupational schemes run a choice of AVCs - often a deposit account and a with-profits or unit-linked option - but for many employees this choice is only available through FSAVCs. There are now about 100 providers of FSAVCs offering almost 250 funds on a with-profits, unitised-with-profits and unit-linked basis. The choice is complex and should not be made without the help of an independent pensions provider. Under a with-profits fund, the life office provides a guaranteed minimum sum at retirement to which annual bonuses are added. These bonuses, which smooth out the investment performance, cannot be taken away once they have been awarded. Under a unit-linked or unit trust AVC, the performance of contributions mirrors the performance of the underlying fund. Few of these funds offer any form of guarantee and performance can be volatile. Over the past five years with-profits funds - and the more recent unitised with profits funds - have performed well against unit-linked and unit trust AVCs. But bear in mind that with profits bonuses will be cut back over the next few years while equity returns are unlikely to repeat the generally poor performance of the period since the 1987 crash. Top with profits AVC performers in the latest survey from the FT's sister publication Pensions Management are Clerical Medical, Co-operative Insurance, and Prudential. Top unit-linked managed funds were run by National Mutual Life and Scottish Mutual. FSAVC Funds have not been running for long enough to give meaningful performance results but projected figures, which show the impact of charges on a fund's growth, will reveal that on projected unit linked results, fee charging Professional Life does well while Equitable Life, Rothschild Asset Management and Skandia Life also offer consistently good returns. Finally, if you are considering taking out a FSAVC, check for flexibility just as you would under a portable pension. In theory, you can take the same FSAVC from job to job and a well-designed plan will allow you to to switch from FSAVC to personal pension to cover periods when you are in non-pensionable employment. If you are in doubt about your long term employment plans follow the golden rule of flexibility and pay single contributions rather than commit yourself to a regular plan.</p>

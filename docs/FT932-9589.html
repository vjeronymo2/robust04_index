			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: TV education market proves a blackboard jungle - A bitter and as yet unprofitable battle for market share between two rival companies A BITTER battle is brewing over control of the accountancy television education market. The quiet world of the profession is being shaken by the vulgarity of aggressive competition. The sleeves are being firmly rolled up on the arms of Accountancy Television (ATV) and Television Education Network (TEN) as the two organisations fight for the audience for videos and broadcast programmes. Both services are beginning to reflect each other's tactics in their attempts to grab market share. Both say that the future looks promising. Neither has yet shown the profits to match the rhetoric. The story began early last year. Three organisations decided to launch a weekly programme on BBC Select, the broadcasts made late at night on television and which can only be watched with the aid of an electronic decoder. They were the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the BBC itself - through BBC Investments - and BPP, a quoted financial training company. But it seems a decision was soon taken that the channel would have more credibility if it included the other principal UK professional accountancy bodies, of which there are six. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy would not take part. The others did: Pounds 250,000 in shares came from the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, Pounds 100,000 from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, and Pounds 25,000 each from the chartered accountancy institutes for Scotland and Ireland. The original three backers stumped up Pounds 350,000 each, bringing the total support to Pounds 1.4m - a figure which some say was still unrealistically low. Bringing in the extra organisations may have provided extra funding, but it also helped stoke squabbling. A demonstration tape shown to the backers annoyed the Certified Accountants because there was no mention of it or its representatives. More fundamentally, the associations tried to influence the focus that the programmes should take. Market research commissioned by the BBC had suggested that the principal audience would be accountants in industry and commerce. But the associations - conscious of their own constituencies - wanted a more wide-ranging focus which would appeal to their members in public practice. This was reflected in a fight over the name of the service. The market research supported those arguing for the name 'Business Account'. The associations insisted on 'Accountancy Television'. The BBC had initially offered substantial extra backing in-kind by advertising the service during normal television hours. It all but withdrew after an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the practice of advertising Radio Times on the air when rival listing magazines had no such option. This forced ATV - under tight time pressures to meet its launch date - to spend more than Pounds 300,000 on alternative forms of marketing. This has made the organisation about three months behind its original business plan. Meanwhile, a rival company was preparing for action. TEN had been founded by Robert Clemente, an Australian entrepreneur who had developed a business selling educational videos to the professions and decided to export the idea. TEN was already running a service for lawyers. Last summer it launched the Accountants' Education Channel, a monthly video subscription service. It had planned to respond to subscribers' reactions and later re-launch the service, but brought forward this date to coincide with ATV's initial programmes in November. The first ATV broadcasts were not without problems. Difficulties with the encoding technology and viewers' failure to understand how it worked meant the company had to send out copies of its programmes on video. Both companies' programmes include a short news bulletin and segments including interviews on subjects ranging across current financial reporting, tax and accounting themes. They are accompanied by documents providing further details. Experience since has clearly borne out the BBC's market research. Despite the insistence of the accountancy bodies on marketing and focusing programmes partly at their members in public practice, nearly all the subscribers have been from industry and commerce. Shortly after the launch, ATV proudly announced that more than 11,000 people had expressed an interest in subscribing. In fact, so far only about 800 have done so. TEN said last month that its accountancy videos had 6,000 viewers. But since it estimates an average of seven to 10 people watch each one, the number of subscribers is also correspondingly lower. That still leaves the assessment of how viewers are split between the different subscription rates. ATV claims the average rate - based on number of viewers - is significantly higher than expected at Pounds 1,780. TEN says about three-fifths of its subscribers are for the 'level 1' tapes charged at Pounds 495 a year, and less than a fifth at the higher-end service at Pounds 1,495. To boost demand, ATV recently began selecting the bits of the weekly broadcast programmes which are most relevant to accountants in public practice, and sending them out as monthly segments on video under the name 'Professional Focus'. It says it now has more than 300 subscribers for the service. Using videos mimics the medium chosen by TEN, which, in turn, is just about to start slicing into ATV's core market by extracting highlights of its tapes most relevant to accountants in industry and commerce, and sending them out each month under the label 'Corporate Briefing'. The message of competition for viewers has not come simply through the medium, however. An accountant recently wrote to ATV alleging that during a sales pitch a TEN representative had questioned ATV's financial status and how long it would continue offering the video service. That led to an ATV solicitor's letter demanding that TEN dissociate itself from the comments. TEN says it is not aware that such remarks had been made, and stresses - as does ATV - that it wants to compete on quality rather than on remarks against the opposition. Both companies make great play of the quality of the service they provide, and stress that customers should choose between them based on their programmes and supporting material. Yet finances remain a crucial question. Neither company wants to talk too openly about its performance - arguing that will only give sensitive information to its rival. TEN says it expects the accountancy service to be in profit by the end of its current financial year. Its latest accounts, for the period to December 31 1991 show losses for all operations of Pounds 435,000. The directors' report stresses that projections until December 1993 show the company may need additional funding. ATV's accounts for the first year of operation will not be filed for many months yet, although it says it hopes to be making a profit by the end of its next financial year in 1994. In late March, BPP wrote off its Pounds 350,000 stake, calling the investment 'a high risk venture whose future must be regarded as uncertain during this early critical period'. Burying the note in its accounts, the Certified Accountants did the same with its Pounds 250,000. The other backers are holding the shares at their original value this year. Quality is all very well, but - as the accountants on the programmes produced by both companies might say - they will need to see quality translated into additional subscriptions before long if they are to survive.</p>

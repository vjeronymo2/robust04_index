			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SHALOM, Y'ALL': WELCOME TO ISRAELI DUDE RANCH  </P> <P> We had climbed Masada, floated in the Dead Sea, prayed at the Wailing Wall,  traced the steps of Jesus and touched Mohammed's rock.  </P> <P> We had "done" Israel, like millions of other tourists before us, and we were  exhausted. We had a few days left on our family vacation and wanted to do  something different and restful.  </P> <P> "It can't be another museum or ancient ruin," our teen-ager said. We agreed.  </P> <P> We consulted an Israeli friend who is a travel agent. "I have just the thing  for you," she said, "a dude ranch in the Galilee."  </P> <P> The children's ears perked up. "Do they have horseback riding?"  </P> <P> "The best in Israel, and they serve American food," she said.  </P> <P> My wife and I looked at each other. Did we really come 7,000 miles to go  horseback riding in Israel? Why not, the children argued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> North to Nazareth  </P> <P> We were on our way. From Jerusalem we traveled north through Nazareth to the  Sea of Galilee. About 15 miles north of Tiberias, 40 miles from the Lebanon  border, we found Vered Hagalil.  </P> <P> "Shalom, Y'All" read the sign above the reception desk in the rustic main lodge  that looks as if it was transplanted from Wyoming.  </P> <P> Vered Hagalil, which means Rose of Galilee, was built by American-born Yehuda  Avni, who came here from Chicago in the late 1940s, married an Israeli woman  and decided to stay.  </P> <P> His wife, Yonah, runs the reception desk and restaurant. Yehuda oversees the  stables and the grounds. From the moment a guest arrives, both seem to be  everywhere, ready to help in any way they can. It seems comfortable to call  them by their first names after only being there a few hours.  </P> <P> The accommodations at the ranch are comfortable and reasonable. Four of us  stayed in one of the roomy wood and stone cottages for about $85 U.S., which  included an American-style breakfast.  </P> <P> There is also a bunk house that sleeps 12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Retreat  </P> <P> Because it is a popular retreat for urban Israelis and there are only a dozen  or so cottages, the ranch is often booked weeks in advance.  </P> <P> Yehuda and Yonah added a pool a few years ago, and may soon have a tennis  court. But the main attractions are horseback riding and eating.  </P> <P> Because no one in our family had much experience with horses, we did more  eating than riding. The restaurant specializes in American food, something we  were all hungry for after two weeks in the Middle East.  </P> <P> There are no falafel. The fare includes steak, fried chicken served in a basket  with fries, fresh trout and delicious lemon meringue pie.  </P> <P> For breakfast they serve the best pancakes in Israel. The restaurant is open to  the public and is usually filled with Israelis who have dropped in to eat  "American."  </P> <P> In order to work off some of our added pounds, we tried the horseback riding.  Yehuda was very patient with us tenderfoots, calming our nerves and finding  just the right horse for us.  </P> <P> "How do you say 'Whoa' in Hebrew?" I asked. Yehuda explained that all the  beautiful Arabians were bilingual.  </P> <P> Yehuda will tailor a ride to fit a need, from one hour to a week. Prices are  $12 an hour, $35 half day and $55 for a day. There is a special six-day riding  package for $100 a day, including room and board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy Ride  </P> <P> We took one of the easy rides through nearby hills overlooking the Sea of  Galilee. Our guide was a young Israeli, David, who, except that he spoke  Hebrew, acted and dressed like a Western wrangler.  </P> <P> Longer rides are to the rich, green Hula Valley, down to the River Jordan, up  to the Golan Heights or to the site where Jesus is said to have given the  Sermon on the Mount.  </P> <P> The only drawback to our stay at Vered Hagalil was that Yehuda does not allow  children under 13 to ride on the trails. He does, however, provide a large  corral that the children can ride in for an hour or so. Lessons also are  available.  </P> <P> When it was time to leave, we agreed that we would come back someday, eat less  and take the ride Yehuda describes in the ranch brochure.  </P> <P> "When a tiny black spot in the distance becomes a Bedouin tent where you're  welcomed to dismount and have coffee; when you ride through the vineyards  overlooking the sky-blue Sea of Galilee and you suddenly understand why the  Sermon on the Mount was given here . . . well, then you know you're visiting  the Galilee as it should be visited . . . on horseback."  </P> <P> For more information, contact Yehuda Avni, c/o Vered Hagalil, Mobile P.O.

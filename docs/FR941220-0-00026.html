			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Excluded Services (&sect;409.49)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the Medicare home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health benefit should cover drugs and biologicals furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept this comment because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1861(m)(5) of the Act specifically excludes drugs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and biologicals from Medicare home health coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that the regulations text  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule omitted paragraph (c) of &sect;409.49.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule did inadvertently omit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c) of this section from the regulations text,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the provisions of paragraph (c) were described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble. This final rule includes paragraph (c), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excludes from home health coverage services which would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be covered if furnished as hospital inpatient services. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have specified this exclusion because the unnumbered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material in section 1861(m) of the Act following paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m)(7) specifically precludes home health coverage of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service that would not be covered as an inpatient hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that exclusion from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage of housekeeping services is too restrictive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not agree. It is important to note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that &sect;409.49(d) excludes only those services whose sole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose is to allow the beneficiary to continue to reside in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her home. If a home health aide performs some light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housekeeping incidental to providing a covered home health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide service, that visit would not be excluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage. However, a visit for the sole purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing housekeeping services would not be covered, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these services are not related to the treatment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary's illness or injury. As we stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble of the proposed rule, this does not represent any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change from current Medicare policy and would not affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage of home health aide services that are essential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> healthcare, such as bathroom disinfection and the cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of soiled sheets. Also, it is important to note that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion applies to Medicare coverage of aide services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the home health benefit and has no impact on coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``homemaker'' services furnished under the Medicare hospice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit. ``Homemaker'' services, which we consider to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to housekeeping services, are specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned as a covered hospice service in 42 CFR 418.202(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters asked that we clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage of home health services furnished to end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requested clarification of Medicare coverage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a home health nursing visit to furnish wound care related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an abandoned shunt site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because Medicare's composite rate payment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ESRD facility is intended to subsume payment for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dialysis-related services, any service directly related to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary's dialysis is covered as a dialysis service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not as a home health service. Home health services that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not related to an ESRD beneficiary's dialysis, however, can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be covered under the home health benefit if all requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are met (for example, the beneficiary is homebound). Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those services which are directly related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary's dialysis (and not to other aspects of renal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease) are excluded by this paragraph. Because wound care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an abandoned shunt site is not directly related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary's dialysis, a nursing visit to furnish such care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a qualified Medicare home health beneficiary would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the reference to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;410.36 in paragraph (f) appears to exclude coverage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wound supplies and intravenous maintenance supplies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (f) excludes from coverage only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those items which meet the requirements of &sect;410.36(b) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prosthetic devices. That is, prosthetic devices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace all or part of a body organ (with the exception of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and bags relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ostomy care) are excluded from coverage under the home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health benefit. Section 1861(m) of the Act indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical supplies and durable medical equipment are covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health services. Since prosthetic devices are not also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in section 1861(m), they cannot be covered as home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health services. Items described in &sect;410.36(a), such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgical dressings, are not excluded by this paragraph. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item that meets the requirements for coverage contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.45(f) of this rule as medical supplies may be covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a home health service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Condition of Participation: Home Health Aide Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;484.36)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that home health aides must receive at least 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours of in-service training each calendar year is overly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome. The commenters did not protest the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of training hours but found the requirement that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training be furnished within each calendar year to present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome scheduling problems. The commenters said these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling problems were particularly difficult in the cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of home health aides who were hired late in the calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year and therefore were obligated to complete the 12 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of training in a relatively short period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

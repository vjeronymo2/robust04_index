			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Who should really run the company? - Peter Montagnon reviews the latest thinking on corporate governance CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Edited by DD Prentice and PRJ Holland Clarendon Press with Allen &amp; Overy, Pounds 35 225 pages Adam Smith had particularly trenchant views about joint stock companies. Shareholders, or 'proprietors' as he called them, seldom pretend to understand the business they invest in and are content to leave its affairs to the management. The latter cannot be expected to look after other people's money as carefully as they would their own. Hence his view that 'negligence and profusion must always prevail.' The argument is equally valid today, though the views expressed in this book do not necessarily go so far. Discussion of corporate governance has loomed large in the UK large since the publication of the Cadbury report. This book provides some useful insights. But first a word of warning. The trouble with collections of essays by different people is that they can make for an overall work of varying quality. This book falls into the trap with a first chapter of almost mind-numbing turgidity. It is a pity that more effort was not put into editing, since those prepared to struggle through to subsequent chapters will find at least part of the experience rewarding. There are a number of issues to be addressed, not only the search for some convergence of interest between owners and managers. It is important to define who are the real stakeholders are in a company, though the idea that workers are among them belongs perhaps more to the mainland European tradition. These issues have to be evaluated against a litany of contemporary concerns: short-termism, investor protection against fraud, and shareholder democracy, to name but three. Who should take on the responsibility for ensuring that corporate governance is sound? Paul Rutteman of Ernst &amp; Young notes that auditors who do not sit on board meetings cannot have much insight into the actual effectiveness of non-executive directors. Paul Davies of Oxford University argues that institutions do not have much of a record for intervening in the way a company is run. Their main concern is to maximise returns. Intervening to change corporate policies risks headlong confrontation with management and requires collaboration between competing institutions. Perhaps the banks could play a greater role. They often exercise an important influence through the covenants in their loan documentation. But as Theodor Baums of the University of Osnabruck notes, the role of banks is greater still in Germany, where banks wield enormous influence because they are both lenders and proxy voters of the stock they hold on behalf of customers. This gives them control of the supervisory board where the real power within German companies lies. Curiously, though, German banks can get too close to companies. To ensure their loans are repaid they have a natural temptation to encourage companies to gear down and pay small dividends. Once the links are well-cemented, however, the relationship can be too cosy. Hence they would be reluctant to insist on management restructuring. That may be more of a long-term approach but banks may be too risk-averse as shareholders. The best answer may be a combination of the German system with that in the UK where there is a market for corporate control which can exert some pressure on management. How such a compromise would work is the subject of another book.</p>

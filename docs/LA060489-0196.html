			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SOME LIKE IT HOT: REDS' DAVIS WARMS TO OCCASION AGAIN, SWATS PADRES  </P> <P> It was June before the Cincinnati Reds' Eric Davis really started to hit last  season. His furious finish enabled the slugger to have another solid season.  </P> <P> He started hitting a little earlier this season and cruised into June on a  hitting spree.  </P> <P> Davis hit a three-run home run to break a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning of the  Reds' 6-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on a rainy Saturday night in  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Davis became the first Red in 30 years to hit for the cycle Friday night when  he also hit a three-run home run. In the last five games, he is 11 for 18 with  three doubles in addition to his two homers and has driven in 10 runs.  </P> <P> "After June 1 last season he was the best player in the league," Red Manager  Pete Rose said. "I hope he's a warm-weather ballplayer. He was last year. I  hope history repeats.  </P> <P> "If you look at his stats, he's been swinging the bat well the last week and a  half -- -- since it started to get warm."  </P> <P> Last season, Davis batted .220 the first two months of the season. But after  June 1 he hit .300 in 91 games with 20 home runs and 70 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Davis, who has missed 15 games because of a hamstring injury, has raised his  average from .217 to .298.  </P> <P> Play was delayed because of rain for 23 minutes in the bottom of the seventh,  but that didn't affect Rick Mahler (7-5). He went the distance, giving up nine  hits.  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, Atlanta 0 -- Manager Roger Craig of the West Division-leading  Giants figures that if Kevin Mitchell played all of his home games in Atlanta,  he would already have 30 home runs this season.  </P> <P> As a visitor to the league's best hitter's park, Mitchell hit his third home  run in two games this weekend, giving him a major leagues-leading total of 18.  </P> <P> After Will Clark singled, Mitchell, who appeared to be trying merely to meet  the ball with two strikes on him, homered to left-center field.  </P> <P> "I didn't hit it that well," said Mitchell, who also leads the majors in runs  batted in with 53. "I thought it might get to the wall, but you never know  here."  </P> <P> The victory was costly for the Giants, however. Already hurting for pitching,  they lost starter Don Robinson after three innings because of a hip injury.  Atlee Hammaker (5-3) was sharp in relief against the light-hitting Braves.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Chicago 5 -- The Cardinals' luck, which has been mostly bad this  season, took a turn for the better in the 10th inning at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Manager Whitey Herzog received permission from team doctors to use Tom  Pagnozzi, a backup catcher who has had a shoulder injury, as a pinch-hitter.  Pagnozzi hit a long sacrifice fly with the bases loaded, and the Cardinals  ended a five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Cardinals had to win it twice. Reliever Ken Dayley was protecting a 5-4  lead and retired the first two Cubs in the ninth. But Mitch Webster, who had  not hit a home run all season, tied the score with a home run to left field.  </P> <P> New York 9, Pittsburgh 3 -- Howard Johnson hit a home run and drove in three  runs at New York as the Mets ended their hitting slump.  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry, who missed Friday's game because of back spasms, hit his  12th home run to help the Mets win their third game in a row. Ten of  Strawberry's home runs have come with nobody on base.  </P> <P> Ron Darling, given the benefit of the Mets' biggest scoring output since May  10, gave up eight hits and pitched his first complete game.  </P> <P> Montreal 7, Philadelphia 5 -- The Phillies' recently retired Mike Schmidt threw  out the first ball at Philadelphia, but it didn't help as the Phillies lost  their 10th in a row.  </P> <P> Kevin Gross (6-3), a former Philly, left in the ninth inning with one out, the  bases loaded and a 7-1 lead. The Phillies scored four runs before Tim Burke  shut down the rally.  </P> <P> Andres Galarraga's eighth home run of the season sparked a four-run seventh  inning for Montreal after Mike Maddux retired the first two Expos. Hubie Brooks  and Mike Fitzgerald drove in runs before Galarraga's homer. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

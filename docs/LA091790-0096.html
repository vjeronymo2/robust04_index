			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSLIM SOLDIER ON A MISSION OF MERCY;  </P> <P> FREEDOM FIGHTER: MOUJAHEDEEN REBEL MIRWAIS WARDAK HAS COME TO THE UNITED STATES  SEEKING SEEDS AND MACHINERY TO REBUILD HIS NATIVE AFGHANISTAN.  </P> <P> He is a long way from home, this dark, lanky Afghan in the flowing white  clothes and bushy, untrimmed beard. As a devout Muslim, he is nervous to be  photographed walking along the boardwalk at Laguna Beach, worried that the  background will feature the oiled flesh of half-naked sunbathers, concerned  that the photo won't play well in Peshawar.  </P> <P> That worry, though, is gnat-sized compared to the monstrous problem that  brought Mirwais Wardak here from Pakistan. He has not come to California to  ride the Matterhorn, or to surf the waves, or to ogle the beach-goers. He has  come to the land of the well-fed to ask for food, or rather, for the seeds,  fruit tree cuttings, pesticides, irrigation equipment and farm machinery that  will enable his people to feed themselves.  </P> <P> Wardak is a moujahedeen, a soldier of Afghanistan's Islamic resistance, which  lost its most visible enemy when the Soviet Union ended its 10-year occupation  of the country early last year. His last name -- Wardak -- is the name of his  province. It lies perilously close to the capital of Kabul, where the  Soviet-installed government of President Najibullah is still in power. The  government was the target of a failed military coup in March, possibly  motivated, said some analysts, by Najibullah's attempts to make peace with the  Islamic rebels.  </P> <P> Afghanistan seems gripped by ideological confusion -- the moujahedeen are  fighting less, the regime has not attempted to expand the mostly urban areas it  now controls. Now, after more than a decade of war, the commercial and  agricultural life has been so weakened there is barely a pulse.  </P> <P> Wardak, a rebel commander and tribal leader, has come to the United States to  talk plowshares, not politics. He wants to make it possible for his people --  many of whom have taken refuge in Pakistan -- to move home.  </P> <P> Strolling with him on the boardwalk is his unlikely American host, John Kountz,  a 55-year-old peripatetic librarian who first saw Afghanistan 31 years ago on a  round-the-world trip and was so overwhelmed by the hospitality of its people  that he is now repaying an emotional debt by orchestrating Wardak's three-week  trip. In 1959, Kountz had been driving across Asia when he was turned away from  India because he had no car insurance. He returned to Afghanistan, and found  work at the University of Kabul with a team from the University of Wyoming,  installing language labs. "Anything I can do for these people, I will," Kountz  said.  </P> <P> He has offered his time, his telephone line and his home, a Laguna Beach cliff  dwelling with a magnificent view of the hills and coastline. He has also  offered his cooking, but after experimentation with dishes such as vegetarian  pizza led to his guest's gastronomic distress, the fare has been simplified:  beans, noodles, bread and fruit.  </P> <P> This unusual pair met in 1982, when Kountz was hired as a sound man by  free-lance filmmaker Mike Hoover, who was shooting the Afghanistan war for CBS  News. (Hoover would later be accused of selling staged battle footage to the  network.) During the expedition, Wardak was Kountz's guide and bodyguard.  </P> <P> Last April, Kountz returned to Afghanistan, which, despite the war, allows  foreign travelers to enter the country, and was appalled by what he found.  </P> <P> "I went because I wanted to see what had happened since the Russians pulled  out," he said. "When I saw the plight of the people, which is malnutrition, a  destroyed country and an inability to go home (from Pakistan) because of all  the land mines left by the Soviets in 13 years of occupation, I thought,  'Something has to be done.' One night, Mirwais and I were sitting on a water  tank in an area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Mirwais said, 'I want to  come to the United States to seek help.' "  </P> <P> That is how an Afghan freedom fighter and a senior associate for library  development in the California State University chancellor's office -- neither  of whom knows a thing about securing tons of grain, let alone shipping them to  the other side of the globe -- came to be collaborating on what they hope is  nothing less than the regeneration of an entire Afghan province.  </P> <P> Wardak, a 35-year-old father of three and scion of an influential Afghan  family, has, like an estimated 3 million Afghans, spent the last decade living  as a refugee in Pakistan, fighting the Soviets and the Communist-installed  government of Najibullah. (An estimated 2 million Afghan refugees live in  Iran.) Najibullah was expected to fall after the Soviets pulled out, but, with  an estimated $300 million a month in aid from Moscow, he has proven resilient.  The moujahedeen joke that when the Soviets withdrew, they sent 200,000 uniforms  back to Moscow for dry cleaning. (Actually, the official number of troops  withdrawn by the Soviets is about 110,000.)  </P> <P> Now that the situation has degenerated into Afghan fighting Afghan, American  support for the rebels -- who have received a reported $2 billion in weapons  funneled through the CIA -- is waning. Many war-fatigued Afghans, such as  Wardak, want simply to move home. Without the means to feed themselves,  however, that will be impossible, and that is why Wardak has come calling in  America. He is by himself, part of no official delegation, no formal tour.  </P> <P> "The Afghan government wants people to be able to return," said Len Scensny,  the State Department's Country Officer for Afghanistan. "But if there's  fighting going on, it's a question of being able to restart their lives without  interference. There's a definite mine problem, not just in farmers' fields, but  on roads themselves. The roads are very dangerous. Wardak (Province) is quite  close to the capital and fighting has continued there."  </P> <P> "There are many worries," said Wardak, through an interpreter, "education,  rebuilding the highways. But now, we would just like to have the hope of  surviving."  </P> <P> The Afghan speaks little English -- although his vocabulary includes  "superpower aggression" -- and needs a translator to make his case. Kountz is  enthusiastic, but hardly schooled in the ways of what amounts to soliciting  corporate charity.  </P> <P> "It is a curious thing," Kountz says. "Here I am, just a citizen, turning to  various places to get assistance."  </P> <P> He began with politicians. Sen. Pete Wilson's office put him in touch with the  Department of Agriculture, which put him in touch with a grain company in the  San Joaquin Valley, which told him what kind of wheat he'd probably need for  the 5,000-foot elevation and cold temperatures. Kountz has also phoned the  universities of Nebraska, and Iowa, and the departments of agriculture in  Minnesota and North Dakota, not only to find out who might donate grain, but to  find out how much grain is needed and how it might be shipped. So far, they've  figured out what kind and how much grain they need, but not much else.  </P> <P> The two flew to Washington last weekend, where they made contact with a network  of Afghans, nonprofit development agencies and government officials who might  be of help.  </P> <P> One man they saw was Tony Campaigne, founder and president of the Council for  International Development. Campaigne's nonprofit group operates projects in  Afghanistan, Kenya, El Salvador and Guatemala. His relief and rehabilitation  projects have a single goal: to help the indigenous populations become  self-sustaining.  </P> <P> Campaigne was not surprised to hear that Wardak was in town on a mission that  sounds close to impossible.  </P> <P> "Let me put it this way,"Campaigne said last Monday, the day before meeting  Wardak and Kountz. "I have learned in Afghanistan never to judge what's  feasible and what's not feasible. The Afghans have a particular talent for  making things you think will never work work. If Mirwais is working on it, it's  probably not out of the realm of possibility. I would listen to him very  carefully if he came to my office."  </P> <P> After their meeting last Tuesday, Campaigne was optimistic about helping them.  "What they're talking about to me sounds like a very noble thing. We're going  to help them out as much as we can. Wardak Province is in a terrible state, and  I think there is a need that can be satisfied."  </P> <P> Campaigne said he will intercede with a Peshawar-based United Nations food  program on Wardak's behalf. "And there are other sources in Peshawar we can  help him with," he said.  </P> <P> Then surely Wardak didn't have to come to Washington to get help in Peshawar?  </P> <P> "There are all different ways to skin a cat," Campaigne replied. "If he hadn't  come here, he wouldn't have met me."  </P> <P> The State Department's Scensny echoed Campaigne's optimism: "Oh, he (Wardak)  will definitely find a way. The Afghan resistance, and Afghans in general, have  developed many imaginative ways to get things done. I'm sure he could get the  stuff into the country once he gets it."  </P> <P> Kountz is convinced he and Wardak will succeed. They have returned to  California, where Wardak will spend several days visiting relatives in Mission  Hills.  </P> <P> He was going to visit family in Texas and New York on his way home next week,  but he was welcomed back to Los Angeles the hard way: as he used a telephone  outside the United Airlines terminal, someone stole his briefcase. They got no  money, but they've robbed him of his ability to go home. In the briefcase,  besides his airplane ticket, were his Pakistani refugee registration and his  Pakistan-issued passport. His trip home may be delayed for up to two months,  Kountz said Friday.  </P> <P> "I don't think we'll see anything delivered to Mirwais while he's here," Kountz  said, gesturing toward the narrow street below his picture window. "At least I  hope not. I don't know what I'd do with 10 tons of grain in my driveway."  </P> <P> On the Laguna boardwalk, topless young women with gleaming backs, raised  themselves on elbows to get a better look at the strange tall man in the long  white tunic and pants. Mirwais Wardak looked puzzled. It was hard to tell who  was more surprised.  </P> <P> "He is still talking about naked bodies on the beach," Kountz said. "He is  afraid that fundamentalists in the U.S. would clip a photograph and send it  back to his area to discredit him."  </P> <P> It wasn't just the sunbathers, though, that unsettled the Afghan. "He has been  astonished by everything," said Kountz. "There is such an abundance of things  here, he just doesn't understand it. I sense a sadness in the guy. He's working  from a frame of reference that we have no way of understanding. He's on the  other side of the Earth. What else can you say?"  </P></p>

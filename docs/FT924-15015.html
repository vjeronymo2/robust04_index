			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Councils to face curbs on spending THE INTRODUCTION of the council tax will not shield councils from curbs on public spending, Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, warned yesterday. 'It is important that local, like central, government does its best to control costs,' he said, adding that Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, had comprehensive capping powers which he intended to use if necessary. 'Next year is not going to be easy financially,' he said during a debate on local government. 'It's a year when the Conservative virtues of efficiency and better value for money will be much needed.' Details of restrictions on councils' share of public spending will not emerge until the chancellor makes his Autumn Statement. Mr Redwood said there was a 'strong mood' in favour of more efficiency, better value for money and more contracting out of local government services. Mr Redwood reassured delegates that the new tax would be easier to sell to the public than the poll tax. 'Transitional relief will be an important part of the system,' he said. He later signalled that the scheme might last no more than two years.</p>

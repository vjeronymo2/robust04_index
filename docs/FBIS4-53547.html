			<p>BFN     [Text] Police are preparing to issue arrest warrants for  two foreigners suspected of involvement in a planned terrorist  attack that was discovered by sheer luck in Bangkok in March, a  top police commander said yesterday.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit did not identify their nationalities.    A one-ton bomb made from ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer  and C-4 explosive was found in mid-March in a six-wheel truck  that had been seized by police and parked in front of the  Lumphini police station since it was involved in a minor traffic  accident near the Israeli Embassy on March 11.    Chaisit said that he had no idea if the two foreigners were  still in Thailand. Police have said they suspected foreign  terrorists, in collaboration with local people, were behind the  unsuccessful terrorist attack. No identities of the suspected  terrorists had been revealed although police said they had  collected intelligence information about them.    A Muslim man was held by police in Narathiwat's Muang  district on Wednesday on suspicion that he was a member of a  southern separatist group preparing to carry out an act of  sabotage in the South.    Ma-ae Buraheng, 27, from Narathiwat's Bacho district, was  held after police stopped a taxi at a checkpoint in Ban Khao  Tanyong area, Narathiwat police chief Panya Thiansat said.  Police found a membership card of the Pattani United Liberation  Organization (Pulo) in his underpants, Pol Col Panya said. In a  search of his camouflage backpack, police found military  fatigues, a pair of jungle boots, an alarm clock, a bag of rice,  a needle and number of electric wires, he said. He said police  had not yet filed charges against Ma-ae. The suspect may be  charged with either organized crime or being a rebel, as  suggested by his Pulo member card, he added. The suspect was  being held at Tanyong police station pending further  questioning, which would be jointly conducted by police and  military officers, he said.    In another development, Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wutthimethi  dismissed press reports that he had approved a request to arrest  13 additional suspects for involvement in a series of violent  incidents in the South.    "Up till now, I have never seen such a request from the  police, Yuwat told reporters.</p>

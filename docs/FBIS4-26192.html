			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Darren Goodsir] </F>   [Text] Organised crime syndicates may use Hong Kong as a  base to trade in nuclear weapons, police have been warned.    Assistant Commissioner David Hodson, the Deputy Director  (Crime), said yesterday it was clear that tough new laws were  needed.    Latest international intelligence showed that organised  crime  might seek to use Hong Kong as a base for arranging deals to buy  weapons of mass destruction, especially in relation to targeting  nuclear storage depots in the former Soviet Union. He said the  territory was vulnerable to profits from nuclear arms sales  being laundered locally, if it had not already taken place.    Mr Hodson also lamented the failure of local legislation to  fight money laundering.    "It is an example of a maximum problem scenario," he said on  the risk of nuclear infiltration. "We have to be prepared for  the worst -- and hope for the best.    "We have got to keep up with the times. We need to be able  to make sure we can keep these people from abusing our financial  laws, to stop organised crime from using this place as a scene  for financing this sort of activity. And, of course, laundering  the proceeds of this activity."    In the United States, FBI director Louis Freeh and the CIA  head, James Woolsey, have repeatedly voiced their concern about  the threat of organised crime hoarding stockpiles of nuclear  material capable of being used in terrorism. The problem stems  from the collapse of security in the former Soviet bloc and the  formidable strength of Russian organised crime.    The German Federal Police -- the Bunderskriminal -- last  year  reported 243 "incidents" involving breaches of security with  nuclear-related material.    In April, Mr Woolsey told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations  Committee that Russian crime was "actively involved" in the  "illegal transport and sale" of nuclear weapons. He said the  CIA paid "particular attention to the potential illegal sale of  fissionable nuclear material".    "We've not seen significant quantities of weapons grade  materials or any other nuclear warheads smuggled out," he said.    "But there have been... reports of thefts of low grade  nuclear materials. In many cases the thieves or smugglers have  been apprehended."    Mr Hodson said U.S. authorities rated Hong Kong-based  organised crime as one of the most significant threats to their  national security. He added it was unthinkable that Asian  criminals would not try to become involved in nuclear  transactions.    Mr Hodson said Hong Kong maintained "unimpressive"  laundering  laws and had "hardly an impressive record" in seizing the  proceeds of crime. This made the territory ripe for brokering  sophisticated criminal enterprise.    He said it was disheartening that no one had been convicted  of laundering.    "We have to play our part. I think we have got to learn  lessons from other countries.    "We have got to recognise that organised crime, in its many  forms, is a very different animal now than what it was 20 to 25  years ago."    When asked of the threat of nuclear deals being organised  from Hong Kong, he replied: "I think it important that we take  reasonable, rational measures to protect ourselves from it.    "I am saying these are the concerns expressed by highly  respected leaders.    "Traditionally, police have investigated crime after it  occurred but we can no longer afford to take this sort of  approach -- we must go after it.    "When you have strong organised crime, you have something  that is an ongoing activity.    "You become aware of the people involved in this kind of  activity. But it requires a different approach -- a different  style.    "It is also international in nature and we have to look at  things occasionally from the viewpoint that it is essential we  play our part on the international scene."    Mr Hodson's comments highlight the concern felt by police .    It also marks the depth to which morale has slipped in  senior  ranks over the failure for 23 months of the Legislative Council  to pass the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill.</p>

The company's year-earlier loss of  $26,000 was unchanged, as was its revenue, which climbed to $230,000 from  $194,000 a year earlier.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of 1989, Fortune posted a revised loss of $36,000,  instead of the $6,000 loss it initially reported. The company did not revise  its year-earlier loss of $34,000, nor did it alter its nine-month revenue,  which rose to $734,000 from $651,000.  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: US-Canadian consortium in Chilean copper venture A US-CANADIAN consortium of Cyprus Minerals Company and Lac Minerals has agreed to pay up to Dollars 555m for a 51 per cent stake in the El Abra copper mine, Chile's largest-ever foreign joint venture. Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to hold the remaining 49 per cent in the project, which is expected to cost Dollars 1bn to develop. The Cyprus/Lac consortium will pay Dollars 404m on signing the contract, due to take place in January, and an additional sum of up to Dollars 151m depending on the mine's development costs. The consortium has also committed itself to securing financing of Dollars 700m to meet investment requirements. El Abra, which could start production as early as 1997, was the biggest copper deposit for sale in the world. Nine international consortia, including such companies as RTZ of the UK and Australia's BHP Minerals, submitted bids last month. Such enormous interest highlights Chile's growing reputation for providing a stable, long-term investment climate. Last year, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, awarded Chile an investment grade, the first to a Latin American country since the debt crisis of the early 1980s. The El Abra deal is seen by many officials as a breakthrough for Chile's state-dominated mining sector, which has until recently resisted foreign investment. Under a law passed last year, El Abra will be the first state-owned copper deposit to be developed with the private sector. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, praised the policy of wooing foreign investors to the mining industry: 'Why should we divert public funds into areas where the private sector can invest? Then we can take that money and put it into infrastructure - education, health services and job training programmes. That's the real job of the government.' Cyprus/Lac plans to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually over 20 years. The grade and relative accessibility of El Abra's oxide reserves is expected to result in extremely low production costs. These should be 40 to 45 cents a pound against Codelco's current average of 69 cents.</p>

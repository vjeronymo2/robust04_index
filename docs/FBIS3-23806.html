We would like to recall that Manucharyan  announced his intention to create a new analytic and  sociopolitical structure intended to promote the settlement of  the Karabakh problem. Moreover, he came out with sharp criticism  against the activity of the republic's Ministry of Internal  Affairs and proclaimed a categorical disagreement with the  presidential edict on KGB reorganization.    Since the criticism against the Ministry of Internal Affairs  was of a general nature and new analytic centers of such a trend  multiply very actively in Armenia, nothing promised a political  storm. However, Vano Siradegyan, the republic's minister of  internal affairs, unexpectedly took up arms against Manucharyan.  He held a briefing, in the course of which scandalous  information was promulgated. Thus, according to the minister, it  turned out that the entire activity of the former national  security adviser was directed against the republic's national  interests and Manucharyan himself, being by nature a "remarkable  schemer," almost seized real absolute power. According to  Siradegyan, Manucharyan kept an eye on the KGB, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, the army, and the tax inspectorate, placed his  people in key posts in the Council of Ministers, in the  Administration of Special Programs, who maintain communication  with Karabakh, and in the Armenian Industrial Construction Bank,  as well as "tried to seize national television." At the same  time, Siradegyan recalled that Manucharyan played a destructive  role in the previous Karabakh Committee, out of which the  Armenian Pannational Movement grew subsequently. According to  Siradegyan, it was Manucharyan who at one time broke up the  planned combination and cooperation in the Karabakh question  between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia  and the Armenian Pannational Movement. He enlisted many morally  unscrupulous individuals from Komsomol organs in the movement  and set prominent leaders of the Armenian Pannational Movement  at loggerheads. Siradegyan asserted that Manucharyan did his  utmost to cause a split between the present president and former  prime minister Vazgen Manukyan. Furthermore, the opinion that  power in Karabakh, allegedly, belongs to the Dashnaktsutyun  Party has become popular since Manucharyan's service. However,  in Siradegyan's opinion, power, not party-political, structures  had real authority in Stepanakert. From Siradegyan's speech it  became known that the former chief adviser contributed to the  transformation of the KGB into a criminal commercial structure,  under the aegis of which currency machinations flourished and  illegal deals with arms and strategic materials, in particular  with copper and aluminum, were conducted. With all this  Manucharyan never sought to occupy a high, responsible post,  preferring to remain in the background and to act through his  puppets. Among the latter the following were named: Gevorg  Vardanyan, former minister of state; Ambartsum Galstyan, former  mayor of Yerevan; Vagan Shirkhakyan, former deputy minister of  defense and adviser to the president, and many lower-ranking  officials. According to Siradegyan's assertion, enjoying the  high patronage of the chief adviser, all of them committed  criminally punishable acts: They took diamonds and antiques out  of Armenia, dictated the currency rate to the black market,  transported stolen cars from Armenia to Georgia and back, and  transferred currency funds abroad. In particular, with the  participation of the former management of the Almaz Plant and  with Vagan Shirkhakyan's help 2 million dollars were transferred  to the United States and only recently part of the funds have  been brought back with great difficulties. It was also declared  that a certain "Moscow Armenian" manages the circulation of  criminal money.    As Vano Siradegyan said, the state succeeded with great  difficulty to squeeze Manucharyan out of his positions and to  rid ministries and departments of his influence, bringing them  back under government control. The minister declared that all  the individuals mentioned by him have long been in the focus of  attention of operational services of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. Their fault is so obvious that the only thing the  procuracy can do is to institute criminal proceedings against  them. The only person against whom this will not be simple to do  is Manucharyan himself, who, as it appears, does not have the  "harmful" habit of signing any documents. However, the minister  expects that testimony will help to prove Manucharyan's guilt.    Vano Siradegyan also noted that Ashot Manucharyan's present  high activity and his attempt to again begin exerting influence  on the solution of the Karabakh problem, undoubtedly, are  instigated from without by forces, for which the existing social  and political calm in Armenia is not advantageous and which do  not want a stabilization of the situation in the conflict  region. It is these forces that have brought to life the figure  of the former adviser from political nonexistence. "It is  ridiculous to say that foreign political problems can be solved  at the party level and at the public level, as Manucharyan  asserts," the minister stressed. "The poorly camouflaged attempt  to again try to get back the lost influence and the  opportunities connected with it lies behind all this."    In general, in Siradegyan's opinion, in Armenia there is a  widespread faulty practice, under which public figures, who have  tarnished themselves, try to change their image, appearing as  members of the opposition so that any actions against them may  be perceived by the public as an attempt by the authorities to  restrict civil liberties. The minister's admission of his  intention to hold a briefing, of which he advised the president  only at the very last moment, was also curious. Levon  Ter-Petrosyan received this fact without enthusiasm, because he  himself was not at all inclined to attach serious significance  to Ashot Manucharyan's words and actions, considering him an  unbalanced person. However, the head of the police department  does not share such an approach, because, as he said, he sees  well all the danger emanating from his former companion-in-arms.  Therefore, by his own admission, he decided to "wash the dirty  linen in public."    The minister's revelations evoked the strongest public  reaction in Armenia and placed the country on the brink of a  criminal political scandal. A certain confusion is observed at  the headquarters of the Armenian Pannational Movement. In  principle, here people are in agreement with Siradegyan.  However, they consider his action impulsive, unprepared, and  capable of causing harm rather than good. In the camp of leftist  Dashnaks and communists there is an unconcealed jubilation in  connection with the self-exposure in the camp of their  ideological opponents.    Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,  declared that, apparently, all this was the beginning of a big  quarrel between two mafioso clans inside the Armenian  Pannational Movement, with which, of course, opposition forces  had nothing to do, and all the attempts to lend a political  nature to what was going on were provocative. Ashot Navasardyan,  chairman of the Republican Party, also agreed with this opinion.  At the same time, he noted that, undoubtedly, forces seeking a  destablization of the situation in Armenia stood behind  Manucharyan. The transparent hint by the chief of the police  department about some "Moscow Armenian" mixed up in mafia  affairs seems not at all accidental. Not so long ago the  Armenian minister and Serzh Dzhilovyan, a prominent Moscow  businessman, exchanged very painful attacks. Dzhilovyan accused  Siradegyan of organizing an attempt on his life, while  Siradegyan, in turn, declared that the mafia itself (the  minister also includes the businessman in it) sooner or later  would eliminate Dzhilovyan and "Armenia will have nothing to do  with this." The Moscow businessman's negative attitude toward  Yerevan's present authorities and his desire to return to  Armenia as a new leader are not concealed in the least.  Furthermore, the phrase about Manucharyan's "Komsomol  entourage," probably, was by no means accidental. A hint about  Suren Arutyunyan, former Komsomol boss, later former first  secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia, and a prominent  representative of Russian-American business, is noted here.  Moreover, it is no secret that in the question of the solution  of the Karabakh problem Manucharyan has always been inclined to  use Moscow's recommendations. Incidentally, the republic's  present leadership is also inclined to follow the Kremlin's  advice and not only in the sphere of foreign policy. Therefore,  it is possible that certain forces in Russia, indeed, have  decided to use Manucharyan's figure in their interests.    There is nothing strange in all this. It is only surprising  that this circumstance has become the cause of such a sharp and  prompt reaction. Many people in Yerevan assume that this is  connected with the fact that Manucharyan possessed information  compromising a number of figures in the present presidential  entourage and was preparing to promulgate it at a convenient  moment. Therefore, the minister of internal affairs simply tries  to forestall Manucharyan's blow. At the same time, the  compromise, evidently, concerns mainly the Department of  Internal Affairs. Possibly, that is why the minister's actions  were of a spontaneous, not completely thought out, nature. After  all, as it was accurately clarified, the president, in fact, did  not know about Siradegyan's intentions until the last moment and  found out about the specific content of the briefing only after  it ended. At some moment it seemed that Levon Ter-Petrosyan  would make a statement, in which he would dissociate himself  from individual pronouncements by his minister, especially on  matters of a foreign political nature. However, this did not  happen. Probably, the president decided to "remain above the  skirmish" for the time being. On the other hand, on the same day  ambassador at large David Shakhnazaryan met with Russian and  U.S. ambassadors and it may be assumed that these talks were far  from simple.    In a private conversation with a person from the  presidential  entourage, Manucharyan himself expressed surprise at  Siradegyan's action and stressed that he did not intend at all  to go over to the opposition, but only aimed at strengthening  the intellectual aspect in the discussion of the problem of  Nagornyy Karabakh.    Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the "skirmish" will take  place and very soon at that. Ambartsum Galstyan, Yerevan's  former mayor, has already announced his intention to hold his  own press conference and to expose the abuses in the system of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Moreover, many former members  of the Karabakh Committee are preparing to make a joint  statement. The parliamentary opposition is about to send a whole  series of questions to the government and the procuracy. In  turn, the procuracy is also not inclined to fulfill the  minister's recommendations and to hastily institute criminal  proceedings. As experience shows, the procurator-general, whose  removal Siradegyan, in fact, demanded during the briefing, is  not afraid to enter into complex relations with the Ministry of  Internal Affairs. Therefore, the retaliatory attack on  Siradegyan promises to be a mass attack and the moment when the  president will have to have his say in order to calm passions is  inevitable. The piquancy of the existing situation lies in the  fact that, according to the results of the quarrel, this say may  by no means be in support of the still strong minister.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / What the President did not say: Bill Clinton sent his Warrington letter to Dominic Lawson who read it carefully HAIL TO the Chief] A fine American sentiment, showing appropriate reverence to their head of state, whoever it happens to be. It sounds much odder on British lips. But that is where it has been over the past few days, following President Bill Clinton's message to the Rector of Warrington. The British media gave effusive coverage to his statement of apparent sympathy to the victims of the IRA's Warrington bombs. It even supplanted from the tabloids' front pages the Princess of Wales' attempts to console the parents of the murdered children. There are three reasons why Britain's opinion formers have become so enthusiastic. First, he had the wisdom to make sure his deeply personal message got into our hands before those of the people of Warrington. My copy of the telegram was headed 'Attention News Editors: Following is the text of a message from President Clinton to the Rev Canon J O Colling, Rector of Warrington, Cheshire. Dear Reverend Colling . . .' The second reason for our enthusiasm is Britain's strange attitude to the US. We like to sneer about Americans but when their country shows any recognition of us - such as awarding a British actresses an Oscar - we curl up like a spaniel having its tummy tickled. The third reason is peculiar to President Clinton, and his reputation. During the election campaign he appeared to be sympathetic to the aims of Sinn Fein. He stated that he, unlike, his predecessor, would be happy to give entry visas to Sinn Fein spokesmen, such as Gerry Adams, to make propaganda tours of the US. He indicated that he would send a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland, with the clear implication that the US wished to impose its own policies in the area. Now we all throw our caps into the air because Clinton has denounced the IRA. But has he? I have read the letter carefully: after all he sent it to me, too. I can find no mention of the IRA. Not one. 'The recent wave of terrorist violence' is condemned, which could be said to refer to the IRA, but equally it could refer to the recent murders of Catholics in Northern Ireland. Later, Clinton shows his true colours: 'The American people join the people of Ireland and the United Kingdom in expressing their sympathy to those touched by these outrages, in believing that violence from whatever quarter can never be justified.' In other words, even in a message to the people of Warrington, the president of the US can not bring himself to single out the IRA, the perpetrators of the terror in question, for special condemnation. We should not be surprised by this. Clinton still has the Irish constituency at home to think of. And his main purpose, like that of many politicians in this whole ghastly episode, is to show clearly, and to state openly and categorically, that he is and always has been opposed to the murder of children. It is a brave stand, and could lose Clinton the votes of child murderers, but politics is about taking the tough decisions, saying the things that people do not want to hear. Should I be so cynical? We are told that the President was so moved that he shooed out of the Oval Office his speech writers, and actually sat down and composed his letter all by himself. Having read and re-read the text (in my vain search for the three letters IRA) I have concluded that Clinton should not let go of his speech-writers' hands in future. His own tongue is forked, and he needs expert assistance to straighten it out, before speaking. I have one other suggestion: that the next time a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is murdered by the IRA, unless we hear similar effusions of sympathy from Clinton, and from leading Irish politicians, we should instruct our ambassadors in Washington and Dublin to deliver a personal message of our own. It would say simply: you lot are stinking hypocrites. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPLAINT CITES SCHOOLS FOR REFUSING  TRANSFER  </P> <P> A Watts mother of 10 has filed a federal civil rights complaint against the Los  Angeles Unified School District for refusing to allow her son to attend a  junior high school outside the gang-plagued neighborhood where they live.  </P> <P> The complaint, filed with the Department of Justice, alleges that the district  violated Linda Lofton's right to "educate her child in a safe environment  conducive to learning" when it would not bus her son away from his neighborhood  to Nobel Junior High School in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Lofton, 35, said she has kept her 12-year-old son, Ramon Atchison, at home  since the beginning of the school year rather than send him to Charles Drew  Junior High, the local school. But school officials said Friday that Lofton  must enroll her child in Drew before they can consider permitting him to  transfer.  </P></p>

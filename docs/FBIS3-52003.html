			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eddy de la Quintana] </F>   [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--After the next  administration assumes office, the Ministry of Government, in  its program for acting as the principal, organizational  mechanism between the Executive Branch of the government and  civil society, will include within it an office charged with  handling investigations of various complaints against corruption  made throughout the country.    The announcement was made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez,  minister of government, in an exclusive interview with LOS  TIEMPOS in La Paz. He said that the new role to be played by the  new Ministry of Government (formerly the Ministry of the  Interior) is essentially aimed at ensuring the effective and  continuing defense of society as a whole.    In that sense he pointed out that the struggle against  corruption is now of fundamental importance, not only for the  government but for the Bolivian people as a whole. For this  reason it has been decided to take appropriate action, in an  organized and systematic way, to fight more effectively against  this endemic evil of society.    Quiroga stated that the Ministry of Government will provide  this new, anticorruption office with the whole structure and  resources of the state intelligence and security organizations  to undertake investigations of corruption in the different  departments of government and in other areas of national life.    For this purpose he indicated that letter boxes will be set  up in the most heavily populated places in the principal cities  of the country so that citizens can deposit their complaints  about corrupt actions. These complaints should contain basic  information which might assist investigations and could make  suggestions which would contribute to the success of this effort.    The minister explained that the anticorruption office will  not in any way be turned into an organization dedicated to  "witch hunts or a search for ghosts." He said that the work to  be done will use advanced methods of investigation and will be  handled in a responsible and serious way, so that it will  generate confidence and credibility in the eyes of public  opinion.    He stated that the work to be undertaken by this office will  be essentially investigative in character. Once the appropriate  investigations are completed and concrete evidence is available  on clearly criminal cases of corruption, the evidence will be  turned over to the appropriate courts for action in coordination  with the Ministry of Justice.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Thai telecoms group's Bt7.25bn share offering Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&amp;T), the consortium installing 1m telephone lines in the provinces of Thailand, this week becomes the latest Thai telecommunications company to go public with the offer of 10 per cent of its enlarged share capital to the public. The offer of 50m shares at Bt145 each should raise Bt7.25bn (Dollars 285m), and value the company at the equivalent of nearly Dollars 3bn when trading begins next month. 40 per cent of the new shares has been set aside for foreign investors and the rest reserved for Thais. Phatra Thanakit is lead manager for the issue, and a total of 62 finance and securities companies are listed as underwriters. Investor interest in the Thai telecommunications sector remains intense as the private sector rapidly makes up the shortage of lines left in recent years by the military-controlled duopoly of the Telephone Organisation of Thailand (Tot) and the Communications Authority of Thailand. Following the recent listing of several companies, including TelecomAsia, which has the contract to install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok, the communications sector now accounts for 16 per cent of the capitalisation of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. TT&amp;T, in which Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the Thai companies Loxley and Jasmine International each have a stake of about 20 per cent, won the provincial telephone concession after a previous Thai government reduced the number of lines allocated to TelecomAsia and reopened bidding for provincial lines. Jasmine, which has other communications interests, is expected to be listed in the next few months. Under the terms of its contract, TT&amp;T gives 43 per cent of the revenue from the new lines to the Tot, compared with the 16 per cent handed over by TelecomAsia, but stockbrokers say provincial lines provide more revenue because more calls are long distance rather than local. TT&amp;T forecasts that its net profit will be Bt39m this year, rising to Bt1.36bn in 1995, Bt2.6bn in 1996 - by which time 760,000 new lines should have been installed - and Bt5bn in 1998.</p>

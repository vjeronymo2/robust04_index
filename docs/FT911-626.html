			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Fast-track at the end of the line: A vital US congressional vote which could determine the fate of the Uruguay Round of trade talks Soon - at the latest by the end of the month and probably sooner - the army of trade negotiators who have been struggling to complete the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva will know whether their four-and-a-half-year effort has been a total waste of time. The US Congress is gearing up to vote on a two-year extension of the administration's 'fast-track' authority to negotiate trade agreements. Without that authority the administration's hands would be effectively tied, and there would be no hope of completing the Uruguay Round, which has been limping along since the Brussels trade ministerial meeting in December broke up in deadlock. As the deadline draws near amid some of the most ferocious lobbying Capitol Hill has ever seen, most political pundits in Washington believe the extension will be narrowly granted. But it will be far from a categoric victory for supporters of free multilateral trade and an uncertain reprieve for the most ambitious attempt to reform the world trading system since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was founded in 1947. Under the fast-track rule, Congress agrees to refrain from amending any trade agreements struck by the administration when implementing legislation is brought to Capitol Hill. Instead of picking holes in the agreement and discarding clauses that it does not like, it is committed simply to voting the whole package in or out on the basis of a single vote. It is thus a way of making sure that concessions granted by the US in trade talks actually stick. Without the fast-track authority, the 100 or so other countries who are involved in the Uruguay Round would not regard Washington as a reliable negotiating partner and would refuse to bargain. So important is the authority to Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, that she has abstained from all foreign travel until the congressional vote is through. Obsessed though Uruguay Round negotiators have become with the fast-track, the debate in Washington has, however, had little to do with the Gatt. Instead the focus has been almost exclusively on parallel plans for the US to negotiate a free trade pact with Mexico for which the administration says fast-track authority is also vital. Even in this context, the discussion in Congress has had less to do with trade per se than with a panoply of other issues such as jobs, the environment and investment. With hindsight, it is not surprising that Mexico has assumed the importance that it has. Unless their livelihood is in textiles or farming, most Americans have only a vague idea of what the Gatt and the Uruguay Round are all about, but they are all too acutely aware of what the proposed deal with Mexico could mean. It has sparked worries about the diversion of investment to plants south of the border where labour costs are a seventh of those in the US, about workers' rights there, and about environmental protection since Mexico's laws are laxer than those of the US. Some say the AFL-CIO trade union federation has exploited these worries to try to make the fast-track vote a test of attitudes to organised labour. Congressmen are worried that if they vote for extension, they may lose union financial support. Overlaying the debate are the traditional concerns of domestic US politics - the worry of northern smoke-stack states that they may lose their economic clout, and the desire of Congress to assert itself over President George Bush, with whom the Mexican agreement is closely identified. Mr Niel Ritchie of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a leading player of the lobby opposing fast-track, wants to convince Democrats that it is smart politics to 'stop playing footsie with Bush' and take control over the negotiating process. The Mexican pact is unpopular because 'people in the US don't want the government doing deals under the cloak of darkness. For solutions to be politically workable they have to be made by the people they affect'. It is on issues such as these, rather than the actual state of play in the Geneva negotiations, that the fast-track vote, and thus the immediate fate of the Uruguay Round now depends. There are few clues offered by the debate so far to US attitudes towards the Gatt itself. Only since May 1, when the administration released an action plan containing concessions on environmental and job issues, has the tide begun to swing in the administration's favour. 'We've stopped the momentum of opposition and rolled it back. We're moving ahead, but we're not yet winning,' says Mr Harry Freeman of the MTN Coalition, a big business group which supports both the Uruguay Round and the Mexican plan. Administration officials believe the Senate would agree to an extension of fast-track, but the vote is much closer in the House of Representatives - and either can reject the extension request by a simple majority. Both Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee, whose support is vital, are in favour of extension. Mr Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic majority leader and a supporter of unilateralist trade policy, yesterday gave conditional support to the fast-track request, but warned 'if the administration . . . trades away American jobs or tolerates pollution or abuse of workers, we can and we will amend (the final agreement) or reject it'. Adding to the complexity are compromise proposals in both houses, which would split the fast-track vote and allow the Uruguay Round to go ahead but permit amendments on the Mexican agreement in a few important areas: environment, rules of origin, health and safety standards, and dispute settlement. The opponents of the Gatt - mostly farm groups and textile interests - are trying to prevent a split because they know the Mexico pact is more controversial. The compromise, proposed by Senator Donald Riegle and Congressman Sander Levin, both from Michigan, has appeal to the undecided. It will be difficult to get through the Senate, but stands more chance in the House. Mr Levin argues that the May 1 action plan is 'responsive but inadequate'. He says: 'With Gatt you have 100-plus nations and you don't have integration of economies. Here you have integration and negotiation with one nation so you have a much higher objective and some added issues and risks. Because of the disparities in the economies of Mexico and the US, there are major unmet concerns ly. 'If they fail, we are left with weighing steel and autos with tomatoes. I don't want to be put in that position. Congress needs a significant role where you have significant problems. Being consulted is not enough.' The decision by the AFL-CIO to focus the debate on Mexico has muddied the waters by providing cover for congressmen whose instinct may be protectionist but who are reluctant to speak out against free trade. The AFL-CIO's concern, though, is not primarily with the Gatt. Even if it loses the fast-track debate, labour will have won a victory of sorts, says Mr Mark Anderson, AFL-CIO international economist, because the terms of the debate have changed. Environment, labour rights, wage rate disparities and job losses have been put on the agenda. 'Before these issues were being studiously ignored and, indeed, rejected by the Bush administration. Now the issue is whether or not they will be addressed in a useful fashion. Instead of spouting simplistic free-trade or protectionist rhetoric, the coalition made trade issues as complicated as they really are in real life.' None the less, many in the pro-Gatt lobby believe the Uruguay Round has gained by default, through being largely left out of the debate. While politicians can satisfy one side of their constituency by admitting to doubts over Mexico, they can refrain from offending their liberal supporters by indicating support in principle for the Gatt. 'Compared with the Mexican agreement, the Uruguay Round has come up smelling like a rose,' says Mr Jeffrey Schott of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. The danger, if a fast-track extension is agreed, is that this sentiment will lead to over-confidence in Geneva about what sort of Uruguay Round agreement would pass through Congress at the end of the day. 'The Uruguay Round is not, at this time at least, very controversial,' says Mr Hal Malmgren, a US trade consultant. 'The opposing forces who are interested in not having too much trade liberalisation seem to have decided to narrow the focus to just Mexico. That does not, however, mean that, later, an agreement in the Uruguay Round will meet an enthusiastic reception.' Pressure is growing in Geneva for the Round to be completed before the end of the year so that the implementing legislation can be laid before Congress before the 1992 presidential election campaign gets under way. With Europe still reluctant to offer substantial new concessions on farm reform, some trade diplomats believe that the heat will be turned on the US in an effort to persuade it to scale down its ambitions in this sector. This school of thought is encouraged by hints that the new US secretary of agriculture, Mr Ed Madigan, is more conciliatory than his predecessor, Mr Clayton Yeutter, towards Brussels on farm reform. Yet trade insiders in Washington warn that the overall package will still have to contain a critical mass of benefits for Congress to pass the deal. Almost certainly this will have to include a strong package of farm reforms, not least because, without that, other countries, notably farm exporting nations in Latin America, will decline to deliver vital concessions on liberalising trade in services. Even while the fast-track debate has been raging, however, the forces for unilateralism in US trade policy have been gathering pace. Car makers, led by Mr Lee Iacocca of Chrysler, have sought protection against Japanese competition, The US semiconductor industry has complained about Japan withholding access to new technology, the aerospace sector has been lobbying for an intensification of the dispute over Airbus subsidies, and Mrs Hills has lodged new complaints against Japan on construction and against China on intellectual property. It is against this backdrop that any Uruguay Round agreement will be viewed. One frequently-voiced argument in Washington is that the bilateral issues which divide the US are largely outside the scope of the Gatt, but the Uruguay Round is intended to bring some of them, such as services and intellectual property, into its fold, and thereby restrain the US determination to go-it-alone in sorting out its commercial problems. According to Mr Bill Archey, head of trade policy at the US Chamber of Commerce, the fast-track debate underlines the way in which Congress is determined to take a strong role in trade matters. Having passed the 1988 Trade Act, US politicians turned their attention to other matters and gave Mrs Hills very much a free hand. Now their are anxious once again to rein in the administration. This is not died-in-the-wool protectionism, Washington trade experts say, but more a concern about competitiveness and ensuring that overseas markets are opened up. In this context the US is coming to recognise that it is no longer strong enough to hold the multilateral trading system together by making the most concessions. There must be an offsetting gain for everything it gives away. So Congress is still likely to scrutinise any final Uruguay Round agreement more closely than ever before and the administration will not be able to push through concessions 'unless,' as Mr Archey says, 'they beget something tangible for business.' That still looks like being the subject of another contentious debate.</p>

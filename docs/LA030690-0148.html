			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> ESSAY;  </P> <P> WHAT MAKES AMERICA WORK?  </P> <P> He works in a forest, where the trees are high and the pay is low, but glories  in the tranquility of open space.  </P> <P> No amount of money, prestige or fringe benefit will ever lure him back to the  city.  </P> <P> She works before the television cameras, where egos clash and sensitivities are  trampled, but endures the emotional strife of acting for the moment she can  touch a viewer's soul.  </P> <P> No bottom-line studio mentality, callous producer or director's temperament  will ever drive her from the career she loves.  </P> <P> He works in a factory that repairs airplane parts, where precision, not chance,  is the commanding element of his day.  </P> <P> No bolt slips through, no strut goes by, no wheel assembly passes without his  personal approval, because safety in the air flies on his unfaltering judgment.  </P> <P> An outdoor worker, an actress and an airplane mechanic, proud of their work,  eager to do it, anxious to share it.  </P> <P> This is America singing.  </P> <P> Walt Whitman heard it 135 years ago, the songs of carpenters and shoemakers, of  wood cutters and mechanics, "the varied carols" of people at work that give a  nation its drive and substance.  </P> <P> I went in search of them specifically for this essay, asking the same question  of each: Are there rewards beyond money in what they do to make a living?  </P> <P> I studied polls that framed my quest, but polls are bereft of humanity, however  impressive their often contradictory results.  </P> <P> They told me that most people would keep working even if they didn't have to.  They told me that Americans ranked occupation low on a satisfaction scale,  behind family, friends, love and health.  </P> <P> They told me that challenge and a sense of accomplishment are at least as  important as status, and pride and appreciation as important as money.  </P> <P> Questions asked, numbers compiled, results analyzed. But do the people still  sing?  </P> <P> Some do, some don't.  </P> <P> Whitman ignored slavery and sweatshops in his verse, and the strife of  inequality that characterized 19th-Century America. Those who moaned didn't  sing.  </P> <P> Today, slavery is history. But thousands of Southern Californians still labor  in sweatshops. And the modern workplace has spawned dilemmas that Whitman could  not have envisioned.  </P> <P> Electronics have altered the nature of our world, creating new burdens for the  employee even as they create new profits for the employer.  </P> <P> Computers conflict with quiet human needs. The old ways aren't always best, but  a stampede toward progress tramples experience and instinct as though they  never mattered.  </P> <P> As the search goes on for new solutions, old problems persist: the soaring  costs of education and training, the agonizing necessity to choose between  money and personal satisfaction, the ferocity of competition, the pain of  failure and the evils of discrimination in many guises.  </P> <P> But still the people sing.  </P> <P> Allen Armand, 26, working in a state forest, sings of nature as Whitman himself  did, "aplomb in the midst of irrational things."  </P> <P> Armand left the hectic pace of varied jobs in Los Angeles two years ago for the  serenity of the north coast redwoods. Today, he draws from his job as park aide  the satisfaction that he is working to protect an environment that, even in its  majesty, is at risk.  </P> <P> "If we don't preserve it now," he asks, "who will? And when?"  </P> <P> Dorothy Dells, an actress in her middle years, sings of the pleasures that  emerge from the creation of a role and the psychic link that connects her with  an audience she can't see.  </P> <P> Hers is a quest for pride through perfection that has honed her career on and  off for 15 years, both as an actress and a student of acting. She works  steadily in a business that suffers the majority of its practitioners to long  periods of unemployment, and she bears with equanimity the pain of failure.  </P> <P> "You have to take personal pride in what you do," she says during a quiet day  on the set of an upcoming ABC movie on the Beach Boys, "because so often that's  all you have."  </P> <P> "Most of the time you're going out on auditions, giving your all for two  minutes . . . and never hearing back. That hurts. But you keep at it because  every once in a while you get a hug from a director who says, 'You were great!'  And that counts a lot."  </P> <P> Joe Kanke, chief inspector and boss of the overhaul division for Sun Valley's  Time Aviation, sings of responsibility and the pieces of history that surround  him in the workplace where he prevails. Parts of DC-3s, the early wonder of  modern flight, and Boeing 767s, the newest work  </P> <P> horse of the jet age, assume new life in the repair division that Kanke  oversees.  </P> <P> He's been an airplane mechanic for 25 of his 47 years. He earned his licenses  by attending night schools even as he worked during the day. In 1970, he was  named the FAA's Western Region Mechanic of the Year.  </P> <P> A deep sense of contributing is part of why Kanke loves his job. He means  something. He counts. It's a rare feeling of individual worth in an arena of  collective achievement.  </P> <P> "One cracked bolt," he says, holding up a defective part, "can mean anything  from nothing to disaster. It's as critical as the part it holds together." He  pauses, then adds with a mixture of pride and commitment, "I won't let it get  by."  </P> <P> Armand, Dells, Kanke. Luck and effort have produced the joy in their music.  They have adapted to problems of low pay, uncertainty and the relentless  strains of precision to come to peace with their careers.  </P> <P> Not everyone has.  </P> <P> A millwright at General Motors who trained four years for his journeyman card  despises the uncertainty that haunts America's auto industry, specifically GM's  Van Nuys plant.  </P> <P> "I like what I do and I like the people," he says, "but there's so much stress  in not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow. There's no peace in the job. We  don't even know if this plant is going to be open a month from now."  </P> <P> A young sales clerk in an electronics store longs for something different.  </P> <P> "Selling isn't what I want to do," she says, looking up from the sketch of a  dress she has designed in her spare moments.  </P> <P> She is sketching when I walk in and is deliberately slow in tearing away from  it. She's proud of the drawing. She wants me to see it.  </P> <P> "Fashion is what I want to do, but my parents don't like the idea and won't pay  for the training. I can't afford it on my own. I work here, but it's a second  choice."  </P> <P> She sighs. "Maybe someday. . . ."  </P> <P> I heard America singing.  </P> <P> I heard a highway worker laugh at the rain. I heard a policeman lecture on  safety. I heard a taco maker sing his own songs in the back room of a fast-food  restaurant.  </P> <P> I sing this essay and the wonder of the worker who sings of himself, however  brutal his task and impossible his goal.  </P> <P> Their voices rise across the land.  </P> <P> Editor: Jonathan Peterson * News Editor: Conrad de Aenlle * Art Director: Matt  Moody  </P></p>

In addition to HUD data, the CAIVRS data base now includes delinquent debt information from the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Veterans Affairs and the Small Business Administration. This match will allow prescreening of applicants for loans or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or insured by the Federal Government for HUD or SBA direct or guaranteed loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before granting a loan, the lending agency and/or the authorized lending institution will be able to interrogate the CAIVRS debtor file which contains the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of HUD's delinquent debtors and defaulters and defaulted debtor records of the SBA and verify that the loan applicant is not in default or delinquent on direct or guaranteed loans of participating Federal programs of either agency. Authorized users place a telephone call to the system. The system provides a recorded message followed by a series of instructions, one of which is a requirement for the SSN of the loan applicant. The system then reports audibly whether the SSN is related to delinquent or defaulted Federal obligations for HUD or SBA direct or guaranteed loans. As a result of the information produced by this match, the authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision of any loan assistance to an applicant or take other adverse action against such applicant, until an officer or employee of such agency has independently verified such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Computer matching is expected to begin at least 40 days from the date this computer matching notice is published, providing no comments are received which would result in a contrary determination.

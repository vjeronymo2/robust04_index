			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL TO KEEP ON EXPANDING SETTLEMENTS IN EAST JERUSALEM, LEVY INFORMS BAKER;  </P> <P> CONFRONTATION: THE FOREIGN MINISTER'S LETTER OF CLARIFICATION IS CERTAIN TO  RENEW FRICTION WITH U.S.  </P> <P> Israel will continue to expand settlements in annexed districts of Jerusalem,  as well as in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite persistent  objections from Washington, Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy said Thursday  in a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  </P> <P> The letter is expected to renew the friction that appeared to have receded with  recent pledges by Israel to alter its settlement policies.  </P> <P> In early October, Israel promised not to use American aid money to build new  neighborhoods on land seized by Israel in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. In  addition, Israel promised not to settle Soviet immigrants across the so-called  Green Line that separated pre-1967 Israel from Jordan.  </P> <P> The dual guarantees opened the way for U.S. approval of $400 million in loan  guarantees for immigrant housing but touched off a storm of criticism from  members of the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which has a fragile  two-seat majority in Parliament.  </P> <P> On Thursday, in order to clarify "differing interpretations," Levy informed  Baker that his previous pledge would not hinder the construction of  settlements.  </P> <P> "I want to make sure you are aware that in the (earlier) letter there is no  undertaking, either direct or indirect, to refrain from construction within  Jerusalem, or restricting it -- or in any other place, including Judea, Samaria  and Gaza," Levy wrote. Judea and Samaria are the biblical names Israelis apply  to the West Bank to symbolize what they regard as Israel's historical right to  the land.  </P> <P> "My government has an ideological foundation," Levy continued. "If you think  that we will change our credo on the basis of which the government was elected  because of these investment (loan) guarantees, you should know that this will  not happen."  </P> <P> Implicit in Levy's letter, Israeli officials say, is that Soviet immigrants  will be settled in new housing in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after  the 1967 war. Under a plan unveiled this week, six new neighborhoods will be  built in East Jerusalem.  </P> <P> In the U.S. view, East Jerusalem lies beyond the Green Line, but Israel  considers the city to be within the line that separates Israel from the West  Bank.  </P> <P> Levy's letter highlights the gap between the United States and Israel over  eventual control of East Jerusalem, with its large Arab population, as well as  the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million Palestinians live.  </P> <P> Israel considers Jerusalem a closed subject. In Israel's view, no Green Line  traverses the city; the municipal boundaries, including annexed Arab  neighborhoods, are permanent. Although Israel has stopped short of annexing the  West Bank and Gaza, the government has seized large areas of land and turned  them over to Israeli settlement.  </P> <P> Because housing is less expensive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip than in  Israel proper, Israelis in increasing numbers are being tempted to move across  the Green Line as the Soviet influx drives up rents and purchase prices.  Financial breaks for contractors may also make new East Jerusalem housing  cheaper.  </P> <P> The United States still views Jerusalem as technically divided, with its status  to be decided by negotiation. Both Bush and Baker have said the city should  remain physically united, although they reserve comment on its political  future. In the past, the United States has favored putting Jerusalem under  international control.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has characterized Israeli settlements on the West Bank  and Gaza Strip as obstacles to peace talks. Last spring, Baker raised the issue  of whether U.S. aid frees up funds that permit Israel to move ahead with its  settlement program.  </P> <P> At a time when Israel is pressing for more aid to cover the influx of Soviet  Jews, the government will spend $80 million on expanding West Bank and Gaza  settlements, Israeli newspapers say.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry officials say the original Levy pledge on immigrant housing  and settlements was designed to minimize U.S.-Israeli discord.  </P> <P> "We would disagree, but not worry about it now," a ministry official said.  </P> <P> East Jerusalem never came up in the negotiations over the pledge, he said.  </P> <P> However, two events have occurred to push the issue forward, and rivals of Levy  in the government -- some say Shamir himself -- have rushed to criticize Levy  for "surrendering" sovereignty over the city.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Shamir muddied the issue with terse comments on radio.  </P> <P> "Whoever accepts these (U.S.) conditions doesn't mean he agrees to all these  limitations always and under all circumstances," Shamir said.  </P> <P> Last week's bloodshed on the Temple Mount, when police trying to deal with  rioters killed 21 Palestinians, also drew attention to the divided nature of  the city. Israel rejected a U.N. investigation of the Temple Mount incident,  saying it would infringe on Israel's control of the city.  </P> <P> Like the United States, the United Nations does not recognize the 1967  annexation of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Washington is trying to keep intact a multilateral military force in Saudi  Arabia to force Iraq out of Kuwait, and it views the Jerusalem turmoil as  undermining relations with its Arab allies.  </P> <P> In recent days, Israel has been trying to shift the focus back to the Kuwaiti  crisis while at the same time giving no ground on either the settlements issue  or the question of permitting a U.N. team to investigate the Temple Mount  incident.  </P></p>

			<p>Boron   Oxide and Boron Nitride   <F P=102> 43070061J Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 49--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061J </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Yasuji Muramatsu, Tom </F> Scimeca, and Masaharu Oshima, NTT Interdisciplinary Research  Laboratories; Jun Kawai, Institute of Physical and Chemical  Research (RIKEN); and Hiroo Kato, Photon Factory, National  Laboratory for High Energy Physics]    [Text] Recently, several X-ray emission threshold  experiments have been attempted to elucidate satellite  structures in X-ray emission spectra using monochromatized  synchrotron radiation.[.sup]1,2[/] The satellite structure in  BK_a_ emission spectra of boron oxide and boron nitride is  particularly interesting because the origin of the high- energy  satellites is not predicted from DV-X_a_ molecular orbital  calculations.[.sup]3[/] The aim of this study is to  investigate the satellite structure in the BK_a_ emission  spectra of the boron compounds from threshold experiments using  highly brilliant undulator radiation as an excitation probe.    Spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a fluorescent  X-ray spectrometer of sophisticated design[.sup]4,5[/]  installed on an undulator beamline (BL-16U)[.sup]6,7[/] at  the Photon Factory.    A prominent increase in the high-energy satellite peak  heights was first observed when the excitation energy was tuned  to the narrow pre-edge peak in the B1s absorption spectrum  corresponding to the transition from B(1s) to an unoccupied  anti-bonding orbital (p*). It is therefore confirmed that  the  high-energy satellites originate from resonant reemission due to  a B(1s)-p* -B(1s[.sup]-l[/]) transition. This resonant  reemission phenomenon reflects the electric structure of the  localized anti-bonding p* orbital in  trigonal-planar-structured boron compounds.  References    1. R.D. Deslattes, R.E.

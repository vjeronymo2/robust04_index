			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus for the QS block proposals. The Council asked its staff to analyze the first of the QS block proposals, the Sitka Block proposal, at its April 1992 meeting. The Sitka Block proposal provided that (1) initial QS for each IFQ regulatory area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to be transferred as a block, and (3) the ``maximum block size'' allowed in each IFQ regulatory area would be one-half the most restrictive QS use limit for an area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Full/Partial Block proposal was considered at the January 1993 Council meeting. It provided that (1) initial QS for each IFQ regulatory area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred as a block, (3) QS that represented 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued as a ``full block'' for that IFQ regulatory area, and (4) QS that represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) would be issued as a ``partial block'' for that IFQ regulatory area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Modified Block proposed amendment was passed after the Council took public testimony and discussed the other two block proposals at its September 1993 meeting. The Modified Block  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposal retained most of the features of the current IFQ program, including the same ownership constraints and the same vessel size categories. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that (1) only initial allocations of QS that represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued as a block, (2) QS that represented 20,000 lb  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who did not hold any unblocked QS could hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks could not exceed use limits in 50 CFR 676.22 (e) and (f). A person who held unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area could hold only one QS block for that area, provided that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area did not exceed use limits referenced above. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut (or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish) in the implementation year could be combined. The QS block resulting from this combination could not exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This ``sweeping-up'' provision was designed to allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All three block proposals, the Sitka Block Proposal, the Full/Partial Block Proposal, and the Modified Block Proposal, were designed to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ program. The EA/RIR/IRFA indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential consolidation, more QS holders likely would remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under any of the three block proposals than under the current IFQ program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council adopted the Modified Block Proposal because it prevented excessive consolidation of QS by blocking any QS allocation for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year (1994). Also, it did not unnecessarily interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in 1994 would remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would achieve the objectives of the other block proposals ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , protect small producers, part-time participants, and entry level participants that may tend to disappear because of excessive consolidation under the current IFQ program), with fewer restrictions on the flexibility and the economic efficiency of the IFQ program as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether QS is blocked or unblocked would be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October 17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons would be treated in a similar manner, regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was long enough after the application period (ends July 15, 1994) to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective of their eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Transfer of QS Blocks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Blocked and unblocked QS would be transferable subject to the approval of the Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. The Modified Block Proposal creates the potential that some QS blocks would become non-transferable, because their size would exceed the QS use limits in 50 CFR 676.22 (e) and (f). This potential was addressed in the EA/RIR/IRFA dated December 17, 1993. Since there was only a slight potential of having a QS block that would be non-transferable, and only a few regulatory areas were affected, an alternative was developed to solve the issue of non-transferability, rather than totally abandoning the Modified Block Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This alternative would permit the transfer of a QS block that exceeded the QS use limits by dividing the block into two blocks. The sizes of the resulting blocks would depend on the QS use limit preventing the transfer_one block would be the maximum size allowable under the QS use limit, the other block would contain the residual QS. Dividing a block to allow its transfer when it would be otherwise non-transferable because it exceeded the QS use limit is an exception to the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;676.21(d)(1)). Under any other circumstance, a QS block could not be divided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

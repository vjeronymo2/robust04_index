Direct-contact transmission involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as occurs when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other patient-care activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission can also occur between two patients with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Indirect-contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Droplet transmission <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , theoretically, is a form of contact transmission. However, the mechanism of transfer of the pathogen to the host is quite distinct from either direct- or indirect-contact transmission. Therefore, droplet transmission will be considered a separate route of transmission in this guideline. Droplets are generated from the source person primarily during coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy. Transmission occurs when droplets containing microorganisms generated from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the host's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth. Transmission of this nature must not be confused with airborne transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Airborne Transmission  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue [5 microns or smaller in size] of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be widely dispersed by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient depending on environmental factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Common Vehicle Transmission  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> applies to microorganisms transmitted by contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vectorborne Transmission  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms; this route of transmission is of less significance in hospitals in the United States than in other regions of the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Isolation precautions are designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by these routes in hospitals. Since agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of spread of infection is directed primarily at transmission. The recommendations presented in this guideline are based on this concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placing a patient on isolation precautions, however, often presents certain disadvantages to the hospital, patients, personnel, and visitors. Isolation precautions may require specialized equipment and environmental modifications that add to the cost of hospitalization. Isolation precautions may make frequent visits by nurses, physicians, and other personnel inconvenient, and they may make it more difficult for personnel to give the prompt and frequent care that is sometimes required. The use of a multi-patient room for one patient uses valuable space that might otherwise accommodate several patients. Moreover, forced solitude deprives the patient of normal social relationships and may be psychologically harmful, especially to children. These disadvantages, however, must be weighed against the hospital's mission to prevent the spread of serious and epidemiologically important microorganisms in the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fundamentals of Isolation Precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A variety of infection control measures are used for decreasing the risk of transmission of microorganisms in hospitals. These measures make up the fundamentals of isolation precautions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> RONSTADT RAPS ARENAS FOR POP  </P> <P> Linda Ronstadt blames arena concerts and radio programmers for the "awful"  state of pop music.  </P> <P> "What really ruined pop music is the architecture that it's presented in,"  Ronstadt told the Pittsburgh Press.  </P> <P> "Any place that's bigger than 11,000 is just not a suitable environment for  music."  </P> <P> Describing the sound in such places as "swimmy and boomy," she said, "I hate  playing in them, and I will never be in an audience at one of them."  </P> <P> Of the current music scene, the singer-songwriter said, "It's awful." One  reason: "the corporate approach to radio programming."  </P> <P> "If you're a musician and you come from Memphis or Nashville or New Orleans,  areas that have some of the richest musical heritage in the country, you have  to go to Los Angeles in order to do it," Ronstadt said.  </P></p>

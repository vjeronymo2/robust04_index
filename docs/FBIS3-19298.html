			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union and  [EU] Norway reached agreement here early Wednesday [16 March] on  Norwegian membership of the EU, the Greek presidency of the EU  said.    Diplomats said Norway had joined Austria, Finland and Sweden  in qualifying to join the 12-nation union on January 1 next year.    One diplomat said: "It's a considerable breakthrough. Most  people here didn't believe Norway would do it on time."    The breakthrough came after Norway and the EU agreed to  Spanish demands for extra fishing catch quotas as part of  Norway's entry ticket to the Union.    Under a complicated formula, the EU's four poorest countries  have been given the right to an extra 14,100 tonnes of annual  cod catch quotas in the Barents Sea starting in 1998.    About 6,000 tonnes will be offered by Norway, calculated  partly on a predicted increase in fish stocks by 1998, and the  EU is to buy the right to catch another 8,000 tonnes, mainly in  the Russian waters of the Barents Sea.    EU officials said 45 percent of the extra quotas would go to  Spain, 45 percent to Portugal, five percent to Ireland and five  percent to Greece.    Austria, Finland and Sweden agreed to their terms for  joining  the EU on March 1, but Oslo originally refused Spain's demand  for access to Norway's fish-rich waters.    But EU membership for Norway and the other applicants is  still dependent on ratification by popular referendums in each  of the four countries and by the European Parliament.    It also depends on resolution of an internal EU quarrel over  changes in the voting rules of ministerial councils to take  account of the newcomers.    Britain, with some backing from Spain, continued Tuesday to  oppose any change in the balance of power which would result  from the entry of four new members.    EU foreign ministers will meet here again next Tuesday to  continue their attempts to overcome the British objection.</p>

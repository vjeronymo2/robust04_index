			<p>CSO     [Text] AIST's Government Industrial Research Institute,  Osaka ([GIRIO] Reikichi Iwamoto, chief) has developed a  micro-actuator (drive apparatus), a bonding of metal to the  surface of high polymer electrolyte film which can bend and  rotate in response to a one-volt signal and move in a way  similar to that of living muscle in terms of cilia movement,  undulation, and so on. Its structure is simple. Since it can  easily be made only some ten microns in size, it appears that it  can be used as medical micromachines, for example, micro-pumps  or micro-robots.    Until recently high polymer actuator development tested only  the use of swelling high polymer gel, but that had the drawback  of slow response time. Moreover, it was difficult to use in a  living body because high voltage was needed to drive it with a  signal and hydrogen gas would be given off by electrolysis in  bodily fluids.    In 1992 GIRIO chemically plated silver onto fluorine resin  ion exchange film and ascertained that when electricity was sent  along a lead line attached to both sides of the film, the film  was driven by low voltage. Later research on its functions  confirmed it: it was several tens of microns small, it moved on  low voltage, there were no emissions of gas due to electrolysis,  it moved freely at low to high speeds, varying with frequency of  1-100 Hz, and it showed responsiveness similar to living muscle.  Its endurance was confirmed in experiments which showed stable  behavior for more than two months, including usage more than 5  million times.    Revolution and bending should be possible using these  functions. If it can be made to move like a fin it can be used  as a micro-pump inside the body or as the propeller for a  micro-robot swimming through bodily fluids. "It can probably be  used soon for opening or closing valves or as a micro-valve or  artificial pancreas-type liquid drug release control," said  Keisuke Oguro, chief of GIRIO's energy and environmental  materials division. The movement of the actuator is influenced  by ions in the solution and type of electrode metal, so it is  possible to design actuators that have different movement  functions by altering these conditions.</p>

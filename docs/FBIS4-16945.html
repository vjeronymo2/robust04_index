			<p>BFN     [Text] Cutbacks in Russian gas exports to Moldova will hit  living standards, Vice Premier Valeriu Bulgaru who is  responsible for the agro-industrial complex believes. In an  interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday, he said the government was  seeking to raise extra funds to be able to clear arrears for gas  imports from Russia.    Bulgar said the cabinet was working hard to try to resolve  the problem of a trade deficit with Russia.    At the same time, he said the problem of gas imports from  Russia was of general concern from government officials down to  ordinary consumers. In his view, the mechanisms of a market  economy will push energy consumers towards unusual  decisionmaking.    On Tuesday, one other Vice Premier Valentin Cunev whose area  of responsibility covers transport, construction and energy said  that gas supply to industrial consumers would be reduced by a  third. He called on consumers to stick to the principle of  "reduce consumption if you cannot pay."</p>

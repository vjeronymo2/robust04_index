			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Russian forces today bade  farewell to Berliners with a military parade to mark their  departure from Germany. Taking part in the parade in the east  Berlin district of Koepenick were 1,500 soldiers of the 6th  Motorized Rifle Brigade, which has been stationed in Berlin for  49 years. About 20,000 of the capital's inhabitants and their  guests lined the street to witness this historic event. A large  number of honored guests, among them the Russian ambassador to  Germany and representatives of the former Western allies and the  Bundeswehr, viewed the parade of the Berlin Brigade, as it is  known, from the VIP rostrum.    In his speech, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said the Berliners and  the Russian forces leaving the city were parting in friendship.  The mayor said he hoped many of the soldiers now returning to  their homeland would come back to Berlin. "We want to remain  good neighbors and friends," he said. Diepgen recalled that the  Russians had first come to Germany, with many losses and  sacrifices, 50 years previously as victors and liberators from  National Socialism with the Western allies. That will remain  their historic achievement. Since then there have been "good  and bad days," and there had often been "difficult times,"  Diepgen went on. He paid tribute to the "special services" which  the Western Group of Russian forces had rendered in the days of  the peaceful revolution in eastern Germany. Colonel General  Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander of the Western Group of  Russian forces in Germany, said the Berlin Brigade is the last  unit of Russian troops to leave German territory. He had a  "feeling of mission accomplished." Burlakov said that the  departure of Russian troops is proceeding exactly according to  schedule. Approximately 98 percent of the 500,000 men, the  123,000 weapons and pieces of equipment, and around 2.6 million  tonnes of material has already been withdrawn over the past  three-and-a-half years. This process will be completed by the  end of August. The joy at returning to the homeland is,  however, mixed with sadness at saying farewell to the befriended  German people, Burlakov said.    The program was staged by the company forming the honor  guard  and the Western Group of Forces military orchestra. The Berlin  Brigade sang "Farewell Germany" in German and Russian. This was  followed by a performance by the Western Group's song and dance  company.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Trolleys are the answer on M25 Sir, The UK government's proposals to provide more motorway service areas ('M-way service sites to increase as controls are eased', and leading article, August 7) will amuse regular users of the M25, well on its way to earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest circular car park in the world. A more appropriate solution on that motorway would be British Rail-style trolley service. Adrian Wood, Court House, The Green, Rottingdean, Brighton BN2 7HA</p>

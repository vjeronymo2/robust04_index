Under the scheme contractors will be expected to design new roads or improvements to existing ones, finance their construction and manage and maintain them for between 15 and 25 years. They will be paid 'shadow tolls' by the government, reflecting traffic volumes on the roads and the quality of maintenance. Among the consortia which have declared an interest in the the programme are: Construction companies Costain and Bovis, the RAC and NatWest Markets. The RAC contribution would be its traffic management and information systems. Contractors John Laing and Tarmac with Welsh Water, Transroute, a French toll road operator, and BZW, a merchant bank. Construction companies Amec and Alfred McAlpine with a Spanish contractor, Dragados. Construction groups Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine and Amey with banker Morgan Stanley.

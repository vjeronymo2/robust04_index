			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Today's meetings of  Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who arrived on a  two-day official visit here yesterday, showed that there are  good prospects for the development of bilateral relations and  the promotion of economic cooperation between Bulgaria and  Indonesia. Today Mr. Alatas was received by President Zhelyu  Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and met with the Deputy  Chairwoman of the National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova.    The lack of controversy between the two countries provides a  basis for mutually beneficial economic cooperation, it was  pointed out. President Zhelev asked Mr. Alatas to intercede  with the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) so that  the problem of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria be taken off the agenda,  president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov said after the meeting.  President Zhelev explained that the issue had been taken up  years ago and is no longer topical, as ethnic Turks in Bulgaria  now enjoy full rights. It is a justified request; the  memorandum I received from Foreign Minister Daskalov and my own  impressions convinced me that the Turkish minority issue is no  longer topical, so I believe the OIC can strike it off the  agenda, Mr. Alatas told reporters. The issue will probably be  tabled for discussion at the organization's next session which  is to be held in Tunisia. The situation in the Balkans and  particularly the fact that Bulgaria's closeness to the conflict  in the former Yugoslavia poses risks which hinder foreign  investment were also discussed by Mr. Alatas and President  Zhelyu Zhelev.    During his meeting with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov Mr.  Alatas pointed out that Indonesian business circles display keen  interest in Bulgaria. Several companies have already come here  to set up joint ventures, the spokesman for the government  Raycho Raykov said after the meeting.    Indonesia's foreign minister discussed the development of  parliamentary contacts with the Deputy Chairwoman of Bulgaria's  National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova. They also discussed  human rights issues and the free expression of the individual.  Mr. Alatas praised Bulgaria's role as a stabilizing factor in  the Balkans and pointed out that its economic stabilization will  further enhance this role.    Although my visit here was short, it was extremely  productive, Mr. Alatas told a news conference before his  departure. There are no controversies between us; what we have  to do now is make the bilateral relations more meaningful, he  added. Our purpose is to open the door to international  cooperation, said his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov.  During the meetings Mr. Alatas had with Bulgarian officials it  was pointed out repeatedly that Bulgaria and Indonesia share a  similar geopolitical position: They can both be used as  bridgeheads to other regions. Indonesia could help Bulgaria  approach the markets in southeastern Asia and Bulgaria could  help Indonesia into the markets of the former Soviet republics  and the Balkan countries, the two foreign ministers pointed out.  "We should not restrict ourselves to bilateral cooperation; we  should try to capture third markets together," Mr. Alatas said  in conclusion.</p>

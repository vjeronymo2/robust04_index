			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Speech by Gyaincain Norbu at an autonomous regional </F> meeting of provincial- and prefectural-level cadres on 22 May  1994"]    [Text] Comrades:    The Second Sessions of the Sixth Autonomous Regional  People's  Congress and the Sixth Autonomous Regional Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] are  being held at a crucial moment when the autonomous region is  accelerating its reform and opening up. Over the last week and  more, the two sessions have concentrated on discussing the main  topics of reform, development, and stability as well as the  general task of "seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening  up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability."  They have fully displayed the superiority of the people's  congress system and the political consultation system in  actively discussing the important issues of Tibet. Entrusted by  the people of all nationalities and all walks of life in Tibet,  the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC committee members,  with a high degree of sense of responsibility, have  realistically appraised last year's government work, seriously  examined and discussed this year's government work plans, put  forward many valuable comments and suggestions, and placed  ardent expectations on governments at all levels. We must  treasure very much the encouragement given to all government  functionaries by the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC  committee members. We must treat the people's demands and  aspirations in a very responsible way and live up to their  expectations. We must take the current opportunity to enhance  vigor, work diligently and conscientiously, and do even better  government work to make the 2.3 million people of all  nationalities in Tibet rest assured and satisfied.    In the work of stabilizing the situation and the  antisplittist struggle, our situation is more special, our  struggle is more complex, and our tasks are more arduous than  other parts of the country. The work of stabilizing the  situation is an important task shared by the party committees,  the public security and judicial departments, and governments at  all levels. Although our reform and development tasks are  particularly arduous this year, we must not attend to one thing  only and lose sight of another. We must attach equal importance  to both the work of maintaining stability and the work of  promoting reform and development, attend to both constantly and  unremittingly, and ensure social stability. Next, I will  discuss several points of view regarding the economic work.  <H5>  1. The present economic situation </H5>   Since the beginning of this year, governments at various  levels, seriously adhering to the guidelines of the Fifth  Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional  CPC Committee and the regional economic work conference, have  achieved initial success in deepening reforms, opening the  region wider to the outside, and developing the economy. While  striving for the overall progress of reform, the governments  have taken the crucial step to formulate comprehensive reform  plans. All productive and business activities are proceeding  smoothly, and the economic operation as a whole is basically  normal.    Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Rural Economy -- In this  year, various localities are continuing to strengthen leadership  over the work in rural and pastoral areas, formulating and  implementing productive measures, continuing to readjust the  production structure, and increasing the ratio of cash crops and  fodder crops in grain-producing areas. The autonomous region is  growing 3.23 million mu of crops, up 2 percent from last year.  Of the crops, grain occupies an area of 2.82 million mu, the  same as last year; rape accounts for 240,000 mu, up 33 percent  from last year; and fodder crops cover 170,000 mu, up 70  percent. Since last summer, some localities have suffered  droughts due to less rainfall, and other localities have  experienced storms and snow storms. However, the loss in animal  husbandry was less than anticipated thanks to efforts to combat  natural disasters and protect livestock. Of 2.38 million  newborn animals in the region this year, 1,794,000 had survived  as of the end of March; and the survival rate was 76.1 percent,  slightly lower than last year's corresponding period. In the  same period, 850,000 full-grown animals died; and the death rate  was 3.7 percent, slightly higher than last year's corresponding  period.    Industrial Production and Transport Service -- The region's  total industrial output value in the first four months was 113  million yuan, up 2.4 percent from the same period of last year.  The outputs of all major products increased during the period  as compared with last year's corresponding period, except those  of timber and cement which decreased somewhat. Electric power  generation increased by 7.7 percent; chromium ores, 82.5  percent; boromagnesite, 65.2 percent; leather, 108.8 percent;  wool, 25.9 percent; and flour, 28.3 percent. State-owned  transport service handled 152,900 tonnes of cargo, up 14.8  percent from last year's corresponding period. Of the cargo  transported, inbound goods increased by 22.6 percent, outbound  goods rose 10.6 percent, and [unintelligible word -- possibly  Tibetan Language] [fen yun 0433 6663] increased by 10.9 percent.    Capital Construction -- Projects under construction and  continued from the previous year proceeded fairly smoothly. A  total of 230 million yuan was invested in capital construction  in the period from January through April, accounting for 11.42  percent of this year's investment target and slightly higher  than the figure in the same period last year. There were 16  above-norm projects continued from the previous year and 10  above-norm projects being newly launched.    Foreign Trade and Tourism -- During the period from January  to April, the value of contracts for imports across the border  reached about $333,900 and the export turnover amounted to $1.36  million; both grew 100 percent over the same period last year.  The value of contracts for imports via shipping service  amounted to about $20.69 million, $20.09 million more than the  same period last year; exports were valued at $31,400, up 100  percent from the same period last year. Travel agencies  received 1,972 foreign tourists, with a business income of  19,573,300 yuan and $374,600 in foreign exchange earnings.    The Situation of Revenue -- Tibet collected a total of  52.877  million yuan in taxes from January through April; this includes  29.233 million yuan in industrial and business taxes, up 16.7  percent from the same period last year.    Banking Conditions -- By the end of April, Tibet had issued  a  total of 3.553 billion yuan in various kinds of loans, and  savings totalled 3.837 billion yuan, 831 million yuan and 764  million yuan more than the figures in the same period last year,  respectively. Savings deposits in urban and rural areas reached  986 million yuan by the end of April, 29.2 million yuan more  than the same period last year. The issuance of state bonds has  been completely successfully.    There are still some problems that must not be left  unattended in the current economic work: 1. some pastoral areas  hit by storms and blizzards are having a hard time fighting  disasters and keeping their livestock; 2. due to price hikes and  other reasons, enterprises' production cost has risen and  operation are difficult; 3. the financial and taxation situation  is not promising; prefectures, cities, and units are crying  loudly for a supplementary budget; collection of some categories  of taxes is not satisfactory, even declining; 4. affected by the  price readjustment in the hinterland, prices for the basic  necessities of life and means of production in Tibet are rising  rapidly; many residents and people living in agricultural and  pastoral areas have strong resentment because their lives are  conspicuously harsh.  <H5>  2. Conscientiously Organize and Implement Reform Programs </H5>   Since the beginning of this year, we have made the  establishment of a new socialist market economic structure our  goal and, in light of the state's reform arrangements,  concentrated our efforts to work out a series of reform programs  which have taken Tibet's situation into consideration. In the  second half of this year, we will successively issue reform  programs for the oil industry, foreign trade, and others as well  as policies aiming at properly solving the wage problem in some  enterprises. The reform for this year requires greater effort,  involves a wider scope, sets higher demands, poses more  difficulties, and creates more hard work. Judging from the  current situation, our principal problems are that the reform  has not been carried out satisfactorily and has proceeded  slowly. To make sure all reform programs will be carried out  smoothly, we must pay attention to the following aspects at  present:    First, we must enhance our steadfastness in reform. Tibet's  rapid economic development in recent years should, in the final  analysis, attribute to reform and opening up. The practice has  proven that without reform and opening up, there will be no way  for Tibet to develop its economy. Reform will certainly involve  readjustment in the structure of interests and even affect the  temporary interests of some areas and people in a certain  period; thus a variety of serious difficulties arise. There are  many problems, particularly those concerning the economic field,  that must be resolved through deepening reform and accelerating  development. We cannot waver in our resolve in reform and  consider resuming the old path of a planned economy whenever we  meet difficulties. Reform is like a boat sailing against the  current; it must forge ahead, or it will be driven back. We  should be aware that people of all nationalities in Tibet,  particularly leaders at various levels, are on the same boat of  reform; only by helping each other, unifying their minds, and  braving the wind and the waves can they successfully reach the  opposite bank. In the midst of torrents and rapids, all the  pessimism, disappointment, complaints, and censures will be of  no avail. Therefore, on the issue of reform, we must strengthen  our belief, take the overall situation into consideration, and  set our eyes on the future; leaders at and above county level,  particularly, must unify their thinking and paces; press forward  and be brave in taking risks in the face of difficulties;  actively guide and organize the people to come up with methods,  countermeasures, and answers with the new ideas of the  development of a socialist market economy; and fulfill their  responsibilities as leaders. Only by doing so can we truly put  the overall situation of reform under control.    Second, we should fully understand the contents of the  reform. The reform plans to be implemented this year consist of  a wide range of things and new concepts; therefore, study of  these reform plans is arduous work, especially at a time when we  are still quite unfamiliar with the basic theory of the  socialist market economy. Currently, the pressing task is for  leading cadres at all levels to gain a good understanding as  soon as possible of the basic contents of all reform plans, the  applicability of the established policies, and specific skills  for implementing these policies; to ensure training of  specialized personnel; to ensure that the established policies  are not interpreted one-sidedly; and to see that implementation  of these policies is not delayed and the reform plans are  carried out faithfully.    Third, we should ensure a good job in conducting propaganda  and in explaining the reform plans to the masses. Reform is an  undertaking for all the people. We can achieve nothing if we  solely rely on the efforts of leaders and specialized personnel  and if we lack the masses' understanding, support, and  participation. Therefore, we should focus propaganda work on the  grassroots. We should publish popular and easy-to-understand  propaganda materials to meet the needs of peoples at various  educational levels; we should hold radio and television  lectures, publish special columns in newspapers and magazines,  and organize lectures by specialized personnel to conduct  elaborate propaganda to enable the masses to understand the  basic contents of reforms. In addition, we should clearly  define the established policies, defuse the masses' misgivings  and misunderstanding, and encourage them to actively and  self-consciously devote themselves to carrying out reform.    Fourth, we should quicken the pace of implementing the  reform  plans. In laying down the general demand of the whole party's  work, central leaders begin with "Seize the Opportunity To  Deepen Reform." Therefore, we must not miss the current good  opportunity for reform. Judging from the developments in the  last few months, the slower reform is carried out, the more  problems are accumulated and the more difficult it becomes to  solve them. Therefore, we must quicken the pace of our work.  On the one hand, general affairs departments and departments in  charge should concentrate their efforts on formulating feasible  relevant measures to support reform and implement these measures  as soon as possible. On the other hand, as clearly stated in  the policy of reform, we should address ourselves to  implementing those measures that are more complete. Problems  common to reforms in various fields may be referred to the next  higher authorities. But, no one is allowed to change  established measures and invent their own.  <H5>  3. Ensure a Good Job in Current Production Work and </H5> Properly Arrange the Masses' Daily Life    This year's economic work was set forth in detail at the  economic work conference early this year and at the current  people's congress meeting, and it is being carried out in all  localities. Here I would like to stress work in five of the  many fields.    The first is agricultural and animal husbandry production.  While strengthening field management, doing work to prevent  natural disasters, and restoring production work in  disaster-stricken areas, we should build capital water projects  in a timely manner for farmlands and grasslands. The second is  that, industrial and transportation enterprises should increase  their vitality through deepening reform, should strive to  improve their profitablity, and should improve their efficiency  by improving management. The third is to properly carry out  construction of key projects. We should ensure that  construction is carried out as scheduled, ensure construction  quality, and ensure that the annual construction plans are  fulfilled. The fourth is to do a good financial and taxation  job. This year's financial budget has been examined by the  people's congress. We should do our work strictly according to  the budget to uphold the budget's solemnness. In principle, no  extra budgets will be granted, barring special situations.  Regarding taxation work, localities experiencing shrinking tax  revenues should seriously look into the causes and take measures  to ensure that their tax revenue plans are fulfilled. [no fifth  point as published]    Here, I would like particularly to mention the problem in  people's livelihood. Generally speaking, we have achieved  positive results in improving the living standards of the people  in the agricultural and pastoral areas of our region. But we  should not be too optimistic about the work of helping people  get rid of poverty and become rich. We should not overestimate  the income standard of peasants and herdsmen. It should be  noted that there are many people who have not yet solved the  problem of having enough food to eat and clothing to wear. With  the introduction of the state's reform policy and price  readjustment in the hinterland, our region is experiencing an  excessive growth in commodity prices. On top of that, some  areas in our region witnessed natural disasters last year. At  present, people in our region have many problems in their  livelihood. In accordance with the investigations conducted by  the regional government in various localities and opinions  expressed at the sessions of the regional people's congress and  the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, all localities are experiencing grain  shortages to some extent. Some households have even run out of  grain. Some workers and staff members of enterprises are also  experiencing hardship in their daily life. These are problems  deserving our great attention. Areas with grain shortages should  take care to transport grain and ensure the supply of the  people's food. Meanwhile, all localities should work hard to  raise funds for helping the poor and relieving disasters. They  should ensure provision of aid to the people in a timely  fashion. Efforts should be made to organize people in Ali [7093  6849] and other areas severely affected by the natural disasters  to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production.  At the same time, we should pay attention to the prevention and  cure of epidemic diseases. People are strongly complaining  about unwarranted price hikes and arbitrary exaction of fees.  Price control is an urgent and heavy responsibility for the  government. Some other problems are likely to occur if we fail  to adopt effective measures. To effectively control the  excessive growth of commodity prices and stabilize the people's  livelihood, it is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic control;  conscientiously improve price and market control by  comprehensively using legal, economic, and administrative means;  carry out the practice of showing the price for each commodity;  resolutely stop the illegal practice of driving up prices; and  strengthen the supervision of prices of people's daily  necessities. In the near future, the Planning Commission will  carry out measures for supervising the prices of 19 basic  necessities including grain, edible oil, and tea as well as  prices in the service industry. This is an effort to control  prices within a limit that most of the people can bear. To  check the excessive growth of prices and combat unfair trade  practices, it is advisable to formulate regulations for  combating price cheating and exorbitant profits. Such  regulations can be formulated by the Price Bureau with the help  of departments in charge of industrial and commercial affairs  and taxation. It is necessary to carry out this year's price  inspection in a thoroughgoing manner. Active efforts should be  made to raise funds and establish a reserve system for important  materials such as grain, tea, and salt so as to strengthen our  ability to control commodity prices. Further efforts should be  made to control the charging of various fees. Last year, 87  kinds of fees were abolished after consolidation. As a result,  the phenomena of arbitrary exaction of fees was under control.  But such phenomena cropped up again in recent months,  particularly in Lhasa city. Therefore, it is necessary to  continue to consolidate administrative fees and business  charges. Resolute efforts should be made to ban any fees that  are unreasonable, without proper authorization, or not within  the proper scope. With the help of the Economic Planning  Commission, the Finance Department should work harder to carry  out this work.  <H5>  4. Pay Close Attention To Making Proper Preparations for </H5> the Construction Projects To Be Carried Out as a Tribute to the  Grand Celebration [of Tibet's 30th Founding Anniversary]    The central authorities are very concerned about Tibet's  economic development and social progress. Earlier, the central  authorities sent special working teams to Tibet to survey and  study projects in a bid to help it map out a long-term  development program. After conducting on-site surveys, they  basically reached a consensus with the autonomous region.  Preparations are in full swing now; the projects reported to  the higher authorities are under consideration; and arrangements  for these projects are being made. These projects requested by  Tibet center on agriculture, animal husbandry, infrastructure,  and social development. They proceed from the interests of the  whole region and take into consideration the need for the  construction and development in the future. A portion of the  preliminary work has been completed already. As regards those  projects whose conditions are ripe for the commencement of  construction, we must pay close attention to ensuring that funds  are channelled to their proper recipients so that construction  may commence at an early date. As regards those projects that  need to be reported to the higher authorities for approval later  on, we must make whatever readjustments are necessary and give  as much priority to important projects as possible on the basis  of the suggestions made by the working teams. If preliminary  work is found to be inadequate, we must make the best use of  time available to make careful calculations, to prepare an  accurate list of materials in detail, and to report them  promptly to higher authorities. As there is only a little more  than a year left before the time for our grand celebration  arrives, we face heavy tasks and are pressed for time. All  prefectures, cities, and departments certainly must organize  competent teams to make proper preparations for commencement of  construction. They must make concerted efforts and closely  coordinate with each other under the unified command of Tibet's  leading group for projects so that construction may commence  immediately after projects are approved and a guaranteed number  of projects may be completed with guranteed construction quality.    Those construction projects which have been included in the  autonomous region's plan and are scheduled for completion around  the time of next year's grand celebration must be treated as the  61 projects which are to be carried out as a tribute to the  grand celebration. They must be placed under unified  management. All quarters must guarantee that their construction  jobs are completed on schedule to pay tribute to Tibet's 30th  founding anniversary.  <H5>  5. Change Work Style and Pay Close Attention to </H5> Implementation    Generally speaking, the work style of organs and leadership  in Tibet is good. However, lax enforcement of discipline,  dilatory work style, low efficiency in handling official  business, shifting responsibility to others, and arguing back  and forth do exist in some departments and units. Some leading  cadres confuse themselves with ordinary citizens. Instead of  positively devising ways to solve problems that have cropped up  in carrying out work, they blame others, grumble, and complain  as if they were bystanders. Some individual departments and  leaders even show out-and-out disregard for orders and bans.  They adopt an attitude of overtly complying with but covertly  opposing the decisions made by party committees and governments.  As a result, some important decisions cannot be implememted  even after stalling for a long time, thus producing undesirable  influences.    This year's tasks on reform, development, and stability are  very heavy. Under such circumstances, leaders at all levels and  all government functionaries must show a strong sense of  devotion and responsibility, and redouble their efforts in a  spirit of seizing every moment. Our power is given by the  people. Our government is called a people's government mainly  because it serves the people in a down-to-earth manner. This is  a fundamental difference from a nonpeople's government. Hence,  we must further change our work style and mental attitude,  mingle with the masses, plunge into the thick of reform, and go  to the frontline of production to study new circumstances, solve  new problems, spread new experiences, and raise various areas of  work to a new level. The authorities of Qamdo, Xigaze, and  Shannan recently sent work groups of various sizes to farming  and pastoral areas to conduct investigations and studies and to  provide work guidance. It is hoped that all autonomous regional  departments and all prefectures and cities will take active  measures to send competent work groups to the grass roots to  implement the guidelines of the "two sessions."    I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate family  planning work. It is our country's long-term basic policy to  practice family planning, control population growth, and improve  the quality of its population. The "Decision on Strengthening  Family Planning Work and Strictly Controlling Population Growth"  promulgated by the party Central Committee and the State Council  noted explicitly: "Family planning should be practiced among  minority nationalities to raise the economic and cultural levels  of minority areas and to improve national quality." The State  Family Planning Commission and the State Nationalities Affairs  Commission last year specifically convened a national conference  on family planning among minority nationalities, and formulated  relevant policies and measures. Our region still experiences  rather rapid population growth. According to the fourth  national census, the national birth rate stood at 21.06 per  thousand, whereas the birth rate of our region was a high 27.6  per thousand. The region's population growth over the past 10  years has averaged 38,000 people each year, resulting in a total  population of 2.318 million people at the end of 1993. Failure  to exercise due control will not only make it difficult to  improve the overall quality of the population and to effectively  improve living standards, but will also only sharpen the  contradiction between population and economic development,  resource utilization, and environmental protection. Therefore,  an urgent task confronting us is to carry out family planning  work and allow the population to grow in a planned way. We must  now focus on three tasks. 1) we should improve our  understanding and unify our thinking. The regional party  committee and government take family planning work seriously.  They have incorporated birth control into the overall plan for  regional economic and social development, and laid down the  guiding thought for family planning, which states clearly: We  should regard family planning as a fundamental plan for  developing the economy and improving national quality. Keeping  in mind the need to facilitate economic construction, the fight  against poverty to promote prosperity, the improvement of living  standards, and gradual national economic growth, we should  devote great efforts to improving the quality of the population  so that Tibet's population will grow in coordination with the  development of various economic and social services. Leaders at  all levels should seriously study documents and regulations  regarding family planning, gain a profound understanding of the  guidelines of those documents and regulations, enhance their  understanding, and improve family planning work along with  economic construction. 2) We should stabilize the family  planning policies currently in force. The family planning  policies which our region currently implement were formulated  according to popular wishes and the practical experiences of  many years. We should seriously study, master, and correctly  implement those policies. In farming and pastoral areas, we  should firmly follow the principle of "stressing five main  aspects," without loosening or tightening it at will. Moreover,  we should gain a timely understanding and grasp of new  circumstances and sum them up, with the aim of improving our  region's family planning policies. 3) We should strive to  provide good services. Aside from vigorously publicizing  policies and information about family planning and maternity and  child care, family planning, medical, and health care  departments should improve the training of relevant personnel,  raise technological levels, provide all kinds of good services,  and fulfill people's needs.    Comrades: This year is crucial to our region's efforts to  speed up the pace of establishing a socialist market economic  structure, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world,  and quicken the pace of development. The new situation has set  even stricter demands for various tasks. We must live up to the  high expectations of the party and people, implement the  guidelines of the "two sessions" in a motivational spirit with a  rigorous approach and through solid work, and usher in the 30th  anniversary of the autonomous region's founding with remarkable  achievements.</p>

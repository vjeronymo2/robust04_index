			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y's US arm agrees Dollars 1bn debt restructuring The US arm of property group Olympia &amp; York said it had reached agreement in principle to restructure nearly Dollars 1bn of its debt, in the first leg of a planned overhaul of total debts of Dollars 5bn. Under the deal, O&amp;Y (USA) will sell one building but retain its equity interest in two others. Since the collapse of its Canadian parent in 1992, the US company has been fighting to stay out of bankruptcy court while retaining control of its 11 New York office properties, among them the prestigious World Financial Centre. Under the agreement announced yesterday, O&amp;Y (USA) said it would sell a mainly vacant building on Broadway and use the cash to renovate and maintain two others, on Park Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The company will also pay only a proportion of the interest on newly-issued bonds, and forego its own right to cash interest payments. By strengthening the cashflow on the remaining two buildings, these arrangements should benefit holders of the Dollars 970m of debt subject to the restructuring. These include Apollo Real Estate Advisers, an investment fund run by Mr Leon Black, a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert. He has been a steady buyer of bank debt in other O&amp;Y (USA) properties this year, leaving him in a strong position in any restructuring of those buildings. O&amp;Y (USA) said the agreement had been reached with holders of more than 60 per cent of the Dollars 970m of floating-rate notes secured on the buildings, among them Apollo. The deal is still subject to approval by other noteholders and investors with a minority equity interest in the buildings, among others. Under the plan, the noteholders would exchange their floating-rate notes for six-year, fixed-rate bonds.</p>

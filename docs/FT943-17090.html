			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Venture with Russia allays ministry fears India and Russia have agreed to launch a Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) joint venture company to service and manufacture spares for military aircraft of Russian origin. The deal was signed by Mr Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, writes Shiraz Sidhva. The deal, one of two signed during Mr Rao's four-day visit to Russia, allayed fears in the Indian defence ministry that the substantial Russian-made component of the Indian Air Force fleet would be redundant if Russia refused spares to India. Russia also agreed that India should have access until September this year to an Dollars 830m credit negotiated with the former Soviet Union for the purchase of defence items and spares. A large part of the credit, which has been frozen since early 1992, is still unused. The proposed joint venture company will be based in India.</p>

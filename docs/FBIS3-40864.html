KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service-- 15 Dey [5  January] The deputy minister of guidance for parliamentary  affairs gave an interview to KEYHAN's correspondent in which he  discussed the provision of the death penalty for producers of  immoral films. He said: Only those who are the main agents in  the production, reproduction or distribution of films showing  nude women and men or sexual relations and who have been  arrested three times for this crime will be called corrupt on  the earth and condemned to death.    'Ezzatollah Zarghami, deputy minister of guidance for  parliamentary affairs, discussed the conditions for issuing a  death sentence for these kinds of criminals. He added: The Law  Increasing Penalties for Producers, Distributors, and  Reproducers of Unauthorized Videotapes and Images, recently  passed by the Majles, states clearly that the death penalty  applies those who knowingly do this, using the resources of  international networks and with the goal of society's moral  deviation.    In this regard he explained: In our view people like this  are  no different than narcotics smugglers and those take armed  action to destroy the government of the Islamic Republic.    In answer to the negative propaganda by some media from  Western nations concerning the law increasing penalties for  those involved in the production, reproduction, and distribution  of vulgar films, he said: As long as the Western nations trample  the primary principles of freedom and democracy and will not  even tolerate the presence of four veiled girls in their  schools, they are in no position to dictate the observance of  human rights to other societies.    According to the deputy minister of guidance for  parliamentary affairs, based on the law approved by the Majles,  individuals who use children for the storage, sale and  reproduction of tapes of immoral films will also be subject to  the prescribed penalties.    Likewise, secondary agents involved in the distribution of  tapes of this kind will be sentenced under the law to cash fines  and prison terms.    Zarghami was asked: "In the end, are video tapes authorized  or not?" In answer he emphasized the need for planning for  proper use of videos and added: At the same time, because of the  sensitivity of the matter, there must be controls in place to  prevent abuses in this area.    He discussed the decision by the Ministry of Guidance to  authorize the establishment of "Video Societies" in the cities.  Concerning the requirements for obtaining this authorization, he  said: Great care is being exercised in the selection of  qualified individuals among the applicants to establish video  centers. In this regard priority goes to reputable revolutionary  individuals who are basijis, veterans and members of families of  martyrs. According to Zarghami, video tapes have already been  produced and made ready for distribution of 100 films of various  kinds.</p>

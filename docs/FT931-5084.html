			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Observer: Time check Race against the clock. That is the message of new statistics for hurried drivers using London's notorious M25 motorway. The Automobile Association says that of the 403 serious delays on the orbital road last year, the majority were on the clockwise carriageway. Mind you, the benefit of travelling in the other direction is scarcely compelling. The clockwise ring had 206 hold-ups, one for every 1,017 yards of its 119 miles. The opposite carriageway had 197, one for every 1,063 yards or, in terms of delay-free distance, an extra 139ft 4in.</p>

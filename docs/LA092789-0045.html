			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A 74-year-old woman who bought 32 of the $1,000 lifetime partnerships at PTL  said at Jim Bakker's fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C., that she would gladly give  the money to the ministry again. "I was given the greatest thrill I ever had by  giving that money," Marjorie Grey of Richlands said after testifying. Grey said  that she also made a $12,000 down payment on a condominium that was never built  at PTL's Heritage USA retreat and theme park. Each partnership generally  entitled a person to three nights and four days lodging at Heritage USA.  Prosecutors contend the partnerships greatly outnumbered the rooms available.  </P></p>

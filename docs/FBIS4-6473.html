			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party in a statement  April 19 called upon all the political parties, organisations  and public figures in South Korea to make singlehearted efforts  for the convocation of a national conference in order to arrange  a new occasion of national unity and open a favourable phase for  peaceful reunification.    He said that the proposal for convening a national  conference  which was made by a joint meeting of the government, political  parties and public organisations of the DPRK on April 11  represents the desire of the entire fellow countrymen for the  reunification of the country.    The conference will be a very significant meeting which  makes  it possible for the entire fellow countrymen in the North, the  South and overseas to promote the great national unity and open  a new phase of reunification by pooling their efforts and  wisdom, irrespective of differences in ideology and idea,  political view and religious belief, he said, and continued:    Those who do not want our nation to fall victims to big  powers and who hope it will defend its dignity and live a happy  life together in a reunified country must take the road of  national unity, irrespective of their residence and occupation,  and prove their patriotic will by unhesitatingly rushing out to  the plaza of the national conference which will unfold a new  chapter of reconciliation and unity.    We cannot tolerate the anti-national crimes of the South  Korean authorities who dislike to shake hands with the fellow  countrymen for national reconciliation and unity and are  hatching up a plot to unleash a reckless nuclear war at the  sacrifice of the interests of the nation in conspiracy with the  outside forces.    The South Korean authorities must stop betraying the  expectation of the whole nation for the convocation of the  national conference and refrain from obstructing the  participation of political parties, organisations and individual  public figures of South Korea in a nationwide dialogue.    All the members of the Chondoist Chongu Party and Chondoists  in the northern half of Korea will make every possible effort to  hold the national conference to accelerate the reunification in  the 90s by achieving the great unity of the nation in the  intrinsic idea of Chondoism intended to promote welfare of the  country and the nation, declared the spokesman.</p>

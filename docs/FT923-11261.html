			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Who gets what from the great carve-up - How sponsorship has changed dramatically the way the modern Games are funded TODAY, the world will switch on its television sets to watch the start of the biggest marketing event ever. By and large, viewers will be unaware of the commercial overtones of the Olympics. What they want to see are sporting glories. But they will be part of a commercial event that has generated Dollars 1.9bn worth of international sponsorship and television licencing deals involving just one important brand logo: the five interlocked rings of the Olympic Games. The NBC television network alone has paid Dollars 401m for exclusive rights to broadcast the Games in the US. Some members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are sensitive to criticism that the Games are being undermined by sponsorship deals, drug abuse, and the professional status of many athletes. But those criticisms ignore history, according to Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director. He says the modern-day role played by big business in the Olympics is not new and points out: 'There has always been commercial involvement, at times far more excessive than now. There used to be in-stadium advertising in 1928 (now forbidden by the IOC). In Montreal (the 1976 summer Olympics), there were 620 sponsors and suppliers. The Olympic rings were on everything, including such inappropriate products as ladies' underwear and bananas, with no control.' What has happened since the financially disastrous Montreal Games is that the IOC has come gradually to see the commercial value of the Olympics. It has sold sponsorship and broadcasting rights in order to make profits to plough back into international sport - and into itself. The first thorough-going attempt to make money from the Games for the IOC and its affiliated national members came with the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. In Seoul, though, the IOC was only beginning to discover the extent to which multinational companies were prepared to pay fortunes simply for the right to use the five-ringed logo. Thus, Barcelona 1992 is held to be the first really determined example of a highly-organised and centrally-planned commercial exploitation of the Olympics. The central sponsorship deal for this year's winter and summer Games is called The Olympic Programme, or TOP. Each TOP programme runs for four years. In the present one, now ending, the IOC has attracted Dollars 175m (part of the Dollars 1.9bn overall figure) from the 12 TOP sponsors. They are Visa International, Coca-Cola, Mars, 3m, Time and its sister publication Sports Illustrated, Bausch and Lomb, Ricoh, Matsushita, Brother, Eastman Kodak, the US Postal Service, and Philips International. Their contracts with the IOC forbid them revealing how much they paid individually but Payne says the individual entry fee for the next TOP programme - which will cover the Lillehammer winter Games next year and the Atlanta summer Games in 1996 - is Dollars 40m. The European TV rights for Atlanta have just been sold to the European Broadcast Union for Dollars 250m, against Dollars 90m for Barcelona. Visa, the present lead sponsor, is thought to have paid about Dollars 20m and the others about Dollars 14m each, either in cash or services and back-up technology. Like all other TOP sponsors, Bausch and Lomb is using its Olympic connections for other marketing purposes. It calculates that its TOP contribution is 'probably doubled or near tripled' when other planned promotional programmes, which are given an Olympic twist this year, are taken into account. Even those not sponsoring the Games directly through TOP regard the event as a crucial TV advertising vehicle. According to the US trade magazine Adweek, General Motors has bought Dollars 40m worth of television advertising time in the US over the next fortnight, effectively blocking out some of its main competitors. Adweek calculated that Honda and Isuzu were each buying Dollars 10m worth of prime-time TV minutes, with BMW and Volkswagen spending Dollars 4m each. Sponsorship ensures that the Barcelona Games are unlikely to make a loss. Perhaps the only sensitive topic left is the slicing-up of the cake. Of the Dollars 1.9bn for the present TOP period, 75 per cent goes to the local organising committees in Albertville and Barcelona, as well as to the IOC itself. The remainder goes to the national organising committees. Of the 170-odd countries competing in Barcelona, 40 will take the lion's share since they are deemed to have the largest markets. The Olympic committees of the smaller nations - arguably, those with the greatest need for cash - will get about Dollars 15,000 plus Dollars 400 per athlete sent to Barcelona.</p>

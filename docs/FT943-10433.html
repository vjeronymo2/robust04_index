			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Italian elder statesman dies Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican politician and intellectual who was a leading figure in post-war Italy, died in Rome yesterday aged 69. He was a contemporary historian, newspaper editor and latterly bon vivant elder statesman. His body was brought to lie in state in the Senate, where he was a life senator and speaker from 1987 until this year. Mr Spadolini, the first prime minister from outside the Christian Democrat party under the post-war republic, was appointed in 1981 to head a five-party coalition when Italy's political establishment had been shaken by the scandal of the P2 secret masonic lodge, a parallel power structure. His strong personality held the coalition together for 405 days before being reshuffled. It then lasted another 82 days. Three times a minister in different governments, he latterly played an important role as speaker of the Senate, enlivening debate with his erudition and crusty humour. He challenged the new Berlusconi government to retain the speaker's post and lost by a single vote. Mr Spadolini was born in Florence and began his public life teaching history. He switched to journalism, eventually becoming editor of the prestigious Corriere della Sera, and entered politics comparatively late, in 1972, on being elected as an independent senator in the Republican lists. He took on the leadership of the Republican party in 1979 on the death of Mr Ugo La Malfa and held the post for eight years.</p>

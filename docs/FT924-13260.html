			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: French confirm ban on current account interest MICHEL SAPIN, the French finance minister, yesterday confirmed his decision to forbid the use of interest-paying cheque accounts in France. 'At present we have a balanced situation whereby account-holders do not receive interest on their balances, but do not have to pay for their current accounts,' said Mr Sapin. 'I am absolutely committed to ensuring that everyone continues to have the right to a free bank account.' The question of whether banks in France should be allowed to break with tradition by paying interest on current accounts has long been a source of controversy. The banking establishment, led by the Association Francaise des Banques, has lobbied strongly against such a change. The issue came to a head earlier this week when Mr Sapin amended French banking regulations to ban an interest-paying account introduced late last month by the French subsidiary of Barclays Bank, the UK banking group. Similar accounts were available in France before the Barclays launch, including products from the Assurances Generales de France and Victoire insurance groups. But the Barclays account, which was heavily promoted, was seen by the authorities as a direct threat to the status quo. Barclays has said it will find a legal way around the new regulations. The rumpus over its account comes shortly after a similar controversy when the French post office was forced to withdraw a new interest-paying cheque account. The tradition of 'free' current accounts stems from close links between the government and France's big banks, which have historically been state-controlled. However, it is also in the interest of France's big banks to maintain the status quo, because it is more difficult for newcomers to break into the market if they cannot offer interest on accounts. French banking margins are under pressure because of the competitive state of the domestic market and the impact of economic slowdown.</p>

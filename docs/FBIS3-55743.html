Following recent unlawful actions in  respect of the Black Sea Fleet naval engineering service  departments in Odessa and Nikolayev, another action has been  staged, aimed at having the Izmail region's personnel swear  allegiance to Ukraine."    The press center of the Black Sea Fleet affirms that the  fleet's group of units deployed in Izmail has virtually found  itself under economic blockade. To normalize the situation and  prevent further negative developments, the Black Sea Fleet  Command has called for wisdom on the part of the Ukrainian Navy  Command and voiced the opinion that it is necessary to wait  until the Black Sea Fleet issues are settled by the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents in a civilized manner. The Black Sea Fleet  leadership has sent relevant documents on the situation in  Izmail to the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries.</p>

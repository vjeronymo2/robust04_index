			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Refugees and wasted revenues - Western countries are unable to disentangle policy towards asylum seekers and immigrants Immigration and asylum policy should, in theory, be quite distinct. The former is an economic and social issue, the latter a humanitarian one. But in practice they have got inseparably intertwined, because a liberal or humane asylum policy is bound to be seen as a loophole in a restrictive immigration policy. The two can only be maintained side by side if there is a fair and fast method of distinguishing between voluntary and forced migrants; and no such method has yet been found. Fast methods are bound to be arbitrary, as snap judgments have to be made about situations which may be very complex, by people who may not be familiar with the language or political background of those whose good faith they have to assess. Fair methods are likely to be slow, and that means either detaining asylum applicants for long periods or letting them into the country provisionally, after which they live for months or years with the threat of deportation hanging over them. In practice European countries deport very few asylum applicants once they are in the country, but many are left in limbo. The unstated policy seems to be to use the difficulties and indignities of the application process as a deterrent. All this is very expensive. Industrialised countries spend, according to Ms Barbara Harrell Bond, director of Oxford University's Refugee Studies Programme, an estimated Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn a year on processing asylum seekers. She compares this to the funds available to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its work around the world, currently less than Dollars 1bn. That makes it sound as if it would be more cost-effective for industrialised countries to slash their expenditure on asylum seekers and give the money saved to UNHCR. Unfortunately, however, this is not a real alternative. Clearly there is no chance of eliminating asylum procedures altogether. This could be done only by deciding either to refuse everybody or to admit everybody. Refusing everybody would be contrary to international law, inhumane and politically unacceptable. Admitting everybody would mean abandoning any attempt to control immigration. This might just possibly be good economics, but is no longer remotely feasible politics in any country, even Australia or the US. Thus giving more money to UNHCR, however desirable in itself, would certainly not remove the need for asylum procedures. Nor would it be at all likely to produce a pro rata reduction in the number of asylum applications to industrialised countries. As Ms Harrell Bond herself points out, those who seek asylum in the industrialised world, although a rapidly growing number, are less than 5 per cent of all forcibly uprooted people. All the rest remain in the south. Nor is there any simple correlation between the cost of processing asylum applications and the number of bona fide applications received. Much of the money spent is a function not of the actual number of applications, but of the number of spurious applications to be feared if the machinery for weeding them out were not in place. In other words, the ostensible cost of an asylum policy is, in reality, part of the cost of an immigration policy. It is perhaps unfair to take Ms Harrell Bond to task in this way, because her remarks were only a preamble to a very interesting argument about what should be done to tackle the worldwide refugee problem, and she certainly does not regard it as a simple matter of giving much more money to UNHCR. Her views were set out in a paper submitted to the UK-Japan 2000 Group, which held its annual conference last weekend. The group exists to promote Anglo-Japanese understanding and co-operation, and this year it devoted a session to international migration. I had assumed that the discussion would focus on the British experience of immigration, the problems now raised by population movements in Europe, and the extent to which Japan faced or might face similar problems. So it was rather a surprise, though by no means an unpleasant one, to find that the main paper submitted from the British side was the one by Ms Harrell Bond entitled 'Refugees and the reformulation of international aid policies: what can Britain and Japan do?'. The next surprise was to find that the main targets of her attack were not western governments, nor yet international business, but UNHCR itself and the 'non-governmental organisations' (NGOs) - western charities working in the third world - which in such discussions are usually cast as the good guys. Ms Harrell Bond's thesis resembles the criticism which Israel has long made of Arab states for their handling of the Palestinian refugee problem, and also the critique that Thatcherism made of the welfare state in Britain. What she says in substance is that current policies tend to perpetuate problems by imposing a dependency culture on refugees, forcing them to live in camps and rely on distribution of emergency food supplies, instead of encouraging them to use their skills to become self-supporting, and in the process make a contribution to the economy of the host country. Her examples of success stories are Cyprus, where 'focusing on the need for housing and placing an emphasis upon labour-intensive policies, the government met the humanitarian needs of the refugees and used the situation as a catalyst for the reconstruction of its economy'; and Nepal, where Tibetan refugees were allowed to use their carpet-making skills, and were paid a wage rather than receiving food aid, with the result that '30 years on, having created employment for thousands of others, carpet making is the largest manufacturing industry in Nepal with foreign currency earnings of Dollars 50m annually'. These examples are contrasted with the 'normal' approach, in which host governments create special offices to deal with the needs of refugees. 'The maintenance of these offices depends on the continued existence of visible concentrations of people who attract funds earmarked for refugees. The result has been the perpetuation of a population labelled refugees, left living in limbo, sometimes behind barbed wire, and dependent for their survival on relief. Such bureaucratic interests were demonstrated on the day the Afghanistan peace accord was signed; several hundred Pakistani government employees petitioned their parliament, demanding to know what would happen to their employment if the refugees went home.' Ms Harrell Bond proposes that in future governments adopt a 'development' rather than a 'relief' approach. Apart from the vested interests of NGOs and local bureaucrats, and the ingrained habits of UNHCR, this argument will often run into the objection that it is politically defeatist, since it assumes the refugees have to be semi-permanently integrated into the host country's economy, whereas their own most ardent wish is usually to be able to return in safety to their original homes. But all too many examples show that keeping refugees in camps is no guarantee that their political problem will be solved; and on the whole they are less resented when they mingle with the rest of the population, paying their own way, than when they are kept as a separate, embittered community with nothing to occupy them but guerrilla training and irredentist politics. The Cyprus/Nepal approach may not be a universal panacea, but it could be tried in many more places than it has been.</p>

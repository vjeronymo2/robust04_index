			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPANISH LESSONS  </P> <P> My colleague Bill Stern penned an article a decade or more ago maintaining  flatly that there were no Italian restaurants in America. His point was that,  though there were certainly plenty of places that called themselves Italian,  and though some of these restaurants might well serve very good food, not one  of them genuinely resembled the restaurants he had come to know and love in  Italy. Today, there are plenty of authentic Italian restaurants in America; we  have come a long way in that regard. But Stern's old point might very well be  adapted today to restaurants purporting to serve the food of Spain.  </P> <P> California has a particular problem in defining its Spanish restaurants --  because Californians have historically considered Spanish and Mexican cooking  to be more or less identical. Consider this rather confusing passage from Craig  Davidson's "Dining Out in Hollywood and Los Angeles," published in 1949:  "Californians love their hot Spanish-Mexican food," wrote Davidson, "and it is  possible to get into innumerable arguments with Angelenos over . . . which is  the best Spanish restaurant in town. El Cholo is vigorously presented as one of  the tops in Spanish dishes. . ."  </P> <P> One of the first restaurants in Los Angeles -- if not the first -- to serve an  approximation of real Spanish food was the Matador, on Pico Boulevard in West  L.A., which opened in 1958. In that establishment's early days, recalls its  proprietor, William Fremont, "at least 25% of (the) patrons . . . came to the  restaurant, munched on the complimentary tapas that were on the table and . . .  ate up all the crispy bread with butter. Then, reading the menu in disbelief,  they called me over and asked in an angry voice how I dared call this a Spanish  menu -- where were the tacos, the enchiladas, etc.? The customers (then)  stormed out of the restaurant. Leaving their car on our lot, they walked across  the street to have dinner at the Cafe Escobar, which proudly displayed a 20x6  sign on the roof: 'Fine Spanish Cuisine'. "  </P> <P> The truth is that, despite certain obvious exchanges of influence and of raw  materials, Mexican and Spanish cooking today  </P> <P> resemble each other about as much as the cooking of Lyon resembles that of New  Orleans -- which is to say not very much at all. Even the terminology has  different meanings: A tortilla is an omelete in Spain, for instance. A tostada  is a piece of toast. A taco is (among other things) a billiard cue.  </P> <P> Integrating elements of Roman, Moorish, Germanic, Italian and French cooking  styles, Spain has developed a veritable panoply of regional cooking idioms,  ranging from agreeable peasant dishes to truly sophisticated cuisines.  </P> <P> At a good, medium-range restaurant in Spain today, for instance, the diner  might encounter such things as mountain ham as good as Italy's best prosciutto;  raw sea urchins or goose barnacles just out of the water; simply grilled giant  prawns (gambas) moistened with olive oil; sweet little red piquillo peppers  stuffed with mousse of hake or salt cod; fresh brood eels or angulas, sizzling  in olive oil; rabbit or quail braised with chestnuts; snails stewed with ham,  potatoes, red wine and a whole handful of fresh herbs; grilled goat chops with  sherry vinegar and mint; hearty ragouts of beans and sausage and the  pot-au-feu-like boiled dinners; a whole treasury of great rice dishes, from the  arroz brut or "dirty rice" of Marjorca to the real country paella of the  Valencia region; and above all fish, fish, fish -- superbly fresh, deep-fried,  grilled, roasted, baked in a crust of salt . . .  </P> <P> Where are such dishes in the Spanish restaurants of the U.S. today? In very  short supply, that's where. And I haven't even mentioned the more  sophisticated, contemporary fare available in Spain's best restaurants -- for  instance baby sole with minced green beans and baby shrimp at Eldorado Petit in  Barcelona; lamb chops stuffed with sweetbreads and fresh thyme at Arzak in San  Sebastian; sea bass tartar and pigs' feet stuffed with ground lamb at Zalacain  in Madrid (which recently became the first Michelin three-star restaurant in  Spain).  </P> <P> While diners in Spain itself sit down to food like this, must we continue to  make do, in our own Spanish restaurants, with the chunky tomato juice that goes  by the name of gazpacho hereabouts, with roasted peppers and San Jose-made  sausage, with paella made with the wrong kind of rice? Well, yes. Apparently.  For now. Spanish cooking in Los Angeles -- in the United States in general --  awaits its Rex, its Valentino, even its Pane Caldo or its Prego. . .  </P></p>

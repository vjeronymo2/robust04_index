			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Pentland Group David Bernstein is leaving Pentland Group, the consumer goods company, after seven years as one of the acquisitive company's leading strategists. Bernstein, 50, is quitting his post of executive director with responsibility for group development, to 'pursue other interests', according to Pentland. Stephen Rubin, Pentland's chairman, says Bernstein had been responsible for finding and investigating acquisition opportunities. 'We are sorry that David Bernstein has decided to move on. During his seven years with Pentland, he has made a significant contribution to the group's progress and we wish him well in his future career,' Rubin said. Bernstein would receive a pay-off which is not expected to be more than 18 months' salary. Pentland is taking the opportunity of Bernstein's retirement to reshape the board; and has appointed two executive directors. Andy Rubin, 30, the chairman's son and head of group marketing services, will take up his post from January 1. His appointment reflects the increasing importance of marketing to the brand-led group, Rubin Snr says. Andy Rubin was not on a contract, nor would he receive share options because of the Rubin family interests in the company. Pentland also announced the appointment of John Charlton, 48, as executive director with responsibility for the company's hard goods division. This includes china interests in the US.</p>

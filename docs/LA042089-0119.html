			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOURMET FOOD FAIR, AUCTION SET FOR VENICE ART WALK '89  </P> <P> When it started 10 years ago, the Venice Art Walk was just another fund-raiser.  Participants paid for self-guided and docent tours of local artists' galleries  and studios, and the proceeds benefited the nonprofit Venice Family Clinic.  </P> <P> Last year, the one-day event netted $575,000 for the volunteer health facility.  </P> <P> Art folks, clinic folks and lots and lots of press folks went to DC3, the hip  new restaurant at the Santa Monica Airport, on Tuesday afternoon to learn more  about the upcoming walk and to meet the people involved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Even Bigger'  </P> <P> This year's Art Walk, scheduled for May 21, is expected to be "even bigger,  providing 40% of our annual operating budget," said Fern Seizer, executive  director of the clinic, as small planes buzzed by in the background.  </P> <P> The 1989 Art Walk also will feature a gourmet food fair with chow provided from  tony Westside restaurants such as Rebecca's, West Beach Cafe and 72 Market  Street. For $90, guests can be taken on special docent tours with in-depth  visits at the studios of artists Peter Alexander, Ed Moses, Tony Berlant, Eric  Orr, Erika Rothenberg and Robbie Conal.  </P> <P> For the truly well-heeled, clinic president Irma Colen waxed rhapsodic about  the more than 300 works that will be available in a silent auction. The auction  alone netted more than $250,000 last year. It's a particularly attractive  option for artists who were used to contributing works for free. They will get  to keep half of the proceeds from the sale of their work.  </P> <P> "It's a smart move," said art man-about-town Charlie Scheips, who helped to  organize the recent Art Against AIDS auction at the Murray Feldman Gallery.  "Giving the artists half the money makes sure that they donate their best  work."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lure of Hors D'Oeuvres  </P> <P> For the kick-off party, the lure of free hors d'oeuvres at the trendy eatery  brought out hundreds of artists and press people, who kept up a steady stream  of chatter even as Art Walk chairwoman Sheila Goldberg tried to explain the ins  and outs of the walk to the crowd. She showed off the '89 T-shirt, designed by  artist Laddie John Dill, and the commemorative poster designed by Richard  Diebenkorn, whose show is at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Dill was at  the party wearing his T-shirt creation, but Diebenkorn was said to be ill at  his Northern California home.  </P> <P> The Art Walk will conclude with a dinner honoring Karen and Michael Gould at a  hangar at the Santa Monica Airport. She sits on the board of directors for the  clinic; he's president of Giorgio Beverly Hills. Dr. Joseph Hittelman will  receive an award for his volunteer service to the clinic's patients.  </P> <P> When the sun began to go down in the overcast sky over the beach and the  waiters stopped coming around with trays of appetizers, guests and press began  filtering out to get their own dinners.  </P> <P> Sheila Goldberg was tired, but she had one last word when asked what the clinic  was planning for the 1990 Art Walk. "It's going to be a two-day event," she  said, beaming, adding quickly, "don't tell the artists I said that."  </P> <P> For information about the 1989 Venice Art Walk, call (213) 392-WALK.  </P></p>

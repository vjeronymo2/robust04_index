			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Castries, St. Lucia, 18 Jan, CANA -- The St Lucia  Banana Growers Association (SLBGA) is to be placed in  receivership, Agriculture Minister Ira D'Auvergne announced.    The move was recommended by a government appointed  committee,  whose mandate was to come up with a new administrative structure  for the island's financially-strapped banana industry.    In a radio and television address, D'Auvergne said the SLBGA  was bankrupt with current debts of 42 million dollars (one EC  dollar ; 37 cents US), up from the 30 million dollars reported  at the height of a strike by farmers last October.    The farmers were pushing for increased prices for their  fruit  at a time when the industry was hit by a falling market prices  and decreasing exchange value of the British pound sterling, the  hard currency earned from exports.    Since the strike, in which police shot and killed two  protestors, the SLBGA has been spending nearly one million  dollars weekly to pacify grumbling farmers through a programme  of price support.    D'Auvergne said in addition, the SLBGA now owed 56 million  dollars to the local company which supplies cartons for the  export of bananas and another 8.6 million dollars to input  suppliers.    The SLBGA also owes the National Commercial Bank (NCB) 10  million dollars in loans and overdraft, 6.4 million dollars to  Geest industries, the marketing company, three million dollars  in gratuities due to staff, and three million in cess credits  due to farmers.    Said D'Auvergne of the association's accumulated debt: "This  figure continues to grow every week and it has become obvious  that this situation cannot be allowed to continue."    The SLBGA announced Tuesday that price support payments to  farmers during last week amounted to 921,996 dollars or nearly  18 cents per pound of bananas sold.    D'Auvergne said the government-appointed committee had  recommended that a receiver be appointed to manage the SLBGA for  a stated period during which certain forms of reorganisation of  the association will be examined to determine which was to be  adopted for ensuing the future viability and stability of the  industry.    He said banana growers here were being paid 31, 28 and 26  cents per pound for grades a, b and c fruit respectively which  was higher than the 24.3 and 20.3 cents per pound for grades a  and b fruit being paid to their counterparts in St Vincent and  the Grenadines and the 25 cents per pound growers in Dominica  were receiving.    Government ministers plan to meet banana farmers Wednesday  to  discuss the state of the industry and plans to restructure it.  That meeting will take place in the eastern village of Dennery,  hotbed of the protest last October.</p>

The United States, booted out of a dirt-poor  Third World country as a neocolonial oppressor, would never  again meddle in Indochina -- an outcome that was to dull the  sweetness of victory into the blandness of irony in the course  of time. Vietnam's seasoned soldiers found it hard to  consecrate their glory in peace, and for more than a decade  after the fall of Saigon in 1975, they strove to rule the  regional roost, standing up to all outside pretenders. The  exertions of military power, even after the roost was reached,  could not still the groans of empty stomachs, however. The doi  moi [renovation] reforms were instituted in 1986, and soon  after, the irony of victory was made plain. Vietnam's economic  horizons were clouded by the sore indifference of the world's  biggest economic power.    Until today the injured pride of American patriotism is  still  refusing to heal, and upon turning its back on Indochina,  America found it hard to forgive and forget. Thus, the  sourpuss' fault-finding denial of diplomatic and economic good  sense -- since the end of Cold War rivalry, U.S. policy over  Vietnam, and by extension, the whole of Indochina, has been held  to ransom by a handful of MIA refuseniks. How the MIA issue,  the agitprop made out of 2,238 missing in-action servicemen  still unaccounted for, can still sear the national conscience,  is due to the recrudescence of Yankee pride marked by the Reagan  presidency after years of liberal protest and self-doubt.    Only the right-wing America Firsters can carry the  compulsion  to get even as belatedly as this and assign Ann Mills Griffiths,  executive director of the National League of Families (of MIA's)  a central role in the highest inter-agency policy planning  level. "Because of her, U.S. policy towards Vietnam was  determined by the narrow -- albeit deserving -- concerns of the  MIA families," according to a pro-normalisation advocate in  Washington. The Clinton Administration, in spite of its eye on  the domestic implications of foreign policy, has kept a safe  distance from the emotive pull of the bereaved families. To the  president's credit, he has attempted a rational tack, one  directed at a constituency governed by the hard facts of  economic realism. The announcement of the lifting of the  30-year-old trade embargo was excitedly welcomed by U.S.  businessmen in Hanoi yesterday.    In spite of Clinton's cleverness at political dissimulation  -- he said the embargo's withdrawal was intended to get the  "fullest possible accounting" of the MIAs and denied its  practical merits -- the move is a first step towards long  overdue normalisation. Part of this procrastination has been  due to Clinton himself: a good-guy president who is much too  vulnerable to angry placard-waving. No matter how it has been  packaged and disguised, the president's hard-headed practicality  in the Vietnam issue is a change from his usual weak-stomached  dallying over foreign policy. Vietnam, of course, has it all to  gain. No one is going overboard in expectations of a flood, but  at least the door has been flung wide open. Even with the  embargo in place, although somewhat relaxed, Vietnam obtained  7.5 percent economic growth in 1993. Without its biggest single  constraint, that economy could well grow by more than 10 percent  this year. [passage omitted]</p>

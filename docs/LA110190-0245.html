			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 4 HOMELESS SUE N.Y. FOR TOILETS  </P> <P> Four homeless people have filed a class-action suit against the city seeking  clean and safe public toilets.  </P> <P> The suit filed Wednesday against the city and two transit agencies contends  that the failure to provide toilets constitutes a public nuisance.  </P> <P> It says the plaintiffs, three men and a woman, are "forced to endure continual  embarrassment, humiliation, physical injury and hazardous conditions."  </P> <P> The Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which represents the plaintiffs, said  the lack of public toilets in the city is a hardship not only for the homeless  but also for pregnant women, the elderly, tourists and outdoor workers.  </P> <P> A report by the center said that of 105 Transit Authority restrooms surveyed,  fewer than one-third were open to the public, and half of those were in bad  condition.  </P></p>

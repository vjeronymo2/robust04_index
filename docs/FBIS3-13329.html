			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi has expressed the hope that Pakistan will  now return to bilateral talks with India on the Kashmir issue  following its setback in Geneva. The minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, told a press conference  in New Delhi today that India had a clear margin to defeat  Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir if it had been put to vote.  Mr. Khurshid, who returned from Geneva last night, said that  there was overwhelming opinion that the bilateral issue should  not be raised at Human Rights Commission forum. He denied  entering into any tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable  withdrawal of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. Mr. Khurshid  also ruled out any fact-finding commission of the Islamic  conference Organization to Kashmir. He, however, disclosed that  India has invited the permanent representatives of the ICO at  Geneva to visit New Delhi for discussions.</p>

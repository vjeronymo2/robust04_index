			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry spokesman has been authorized  to respond to the statement made on BBC radio on 27 June by a  member of the Australian Parliament consultative delegation that  will soon visit Vietnam, in which it was said that the main  purpose of the visit would be to examine the human rights issue.    Vietnam agreed to receive the Australian Parliament  consultative delegation in the name of developing bilateral  relations between the two countries on the basis of equality,  respect for each other's sovereignty, and mutually beneficial  cooperation. The purpose of the visit is to exchange views on  issues of mutual concern, particularly measures to promote  cooperation. Following several meetings, both sides clearly  understood this. Any activities that are not in line with this  agreement or that intervene in Vietnam's internal affairs would  be inappropriate. They could undermine the visit and harm the  cooperative relations between the two countries, which have been  developing favorably.</p>

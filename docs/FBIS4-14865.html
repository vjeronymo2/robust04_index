			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Balyakin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Russian nucear power plants  have no money to buy fuel and carry out maintenance work  although they are highly profitable, TASS was told on Tuesday by  Vladimir Kashkin, chairman of the strike committee which  organised a protest action at the Russian Government building on  Tuesday. "If the problem is not solved the nuclear power plants  will simply shut down", he warned. Three-month delays in wage  payments are also a reason of the protest, although not the  major one, according to Kashkin.    "Our objective is to be heard by the government. A special  meeting is necessary on problems of nuclear and fuel  production", said Kashkin who is also deputy chairman of the  trade union of nuclear industry workers.    After the Chernobyl catastrophe nuclear reactors had to be  modernised, however the lack of finances stalled the work. "We  know too well what this is fraught with", Kashkin said. The  government reportedly owes the indstry 600 billion roubles.    Some 60 people from eight nuclear power plants are picketing  the government building instead of expected 150.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Paris sees inflation fall to annual 3% FRANCE'S monthly inflation rate eased to 0.1 per cent in June, down from 0.3 per cent in the previous month, according to provisional figures from the Insee state statistics body yesterday, William Dawkins writes from Paris. The result, better than most forecasters were expecting, brings the annual rate to 3 per cent, a fraction below the rate at which inflation had stabilised since March. The improvement is believed to be due to lower energy prices and a consistently low price rise for goods. Inflation in the services sector, by contrast, is rising slightly above the headline figure. This leaves French inflation at 1.3 percentage points below the rate in western Germany.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Shoot-out in central Jerusalem One Israeli was killed, and more than a dozen were injured, when two gunmen opened fire in central Jerusalem last night, in a pedestrian area crowded with restaurants, a Jerusalem correspondent writes. The gunmen were shot dead by Israeli security forces. The centre of Jerusalem was closed to traffic, as police and the army searched for explosive devices the gunmen might have planted. Mr Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to PLO chairman Yassir Arafat, condemned the incident, which he said was intended to harm the Israeli-PLO peace process.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Polish minister offers to abandon share tax scheme Mr Leszek Miller, Poland's minister of labour and one of the most left-wing members in the centre-left Polish government, told a meeting of large private investors that he would no longer press for his proposed tax on stock exchange transactions. The move was designed to calm investors' fears after a bout of selling on the Warsaw stock exchange. Investors argued that the proposed 0.5 per cent transactions tax contradicted earlier legislation. This provided for tax exemption on transactions and stock market profits until the end of 1995. Investors warned it would jeopardise the government's hopes of raising large funds for the budget from the privatisation of state enterprises. Mr Miller hoped to raise about Dollars 18m a month from the proposed tax in order to increase social payments as promised in his party's election manifesto. However, he was criticised by the finance minister and others within his own party. He finally backed down after heavy selling on the Warsaw stock exchange over its last two sessions. The selling, after months of steady buying, was also sparked off by a row between the two coalition partners over the sacking of the minister in charge of bank privatisation and warnings by Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, a former finance minister, that the stock exchange bubble was about to burst. Warsaw's WIG index reached a record 18,218 last Thursday but tumbled to 15,227 on Tuesday. Trading, which takes place only three days a week, resumes today.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Yacht, fetes and death sentences await governor AS GOVERNOR of Hong Kong, Mr Chris Patten can console himself with the knowledge that even if his Westminster career is over, he will earn more than HKDollars 10.4m (Pounds 765,000) tax-free during his tenure, at current pay levels. In case that is not enough, he will also receive an entertainment allowance of HKDollars 432,000 a year with which to wine and dine visiting dignitaries and local high-flyers. Not that he or his wife will have to do the cooking. He will be maintained by a domestic staff of 30, which includes three chauffeurs, one for each of the governor's cars, a Rolls and two Daimlers. But Britain's last significant outpost of empire requires more than the occasional donning of the colonial plumed helmet. As the Queen's representative in Hong Kong, the governor has enormous powers, including the final decision over the death sentence. (All sentences have been commuted since the 1960s.) He is also in charge of the 186,000-member civil service and, working with the Foreign Office and Downing Street, guides Hong Kong's relations with third countries. Once a year he delivers a policy address, the equivalent of the Queen's speech, which sets out his government's agenda. On day-to-day decisions, he is advised by an Executive Council of senior business and political figures. He is also surrounded by Foreign Office mandarins, many of them Sinologists, who advise on China relations. Much of the work is boring, including opening fetes and placing wreaths on the anniversary of the Japanese invasion. But if Mr Patten should ever become disillusioned, he can escape to the calm of the governor's luxury country house in the New Territories, or set sail into the South China Sea sunset on his 30-metre launch, the Lady Maurine.</p>

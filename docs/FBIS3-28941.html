Officials of the United States, Britain, France, China  and Russia will hold discussions to prepare for possible  referral of the problem to the Security Council, according to  the official.    Han is visiting Washington to discuss ways to cooperate with  the U.S. Government in dealing with the nuclear issue.    "Han and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed  in  their talks that a meeting of UNSC members at the IAEA will be  useful in finding joint measures to cope with the nuclear  problem at this stage," the official said.    If the permanent UNSC members discuss the problem in New  York  now even though the problem has not yet been referred to the  United Nations, it might unnecessarily provoke Pyongyang, he  added.    "That's why they decided to discuss the problem at the  IAEA,"  he said.</p>

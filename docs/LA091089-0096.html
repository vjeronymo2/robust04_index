			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> West Virginia voters handed Gov. Gaston Caperton an overwhelming defeat on  three constitutional amendments he had said were necessary to complete his  reorganization of state government. With 99% of the vote counted, only one of  the proposals garnered as much as 19% support. One of the amendments would have  eliminated three statewide elected offices -- secretary of state, treasurer and  agriculture commissioner -- and placed their duties under the governor's  control. The second amendment would have given the governor greater authority  over the state primary and secondary education system. The third would have  given cities and counties the ability to merge or choose new forms of  government. Caperton, a Democrat who took office in January, said his  Administration failed to fully explain the proposals.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dipankar Bhattacharya: "Knocking at the Pearly </F> GATT"]    [Text] It has taken seven years and quite a bit of high  drama towards the end, but the Uruguay rond of the Geneva  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has now a solution in sight.  Probably not as general as Mr Peter Sutherland would have  wished, the agreement nevertheless has brought the world  remarkably close to becoming a single market.    Not all wrinkles have been ironed out. Entertainment still  eludes a negotiated settlement. So do intellectual property  rights. Resentment lingers over proposals to phase out subsidies  on agriculture and civil aviation. Financial services have been  grudgingly admitted into local markets. There is talk of a  general agreement on trade in services to take up what the  Uruguay Round has left unfinished.    Yet there can be no denying the current round's achievement.  GATT proposes to slash tariffs by an average of one third and  reduce non-tariff barriers--quotas, subsidies, taxes--with the  ultimate goal of fuelling global economic expansion. By some  estimates to the tune of at least $200 billion annually by the  year 2002.    The European Union, China and Japan are slated to be the  biggest gainers. The rest of Asia, which gets the smallest piece  of the enlarged world trade pie, is expected to net an  additional $10 billion annually by 2002. India, whose exports in  1992-93 accounted for 0.4 per cent of global exports, too is  hoping for a $200 million gain annually.    Which is what the third world, having watched the  Airbus-Boeing battles from the sidelines, can hope to extract  out of a comprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. GATT  offers the third world between 15 and 20 per cent of the  increased world trade. Far more than it can expect by way of  loans, aid and capital transfers.    But all of this is on paper. GATT has merely opened up the  possibilities. Whether they are transformed into real gains is  solely dependent on member nations. In the expanded world trade  as the GATT envisages, there will be some winners and some  losers. Apart from protection, members are left to their own to  devise favourable trade balances.    While India may be insignificant in the trading world, trade  is by no means insignificant for India. Its $18.42 billion  exports constituted 7.6 per cent of its gross domestic product  in 1992-93, and its $21.73 billion imports, 9 per cent of the  GDP. However, an increase in the volume of trade by $200 million  annually does not mean much unless it goes towards improving  India's trade balance.    So when Mr Pranab Mukherjee assures a baying Opposition that  India's share of the increased action would be in the region of  $200 million, nothing is actually being said. There is no  attempt to explain how India expects to climb out of its  consistent trade deficit. Since 1950, the country has had trade  surpluses in only two years. And trade models have very little  to offer by way of optimism for Indian exports.    The GATT edifice is built around Ricardian comparative  advantage. The "I make gin you make rum and we trade" principle.  Comparative advantage would imply that India exports labour  intensive goods and services to buy capital intensive imports.  But while India has an overabundant labour supply there is very  little evidence that it is cheap. Low productivity, a narrow  skill base and government induced wage distortions makes Indian  labour a costly proposition.    Since capital too is scarce, the Indian trade experience  falls into that arcane extreme of theory--that of absolute  advantage. India has an absolute disadvantage in labour, as well  as capital intensive exports. Forty years of trade deficits bear  this out. With absolute disadvantage, a country has little  reason to trade.    But this is without taking technology into consideration. As  a theory, factor intensive comparative advantage is constrained  by a set of extremely restrictive assumptions. Benefit to  trading partners accrues if technologies are assumed identical  and static, there are no economies of scale and products and  factors are undifferentiated.    The real world is not so rarefied. Expansions of Exxon and  Mitsubishi contradict the economies of scale assumption. And  growth rates of the Asian tigers shows how futile it would be to  ignore technology in a trade model.    Efforts have been made to incorporate technological dynamics  into trade theory. The techno-economic models are based on the  mushrooming of sunrise industries in the Pacific Rim. But  Nehruvian isolation kept India blissfully unaware of last  decade's information revolution. The share of new technology  imports in India's total import bill is now around 64 per cent.  This ratio is increasing. Only 19 per cent of Indian exports are  in these areas, that too in the lower market segments such as  software programming and computer peripherals.    With economic restructuring exports may have picked up, but  India still has a long way to go before trade begins to propel  growth of the economy. It is a reflection on the general  ignorance about the country's trade prospects that Indian  opposition to GATT centres around emotive clauses where we have  in fact extracted considerable mileage, in seed and drug  patenting, for instance.    Despite India's trade prospects, GATT offers more to India  in  terms of capital flows than it could expect through aid, loans  or investment. As such, trade earnings are the least tied up  source of foreign exchange. However, GATT imposes pressure on  the reform process. Balance of payments considerations in a  freer world trade regime are likely to hasten the government's  move to free exchange and interest rates. And global competition  will force the government's hand on the exit policy.    This is another area where the Opposition has failed to make  hay. To other countries, GATT has revolved around jobs, jobs and  jobs. But employment ramifications of freer trade seem to have  been lost on the Indian politician. Admittedly, GATT phases out  trade barriers over 10 years, but at the end of it there is  going to be an immense global displacement of labour.    Freetrade is not only about free movement of products.  Factors of production, labour and capital, must also be free to  move across national borders. Through GATT, the North has, in a  way, legalised the mobility of capital, but there is little in  the Uruguay round's agreement to enhance labour mobility.    The United States, to a certain extent, introduced the issue  of labour mobility by bringing services into GATT's ambit in  1986. But an ideal free trade agreement should make it as easy  for a Filipino to work in a Pittsburg Steel plant as it would be  for a London lawyer to offer his services to an Egyptian bank.    But the process is not easy. Labour is typically more  encumbered than capital and labour mobility is not an issue for  economists alone. Social, political, cultural and racial  considerations have a large role to play in determining  immigration levels. No infringement of these interests is likely  to be tolerated for the sake of economic efficiency.    In this respect, GATT still has a long way to go. Till then,  85 per cent of the world's population will have to be content  with 15 per cent of the gains from multinational trade  agreements. For the third world to increase its bargaining power  in subsequent trade negotiations, their markets will have to  become indispensable to developed nations. To the extent that  GATT has initiated the opening up of markets, its achievement is  salutary.</p>

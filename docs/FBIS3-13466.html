There is agreement  that for this summit, as it is a resumed summit, the rules of  the quorum (2/3rds) shall not apply. It is expected that a  number of these states will participate at the level of the  heads of state/government, judging from the responses received.  We should, therefore, be assured of a good attendance at the  summit level. The preparatory meetings of the personal  representatives and of the ministers shall be held on March 25  and 26 respectively. This resumed summit is expected to include  discussions on issues relating to the future course of the G-15  in a fast-changing world.</p>

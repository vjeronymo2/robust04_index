			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (1): A narrow window of opportunity - There is not much time for Mrs Zia to curb political disputes and put the economy and poverty back at the top of her agenda For Bangladesh the struggle to capitalise on the gains it has made in the past three years of good harvests, democratic government and freedom from natural disasters is proving hard. Mrs Khaleda Zia's assumption of power as prime minister in 1990, following the overthrow of the military dictator, General Hossain Ershad, has enabled the country to enjoy its longest period of political stability since its formation in a bloody independence war in 1971. Although they remain among the poorest people on earth, Bangladeshis are slightly better off than they were, thanks to bumper rice crops. The government has brought its borrowing under control, taken some steps to liberalise the economy and is considering implementing many more. There is a risk, however, that the gains could be lost. The next general election, due by early 1996, is already exerting a baleful influence on the country's politics, diverting attention from social and economic needs. Economic reforms are progressing at a snail's pace while politicians focus on party work. Charges of election-rigging pollute the political air. Strikes and demonstrations have disrupted business. Islamic fundamentalists, numerically weak but nonetheless active, have launched bad-tempered attacks on the influence of foreign aid organisations. There is still time for Mrs Zia, widow of the assassinated soldier-president Zia ur Rahman, to bring the political disputes under control and put the economy and fighting poverty back at the top of her agenda. But the window of opportunity is closing fast. As Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned businessman, says: 'The political parties are fighting so much that we are heading towards a point of no return.' The tensions were highlighted last month by the decision of the Awami League, the main opposition party, to call a strike on the day when the prime minister was laying the foundation stone for a Dollars 700m bridge - the biggest investment ever made in Bangladesh. A day which was meant to celebrate the nation's economic progress became an occasion for political squabbling. Mrs Zia denies there is any risk of instability. She says: 'The important thing is democracy and the democratic system. If democracy continues, then stability will continue and our economic policies will also stay in place.' Bangladesh is a young country of 120m people with a young country's sense of insecurity. It is tragically vulnerable to the elements, such as the devastating cyclone of 1991 and the storms which lashed the eastern coast this month. It feels nervous about its huge neighbour, India. Bangladesh's institutions and elites are new; the middle-class is small and lacks capital, skills and experience. Among the poor, one child in 10 dies in infancy. Nearly one third of youngsters do not go to school. About 20 per cent of families have no access to safe drinking water. Without foreign aid, of which more than Dollars 2bn is pledged every year, Bangladesh would even have difficulty feeding itself. Although population growth has slowed to 2.2 per cent a year, it is still so high that in just over 20 years Bangladesh will have 200m people. Moreover, the country is not free of external difficulties. It is engaged in a festering dispute with India over sharing the waters of the Ganges river; and it has run into international criticism of its handling of tribal refugees from Myanmar and of a long-running insurgency among tribal Chakma people in southern Bangladesh. Mrs Zia deserves some credit for trying to tackle the country's basic economic difficulties. The government has contributed by expanding poverty-alleviation and social welfare programmes and introducing a World Bank-endorsed economic liberalisation programme. Government over-spending and inflation have been curbed. Prices are rising at less than 2 per cent annually. Controls on foreign trade and investment, including high import tariffs, have been cut, internal price controls relaxed and a start made on financial reforms and on overhauling debt-laden public sector industries and services. Last autumn, the taka was liberalised on the current account. Liberalisation has particularly benefited agriculture. Bangladesh has become almost self-sufficient in food grains and has started exporting modest amounts of high-quality rice. With the country's subsistence seemingly assured, agricultural planners are now looking to expand output further by encouraging crop specialisation. Foreign trade has gained from liberalisation and the establishment of two duty-free export-processing zones. Boosted by the rapid expansion of the garments industry, overall exports are growing at about 20 per cent a year and could reach Dollars 2.6bn in the year ending June 1994, according to government estimates. With the help of a further Dollars 1bn of remittances from Bangladeshis working overseas, Bangladesh has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 2.6bn, enough to pay for seven months' imports. The fiscal deficit is also well under control and inflation is low, running at an annual rate of 2 per cent. As Mr Saifur Rahman, the finance minister, says: 'Never in the past has our economic position been so good.' And yet, even though Mr Rahman's boast is true, Bangladesh still has far to go before it can satisfy even the basic needs of its people. The main problem is that economic growth - running at 4-5 per cent in recent years - is too slow to generate adequate resources for the future. However, in order to reach growth rates of more than 6 per cent, which the government believes is the minimum required, Bangladesh needs to make radical economic changes, particularly to boost investment above its current level of about 13 per cent of output. The World Bank estimates a ratio of 18-20 per cent is necessary to lift Bangladesh into a higher level of economic activity. The immediate challenge is to raise public investment. Bangladesh has Dollars 5bn of unused foreign aid in the pipeline waiting for the government to implement projects to which the funds are tied. The start of construction on the Jamuna River bridge will help utilise money, so will work on the Flood Action Plan, a system of embankments designed to protect Bangladesh against floods. Preparations and pilot studies for a World Bank-sponsored programme have themselves cost Dollars 150m. There are also ambitious projects to improve the exploitation of Bangladesh's abundant natural gas reserves. Inexperience and inefficiency among ministers and civil servants alike combine to frustrate schemes, sometimes for years. The fear of corruption, coupled to the measures taken to prevent it, ties the government into knots. Mr Rahman has promised to speed decision-making, but aid donors see little sign of improvement. Without more public investment, private investment will be slow in coming and limited to small projects. Industry needs more support than Bangladesh provides - electricity generation is just 80 kilowatt hours a head a year, compared with 200-350 in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. There are just two telephones for every 1,000 people when even India has seven. Only this year will the last ferry crossing on the road from Bangladesh to the second city of Chittagong be replaced by a bridge. One reason why public investment is slow is that the government's time and money is being swallowed up by the loss-making, over-manned, state-owned industry. The gross losses in 1992-93 amounted to about 20bn taka, the equivalent of 45 per cent of external aid disbursements. Moreover, the inefficiency of these industries acts as a drag on the rest of the economy, raising costs and dissuading companies from investing. Prodded by the World Bank, the government has committed itself to streamlining enterprises, liberalising the state-dominated financial markets, privatising and opening basic services such as electricity generation and telecommunications to private investment. It has already embarked on rationalising the jute industry, the biggest loss-maker, with the help of a Dollars 250m World Bank loan which will contribute towards compensation for some 20,000 mill workers losing their jobs. Financial sector reform depends crucially on improving the performance of the state-owned banks which hold about 80 per cent of banking assets. The government is planning to privatise Rupali Bank, a medium-sized state-owned institution, later this year. It has also granted permission for Citibank of the US to join the small group of foreign banks operating in Bangladesh and increase competition. But deep-rooted problems remain, notably the Dollars 2bn of bad debt weighing on the public sector banks - about a third of their assets and much of it accumulated through loans to state-run enterprises, notably jute. Overall progress with privatisation is painfully slow. Only two of about 40 enterprises identified for stock market flotations have actually been sold. Measures to attract private investment into infrastructure are only beginning to be implemented. The government was due to sign its first contract for oil and gas exploration with a foreign consortium this month. The latest indications are that the government is more likely to slow economic reform than to accelerate in advance of the next general election. The ruling Bangladesh National Party was defeated in municipal elections in Dhaka and other cities in March - a setback which Mrs Zia says was partly due to the unpopularity of reform. The obstacles to further progress are many: politicians who are more interested in fighting over the existing political and economic turf than increasing future acreage; civil servants worried that liberalisation will curb their powers, including access to bribes; strike-prone trade unions which resent the job cuts that serious public sector reform would bring; Islamic fundamentalists seeking to exploit deep-rooted suspicions of programmes advanced by foreign donors; and poverty and ignorance. But amid the gloom there is also hope. Bangladesh's fight against poverty has spawned two of the world's most successful non-profit organisations - Grameen Bank, a co-operative bank which has won endorsement from President Bill Clinton for its work with the poor, and the Bangladesh Rural Action Committee (BRAC), which has a range of programmes including credit co-operatives, chicken farming, schools, and health centres. These institutions show how even the very poor can take advantage of opportunities, given the right encouragement. As Mr Mohammed Yunus, Grameen Bank's founder, says: 'Poverty is a very powerful motive for action.'</p>

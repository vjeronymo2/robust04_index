			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley share offer success Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the international publishing group, and JD Wetherspoon, the chain of 44 Greater London pubs - yesterday announced the results of their offers to financial intermediaries. The 7m Dorling Kindersley shares offered to the public at 165p were six times subscribed. Strong demand for the shares had already caused the amount on offer through intermediates to be increased from 25 to 36.3 per cent of the issue, valuing the group at Pounds 101.7m. In the JD Wetherspoon flotation, which valued the group at Pounds 45.6m, applications were received for 79.4 per cent of the 5.3m shares offered to intermediaries. The remainder of the 14.68m shares on offer have been placed with institutions, raising a total of Pounds 24m. Dorling Kindersley said investors who had applied for 5m or more shares would receive 10 per cent of the number sought; those who applied for between 2m and 4.99m would receive 15 per cent and those who sought fewer than 2m would be allocated 21.95 per cent, rounded to the nearest 100 shares. A further 12.15m shares were firmly placed with institutions last Friday. The flotation raised Pounds 31.6m, of which Pounds 25m was new money for the company.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Nicaraguan hostages released but others still held Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua, pictured on arrival at the northern Nicaraguan town of Quilal, helped to secure the release of 11 left-wing hostages there early yesterday. Contra rebels, however, continued to hold five hostages and said they had suspended their talks with the cardinal after spotting government troops nearby. He said later yesterday he was seeking more talks. The rebels are demanding that left-wing Sandinstas be ousted from the Nicaraguan government. The releases came after former Sandinista gunmen holding hostages in Managua had freed three conservative politicians late on Tuesday. They continue to hold Vice-President Virgilio Godoy and five colleagues in order to try to force the release of the left-wing hostages at Quilal.</p>

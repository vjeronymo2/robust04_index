			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Varde to be split up as deficit rises Varde Bank, Denmark's 10th largest bank with assets of about DKr11bn (Dollars 1.65bn), is being broken up and the healthy business will be acquired by Sydbank Sonderjylland, the South Jutland banking group, Sydbank said yesterday. Varde Bank, which serves the region of the West Jutland port of Esbjerg, underwent a financial reconstruction a year ago, when the central bank and the larger commercial banks put up guarantees to enable it to stay in business. But fresh losses this autumn sent the bank's capital adequacy ratio under the Danish legal minimum ratio of 9 per cent and negotiations to find a solution to the bank's problem have been continuing for several weeks. The final arrangements for winding up the bank will be announced today. An option being considered, according to Varde Bank, is the creation of an asset management company, or 'bad bank', to take over the biggest of the bad debts, which are linked to property engagements. Denmark operates a deposit insurance system to prevent losses for deposits of up to DKr240,000.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REPORTER LOSES IN HIGH COURT  </P> <P> A Supreme Court justice today refused to help a Texas television news reporter  who has begun serving a six-month jail term for refusing to surrender the name  of a source.  </P> <P> Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied an emergency request by Brian  Karem of San Antonio's KMOL-TV.  </P> <P> The request sought to postpone Karem's sentence while he appeals the  contempt-of-court finding against him.  </P> <P> "I sure don't want to do six months in jail," KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem said  on the Bexar County Jail steps as he surrendered to begin serving the jail term  Wednesday. "But I'm going to keep my promise."  </P> <P> The reporter has defied three court orders to turn over confidential notes of a  telephone interview last year with one of the two suspects jailed in the murder  case.  </P> <P> Prosecution and defense lawyers, who are preparing for the murder case, contend  they need to know who arranged the interview. Karem has said the source fears  for his life if his identity is revealed.  </P> <P> "We can't live up to our principles every day in life," Karem told reporters as  he entered the jail. "But I think this is an important enough issue and I feel  strongly enough about it that I want to live up to how I believe."  </P> <P> Karem had hoped to stay out of jail while he appealed the contempt citations.  But those hopes ended Tuesday when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  refused to issue a stay.  </P> <P> Sheriff Harlon Copeland met Karem on the steps of the jail. The reporter was  accompanied by KMOL news director Ron Harig, station manager Bob Donohue and  Karem's father, James.  </P> <P> Karem said his only hope for release would be for the source to come forward or  for the U.S. Supreme Court to block his sentence pending appeal.  </P></p>

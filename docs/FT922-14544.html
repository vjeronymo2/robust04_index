			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Threat of UK break-up if Tories lose warns Major MR JOHN MAJOR sought to pull back his government from the verge of defeat in Thursday's general election with a stark warning yesterday that anything but a Conservative victory would threaten the break-up of the United Kingdom. As the opinion polls suggested that Labour would emerge as the largest party in a 'hung' parliament, Mr Paddy Ashdown hardened his terms for a deal between the Liberal Democrats and a minority government headed by Mr Neil Kinnock. Mr Ashdown admitted that his uncompromising insistence that a coalition government - with cabinet posts for his party - should legislate immediately to introduce proportional representation had created tensions with some of his colleagues. Reports that Mr Ashdown's terms for an agreement would include a demand for up to four Cabinet posts were rejected as 'premature' by a senior Liberal Democrat official last night. Mr Major's intervention, based on the plans of the two opposition parties for Scottish devolution and closer European integration, was his most strident of the campaign. He told a London rally that what was at stake in the election was 'the birthright' of all British citizens. His opponents would allow Scotland to break from the United Kingdom and submerge the sovereignty of Westminster in a united states of Europe. He called on voters to 'wake up' to the fact that 'the United Kingdom is in danger'. Senior ministers said that the Conservatives would put the 'threat' to the Union, alongside the promise of rapid economic recovery if Mr Major is re-elected, at the centre of their campaign in the final days before April 9. The prime minister, who underlined again his implacable opposition to electoral reform, insisted he remained confident of an overall majority at the election. He suggested that the opinion polls were misreading the mood among the electorate. But with five out of six polls published yesterday showing a Labour lead, some senior ministers were ready to concede that the best the Conservatives could realistically hope for was to emerge as the largest party after an inconclusive election. The FT poll of polls shows Labour with the support of 39.4 per cent - little more than 2 points ahead of the Conservatives - enough to put Mr Kinnock in Downing Street as leader of the largest party. The Liberal Democrats are put at 19.4 per cent. A survey of floating voters conducted by Mori for the BBC suggests that although Mr Major is still regarded as the most capable potential prime minister, his campaign has failed to win over voters to the Conservatives. It also indicates that the party's criticisms of Labour's tax policies have not so far been effective. Mr Kinnock yesterday stepped up his offensive to win over more voters in the centre ground by insisting that a majority Labour government would seek to govern by consensus. While rejecting any post-election deal with Mr Ashdown, Mr Kinnock re-emphasised his party's willingness to reform the constitution and to convene a national debate on changes to the voting system. He also hinted in a BBC radio interview that Labour was ready to see proportional representation introduced for elections to the European parliament. His conciliatory message was echoed in separate speeches by Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, and Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, who argued that Labour's approach to electoral reform would seek to build a 'new consensus after a great national debate'. Labour strategists acknowledged that the pledges were directed at 'soft' Liberal Democrat supporters who needed to be persuaded that Mr Kinnock was committed to constitutional change. They are also intended to capitalise on disquiet among some Scottish Liberal Democrats at the uncompromising stance being adopted by Mr Ashdown. Mr Charles Kennedy and Sir David Steel are said to be among senior colleagues who believe that in the event of a hung parliament, the party might have to soften its stance. Yesterday, however, Mr Ashdown said he would be willing to force a second general election if his terms were not met. Those terms included seats in the cabinet in any coalition. Mr Major signalled a determined effort to 'squeeze' the third party vote, warning that a vote for Mr Ashdown would allow Mr Kinnock into Downing Street. Drawing on the overwhelming backing that the Conservatives have received from the business community, Mr Major said the choice at the end of this week would be between a government which promised recovery and a socialist party which would deepen the recession.

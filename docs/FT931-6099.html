			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Jobs: How to minimise an uninsured liability - Evidence that sound selection tests can pay dividends even at basic levels of employment FINDING a note on the desk to return Ken Miller's call, the Jobs column followed the scribbled instructions, got though and arranged to visit his house. He then gave the address, but hearing I planned to go by rail, offered to pick me up by car if I phoned him from the station. So I thanked him, and asked for his telephone number. 'You're calling me on it,' said Dr Miller, an internationally esteemed tester of intelligence. His voice took on the same pointed tone again when I rang on the due date itself to say that, having come by car instead, I couldn't find his house. It turned out that I'd arrived in a road with the right name, but located in entirely the wrong area. He nevertheless agreed to stay waiting, probably because I wasn't going there for a by then superfluous assessment of my intelligence. The purpose of my visit was to take one of the many other kinds of test administered from the same household - not just by Ken, but by Mrs Miller better known by her professional name of Barbara Tyler. The test in question is the Work Attitude Scale which, although popular with employers in the Millers' native Australia, is little known in Europe. Hence their idea of inviting this Pom to come and have a shot at it. Consisting of just 44 questions to be answered by ticking either 'yes' or 'no', it is normally completed within 10 minutes. But on being left alone to make my attempt, I ran into difficulties on only the second question, which asked: 'Do you find yourself at times full of energy and at others find it hard to get going?' What stumped me was not the bit about finding myself at times full of energy, which I sometimes do despite usually feeling quite the opposite. The trouble is that even when at my most energetic, I still find it hard to get going. So I went and explained the problem to Ken Miller, who studied me in silence for several seconds before saying the safest advice he could give was to answer 'no'. Fortunately, things went well enough thereafter for me to finish the form just over 15 minutes after starting. But since it then took the good doctor a good deal less time to to score my efforts and hand down his verdict, I was surprised as well as pleased to come out pretty well. In exploring people's attitude to work, the test measures three different aspects of character. And the first of them, technically termed service orientation, is essentially how we get on with our fellow humans. Barbara Tyler was swift to emphasise that there are no hard and fast rules for deciding the right degree of sociability for jobs in general. A score on the stand-offish side could be a plus in work that requires distanced judgment. On the other hand, staff continually badgered by not always sympathetic people might do well to be more than usually gregarious. In the main, though, a score somewhere between the two will be preferable. The next measure, which the test calls task focus, is of how far we accord with Ecclesiastes 9,10: 'Whatsoever they hand findeth to do, do it with thy might . . . .' But while staff who take personal pride in their accuracy and high productiveness are obviously more desirable than skimpers, those who elevate pride in the job to outright perfectionism tend to be handicaps. Measure number three, termed work approach, is of the extent to which we characteristically take responsibility for the tasks entrusted to us. Here again the right degree will be determined by what is appropriate for the particular setting. Even so, since responsibility-addicts are apt to be bloody-minded, and their extreme opposites are averse to doing anything unless issued with detailed instructions, the best bet is once more a score in the mid-range. So how did the Jobs column rate on the three yardsticks? Well, for the benefit of any readers who happen to be top executives and in the market, Here is the snapshot of me that would be handed to an employing outfit's chieftains: Service orientation - A bit too open and easy-going. Task focus - Takes pride in doing a good job. Work approach - Accepts responsibility. Hence, in the latter two, the test scored me squarely in the desirable mid-range. Moreover, while on the over-sociable side, I am only slightly so. Alas I wasn't left preening myself for long before Barbara Tyler brought the chickens home to roost with a vengeance. 'Of course, those results say nothing about your ability for higher-level work such as managing and the professions,' she said sweetly. 'That's not what the process is designed to assess. All that it reflects is fitness for basic jobs - shopfloor manufacture, checking-out in supermarkets, hotel reception, bus conducting - up to the lowest rank of supervisor, perhaps, but not beyond it.' At which point I would dearly like to know whether readers' instant reaction is the same as mine was. I immediately felt myself losing all interest in the Work Attitude Scale and its applications. But any of us who shared that reaction should surely need only a second's thought to give us reason to feel ashamed of our snobbish reflexes. For the fact that a job is ranked low in a hierarchy is clearly no gauge of its importance to the employing organisation, let alone to the welfare of humanity. For one thing, there seems little doubt that anybody who talks of such jobs as 'unskilled' can never have tried doing them properly. Even sweeping-up is something that can be done either well or badly, despite being an expertise that is most often noticed only in its absence. For another, just as people who apply themselves cheerfully to basic work in the spirit of Ecclesiastes are an undervalued asset, skimpers of it are an un-insured liability. Goodness knows how much harm they collectively do to the corporate interest. For example, if I had a fat research contract to hand to one of the universities, a good half thereof would already have disqualified themselves just by employing couldn't-care-less telephonists. So it is to the credit of the Work Attitude Scale's Australian developers, Doug Mcleod and the late Alf Chandler, that they twigged the decisiveness of low-ranked work. And, having twigged same, they also look to have devised a useful test of some of the necessary abilities. True, the personality factors the WAS measures are only part of the mix required; as Barbara Tyler says, physical looks can often be no less important. True, too, that the Millers stand to gain from the test's wider usage. Even so, evidence of its value is there to be seen in before-and-after studies of its effects in companies. Gauged by reductions in basic staff departures both voluntary and otherwise, the improvements range from 17 to 57 per cent, with an average of 31. The testing cost of achieving them is under Pounds 20 a candidate. Any employer minded to use the test should nevertheless check the facts personally. For the Jobs column, or at least its present writer, now also has a vested interest. With retirement age looming next year, I'm glad to have the WAS certification of qualities that should make me an almost ideal checker-out in a supermarket - if I can only find my way to it, that is.</p>

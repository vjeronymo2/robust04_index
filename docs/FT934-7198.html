			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Joys of duty-free shopping - The Bottom Line THE HALF-year profit increases reported this week by British Airways and BAA, the privatised British Airports Authority, have confirmed civil aviation as one of the UK's corporate success stories. At a time when most other international airlines are still struggling to return to the black, BA's interim pre-tax profits rose 3.5 per cent to Pounds 235m, which including an impressive 26.5 per cent increase in second quarter profits, making it the most profitable airline in the world. BAA, the only privatised airports operator in Europe, showed an 8.7 per cent rise in interim pre tax profits to Pounds 237m and said some 20 to 30 airports around the world were interested in forming collaborative or equity partnerships with it to help them expand and modernise. The performance of both UK air transport stocks was much in line with analysts expectations. Both are seen as good buys since both companies are well positioned to take advantage of the gradual recovery in air travel from the prolonged slump caused by the combination of the Gulf crisis and the economic recession. However, the City is divided on which stock is the better bet. For some, BAA is the safer investment in that its income flow is directly related to the increase in passengers using its airports without the competitive risks faced by airlines. BAA's latest traffic forecasts predict that demand for its seven UK airports will grow at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent up to the end of this century. Faced with a more stringent regulatory pricing formula for its landing charges, BAA has continued to expand its retailing activities which are turning its airports into large shopping malls. For the first time, retailing has become the company's largest source of income overtaking landing charges. Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, has been travelling to China to discuss airport joint ventures in an air travel market growing at 30 per cent a year. He is also in discussion with airports in continental Europe, especially Rome, where government's are beginning to see in BAA's performance the positive benefits of privatising airports. 'We have shown we can make profits and reduce landing charges as a private concern,' Sir John said this week. But as a quasi-monopoly, BAA's dividend yield remains conservative at 2.2 per cent and its decision this week to raise the interim payout by 8.6 per cent to 6.75p a share proved somewhat disappointing to the market. Moreover, the company faces heavy spending in the next years to build the new Pounds 900m-Pounds 800m fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport, its star asset, as well as in possible future investments in other international airports. There is a suspicion that the company will launch a rights issue. BA's 3.3 per cent dividend yield reflects the greater risks attached to the stock. Although airline shares are not for the faint-hearted - the UK-US air war over BA's ticket codesharing deal with USAir, its US partner, flared again this week; ticket discounting continues; and over-capacity plagues the market - BA is probably in the best position of any international carrier to profit form the overdue cyclical recovery in the business. While continuing to drive down its cost base (by the end of this year BA will have reduced underlying costs by Pounds 500m in the last three years), BA has taken a lead in the industry to form a global network with partners in the US, Australia and Europe. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, reported signs of improvement in the airline's two most important markets, the US and the UK, as well as some recent growth in first and business class premium traffic. It also plans to bring fewer new aircraft into service next year and in 1995. BA appears poised to see sustained profit growth. Chris Tarry, Kleinwort Benson's aviation analyst, upgraded his profit forecasts for the airline this week and expects BA to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m in 1995. All in all, many in the City believe BA could provide risk inclined investors with more attractive rewards than a lower yielding privatised utility such as BAA.</p>

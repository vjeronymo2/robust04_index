			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The unhealthy story of where a family spends its money THE NEW retail prices index weightings, which are supposed to reflect how a typical household divides its income, paint a rather disturbing picture of family spending priorities. Mortgage interest payments still get the single biggest weighting of 48 parts out of the total of 1,000, although this has fallen from last year's weighting of 64. Sweets and chocolates get the highest weighting in the food category, accounting for 12 parts, while biscuits and cakes get a weighting of 9. Fresh vegetables get 7 parts and fresh fruit a meagre 6. The cigarette weighting has fallen this year to 31 parts from 32, in spite of price increases. This suggests that families are spending proportionately less on tobacco. Compact discs, which were introduced to the index five years ago, receive a weighting of 7 with cassette tapes. Vinyl records disappeared from the index last year. The cost of foreign package holidays, included in the retail prices index for the first time in its 79-year history, has been given a weighting of 30.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Devon solicitors threaten action SOLICITORS in Devon have voted unanimously to take industrial action over government proposals to introduce fixed fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts. Members of the Devon and Exeter Law Society have decided to withdraw during March from the 24-hour duty scheme which provides emergency cover for suspects at police stations and courts. The solicitors claim they will only lift the threat of action if Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, allows the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice to examine the issue of fixed fees before they are introduced.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses unsettled by weakness in New York BOURSES seemed unsettled yesterday by declines in New York and Tokyo overnight, and late closers took no consolation from Wall Street's weak opening yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT maintained its sideways gait, particularly hesitant in advance of US price and output data, due after German market hours, and Monday's Wall Street holiday. The FAZ and DAX indices each ended a mere fraction lower on the week as they fell 0.53 to 686.71, and 4.91 to 1,676.48 respectively. Volume fell from DM6bn to DM4.4bn. There were ripples of activity. AMB, the financial holding company, ended DM15 higher at DM875 on speculation that the insurance company Volksfursorge, in which it has a holding, would decide to buy a reciprocal stake in AMB. Volksfursorge said later that it had made no decision on this. Degussa saw two-way pressure, adding DM6.50 at one point before closing DM1.30 higher at DM348.10. The chemicals, metals and pharmaceuticals group has support from Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, which sees earnings nearly doubling over the next two years, but BZW Deutschland said this week that there were better ways to play the economic cycle. Among blue chips, Volkswagen lost DM3 to DM335.80 on its forecast of flat 1991 net profits. PARIS added gentle profit-taking, and bourse talk of higher German interest rates to Wall Street's weakness as the CAC-40 index ended 11.36 lower at 1,865.11, up 0.2 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of FFr1.9bn. Poor profit and turnover reports weighed on some stocks, with Cie Bancaire falling FFr15 to FFr490 on the drop in 1991 net profits from FFr998m to FFr866. Lafarge fell FFr3.90 to FFr313.50 with 126,260 shares traded on 1991 turnover down from FFr32.54bn to FFr31.65bn. The industrial gases company L'Air Liquide, a recent favourite with institutional investors, rose FFr8 to FFr732 in unusually active turnover of 196,650 shares. MILAN saw profit-taking in active trading as the monthly trading account closed. Turnover was estimated to be a little higher than Thursday's L110bn. Blue chips showed declines, with Fiat down L108, or 2.2 per cent, to L4,757, Olivetti L59, or 2.1 per cent, to L2,759 and Pirelli, which has a rights issue on Monday, falling L15, or 1.3 per cent, to L1,110. The Comit index fell 2.74 to 531.21, down 2.9 per cent on the week. Sip savings shares closed down L65, or 3.6 per cent, to L1,360 following Thursday's announcement of the closure of the L400bn bond issue by Stet, the parent group, which has Sip savings warrants attached. The exercise price of the warrants on Sip savings shares is L1,550. The banking sector was generally strong, with Credito Italiano up L35 to L2,150 and Banco Ambroveneto gaining L35 to L4,155. ZURICH ended weaker in low volume on Wall Street and steady to slightly higher Swiss money market rates. Interest rate-sensitive financials lost ground, UBS bearers falling SFr40 to SFr3,760 in banks and Winterthur by SFr60 to SFr3,630 among insurers. BRUSSELS was led down by Petrofina which dropped BFr225, or 2.1 per cent to BFr10,325 as the Bel-20 index closed 7.66 lower at 1,158.37, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Belgium's leading glass-maker, Glaverbel, slipped BFr85, or 2.3 per cent to BFr3,550. After the market closed, it said that 1991 estimated group net profit plunged from BFr2.27bn to BFr700m. STOCKHOLM was dragged down by the banking sector, which fell 3.8 per cent on further evidence of the impact of loan losses on the financial sector. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 9.6 to 938.9, 2.9 per cent lower on the week. The rating agency, Standard and Poor's, downgraded some debt of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, whose A shares fell SKr3.5 to SKr45, and Svenska Handelsbanken, which fell SKr3 to SKr81.5. VIENNA's climb continued for the fourth consecutive day, the 18-share ATX index closing up 18.59 at 1,066.85, a rise of 4.3 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM was generally mixed, with Fokker active after announcing the sale of seven F - 100 aircraft to a Chinese regional airline. It gained Fl 0.30 to Fl 29.20. The CBS Tendency Index declined by 0.3 to 121.8, closing little changed on the week. A government decision to refuse a licence for the export of four submarines to Taiwan was partly behind the decline in shares in Begemann, the engineering group, parent of the company that was to have manufactured the vessels. It came off Fl 4.50 to Fl 100.50. HELSINKI closed at its highest level since last September, the HEX gaining 6.00 to 901.9, a rise of 1.4 per cent on the week. MADRID closed marginally ahead, the general index rising 0.2 to 258.77, up 1.03 per cent on the week. The construction sector was generally strong.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1133.56  1133.05  1132.08  1131.02  1131.80  1131.09  1130.29  1130.78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1133.71    Day's Low  1129.28  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 13    Feb 12    Feb 11    Feb 10    Feb 7 1136.68   1136.12   1137.74   1137.68   1137.10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

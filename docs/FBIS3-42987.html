Requirements are set forth for the sensitivity of ordinary  and professional radiometric instruments for radiation  monitoring of food products based on supporting the concept of  residence of the populace in regions contaminated by  radionuclides from the Chernobyl disaster.    Information is presented on setting up independent local  centers for radiation monitoring of food products and the  environment in centers of population of the Republic of Belarus.    Medical and biological consequences for the populace  following the Chernobyl disaster are examined.    The report sets forth the scales of damage to forestry and  agriculture as a result of the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear  Electric Power Plant and gives recommendations on management of  agricultural production and use of forests on territories  contaminated by radionuclides.    Keywords: radiation conditions in Republic  of Belarus, radiation monitors and radiometers, systems of  radiation monitoring of food products, medical and biological  consequences of Chernobyl disaster for the populace, management  of forestry and agriculture on radionuclide-contaminated  territories.    Introduction    Systems of radiation and ecological monitoring of the  environment in Belarus, as in other regions of the nation, are  narrowly departmental as a rule. In most centers of population,  Belgidromet regularly determines the radiation conditions with  respect to isotopes cesium-137, strontium- 90 and plutonium-239.  Maps have been published of the radiation contamination of the  territory of the republic with cesium-137, as well as  strontium-90 and plutonium-239. At the same time, the  representativeness and confidence of these maps are inadequate.  At present only one measurement per 50 ha is taken on  agricultural lands, and in centers of population with extent of  1.5-2 kilometers, only 15-20 measurements. For example, within  the confines of the village of Veprin in Cherikovskiy Rayon of  Mogilevskaya Oblast, according to data of the former State  Hydrometeorological Committee of the USSR the density of  contamination with isotope cesium-137 is 1184  kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. However, according to data of a mobile  radiometric laboratory equipped with a "CANBERRA" gamma  spectrometer, a detailed study done on 24 March 1991 revealed an  extensive zone on one street with contamination of the order of  1850-2035 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. A significant contribution to  protective measures has been made by household studies of  radiation conditions and compilation of radiation certificates  of centers of population of the republic. Radiation  certification of centers of population has basically been  completed on contaminated territories, although certification of  housing and garden plots continues. Certification of woodlands  and agricultural fields is being done by the Ministry of  Forestry and the Ministry of Agricultural Products of the  republic respectively.    In 1986-1988 when determining protective measures, good  reasons were found for leaning toward the use of density of  contamination of lands with radionuclides as an information  index. Since completing resettlement of residents away from  centers of population with density of contamination by  cesium-137 of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and strontium-90  of 111 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], and also families with children away  from the zone with contamination density of more than 555  kBq/m[.sup]2[/], the overall dose of external radiation for  most regions does not exceed 10-40 percent, and the principal  dose of irradiation of residents in affected regions is obtained  from internal irradiation due to using local food products  contaminated by radionuclides.    Up until August 1990 in Belarus, as in other republics  affected by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power  Plant, standards VDU-88 [for temporary admissible levels] were  in effect that allowed exposure to internal irradiation due to  radionuclide-contaminated food products of 0.7-0.8 rem per year.  Laws of the republic on social protection of citizens affected  by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plantset an  effective equivalent dose of the population resident on  contaminated territories of not more than 0.1 rem per year (7  rem for life). This has required the acceptance of new  admissible levels of radionuclide contamination of food  products. The introduction in Belarus on 1 August 1990 of new  and more stringent control levels of admissible radionuclide  contamination of food products was not supported by appropriate  means of measurement, as most radiometric instruments were of  type KRVP-4AB with inadequate sensitivity.    In November 1990, the international Commission on Radiation  Protection set stricter upper limits of the dose of irradiation  of professionals to 20 mSv per year (previously 50 mSv per  year), and for the populace to 1 mSv per year (previously 5 mSv  per year). The same ICRP recommendations (No 60, 1990) introduce  a minimum limit of annual dose of 0.1 mSv for taking protective  steps (all values stated over the dose burdens from the natural  background).    In 1992, Belgidromet came out with a map of radioactive  contamination of the territory of the republic with iodine-131  and the dose rate due to this radionuclide in various regions.    In 1991, the Institute of Radiation Medicine of the Ministry  of Public Health of the Rebpulic of Belarus compiled a catalog  of doses of irradiation of residents for centers of population  of the republic, where the density of contamination with  radionuclide cesium-137 was more than 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/].  Dose loads were calculated by the approved procedure of the  Ministry of Public Health for external irradiation with respect  to dose rate and internal irradiation with respect to content of  cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239 in milk and potatoes.    The catalog covers 1111 centers of population of Gomelskaya,  Mogilevskaya and Brestskaya Oblasts. In 1991, the dose of  irradiation of residents exceeded 1 mSv per year in 610 centers  of population. According to data of Belgidromet, there are more  than 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities, on  territories with cesium-137 contamination of more than 37  kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. This number of centers of population should  be increased due to villages and settlements in the Polesye  district where the cesium-137 contamination density is 18.5-25.9  kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and milk meeting standards RKU- 90 cannot be  obtained. Thus, in 1992 we will need to measure the content of  radionuclides in food products at more than 2500 centers of  population of the republic.    Following completion of work on compiling the catalog of  doses of irradiation of residents in centers of population of  the republic, there will have to be a more precise definition of  the previously assumed decisions on assuring safety of  habitation on radionuclide-contaminated territories.    The report analyzes the main reasons for the unsatisfactory  state of radiation-ecological conditions in the Belarus region  and gives recommendations on necessary measures aimed at radical  improvement of the situation that has evolved.    The book offers an analysis of the state of health of the  populace of the Republic of Belarus since the Chernobyl disaster.    Creation of a network of local centers for radiation  monitoring of food products for the populace along with the  state radiation monitoring system will provide the population  with means of protection from radionuclide-contaminated food  products.    This report has been prepared by a panel of experts from  Belarus; the base for doing the research was defined by the  Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which was set up by  the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of  Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power  Plant and the International Chernobyl- Pomoshch non-governmental  organization.    The basic goals and areas of activity of the Institute:    development of protective measures and regulations of safe  production activity and habitation of the populace on  radionuclide-contaminated territories;    comprehensive radiological examination of centers of  population and territories subjected to radioactive  contamination;    creation of local centers and preparation of dosimeters for  monitoring food products for the populace, developing and  producing radiometric instruments for radiation monitoring of  food products and the environment.    Conclusions and Proposals    1. The Republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the Chernobyl  disaster. To assess the scales of the disaster for the republic,  the following data should be presented:    more than two thirds of the radionuclides discharged from  the  fourth unit at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant fell on  Belarus, and one fifth of the territory of the republic was  contaminated with radionuclides;    the population residing on territory with density of  contamination by cesium-137 of more than 137 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]  in the republic numbers 2,105,400 (including more than 400,000  children) in 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities;    more than 100,000 people have been resettled from  contaminated regions of the republic: in 1992, residents were  resettled from all centers of population in regions with  contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; more  than 30,000 children reside on territory with density of  contamination by cesium-137 of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/];    the damage inflicted by the Chernobyl disaster on the  Republic of Belarus, which does not have a single nuclear  electric power plant, is expressed by sixteen annual budgets of  the republic;    in the post-accident period, incidence of thyroid cancer  among children increased by a factor of seven over the republic,  and by a factor of 22 in Gomelskaya Oblast;    in zones of radioactive contamination of 17 regions of  Mogilevskaya and Gomelskaya Oblasts, for three years after the  accident the frequency of congenital defects of development in  close follow-up nearly doubled in comparison with the period  preceding the accident;    cytogenetic studies have shown that pregnant women (and  fetuses) from the southern regions of Gomelskaya and  Mogilevskaya Oblasts received doses of radiation that increase  the overall level of spontaneous mutations of chromosomes by a  factor of 1.5-2, and the number of dicentric and ring  chromosomes in some mother-fetus pairs increased by a factor of  4-10;    an absorbed dose of 400 cGy or more is considered a  considerable risk factor of laboratory hypothyroidism and  autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland among children;    significant prevalence of dyspancreatism syndrome has been  established among children with level of incorporation of  cesium-137 of more than 0.3 Ci/organism;    children residing on contaminated territories show greater  frequency (compared with the control) of persistent asthenic  states (by a factor of 2), hypochondriac syndrome (by a factor  of 4.6), phobic syndrome (by a factor of 2.3) and so on;    among children and adolescents residing on contaminated  territories, especially under conditions of elevated  incorporation of cesium-137, there is an increase in disorders  of the digestive system. For example, the occurrence of chronic  gastritides and gastroduodenitises among children and  adolescents in 1990 in these regions reached 171-297% (in  the  control--125-153%);    the level of recorded primary incidence of circulatory  system  disorders (CSD) in 1990 increased by comparison with 1985 by a  factor of 3.5 over Gomelskaya Oblast, and by a factor of 2.5  over Mogilevskaya Oblast.    2. The republic program for alleviating consequences of the  Chernobyl disaster for 1993-1995 and ahead to the year 2000 must  take as a priority direction the production of clean food  products, implementation of the concept of safe habitation of  people on radionuclide-contaminated territories.    3. Contamination in the Republic of Belarus covers 45,600  km[.sup]2[/] or 23 percent of the territory of the republic,  more than 1,866,000 ha of arable land, of which 106,000 ha was  removed from agricultural use in the first year following the  disaster; in 1986-1989, a total of 256,700 of arable land was  taken out of circulation. In 1990 alone, lands wiht Cesium-137  contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] were  eliminated from agricultural use, and finally, volumes of  deliveries of meat and milk from these regions were reduced.    4. Research has shown that in the zone of contamination by  radiocesium of up to 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and by strontium-90  of up to 11.1 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], all kinds of agricultural  operations can be carried out by conventional technologies on  arable lands. Forage with contamination density from 37 to 555  kBq/m[.sup]2[/] is resown to grass. Radioactive contamination  of territory by cesium-137 with density of more than 555  kBq/m[.sup]2[/] makes stock raising unfeasible for practical  purposes in this zone.    5. Standards have been set for the content of radioactive  substances in agricultural raw material for producing goods  corresponding to RKU-90 standards. Fodders should contain 5 x  10[.sup]-8[/] - 1 x 10[.sup]- 8[/] Ci/kg.    6. In 1991-1992, the radiological services of the Ministries  of Agriculture, Forestry, and Public Health significantly  renovated their inventories of radiometric instruments for  cesium-137 monitoring; the instruments have high sensitivity  that allows monitoring to be done in accordance with standards  RKU-90. Complete retooling in these enterprises requires  delivery of more than 2000 new gamma-radiometers of Vityaz,  Belrad, Aliot and RUP 01P6 type.    7. The level of admissible content of radionuclides  according  to RKU-90 in food products, and the specificity of the diet of  food products for those living in Belarus are such that the  possible annual dose burden may amount to 0.17-0.18 rem/yr. And  milk, baked goods, potatoes and meat comprise more than 70  percent of the accumulation of radionuclides in the organism.  There is an acute need for 2-3 times more stringent radionuclide  control levels with respect to grain, potatoes and milk.    8. Food products can be checked for strontium-90 and  plutonium-239 content only by a radiochemical method (10-14 days  for one measurement). Experimental models of beta-radiometers  have been developed for instrumental determination of  strontium-90 within a few hours (strontium-90 in soil of 20  Bq/kg within 3-4 hours). Experimental models of alpha  radiometers are being developed for instrumental determination  of plutonium-239.    9. The law of the Republic of Belarus "On the Status of  Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as a Result  of the Chernobyl Disaster" (Article 40) acknowledges the  advisability of setting up local centers (LC) for radiation  monitoring (RM) of food products for the populace. According to  a resolution and with the financial support of the State  Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of the  Aftermath of the Chernobyl Disaster, 167 local centers for RM  have been set up for rural Soviets in Gomelskaya (65),  Mogilevskaya (42), Brestskaya (26) and Minskaya (14) Oblasts,  and in the city of Minsk (20).    10. The Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which is  the head institute for LCs, is organizing LCs in the republic,  and training capable local rural residents in radiation  monitoring. Plans call for instituting more than 600 LCs in  centers of population (generally the central homestead of farms)  where the dose burden of the population exceeds 0.1 rem/yr.    11. Certification of the homesteads of villages and farms,  use of adaptive technologies for agricultural production,  compilation of maps of isotopic contamination of food products  and development of regulations for safe production activity and  habitation will enable protection of the health of the populace  in regions hit by the Chernobyl disaster.    12. The operation of local centers in Brestskaya and  Gomelskaya Oblasts has revealed considerable contamination of  food products in centers of population of Belorussian Polesye,  especially milk, cranberries and wild fruit at contamination  density of less than 37 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Clean milk cannot be  produced even at a contamination density by cesium- 137 of  18.5-25.9 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Haste must be made in cultivating  and improving natural grasslands, and respecialization of  agricultural enterprises.    13. Laws of the Belarus Republic "On Social Protection of  Citizens Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster" and "On the Legal  Status of Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as  a Result of the Chernobyl Disaster," the first legislative acts,  are running up against considerable financial difficulties in  their implementation; assistance of republics of the former USSR  has practically stopped, especially in convalescence of more  than 580,000 children.    Considering the limited capabilities of Belarus in  sanatorium  and health resort facilities for convalescence of children  (70,000 a year), an immediate task is to set up a  sanitorium-convalescence base in the republic for  300,000-500,000 children. Priority and long-term plans should  include setting up children's year-round  sanitorium-convalescence centers in clean regions of Belarus  with incorporation of foreign investments, offering tax  privileges for such centers and their founders.    14. In connection with the scarcity of reliable data in  world  science about the effect of low doses of radiation andthe  no-threshold effect of radiation on man, and passage of new  recommendations by the International Commission on Radiation  Protection in November 1990 with appreciably lower limits of  radiation doses for professionals of less than 20 mSv per year  (formerly 50 mSv per year) and for the populace of less than 1  mSv per year (formerly 5 mSv per year), particular attention in  the republic must be given to minimizing the collective dose of  irradiation, more precisely determining the effect of low doses  of irradiation on healthy populations, especially for  radiosensitive critical groups (a list of 34 illnesses is given  in NRB-76/87), and working out effective measures for the  population on territories with contamination density of not only  555-1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and 185- 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], but  also with contamination density of 37-185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/],  where the effective equivalent dose exceeds 1 mSv per year.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries prominently marked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ATF has received a petition from Mr. Charles A. Carpy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation Committee, proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish a new viticultural area in Napa County,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appellation Committee is composed of various vineyard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winery owners located throughout the St. Helena area. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed St. Helena viticultural area is located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16 miles northwest of the city of Napa. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located totally within the larger and previously established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Napa Valley viticultural area. As stated in the petition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the St. Helena viticultural area covers approximately 9,060  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acres, and is densely planted to vines. There are over 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wineries within the area. The petition provides the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following information as evidence that the proposed area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the regulatory requirements discussed previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Charles Sullivan, Napa Valley historian, has provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the petitioner with most of the historical information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the St. Helena area that is covered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition whereas Dr. Deborah Elliott-Fisk of the University  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of California has provided the petitioner with most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the petition concerning soils, geology and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical geography of the St. Helena area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence That Viticultural Area Name Is Widely Known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Data prepared by Mr. Sullivan in support of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition provides the following historical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   The town of St. Helena was founded by Henry Still, who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bought land from the Edward Bale family in 1855. By 1858  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there was a school house and a little Baptist church. Four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years later Professor William Brewer of the Whitney party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called it a ``pretty little village with fifty or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> houses *&blank;*&blank;* nestled among grand old oaks.'' Early winemakers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the St. Helena area included Charles Krug and George Belden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crane. At the end of the 1879 vintage the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> San Francisco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Post <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ran an article on northern California wines which noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flavor characteristics of Napa clarets. This article  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was copied by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> St. Helena Star  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which predicted that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be 2,000 acres of grapes planted in the Napa Valley in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1880. According to Mr. Sullivan, the final total was closer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 3,000, and concentrated in the St. Helena area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   As early as 1869, San Francisco's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alta California <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making reference to a ``St. Helena district,'' as did the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pacific Rural Press. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These were references to vineyard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plantings in the area. In 1872 the Napa Reporter made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the boom in vineyard land around St. Helena.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alta California  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ran an article on the area in 1878,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating St. Helena as a specific district with a great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reputation. By then Charles Krug, the Beringers, Crane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> John Lewelling, H. A. Pellet, and 14 other producers had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> built cellars in the St. Helena area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   In 1875 Krug and Pellet organized the producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growers in the district, a move that culminated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formation of the St. Helena Viticultural Club on January 22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1876. According to Mr. Sullivan, others outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> district could join, but it was a local St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization. In 1880 the Club constructed Vintners Hall, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two story building with a reading room, meeting rooms, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> social hall upstairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   Mr. Sullivan states that by the end of the 1870s there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was no question concerning Napa's special reputation as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winegrowing region, or about St. Helena's as a discrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> district in that region. As support for this statement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Sullivan cites the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alta California  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which concluded in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> article published in 1880 that ``Napa is now the leading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wine-growing county of California, and *&blank;*&blank;* St. Helena has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become the center of the most prosperous wine district in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   According to Mr. Sullivan, by the turn of the century  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Napa prices were still higher than those of other districts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the special position accorded St. Helena wines had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ceased to exist. The popular image of the wines of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oakville, Rutherford, Larkmead, and Howell Mountain had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ended the perception of St. Helena wines standing above all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others. After Prohibition, the regional association of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leading Napa Valley producers was far from foremost in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers' minds and in the minds of wine writers according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Mr. Sullivan. However, Mr. Sullivan states that more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently there has been a tendency for wine writers to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the St. Helena ``district'' and to its wines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly to its Cabernet Sauvignons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   In addition to the historical name information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned above, the ``St. Helena'' name appears on a U.S.G.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.5 minute series map entitled ``St. Helena Quadrangle'' which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the city of St. Helena and much of its surrounding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Which bank do you say 'yes' to? - How to . . . pick a current account / Why customers can afford to be choosy THERE was a time when you did not have much choice of bank accounts. But competition now means there is a wide range of them, with different rates and charges. Most offer similar services: free banking if you are in credit, interest-bearing current accounts, cheque guarantee and credit cards, and cashpoints. But there is a tendency for those banks that offer better interest rates to charge more if you overdraw. This could have a large bearing on the current account you choose. So, how do you go about choosing an account? Here are some points to consider:IN CREDIT? Mr Black has a monthly salary of Pounds 1,500 paid into his account every month. He has a series of standing orders and direct debits which are paid from the account three working days after his salary is received. He always has savings so there is no need for his current account ever to go into the red. Thus, the overdraft rate that the bank or building society charges does not concern him. He would much rather have a current account which pays good interest and provides the usual services and cards. Almost all banks and building societies give tiered rates of interest, but some offer better returns than others on larger deposits. Best rates on Pounds 1-Pounds 499 can be found on Caledonian Bank's High Interest cheque account, paying 7.5 per cent net, and Beneficial Bank's Classic Visa (6 per cent). But there are no cheque or credit cards with the Caledonian account, although Beneficial runs a Visa account with a cheque book and the Visa card doubles as a Pounds 100 cheque guarantee card. The downside with Beneficial is the paucity of national branches (only 53 in the UK) and the fact that it charges 1.5 per cent on every withdrawal made from a cashpoint subject to a Pounds 1.50 minimum. Mr Black often has Pounds 1,000 or more in his account, so he wants good rates on higher deposits. Cater Allen offers 6.75 per cent net on Pounds 1,000 but does not have a cash or cheque guarantee card and will not pay interest if the account falls below that amount. Robert Fleming/Save and Prosper's Classic account pays 5.25 per cent net on Pounds 1,000; Bank of Scotland's Banksave Plus account (requiring a minimum Pounds 500 deposit, which can drop to Pounds 1) offers 4.5 per cent; Northern Rock's current account, 3.77 per cent (this also requires an opening deposit of Pounds 500); Britannia BS's React 365, 4.33 per cent; and Firstdirect Cheque, 3.56 per cent. On larger amounts - for example, Pounds 2,500 - Moneyfacts, the monthly newsletter, suggests the Chelsea Classic account paying 7.13 per cent net; the Portman Prestige Cheque account, 6.38 per cent; Caledonian, with 7.5 per cent on all balances above Pounds 1; and UDT, with an interest rate of 7.43 per cent on deposits of Pounds 1,000 and over. UDT requires minimum withdrawals of Pounds 200 and has no cash or cheque card. The Chelsea Classic requires an opening deposit of Pounds 2,500 and pays 1.68 per cent net on amounts below this. Mr Black would need Pounds 1,000 to open its Capital account and, again, Chelsea would pay only 1.68 per cent on smaller deposits. OVERDRAWN? Some of these accounts would be no good at all to Mr White - the downside of the ones cited by Moneyfacts is that they do not have an overdraft facility. Since Mr White errs occasionally on the wrong side of credit, he sometimes needs to negotiate an overdraft of more than a couple of hundred pounds. Moneyfacts recommends Firstdirect for having one of the best overdraft facilities on the market - Mr White would be allowed an automatic interest-free facility of Pounds 250. If he needed more, the rate would be 20.7 per cent APR and an annual arrangement fee of 1 per cent, subject to a minimum of Pounds 15. The Co-operative Bank's Ultra account allows Mr White to become overdrawn by Pounds 250 for three days; Lloyds Bank has an automatic overdraft of Pounds 100; National Westminster Bank would let him be overdrawn by Pounds 50 before imposing charges; and Girobank's Keyway would give him Pounds 20 leeway (you have to deposit Pounds 400 a month into this account, though) as would Northern Bank. Britannia might waive charges on a Pounds 250 overdraft for three days at the manager's discretion. Mr White would be extremely foolish not to negotiate an overdraft facility for amounts greater than these. Unauthorised overdraft rates are usually at least 10 percentage points higher than rates already agreed with the bank - Firstdirect has one of the most draconian. The Investors Chronicle calculated recently which banks or building societies offered the best deal for someone who was usually in credit but overdrew for short periods. The example is of a basic-rate taxpayer who normally maintains about Pounds 500 but goes into the red without authorisation by Pounds 300 for two weeks at Christmas and by Pounds 80 for two weeks in July (during the sales). He would still be left with a net credit in his current account if he banked with Abbey National; Nationwide; Royal Bank of Scotland's interest-paying current account; Robert Fleming/Save and Prosper; and Woolwich. He would be Pounds 25 worse off at Bank of Scotland's Banksave Plus; Barclays Interest and Flexible; Britannia BS; Co-operative Bank; Firstdirect; Girobank Keyway; Halifax; Lloyds Classic; Midland's Orchard; and Northern Rock BS. Mr White would have to pay between Pounds 25-Pounds 50 with Bank of Scotland's Chequeplus account; Girobank's Current; Royal Bank of Scotland's Personal Current; TSB's Cheque and Interest Cheque; and Yorkshire Bank's Paymaster Plus. But the costs mount to Pounds 50 or more at AIB; Bank of Scotland Current; Lloyds Gold; Midland Current and Meridian; NatWest Current and Current-plus; Norwich &amp; Peterborough; and Yorkshire Bank's Paymaster. It is the fees and transaction charges which hurt the most. Mr White is likely to end up paying more in overdraft rates and charges to the Big Four banks which, unlike the largest building societies and Abbey National, charge a standard overdraft fee. The overdraft fees at Barclays and Lloyds are Pounds 8 a month, Pounds 5 at Midland and Pounds 20 a quarter at National Westminster compared with nothing at the Halifax, Abbey National, Nationwide and Woolwich. NatWest charges Pounds 20 for an overdraft letter while Abbey National, Nationwide and Woolwich do not (surprisingly, for a Big Four bank, Barclays does not charge for this but Halifax BS charges Pounds 10). Mr White should, therefore, avoid accounts with overdraft fees and high overdraft service charges by finding out which institution charges what and how often. EASE OF ACCESS Once you know whether you are a Mr Black or a Mr White, the fine-tuning can begin. The points for which to look out are: Accessibility. Must you have a branch near you? Girobank, which is available in every post office, has the advantage here as do the larger banks and building societies which maintain a presence on every high street. But those with a regional bias usually have reciprocal arrangements with other banks and building societies or are part of a national electronic network of cash machines such as LINK. Check however, to see if there are transaction charges. Home banking. Do you really need to go into a branch? Firstdirect, Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper and NatWest's Primeline are all telephone banking services that operate independently of a branch network. Customers of these accounts appear very happy with them but telephone bills are a potential expense. Plastic cards. The Pounds 50 limit on a cheque guarantee card was set in 1977 and has not been re-valued to keep pace with inflation. However, some banks and building societies offer cards up to Pounds 250 (see table). Other useful plastic includes credit cards and a direct debit facility, which usually is linked to the guarantee card. Many of the building societies do not issue credit cards, which might be a big drawback for some potential customers. Sending money abroad. If you need to do this regularly, check the expense and the ease of transfers. Some banks or building societies stipulate large minimum sums. Which?, the Consumers' Association's monthly magazine, points out that Girobank account-holders can transfer money free of charge to overseas Giro accounts, while customers with the Bank of Scotland can use the low-cost 'TAPS' payment system. On the high street, Which? found that NatWest was the cheapest and Abbey National the most expensive for sending FFr1,000 to France.</p>

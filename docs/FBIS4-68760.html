Foreign Minister Juri  Luik made a presentation on behalf of the government. It did not  include any analysis of the previous year. Predecessors were  praised, the Meri-Manitski-Velliste line was proclaimed, and a  promise made to continue along that line. The Foreign Commission  of Riigikogu limited itself to a statistical report of its work.  The greater part of the government coalition was not interested  in the discussion. The government, or rather its foreign  ministry, was represented by only a few people. The independent  media was enthusiastic about the minister's presentation. The  session hall of Riigikogu was aglow, if not sold off, in a  glitter of pretense.  <H5>  We Lost Time in 1993 </H5>   Estonia's foreign policy was not as successful as it was  made  out to be. We have lost time and missed out on international  initiative. Actions taken have not always been sensible, nor  have they been to the benefit of Estonia alone. We were too  yielding, perhaps, to the wishes of super-states. We have given  too much leeway to international organizations to dictate to us.  The foreign politicians and officials visiting Estonia dispelled  our vigilance, when they tapped us on the shoulder for human  rights. Thus, we let United Nations stick us with an  uncomfortable resolution regarding human rights. Now it is not  quite clear whether we are violating it or not.    The priorities and the orientation of our foreign policy  have  also remained unclear. Out of Estonia's political elite, every  person has his or her own vision of what state or what  organization we should be dealing with. We didn't quite  understand it ourselves, who is responsible for foreign policy  in Estonia, or who has the last word. There was a power struggle  between factions. That also irritated Estonia's friends abroad.    We waxed enthusiastic about international organizations. The  rules of the game for UN, NATO, the European Union, CSCE and  GATT were obviously not too well understood. We did not quite  know the balance of power in UN and CSCE, which is controlled by  Russia. For us, CSCE is a meaningless organization altogether,  because it was created by the Soviet Union to further its  imperialistic aims. Russia is very comfortable there. After all,  representatives of CSCE have been promoting Russia's cause in  Estonia quite unashamedly, gotten involved in our internal  affairs, and fanned up international tensions in Narva. You can  still remember what happened with the laws on aliens and local  elections.    I watch with trepidation, how the theoreticians and  practitioners of our foreign policy adopt the theories of CSCE  emmissaries on integrating aliens into Estonian society. This is  both dangerous and harmful. Such integration will subject us to  the control of a stronger nation, ruin our culture, make us into  a biligual country, dilute our pragmatic attitude to life, and  reduce the necessary immunity to resist harmful foreign  political influences.  <H5>  Timidity About Russia </H5>   During 1993, we have made many concessions harmful to the  state of Estonia in the course of our dealings with our eastern  neighbors. They had their way in fixing our sea borders. They  have skilfully managed to delay removing troops and military  pensioners from Estonia. They have been able to tell the world  at large, without any protest from us, whatever they please  about Estonia. They are about to get their way with the  connecting regions treaty that is very harmful to Estonia's  state security. They got voting rights for their legal and  illegal citizens to participate in our local elections. They  want to turn Estonia into an officially bilingual state. Their  efforts toward changing the language law are continuing. They  want Estonian citizenship for all of their people. This has  already encouraged our governing officials to think about toning  down the citizenship law. They have already obtained the right  to apply for a residency permit for a portion of their military  pensioners. They are not interested in economic cooperation.  They are asking for greater political concessions, instead.    With the tacit approval of the Western states, Russia has  taken us into its sphere of influence. No protest. Velliste's  foreign ministry explained that there was no need to react to  anti-Estonian statements made by Russian politicians. That was  supposed to increase the sympathy level toward us. However,  Russia kept hammering away, but no sympathy was forthcoming. The  government kept assuring us that the Western states and NATO  would not leave us in trouble. How big would that trouble have  to be? The government consoled us that there was no need to  worry about the limited contingent of Russian troops in Estonia.  They were supposed to shrink anyway, and not be dangerous at  all. We were beginning to believe. Now we are told that they  cannot leave because of cold weather. Up until August 30, we  will go on believing that they will be gone by August 31. Just  as the government wanted us to believe in their departure by the  end of 1992, and then again by the end of 1993.  <H5>  The Foreign Commission of Riigikogu </H5>   made repeated attempts during 1993 to encourage the foreign  ministry to action that would be geared more to the interests of  Estonia. Repeatedly, there has been talk of the conservative  activity of our UN delegation, of the liberal stance of our  negotiations with Russia, and of our lack of progress in setting  up visa-free travel with other countries. The foreign commission  asked why Canadian citizens can come to Estonia without a visa,  while our citizens must pay 500 kroons for a visa. The need to  set up rotation within our foreign delegations was pointed out  to the foreign ministry. There have been detailed explanations  of reasons why it would benefit our state to have the foreign  ministry initiate a wide-ranging propaganda campaign to explain  our positions. Members of the foreign commission recommended  that the foreign ministry protest against the anti-Estonian  statements made by the Russian politicians, and other acts  harmful to the state committed within Estonia's territory by the  "political tourists" from CSCE.    Riigikogu and its foreign commission had to take the  initiative, because motivating the government did not bear  fruit. Now, the international public is aware of Riigikogu's  position on the growth of imperialistic tendencies in Russia'a  foreign policy. And also of the position of the foreign  commission on negotiations being held with Russia and the  presence of Russian troops in Estonia. Riigikogu has turned to  parliaments and governments of the world asking them to  influence Russia that it, as the legal successor to the Soviet  Union, would acknowledge the occupation and annexation of  Estonia. But even these undertakings had their opposition. Why  irritate Russia? There have been quite a few members of the  foreign commission and of Riigikogu who cannot stop their  endless editing, which keeps putting off the passing of the  resolution.    Riigikogu's involvement in foreign policy issues seems to be  paying off. The harsh statements made by Russia's politicians  and members of the government have diminished in number. On  February 20, Ostankino's [Russia's major network] News program  referred to Riigikogu's statement about the precipitation of  Russia's imperialistic tendencies. It was done with a touch of  annoyance, but containedly. Russia does not respect neighbors  who are whining, subservient or without opinions of their own.  <H5>  Foreign Ministry Like a Sailor's Wife </H5>   The busy staff of the foreign ministry spent the year of  1993  either expecting or sending off its minister. The `flying  minister' spent almost half of his work-year abroad explaining,  at press conferences, that Estonia is regarded everywhere with  benevolence and respect. We are being supported, we have  learned. Last fall, however, when this support was needed at UN,  we didn't get it because our `friends' threatened to walk out on  the meeting. That was the way it was explained to us to justify  the failed maneuvers in the matter of the human rights  resolution relating to Estonia and Latvia. We found out that  abstaining from the vote was a diplomatic coup and a concession  to Latvia. We were told that the two Baltic states would be left  at the mercy of the African countries, who would be happy to  support Russia. Our `flying minister' had not yet gotten through  to the African tribes.    Now, one can always come back to the human rights problem.  At  Russia's insistence (or proposal), UN has even appointed a  special counsel to the executive secretary for that purpose. We  are wrapped up tightly with Latvia now. That is why we also have  to share some other issues. Like that of the Skrunda radar  station. I don't think that giving Russia the station is an  internal matter for Latvia. This sly maneuver is as hazardous to  their security as it is to ours.    The staff at the foreign ministry is different from those  found at other state offices. It includes many individuals whose  thinking has evolved in other parts of the world. The  rank-and-file Estonians often find it hard to share some  high-ranking official's understanding of Estonia's situation,  its relations with its neighbors, and its tactics for handling  foreign relations. I can well understand how convictions that  have been implanted in people in some distant motherland, can be  different from those held in our native country here. Prominent  figures from the other side of the Atlantic may think that  Estonia should be yielding, accommodating and considerate of the  complicated political and economic situation of our great  neighbor. For that we should keep our state egotism at bay. One  can assume that this is the order of the day in the minds of  many ministry officials from some foreign land and that it  becomes part of the policy being pursued. I sincerely hope I am  wrong, although this is what we are seeing.    I want to reiterate here to the columnist from HOMMIKULEHT  (see HL April 18, 1993) that I was not `making faces' from the  podium of Riigikogu and `believed sincerely' that the chief of  foreign ministry's political department stated the momentary  stance of some North-American country, maybe also that of the  exile-Estonian leaders at the foreign ministry, to keep Estonia  from approaching NATO. This young official reacted to  Lithuania's desire to join NATO quite clearly: 1. it can cause a  counter-reaction in the West; 2. it is not realistic; 3. we  should wait to be invited. No commentary has been forthcoming.    Riigikogu has difficulty understanding the Estonian language  of the foreign ministry. Riigikogu received some documents that  have caused anxiety. Like ratification of the famous  `buttonhole', `sidecar' or the Baltic states economic  cooperation law. Riigikogu has accommodated the foreign ministry  to the maximum, and even violated its own procedures to get the  matter settled fast. I am not complaining that the foreign  ministry exerted a certain pressure on Riigikogu. We were even  being lobbied by some of Estonia's outstanding industrial  leaders. We believed their argument that unless this document is  ratified during 1993, the Estonian industry will collapse.  Nothing tragic happened, however, because the law is still not  in effect. It would be nice to have less panic in the work of  the foreign ministry in the future.  <H5>  Situation Is Far From Hopeless, </H5>   even though we cannot give a satisfactory rating for the  foreign policy of 1993. That part of the foreign minister's  presentation at Riigikogu that deals with visions for the future  of our foreign policy is quite factual. It seems that the  orientation for foreign policy that has been quite confusing up  until now, is beginning to take shape. Providing a logical  direction for staff activity at the foreign ministry is also  essential. The current staff needs a good airing out. Other  countries have been imposing too much of their will and their  ideology on us.    The idealization of leading Western countries is bound to  come to an end soon, as we start looking for allies among such  countries that can sense the danger emanating from Russia on  their own skin. Those who don't sense that danger get out from  under every time an important resolution needs to be passed.  They simply do not wish to spoil their relations with Russia for  some small Baltic state.    It's a good thing that the foreign minister spoke seriously  about the need for close cooperation in the Baltic region. Such  cooperation was hard to come by in 1993. A few visits or  meetings between high ranking officials do not necessarily  signify profound and coordinated relations. Due to our reserved  stance toward countries with leftist governments, cooperation  between the Baltic states was hampered because of Lithuania.  Listening to Juri Luik, one is likely to get the  impression  that we will also be seeking contact with such CIS countries,  who would be our allies in the fight against imperialism.    So, what if a theoretical course is taken for joining up  with  NATO and the European Union. For the time being, it will amount  to nothing more than taking a political stance. But even that is  something. I fear, though, that CSCE is an organization that is  completely hollow and harmful to us, in addition to being a  waste of time and money. The Western states we get our  orientation from do not take this artificial organization  seriously. This, too, affords an opportunity to demonstrate our  attitude.    There are problems with the UN. The latter is influenced  largely by Russia and its satellites. We should have a strong  delegation in New York who could stand up, at least to some  degree, to the experienced diplomacy of Russia. It would be a  shame if the presently known plans for restructuring our UN  delegation were to be carried out.    I fully agree with the expert opinion of HOMMIKULEHT,  maintaining that foreign policy be left to the professionals.  And therein lies the problem. It will take some time to turn  amateurs into professionals who are capable of analysis and  interaction. Right now, it's more like the twin games of the  north: there are those who jump well, and others who ski  splendidly. Winners would be those who can not only jump far,  but also ski fast.</p>

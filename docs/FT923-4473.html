			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Council to end national bargaining for some BUCKINGHAMSHIRE County Council is to take 480 manual workers in its direct service organisation out of national collective pay bargaining arrangements in a move which will lead to pay cuts for some, Michael Smith writes. Although other councils have varied terms for small groups of manual workers, the move to implement a local pay deal for all workers in a DSO is unusual. The county implemented a local deal for another 800 or so workers in the DSO earlier this year. Not all DSO employees will suffer, and the overall pay bill will remain steady. For example in the landscape gardening department 26 will receive pay rises, against 12 who will lose. The rates will take effect from October 1 and be reviewed next year. The council has reached agreement with Nalgo, the public-services union, but not with Nupe, the other union involved.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: TT lifts bid for Magnetic from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 9.2m TT Group, the industrial holding company, has increased its hostile bid for Magnetic Materials Group, the USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 9.2m, writes Jane Fuller. This followed TT's purchase yesterday of a further 7.4 per cent stake at 50p per share, against the original offer price of 37p. TT now controls 24.8 per cent of its target. MMG's share price has risen 10p to 51p since the first offer was announced on April 17. TT said the new offer represented a historic p/e of 13.4, but MMG said the price still did not reflect the underlying value of its niche businesses, which supply long-term growth sectors - telecommunications, aerospace, automotive and instrumentation. It also stressed its gearing of 14.4 per cent on net debt of Pounds 1.6m at the June year-end, and the net asset value of 61.8p.</p>

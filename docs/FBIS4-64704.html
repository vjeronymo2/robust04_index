			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Bulletin" column by Derya Sazak: "Inelegant </F> Dealings"]    [Text] An early evening at the residence ... Tansu Ciller  is quietly listening to the former minister whom she has not  seen for quite some time:    "We cannot hold the group together if you do not let go of  the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party] and form a coalition  with ANAP [Motherland Party]. It is uncertain where the  dissolution within the TPP [True Path Party] will lead. I am  afraid the intervening forces will take power if we do not do  anything.    The prime minister breaks the silence when the conversation  is directed to speculation regarding the army:    Ciller's reaction is: "Actually problems will arise if I  go."    It is interesting... Before the 27 March elections, Mrs.  Ciller who said "If we fail the PP [Prosperity Party] will come  to power," is trying to communicate the message that the General  Staff's Office will not be pleased with the political void that  will emerge when she "withdraws" as a result of the pressure on  her which is the inevitable result of the economic crisis.    Actually, Turkish politics have been led in the wrong  direction in recent weeks. Impossible scenarios are envisaged.  What is dramatic is that there are democratic writers who talk  about an "elegant" 12 March model [an ultimatum from the  military and the formation of a nonpartisan government] in their  columns and define as "encouraging" those developments which  will open the parliament to outside intervention.    As if today Turkey is governed by a government which does  not  enjoy the confidence of the Assembly! As if soldiers are at the  door!... As if the sound of marching troops is heard again and a  situation exists where a coalition has to be formed hastily with  ANAP instead of the SDPP. As if the army submitted or will  submit a memorandum! No. A situation which necessitates a  takeover by the army is not existent in the country today. And  it will not exist tomorrow. Because a new government will  emerge from within the parliament if Ciller fails. There are no  other alternatives in democracies. Paving the way for a  military intervention by conducting searches for an "elegant"  nonpartisan approach will mean hindering Turkey from moving in  the same circles as first rate democratic countries, downgrading  it.    Unfortunately, the "intervention" theses of civilians  confuse  everybody from the businessman to the parliamentarian, from  former ministers to the prime minister. Afterward, there are  mindless people presenting their formula of "nonpartisan interim  government."    Unquestionably, there are lots of scenarios discussed in  Ankara. However, aren't we overthrowing the democratic regime,  which we believe in and defend, by discussing these alternatives  and exaggerating our estimates of their feasibility?    Whereas, it is possible to point to the failures and  successes, without confusing the people. This is the  responsibility that falls on the press and on the enlightened  people of the country.    Looking at the current political upheaval in our country it  is possible to envision the following scenarios:  <H5>  Government Without Ciller </H5>   Overthrowing the TPP-SDPP coalition without one of them  withdrawing on its own can be achieved only by a referendum.  226 votes are needed for a referendum. The present coalition  cannot be overthrown without these 226 votes. The government  falls only if the SDPP withdraws from the coalition or Ciller  resigns. As long as Mrs. Ciller is the TPP's leader,  transferring the premiership depends on her own will.  Otherwise, the way to an "extraordinary congress" is barred to  her in view of the TPP regulations regarding changing prime  ministers.  <H5>  ANAP-TPP Coalition </H5>   Yilmaz states that he is ready for all coalition  alternatives  and is proposing a government without Ciller. It is assumed  that if Mrs. Ciller is out of the coalition then she will  certainly not continue to be the leader of TPP. Ciller, in  turn, knowing that the ANAP-TPP coalition will oust her, is  trying to perpetuate the SDPP coalition as long as she can. One  of the preliminary conditions for an ANAP-TPP coalition is the  dissolution of the present government.  <H5>  Saracoglu's Technocrats </H5>   Former Central Bank director Rusdu Saracoglu comes to mind  first. When Saracoglu's name was uttered at a Young  Businessmen's Association meeting with the participation of  General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, the "rating" of  the technocrat model increased. Although Saracoglu denies these  speculations, as a precaution, his dossier is being blown out of  proportion.  <H5>  Ekrem Ceyhun Incident </H5>   Ceyhun's pretense at playing the role of an impartial prime  minister, at a time when he has completely withdrawn from  politics, by writing reports on how to save the country may be  the outcome of Cankaya's "half premiership" calculations.  Seeing the "capabilities" of the present cadre, Demirel may be  thinking "let Tansu withdraw and I will govern the country."  Or, Mesut Yilmaz may have thought of Ekrem Ceyhun as a fitting  prime minister in case a coalition is formed with the TPP.  <H5>  Ecevit Model </H5>   Also under discussion is a coalition that will be formed by  Democratic Left Party leader Ecevit with the big groups in the  Assembly. Cindoruk's indecision and Ecevit's vision of  mastering foreign and national policies contributes to his name  being put forward as prime minister both by ANAP and by groups  in the parliament with common sense.    Yes, it becomes more difficult to reach a solution when  there  are so many alternatives. When thinking of overthrowing Ciller,  some people tend to think about undemocratic solutions. Mrs.  Ciller will go one day, but it will take us years to reestablish  democracy if we end up dissolving the parliament in our search  for an "elegant" interim regime. We have watched this movie  before. We cannot bear to go through it once more.    In the 21st century, it will be a shame to live in a Turkey  where the government will pass from hand to hand with coups  d'etat.</p>

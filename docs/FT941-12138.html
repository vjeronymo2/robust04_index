			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Verbiage and capital losses clause should be thrown out Sir, Mr John Newman (Letters, January 19) asks whether only he is disillusioned at how the government has ignored the need for fair legislation, simply expressed. I am more than disillusioned not only by the government ignoring completely your excellent leading article of December 13 on the removal of indexation on capital losses ('Trickery with capital gains'), but also by the way the one-phrase comment on this subject in the chancellor's Budget speech has been turned into almost four pages of incomprehensible verbiage in the Finance Bill. Let us hope that the House of Commons will take a first step in the direction desired by Mr Newman by throwing out this clause and its effectively retrospective impact.

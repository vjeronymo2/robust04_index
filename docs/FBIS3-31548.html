			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to the Public Relations Office of the  UNPROFOR Command in Zagreb, today's scheduled meeting between  the Croat Defense Council [HVO] Commander, General Ante Roso,  and the commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, General Rasim  Delic will not take place. A spokesman for UNPROFOR could not  reveal the reasons behind the postponement of their meeting.    Croatian sources assume that Gen Delic has encountered some  difficulties while on his way to Zagreb. The talks between  generals Delic and Roso were arranged during a recent round of  the Geneva negotiations between Croat Minister for Foreign  Affairs Mate Granic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime minister Haris  Silajdzic. They reconfirmed this arrangement when they met in  Frankfurt last Saturday.    Yesterday, following their meeting with UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi at the UNPROFOR  Headquarters in Zagreb, HVO generals Ante Roso and Milivoj  Petkovic said that they would hold talks today with Rasim Delic  and that they hoped they would sign an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities.    Speaking about the possibilities of signing an agreement on  the cessation of hostilites, Akashi yesterday said that this  would be an historic moment in the return of peace to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

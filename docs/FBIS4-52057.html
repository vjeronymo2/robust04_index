			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry on 6 May  answered a KCNA reporter's question about the abuses heaped by  the South Korean authorities on our proposal for peace  negotiations contained in the Foreign Ministry statement dated  28 April. He said as follows:    The statement of our Foreign Ministry proposing negotiations  to the U.S. side for the establishment of a new peace assurance  system [pyonghwa pojang chegye] that will replace the present  Korean armistice system has evoked great repercussions upon the  world public. The South Korean authorities, however, are trying  hard to decry [hwebang] it.    The unification and foreign ministers of South Korea made a  fuss, claiming that the establishment of a peace assurance  system is a matter that must be discussed between the North and  the South, not between us and the United States, and that the  proposal is a negotiation card to get concessions at the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    Such remarks by the South Korean authorities are an  obtrusive  and imprudent act of those oblivious of their lot.    The republic's government proposed this time to the United  States that the two countries hold negotiations for the  establishment of a new peace assurance system, taking into  account the legal and practical conditions that the United  States is a signatory to the armistice agreement and it is in  actuality holding the military prerogative in South Korea.    The South Korean authorities categorically opposed the  signing of the Korean armistice agreement at the time of its  conclusion and now have no complete military prerogative in  South Korea, so they have no authority or qualification for  participating in peace negotiations.    The replacement of the Korean armistice agreement with a  peace agreement and the establishment of a new peace assurance  system that will replace the present armistice mechanism are  urgent problems raised by the present situation on the Korean  peninsula.    Such complicated problems as the nuclear issue have cropped  up on the Korean peninsula because the United States shipped  nuclear and other weapons of mass-destruction into South Korea  in violation of the armistice agreement and the tensions are now  mounting because the United States is accelerating an arms  buildup and increasing the military threat to us.    This shows that the present Korean armistice agreement and  armistice mechanism are incapable of preventing arms buildup and  recurrence of war and preserving peace on the Korean peninsula.    To terminate the state of truce that causes only political  distrust and military confrontation and establish a new peace  assurance system at an early date is the only way of easily  solving the pending issues between the DPRK and the United  States including the nuclear issue. A North-South agreement with  nonaggression as its keynote has been adopted and a North-South  joint military committee pursuant to it has been organized. So  the establishment of a new peace assurance system would  facilitate their effectuation and, further, the problem of  preserving a durable peace on the Korean peninsula would be  resolved completely.    In mid-April the South Korean authorities revoked the  exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South  as a precondition for the DPRK-U.S. talks, saying that if the  DPRK-U.S. talks were promoted, replacement of the armistice  agreement with a peace agreement would be put on the agenda and  then the North-South dialogue will go well. But now they blindly  oppose our practical proposal for replacing the armistice  agreement with a peace agreement. This makes it plain that the  South Korean authorities are fickle [pyondok suroun] and have no  clear principle concerning the peace and reunification of the  Korean peninsula and blow hot and cold.    What they are advised to do is to refrain from following a  big power and imprudently poking their nose into others affairs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After a meeting between Defense Minister Edmundo  Perez Yoma and members of the Carabineros high command, it was  officially announced that General Fernando Cordero Rusque has  assumed duties as acting director general of this institution.    This was disclosed after the meeting, when Gen. Cordero  chatted with the media, at times in a harsh tone of voice.    [Begin recording] [Cordero] You have asked me on several  occasions whether or not I think about the matter. The truth is  that I do think about it.    [Unidentified reporter] No, what I meant is what do you  think  about Carabineros officers being charged with unlawful  association for terrorist purposes?    [Cordero] Well, that will be determined by the  investigations.    [Reporter] Yes, but Judge Milton Juica has sentenced several  Carabineros officers for unlawful association for terrorist  purposes.    [Cordero] Yes. The ruling has not been appealed yet. [end  recording]    Later on, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said that the  government is fully satisfied with the solution to this problem.    [Begin recording] [Perez] It is a solution. We always  maintained we thought it unsuitable that General Stange remained  head of the institution while the investigations continued. We  believe the right thing has been done, and greatly appreciate  Gen. Stange's gesture to request the Supreme Court to appoint a  special judge to hear the case. This gives him and the public  guarantees. We are fully satisfied.    [Reporter] Does this mean that the National Security Council  will definitely not be summoned?    [Perez] I think so, definitely. [passage omitted]    It was not stated how long Gen. Stange will be on leave, but  Minister Perez did say he would remain on leave until his legal  situation is resolved.</p>

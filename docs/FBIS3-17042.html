			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Rotar under the "Interlocutor" rubric: </F> Askar Akayev Likes NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and Is Tolerant of  Criticism"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] During our nearly two-hour  conversation, the Kyrgyzstan president managed to shake my  skepticism somewhat about the future of Russians in his country.  Sadly, my interlocutor asked me not to turn on the tape  recorder: "Let it be an unofficial conversation, and you will  write an article after you have traveled around our country."    Yet I managed, not without difficulty, to secure Askar  Akayevich's consent to publish excerpts from our conversation.    Akayev believes that Kyrgyzstan is vitally interested in a  comfortable existence of the Russian ethnic minority not out of  only purely humanist considerations. In its ethnic composition,  Kyrgyzstan differs appreciably from the other Central Asian  states where Slavs account for a relatively small share (some 10  percent) of the country's population. Tranquillity in  Kyrgyzstan rests on a precarious ethnic balance between the  three most numerous peoples of the state: Kyrgyz (nearly 50  percent), Uzbeks (more than 10 percent), Russians and Ukrainians  (nearly 25 percent). In this ethnic "crucible" the Slavic  component fulfills the role of a stabilizer that maintains  relations of harmony between the peoples. A massive outflow of  Slavic people would tip the ethnic balance in the republic, and  the probability of interethnic clashes would grow sharply.  [passage omitted]    The main reason for the Slav emigration is a low living  standard. The Kyrgyz leader thinks that Western countries have  proven in practice totally indifferent to such notions as  democracy and freedom of speech, and prefer to invest money in  countries that bring profit. "We are being helped only by  America and Japan; as for Europe, I do not visit it," Askar  Akayev added with sadness. As for Kyrgyzstan's neighbors, which  have much richer natural resources, they are securing credits  all over the world.    The other important specific feature in the life of  Kyrgyzstan's Slavs is that, unlike their fellow Slavs in the  other Central Asia states, most of them work for defense. With  the disintegration of the Soviet Union, virtually all workers of  the military-industrial complex have been left without a job.  The Kyrgyz president pins great hopes on an understanding with  Boris Yeltsin on creating an investment fund to turn the  enterprises where Slavs work into joint enterprises. "This  would finally provide jobs for our Slavs, and they would not be  leaving for Russia," Askar Akayev said.    Finally, there is the dual-citizenship problem. In the  president's view, it can be only granted to local Slavs and  Germans. The granting of dual citizenship to Uzbeks and Tajiks  would, Askar Akayev thinks, lead to unpredictable consequences.  The Kyrgyz president reminded me that Tajikistan had made  territorial claims on his country not so long ago. If one  grants dual citizenship to Tajiks, who densely populate areas  close to the Tajikistan border, there would actually be no  avoiding a territorial division.    A similar problem also exists in Osh Oblast, with a dense  Uzbek population that borders on Uzbekistan. Askar Akayev  admitted that in Uzbekistan, too, there are certain forces  interested in a revision of borders. A similar problem also  exists in northern Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz president  appreciates Nursultan Nazarbayev's stance very well. Akayev  thinks that the best solution in such situations is bilateral  agreements to guarantee an immediate granting of citizenship  when one changes the country of residence or decides to go back.  Let me note that Kazakhstan Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko,  who visited Moscow last week, came up with almost the same  initiative.    To the "provoking" question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent: "What forces in Uzbekistan are interested in  territorial division when all power in the neighbor state is in  the hands of one person -- Islam Karimov?," Askar Akayev  replied: "Islam Karimov holds a very constructive position, and  we have no differences on this question. However, this problem  has always been there -- both before Karimov, Nazarbayev,  Niyazov, Rakhmonov, Akayev, and their time, and it will remain  after them. We should be very cautious about provoking a  catastrophe."</p>

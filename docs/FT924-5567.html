			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Call to break up generators: Power companies defend gas move NORWEB, THE north of England power company, called yesterday for the break-up of National Power and PowerGen, the two large electricity generators, as it and two other regional electricity companies mounted a robust defence of their diversification into gas-fired generation. The three regional companies, giving evidence to a Commons committee on energy, also supported growing calls for the government to postpone liberalisation of the electricity market from 1994. Southern Electricity said that maintaining the existing levels for competition, where only large customers have a choice of who supplies them, would allow British Coal to secure a five-year contract for 55m tonnes in 1993-94 and 45 tonnes thereafter. That is 15m tonnes a year more than the proposed current contract between British Coal and the generators and could help to keep more than 10 pits open. Norweb's call for a break-up of National Power and PowerGen into five separate companies reflects resentment among the regional companies over generators' pricing policies since privatisation two years ago. Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said his company was concerned that the present structure of the bulk electricity market did not allow sufficient competition, and even after all independent gas-fired power stations were built they would supply only 13 per cent of the market. Mr Harvey said his company suspected that National Power and PowerGen were keeping back 3 per cent, or about Pounds 100m, of the benefits of lower coal prices. He said the same regulatory framework that applied to the regional companies' supply businesses should be applied to the generators. Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern, said independent power plants were the only means to get strong down-ward pressure on generators' prices. Yorkshire Electricity said a larger and more secure franchise (non-competitive market) should not result in higher prices to customers. It said there was obvious scope for monopolistic profits to be made in the absence of generator competition. Yorkshire also suggested a one-year interim contract between British Coal, the generators and the regional companies while regulatory and contractual issues were resolved.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Applicants also propose that the Funds be permitted to impose a CDSC on redemptions of one or more classes of shares that are not subject to a front-end sales load and waive the CDSC in certain instances. The amount of the CDSC and the timing of its imposition may vary. Applicants also propose to impose a CDSC of up to 1% on redemptions that occur within a year of the purchase date of certain classes of shares that are subject to a front-end sales load in cases where the front-end sales load has been waived because the initial purchases of such shares totals $1,000,000 or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to redemptions attributable to increases in the value of an account above the net cost of the investment due to increases in the net asset value per share. No CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired through reinvestment of income dividends or capital gain distributions, or shares purchased a specified period of time prior to the redemptions. In determining whether a CDSC is payable, it will be assumed that shares, or amounts representing shares, that are not subject to a CDSC are redeemed first and that other shares or amounts are then redeemed in the order purchased. No CDSD will be imposed on any shares purchased prior to the effective date of the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Applicants intend to waive the CDSC on redemptions of shares in one or more of the following categories: (a) Following the death or disability (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of a shareholder; (b) representing a minimum required distribution from an IRA or other retirement plan to a shareholder who has reached age 701/2; (c) incurred by current employees of the investment adviser to the Funds, or by current or former directors of the Funds; or (d) resulting from a Fund's right to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the effective minimum account size. Applicants may waive the CDSC in the case of some, but not all, of these categories, provided that the selected waiver categories will be provided on a Fund-wide basis. Applicants' prospectuses will list all available waiver categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class System might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate assets or reserves. The proposed Multi-Class System does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. Nor will the Multi-Class System increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund, since all shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all of a Fund's income and expenses (with the exception of Class Expenses). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants assert that the Multi-Class system will preserve mutuality of risk with respect to all shares of a Fund. Further, since all shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference or priority over any other class in a Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences with respect to particular assets and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account), and the similarities (and, with respect to Class Expenses and associated voting rights, dissimilarities) of the shares will be fully disclosed in the prospectuses for each class of a Fund, investors will not be given misleading impressions as to the safety or risk of the shares and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants also request an exemption from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares and waive the CDSC in certain instances. Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above would be fair, in the public interest and the interest of the shareholders of the Funds, and would be consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

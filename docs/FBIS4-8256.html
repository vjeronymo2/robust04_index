			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The 1st congress of the  Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), after a  stormy discussion, approved the CMKOS news statutes tonight.  Representatives of some small trade unions even walked out of  the negotiating room in protest against the deletion of the  article establishing the Council of Union Chairmen.    The Council comprised 38 chairmen of the individual unions  associated in the Chamber, each having one vote.    On the other hand, the new statutes create a new body -- the  CMKOS Assembly, in which individual unions are represented  proportionately to their memberships. The Assembly is to meet  once in six months.    Representatives of small unions were opposed to the  abolition  of the Council because they are afraid of the numerical strength  of large unions in the Assembly. Representatives of the large  unions, on the other hand, said the Council was not functional.</p>

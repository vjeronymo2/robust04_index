			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Wang Sumei (3076 4790 2734): "Gu Jinchi, </F> secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, conducts  investigations and study in the southern areas of Liaoning  Province"]    [Excerpts] Accompanied by Xu Wencai, standing committee  member and secretary general of the provincial party committee,  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  conducted five-day investigation and study activities in  Haicheng, Wafangdian, Pulandian, and Dalian from 30 March.  After hearing the reports by various cities, districts, towns,  and the provincial department for foreign trade and economic  cooperation and visiting 10-odd production enterprises, markets,  and peasant households, Comrade Gu Jinchi said pleasantly: "The  areas in the southern part of the province have clear targets  for developing agriculture, town and township enterprises, and  the export-oriented economy; early entered the orbit of  sustained, stable, and fast development; and made positive  contributions to and provided extremely good experiences for the  province's economic development." Simultaneously, he made an  important speech on the current economic work, the current  social situation, and party building.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Modernize Agriculture and To Urbanize the </H5> Rural Areas    Comrade Gu Jinchi first stopped in Haicheng, one of the "100  economically powerful counties" in the country. As soon as he  arrived in Haicheng, he did not give a thought to his rest but  asked the leading comrades of Anshan and Haicheng about the  situations. The first question he asked was agricultural  production. He said: "Liaoning is a large industrial province.  Last year, the province reaped a bumper grain harvest and had  grain and vegetables enough and to spare. The central  authorities highly assessed this. On the basis of ensuring  stable growing areas, this year, we should reap another grain,  oil-bearing crop, and cotton harvests. This is a major issue  which we should pay attention to. [passage omitted]  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Combine Various Sectors of the Economy </H5> and To Accelerate the Rejuvenation of the Economy    Inspired by the spring wind of reform over the past years,  the southern areas of the province have rapidly developed  various sectors of the economy, including the individual,  private, and collective ones, persistently with the public  ownership constituting the mainstay. Last year, the total  output value of the town and township enterprises in Haicheng  reached 13.7 billion yuan, and the profits realized by these  enterprises reached 1.4 billion yuan. Town and township  enterprises account for two thirds of the economic sphere.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  To Develop Economy and Trade On a Large Scale, We Should </H5> First Mobilize the Forces of All Fronts    On the morning of 2 April, Comrade Gu Jinchi heard the work  reports of the Dalian city party committee and government and  fully affirmed the work done by the city. He maintained: Last  year, Dalian city made great achievements in its work. The 1994  work ideas and priorities conform to the reality of the city.  He hoped that according to the defined targets, the city will  grasp favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand the scale  of opening up, and further play a leading role in opening the  province to the outside world. [passage omitted]  <H5>  We Should Conscientiously Strengthen Party Building </H5>   Wherever he went, he laid special stress on strengthening  party building. He pointed out: we should pay attention to  accumulating the experiences in bringing into play the party's  role as a political core in the course of developing the  socialist market economy. We should cultivate a group of young  party-member specialized talents; select, according to the  standards for "having ideals, education, morality, and a sense  of discipline," young cadres with both ability and political  integrity; and transfer them to the leading bodies at various  levels. We should persist in the mass line when selecting and  promoting cadres. Some individual leaders select persons  according to their own tastes. So, they often make mistakes.  The leading bodies at various levels should persist in the  principle of democratic centralism, strengthen unity, closely  cooperate with one another, and make concerted efforts to  achieve their work.    Comrade Gu Jinchi said: We should realistically strengthen  the construction of the grass-roots party organizations and pay  attention to recruiting young outstanding party members from the  forefront of production. The party organizations at various  levels should proceed from the new situation and the new tasks  and achieve the construction of ideas, organizations, and work  style. Party-member cadres should take the lead in carrying  forward the fine traditions of the party, establish close  contacts with the masses, be the first to carry out the reform  and open policies and develop the economy, and take the lead in  guiding the masses to seek wealth.</p>

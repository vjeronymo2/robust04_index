As one noteworthy example, he recently decided to  discontinue  subsidies to civil organizations thus far supported by the  government such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement without  consulting beforehand with Chongwadae.    And on Thursday, he made important remarks on the  internationally sensitive North Korean nuclear issue, a  significant departure from his predecessors.    Widely known as a man of principle and conviction, Yi  ordered  Home Minister Choe Hyong-u on Tuesday to stop giving financial  support to the Saemaul Movement, the Association for Just Living  and other civil organizations, and to take steps enabling these  movements to stand on their own feet.    The decision took many in the government by surprise,  because  he announced it without prior consultation with Chongwadae.    President Kim's aides at Chongwadae were unhappy, not only  because they were not consulted in advance but also because they  think it premature for the government to discontinue subsidies  to civil movements.    "Civil movements should, in principle, be self-reliant and  free from the government's influence and of the nature of  volunteer services," he told reporters on Thursday. "When they  use government funds for their programs, they can invite public  distrust and misunderstanding, however good their cause may be,  and this is why I decided to stop supporting them."    One of Yi's aides said, "It's true that he did not discuss  the decision with any Chongwadae officials, but he must have had  sufficient communication with President Kim on this matter."    Yi's way of announcing the decision was unique: He  personally issued an order to Home Minister Choe, unlike his  predecessors who made such announcements at cabinet meetings --  almost without exception.    By giving an order to Choe, known as "a strong man" in the  Kim Yong-sam government due to his long relationship with the  president, Yi made it clear that Choe is but one of the cabinet  members under his control.    All cabinet ministers are "real power," he remarked only  days  after he took office late last year.    In a meeting of related ministers just before the recent  extraordinary parliamentary session, Yi hinted at a plan to  reform government-funded civil movements.    When Home Minister Choe discussed a plan to reduce subsidies  to civil movements gradually over a period of four to five  years, Yi asked, "Is there any need for such a gradual approach?"    Then came his decision to stop handing out government funds  to them once and for all.    On the North Korean nuclear issue, he warned on Thursday  that  the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would not  take place and the suspended South Korea-U.S. military exercise  "Team Spirit" this year would be held if the ongoing  inter-Korean dialogue fails to make any headway.    This was an unexpected and exceptional warning by a premier,  because almost all of Yi's predecessors made it a rule to avoid  commenting on sensitive political and foreign policy issues.    Yi issued the warning at a press conference where he  disclosed the results of a high-level strategic meeting of  unification-related ministers he presided over that morning,  indicating that he has a voice in any matters the government  deals with.    He recently said he would meet the press at least once a  month to make known his views on major problems facing the  government.    One of his aides, who served several premiers before Yi,  said, "He's a premier of the new generation," pointing to two  things that make Yi different from his predecessors.    One is that Yi cares little about the reactions of senior  presidential aides when he makes a policy and the other is that  he asks for an exclusive meeting with President Kim whenever he  considers it necessary.    Premier Yi, as the government's No. 2 man, ought to be that  way in running the administrative branch. But his predecessors  did not act similarly. For instance, one of them asked for the  presidential secretariat's permission when he gave a small  present to each reporter covering his office.    In addition to his weekly meeting with President Kim, Yi  often has special in-depth talks with his boss, according to the  prime minister's close associates.    Thanks to his frequent communication with President Kim and  his firm grip on the cabinet, Yi can fully exercise his power as  No. 2 man.    His grip on the cabinet is based on an ability to keep his  wits about him when pressing tasks facing the government and his  experience as a court judge passing judgement in criminal and  civil cases.    His experience as a judge, which necessitates reading many  case reports, helps him quickly understand many reports  submitted by cabinet ministers and others.    He is particularly good at pinpointing faults in reports and  is rather cold when criticizing his subordinates for making  mistakes.    Recently, Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok felt  Yi's  wrath for an error in his anti-inflation report, according to  Yi's aides.    Yi ordered his aides to make a list of the steps he had  promised to take at the recent interpellation session of  parliament, saying he would check the list periodically to see  if the steps have actually been taken.    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang is a man of his word.</p>

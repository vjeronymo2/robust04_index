			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SWAP MEET GETS SANTIAGO COLLEGE BOARD'S BACKING  </P> <P> Before a crowd of more than 100 people, the Rancho Santiago College Board of  Trustees on Wednesday unanimously agreed that a swap meet held each Sunday in  the college parking lot does not harm the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> Members of the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn. had complained that El  Mercado, a mostly Latino swap meet, brings traffic, trash and noise to their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The group was lobbying to have it moved to another location.  </P> <P> But board members said they were satisfied with the results of a court-ordered  study of the swap meet's impact on the area, which was conducted by the  Irvine-based firm of S/R Lamoureaux.  </P> <P> "I believe there are very few areas of negative impact," Trustee Shirley  Ralston said. "In the few areas where there are concerns, we'll be very happy  to sit down with the community and talk."  </P> <P> Tim Rush, a member of the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn.'s board of  directors, told the board that his group was open to negotiations to settle the  problem.  </P> <P> For the large crowd of vendors who spoke in support of the swap meet, the  board's decision came as good news.  </P> <P> "We feel very relieved," said Edward Salcedo, manager of El Mercado. "We were  very concerned about the possibility of the swap meet having to shut down. It  really means a lot to many people."  </P> <P> The board still faces a lawsuit filed by the city charging that the swap meet  violates Santa Ana zoning laws.  </P></p>

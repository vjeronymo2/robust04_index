			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. VETOES U.N. RESOLUTION CALLING FOR FACT-FINDING TRIP TO WEST BANK, GAZA  </P> <P> The United States on Thursday vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for  a council fact-finding mission to report on abuses of Palestinians in Israel's  occupied territories. The vote was 14 to 1.  </P> <P> Arab states said the U.S. veto demonstrated the international isolation of the  United States and Israel on Middle East issues.  </P> <P> "This resolution does not focus on the real need to move the peace process  forward," U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said. "Rather, it could too  easily become a vehicle which could be misused to generate more needless  controversy," he told the 15-member council after the vote.  </P> <P> "This appears more likely to add to the problems, rather than help resolve the  peace process in the region," he added.  </P> <P> The United States, the U.S. ambassador said, favors an envoy dispatched by the  U.N. secretary general to investigate violence in the territories.  </P> <P> Israel, however, opposes any fact-finding mission, and Israeli officials said  they will not permit U.N. officials or Security Council members to enter its  territory.  </P></p>

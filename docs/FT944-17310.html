			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shooting in the heat of battle - David Spark talks to a cameraman who specialises in frontline film Vaughan Smith was the only television cameraman to get frontline film of the allied advance in the Gulf War. He posed as an officer taking pictures for the British army, sat undetected while officers were warned about an unauthorised intruder, then left to hitch a lift with US troops, claiming they had crashed into his Land Rover. Smith is a former captain in the Grenadier Guards. His Gulf War earnings enabled him to finance the development of Frontline News TV, which started out as a cameramen's co-operative and has provided much of the world's TV coverage of Bosnia, Somalia and Liberia. Its scoops include Rory Peck's Gulf War pictures of a missile-hit air-raid shelter in Baghdad, and the story of UN soldiers in Sarajevo trading on the black market and buying people's few belongings. Eighteen months before the Gulf war, Smith, who used to fly microlight aircraft, went to Pakistan to represent a company that made the aircraft and joined a camera crew accompanying the BBC's John Simpson over the mountains to Kabul. The other members of the crew were Peck and Peter Jouvenal, a former soldier, on the trip they discussed setting up a company. The following year, after the Romanian revolution, they set up the Hard News group, later renamed Frontline News TV, with Nick della Casa and Tim Weaver. Freelance cameramen may take exciting pictures but they struggle to sell them. For individuals the problem is making themselves known to TV companies. 'It's hard to do enough for them to remember you,' says Smith. Freelances rarely figure in the credits at the end of TV programmes. Companies normally try to disguise the fact that they are using non-staff pictures. The idea of Frontline was to establish a name which companies would remember. Smith ran the group from his London home and cycled round TV offices delivering material. The first year was difficult. The group had a Pounds 50,000 turnover but did not make money. Smith's Gulf earnings enabled him to buy computers, set up a data base of clients and sales, and improve the presentation of material to TV executives. He also spent Pounds 50,000 on an editing suite, which saved money and time. Annual turnover rose to Pounds 180,000. Towards the end of 1991, Anna Roberts, a journalist and producer, joined the group to market the cameraman's material and built the number of TV clients to 70. Roberts became a camerawoman and producer and, in early 1993, Frontline hired first Susannah Nicoll and then Jane Birch to organise sales, seek contracts and run the office. Annual turnover has reached Pounds 400,000, partly because the cameramen became better at choosing what to do and doing it, partly because of work in Bosnia. The Frontline group was among the first users of Hi8 home video cameras for TV instead of the heavy and expensive Betacam. 'People picked up Hi8s and went to war zones and came back with footage that sold,' says Smith. Hi8s have become standard on BBC World Service TV. After the Gulf War, della Casa was murdered by his guide in Kurdistan. Weaver left the group to work on his own. Peck also left to set up an office in Moscow. He was killed in the battle at the TV station when the Russian parliament challenged Boris Yeltsin. Last May, Smith and Jouvenal changed Frontline News into a limited company, with five share or share-option holders, all camera-people who work almost exclusively for Frontline. The aim is to keep ownership in the hands of the people who do the work. Camera-people working with Frontline take responsibility for themselves and their equipment and pay Frontline a commission. They may offer features lasting six to 12 minutes to TV companies; or they may go overseas as camera crew for the networks. Smith says: 'We have a reputation for war coverage and getting to places that are difficult to get to.' To attract networks, a freelance group has to be cheaper than a staff crew and yet also meet its running costs from within its fee. 'That means being highly competitive and motivated. The very fact we have survived shows flexibility and motivation.' A BBC cameraman in Bosnia goes to war in an armoured car. Frontline cannot afford that. Its people probably stay with a family in Sarajevo for Dollars 20 (Pounds 12.60) a night, instead of paying Dollars 80 at the Holiday Inn. Smith stresses, however, that freelances play an important role because of their freedom from head office. 'We can do what most broadcasters sometimes don't do, because we aren't controlled.' For example, he could get frontline pictures of the Gulf because he was outside the deal between editors and the British Army. Other journalists could have broken the story of the Sarajevo Mafia and UN corruption; but they were staying in the Holiday Inn and benefiting from Mafia-provided power, water and food. One thing which rankles with Smith is that freelances rarely win awards. The networks give them to each other. Frontline News TV, 150 Buckingham Palace Road, London SWIW 9TR (tel:071-824- 8834)</p>

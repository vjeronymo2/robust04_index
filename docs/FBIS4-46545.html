			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article prepared from a speech by Main Directorate for </F> Indoctrination and Moral-Psychological Work of the Ministry of  Defense of Ukraine Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar to a  practical-science conference by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent  Lieutenant-Colonel Volodymyr But: "We Will Be Able To Reach  Better Indicators of Military Discipline Only Through Purposeful  Influence on the Moral-Psychological State of the Troops"]    [Text] Analysis of the state of military discipline in the  Armed Forces of Ukraine shows that no qualitative changes have  been achieved in this issue. This signifies, first of all, that  the complex military organism is not working as it should and,  second, that the forms and methods we have chosen to strengthen  military discipline have not been effective.    The low level of military discipline by no means testifies  to  the healthy and strong moral-psychological state of the  troops--an indicator that, as world experience shows, has no  less significance for the Armed Forces than modern weaponry.    So what the moral-psychological state of the troops mean? It  is, on a general plane, the set of spiritual qualities of the  personnel that signifies its conformity to the tasks of military  service. The moral-psychological state of the troops, that is,  is reduced to the so-called "human factor," with all of its  multitude of components.    The military person should have not only a national and  political awareness that is psychologically well grounded and  emotionally committed to his Fatherland, but should also be well  fed, dressed, armed and physically and professionally prepared  for the performance of his duties. The moral-psychological state  of the troops is based on a whole series of components. We are  talking first and foremost namely about those, since we are  primarily interested in the areas of practical work. And the  components of a strong moral-psychological state, and not its  traits, goes back to that.    Science shows that, first, it is impossible to formulate  specifically any trait of a strong moral-psychological state,  and second, that any of these traits can be formulated only  through all-round influence on all of the constituent elements  that make it up. In order to form such an integral trait as  courage, for example, among the personnel, it is necessary to  foster a thrust toward certain values, psychological tempering  and physical durability, the people must be well armed, since  courage relies on confidence in one's powers, and so forth.    The indicator of the moral-psychological state encompasses a  very broad circle of areas of work, and reacts with sensitivity  to a great many of the factors under which the military person  operates. It is, that is to say, an integrating indicator in  which a multitude of components are focused, each of which  proceeds from the satisfaction of these or those requirements of  people starting with the biological and ending with the  spiritual. The level of development of spiritual requirements  itself is definitive in the evaluation of the  moral-psychological state.    These views lead us to the conclusion that strengthening the  moral-psychological state of the troops will require work with  areas that lie outside the jurisdiction of the bodies for  indoctrination work as well. It must thus be acknowledged that  overall responsibility for the moral-psychological state of the  personnel lies with the commander as the chief organizer and  sole ultimate authority.    There exists a fundamentally important general law for us,  however--the same way that certain factors affect the  moral-psychological state of the troops, that state also affects  the perception of any factor in their everyday conditions by the  personnel, the level of insecurity in housing, a narrow circle  of association etc. The level of development of spiritual  requirements and a streamlined system for satisfying them are  able to compensate for even the substantial problems that  military-professional activity, and the conduct of combat  operations in particular, entails. That is why the bodies for  indoctrination work occupy a central place in the cause of  strengthening the moral-psychological state of the troops.    We will be able to reach a better indicator of the military  discipline only through purposeful influence on the  moral-psychological state of the troops. That influence should  be exercised by all the elements of field command and control.  The methods of that influence differ in accordance with the  specific tasks.    How can military discipline be maintained at a more or less  satisfactory level under conditions where the level of  discipline among the personnel remains low? We have always been  trying to do just that by directing our efforts in raising  military discipline mainly toward the creation of conditions  where an undisciplined--that is, psychologically ready for an  offense--serviceman was forced to uphold stipulated norms  through the intensification of monitoring, increased  exactingness etc. Life has shown that we were not able to  achieve a radical change in the situation with such an approach.    So the way to strengthen military discipline, from the  scientific point of view, lies in influencing the  moral-psychological state of the troops as one with the level of  discipline of the personnel--the main precondition for strong  military discipline.    We understand that educational influences on the personnel  on  the part of indoctrination bodies alone are insufficient to  achieve positive indicators of the moral-psychological state of  the troops.    There is, by the way, another positive element connected  with  our orientation toward the concept of the moral-psychological  state in the cause of strengthening military discipline, as well  as the fighting ability of the troops--such an orientation  allows us not to destroy the important components of practical  work and not to focus on indoctrination alone.    We proceed from the fact that the formation of the level of  discipline as a socio-psychological trait should be accomplished  at both the conscious and the subconscious levels of each  individual consciousness. This is achieved in practice thanks to  the combination of measures of an indoctrinational, including  ideological, work and measures for the socio-psychological  support of military service in an interconnected system.    Indoctrination work in the Armed Forces is directed toward  the formation of such personality traits as patriotism,  ideological loyalty to the cause of building and protecting the  Ukrainian state, respect for the law, and a conscientious  attitude toward service obligations.    Both commanders at all levels and the corresponding  officials  of the bodies for indoctrination work--the deputy commanders,  ethnic studies specialists, and workers in culture and  education--are working on namely those tasks.    A great deal has been done in particular with regard to the  development of guiding documents and the institution of  standards for indoctrination work in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    The standard complements of the Centers for Culture,  Education and Leisure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been  developed in accordance with the areas and amounts of their  work. The Minister of Defense has signed the order "The Conduct  of a Review Competition of the Centers of Culture, Education and  Leisure, Collectives of Artistic Amateur Activities, Clubs and  Ethnic-Studies Rooms," the provisions and requirements of which  have been adopted by the troops for fulfillment, with the aim of  a qualitative rise in the level of cultural and indoctrination  work.    But it must be acknowledged as a whole that indoctrination  work on our part is still unfortunately reduced to the ordinary  informing of the personnel, while it should be emotionally  amusing, should incite deep passions in servicemen, a historical  memory of their people, a universal perception of their  forefathers, and be based on subconscious national traits and  models of behavior. Then the indoctrination work will bring  significantly better results in the cause of strengthening the  moral-psychological state of the troops and the level of  discipline of the personnel. We are thus directing ourselves  toward a search for and re-creation of new, vital forms of  indoctrination work. An organizational structure of the bodies  for indoctrination work has been developed and incorporated for  this purpose that makes it possible to encompass all of these  areas. We are devoting primary attention to the training of  officials in practical work and the satisfaction of the needs of  the Armed Forces for methodological support for the work with  personnel--both in the form of practical recommendations, making  use for that purpose of the capabilities of the  Scientific-Research and Methodological Center of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine and special issues of the newspapers NARODNA  ARMIYA and ZVYTYAZHETS, and in the form of specialized  techniques and tests, oriented first and foremost toward those  questions that are the most pressing.    Some questions of practical work require further scientific  study, which would make it possible to reach a level of support  of social technologies in work with the personnel. In order for  the process of transition to those technologies to begin as soon  as possible, we have ordered and are coordinating the  corresponding research programs. They are being carried out both  by our own military specialists, and by leading scholars of the  Institute of Sociology and Psychology of the Academy of Sciences  of Ukraine.    The question not only of scientific-methodological support  for the work with personnel, but raising the psychological and  pedagogical competence of all officer personnel, is an ever more  pressing one on the agenda. Each officer is an educator and  pedagogue in the broad understanding of those words, and life  requires today--and will require in the future--that we place  emphasis on that.    The deputy commander for indoctrination work cannot stand  apart from the broad circle of questions that pertain one way or  another to the interests and needs of the person. And this in  turn requires a reliance on the mechanism for the administration  of bodies of indoctrination work. We do not have such an  opportunity today even in some very important areas. The fact is  that some extremely necessary structures do not even exist, they  have not been created. I have in mind the departments for  indoctrination work of the administration of the central  apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff.    The definition of indicators for evaluating the quality of  work of the bodies for military administration in this area, as  well as the set-up of a system for the corresponding information  support, that is, a system of accounting for the work, is a  fundamentally important issue in the cause of strengthening  military discipline.    The importance of this question is connected with the fact  that it pertains to feedback, without which positive results in  the activity of administrative bodies cannot be achieved.    The principal requirement for any feedback is that it should  correspond to the substance of the practical work. A scientific  approach to this question is such, and we are oriented namely  toward that. Structuring feedback using indicators of the  quantity of violations of military discipline and crimes is  renewing the erroneous system of concealment and focus on  secondary measures and areas of work that will never provide  stable and profound positive results.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Zuan (6200 9449): "Lu Ping Says Hong Kong New </F> Airport Project Talks Should Be Held in Compliance With the  Memorandum of Understanding"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Lu Ping,  director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, commented today on Hong Kong's new airport to deputies  from the Hong Kong and Macao region of Guangdong Province to the  8th National People's Congress. He pointed out that it is the  consistent stand of the Chinese Government to build a new  airport in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that the British side has  once again complicated the issue deliberately, the Chinese side  still cherishes the hope that the two sides can continue talks  on the airport in line with the spirit and principle of the  Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport, reach an  agreement at an early date, and strive to start construction of  the airport as soon as possible.    Lu Ping indicated that the aforementioned Memorandum of  Understanding is a solemn diplomatic document signed by the  heads of both the Chinese and British Governments; therefore,  everything should have been fine after the signing of the  document. However, the British side has asked us to make our  position known. The Chinese Government has already declared its  stance, that is, we support the idea of building a new airport  at low cost and with high efficiency and demand that it brings  no financial burden to the future government of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [SAR]. To put it in detailed  terms, financial reserves of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  should be set aside for the SAR government and the total debt  borne by the government should not exceed HK$5 billion. Things  could begin right then if everyone agreed to act in compliance  with the Memorandum of Understanding. However, the British Hong  Kong Government later put forward a financial package in which  liabilities overran by a large margin the provisions in the  Memorandum of Understanding. The total amount of liabilities  set out in the first package stood at over HK$70 billion. Lu  Ping said that the British side must be kidding if it is indeed  acceptable for the SAR government to undertake debt of over  HK$70 billion given financial reserves of just HK$25 billion.    Lu Ping noted: The British side put forward a third and then  a fourth financial package, and the latter still falls short of  the stipulations of the Memorandum of Understanding. Therefore,  the British side is to blame for a failure to act in accordance  with the Memorandum of Understanding. The issue is very simple,  and they can go ahead without holding discussions with us. The  reason why the British side wants to hold talks with the Chinese  side is because nothing can be accomplished if they stick to  this financial package. They will not be able to raise loans.  Banks will not grant them loans because the financial package  raised by the British side does not conform to the Memorandum of  Understanding.    Lu Ping added that the British side is making trouble again.  Despite this, the Chinese side will not rigidly adhere [si qia  zhu 2984 1595 0145] to the HK$5 billion ceiling, yet hopes the  British side can consult the Chinese side if debts exceed HK$5  billion. The problem now is that the gap is too wide. Lu Ping  said that at the present stage, the Chinese side is still  prepared to hold talks with the British side and hopes an  agreement can be reached at an early date.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halls Homes &amp; Gardens taken over by receivers HALLS Homes &amp; Gardens, the USM-quoted manufacturer of conservatories, garden buildings and home improvement products, yesterday had its shares suspended and passed into the hands of receivers. The action jeopardises a Pounds 1.5m debt-into-equity swap agreed by National Westminster, its bankers, in February last year, which reduced borrowings to about Pounds 6.3m. NatWest subscribed in full to a 1.5m issue of 7 per cent preference shares of Pounds 1 par redeemable in 1993-95. The company launched a Pounds 3.2m rights issue at the same time without which it said it would 'almost certainly be unable to continue trading'. Mr Tony Houghton and Mr John Richards, partners in accountants Touche Ross, were appointed receivers. Mr Houghton said the company had suffered from the effects of the recession, which reduced demand for its products, cut margins and put pressure on liquidity. But he added a note of optimism for the employees and creditors. He said that receivership allowed him to 'run the business as a going concern with a view to selling it on as such'. 'We will be looking to do so once we have had time to fully investigate,' he added. Mr Neil Curtin, the managing director who was appointed last November, was last night unavailable for comment. Halls Homes &amp; Gardens was established in 1934 and came to the USM in 1986. It currently employs 175 people, primarily at two sites in Kent. It also has a long lease on a paint factory in the region. In the latest full accounts for the 12 months to December 31 last year, the company showed a loss of Pounds 7.2m on a turnover of Pounds 20.8m. It had net current liabilities of Pounds 3.5m. In the first half of this year it returned into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 529,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.7m. It declared no dividend.</p>

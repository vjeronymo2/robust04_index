			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Major Japanese steelmakers  have received a series of Chinese orders for massive imports of  seamless steel pipes for oil drilling, industry sources said  Monday [31 January].    China has already ordered about 100,000 tons of the material  from Nippon Steel Corp., NKK Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries  Ltd. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. for deliveries in the  February-July period, compared with actual shipments of 120,000  tons a year earlier, they said.    There is speculation in the industry that Chinese orders for  the half year will rise to a level of 150,000 to 200,000 tons.    Increased exports in the coming months are likely to bolster  the Japanese steelmakers' money-losing seamless pipe  manufacturing operations, the sources said.    Despite booming exports of ordinary rolled steel to China,  Japan's seamless pipe exports to the country have been sluggish  in recent years, falling to a range of 150,000 to 200,000 tons  from a peak of about 700,000 tons in the half-year period of  1985.    The sources attributed the active Chinese orders to a series  of oil development projects in China's inland areas and a  reduction in Chinese stocks of the material.    Japan, which exports more than 70 percent of its seamless  steel pipe production, has been losing money on the operations  due to the yen's appreciation on the foreign exchange market.</p>

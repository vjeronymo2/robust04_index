			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A possible strike looms by New York City Opera orchestra members if they reject  management's final offer at a meeting tonight. Although subsidiary issues  exist, the two main stumbling blocks to a settlement are guaranteed work weeks  and salary issues. Should a strike be called, picket lines will be set up for  the current "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" at Lincoln Center. The union's refusal to  give a no-strike guarantee for this season has already caused the company to  cancel plans for a new production of Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron." The  orchestra members have been performing under an expired contract. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

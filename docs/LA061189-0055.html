			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO SELECT INSPECTOR  </P> <P> A good place to begin your search for a home inspector is the telephone Yellow  Pages, under "Building Inspection Services," "Inspection Bureaus" or similar  listings.  </P> <P> Real estate brokers, who commission the majority of inspections, are another  good source. Ask a neighborhood broker for the names of three or four  inspectors and check out their qualifications.  </P> <P> The California Real Estate Inspection Assn., (916) 443-1422, will provide names  of CREIA members in your area. If you live outside California, the American  Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI), (202) 842-3096, will do the same.  </P> <P> Here are some pointers for choosing a home inspector, along with suggestions on  how to interpret and use the inspection report:  </P> <P>  -- Ask if the inspector is a CREIA or ASHI member or a candidate -- a person  in the process of becoming a full member -- of either organization.  </P> <P>  -- Check how long the inspector has been in business as a home inspector. Ask  what special qualifications he or she has.  </P> <P>  -- Ask if the inspector is experienced in residential construction, through  education and experience, and is a licensed contractor. Most experts believe  that a licensed contractor makes the best inspector.  </P> <P>  -- Ask to see sample inspection reports. Some inspectors use a checklist,  while others supplement the checklist with a narrative report. The latter is  easier to interpret, but it is important to have the checklist, too.  </P> <P>  -- Once you have chosen the inspector, you must make arrangements with the  seller or the seller's agent to conduct the inspection.  </P> <P>  -- According to Robert J. Bruss, a syndicated real estate  columnist/lawyer/real estate broker, make sure that your offer to purchase  includes a clause specifying a professional inspection, with the seller to pay  for certain repairs. The seller will probably add a clause limiting the dollar  amount of the repairs, Bruss advises.  </P> <P>  -- Depending on the location of the house -- soil conditions, hillside site,  etc. -- you may decide to have a professional engineer or a geologist inspect  the property. In many cases, your home inspector can tell you if additional  inspections are required.  </P> <P>  -- When you get the completed report, don't panic if the inspector lists many  minor items that need fixing: This is to be expected in just about any house --  existing or new.

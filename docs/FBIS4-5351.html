			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Choe Kwang, member of the Political Bureau of the </F> Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea and chief of  staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA), to the central report  meeting marking the first anniversary of the election of Kim  Chong-il as chairman of the National Defense Committee held at  the 8 February House of Culture in Pyongyang -- live]    [Text] Comrades:    Today, we are observing the first anniversary of the  election  of the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il as the chairman of the National Defense Committee under  a militant atmosphere in which all the people across the country  and People's Army officers and men are resolutely smashing  [chitpusida] the vicious challenge by the imperialists and  reactionaries and vigorously accelerating the general onward  movement of the socialism of our own style, being  single-heartedly united around the party and the leader  [suryong].    Observing the meaningful day, our people and People's Army  officers and men are filled with great pride and dignity of  having the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is an  iron-willed military leader, at the head of the country's  defense forces and the revolutionary Armed Forces. They are  replete with the impregnable resolve to achieve the  reunification of the fatherland and complete the chuche  revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership of the  comrade supreme commander.    The election of KPA [Korean People's Army] supreme commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the DPRK National Defense  Committee at the fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's  Assembly held in April last year was the realization of the  unanimous aspiration and burning desire of our people and  People's Army officers and men to have their leader at the head  of the defense forces and follow him. [applause]    As everyone knows, whether or not the long-cherished desire  of a sovereign state which builds socialism while repelling  anti- revolutionary offensives by the imperialist aggressive  forces and reactionaries is accomplished depends on the  greatness of a leader [yongdoja]. History tells us that a  country and nation with a great leader always prevail over both  politics and defense, however those without a great leader  [yongdoja] cannot defend independence and sovereignty, and,  moreover, cannot complete its just revolutionary cause.    In light of this, the people link the name of a leader with  the fate of a nation and that of revolution, and convinced in  tomorrow's victory, considering it as their greatest fortune to  have a great leader.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who has led the party,  the state, and the revolutionary Armed Forces at the head from  his early years -- wisely led the historic cause of modelling  the whole party and the entire Army of the whole society after  the chuche idea. He thus accumulated immortal accomplishments  which will shine forever in the history of the fatherland.  [applause]    In particular, the achievements accumulated by the dear  comrade leader on the road to strengthening and developing our  revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary Armed Forces of  one-a-match-for-100 by firmly consolidating the country's  defense power, are innumerably enormous.    Highly upholding the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il,  who accumulated great achievements in fulfilling the chuche  socialist cause and (?overall) construction cause at the head of  the self- reliant defense power, is another historical milestone  in the people's security, firmly defending the revolutionary  cause, and in victoriously advancing our revolution. [applause]    By upholding the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il,  who is a great military commander, at the supreme head of the  defense power, our people and the People's Army were able to  firmly guarantee the work to further defend the chuche socialist  system ever so strong and accelerate the completion of the  chuche revolutionary cause at a new high stage. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim  Chong-il has an indomitable will and courage, and outstanding  intelligence and commanding art as befits the supreme commander  of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees the constant  strengthening and development of our revolutionary Armed Forces  and their ever-victorious advance.    The dear comrade leader is embodying at a lofty level the  trait of an extraordinary military strategy and outstanding  military commander who can lead our people and the People's Army  to be ever victorious. The first mission of a military  commander leading the military and people is to present a  correct military ideology and theory to correctly elucidate the  road in the construction of the main force of the revolution and  in the victory in the revolutionary war. Here, the greatness of  the military commander is concentratedly manifested.    Through his extraordinary wisdom and activities that were  carried out without sleep and rest, which no one can follow, the  dear comrade leader developed and enriched the chuche-oriented  military ideology and theory that the great leader presented.  Thus, he provided the most correct guiding principle in solving  the military problems of our times.    The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il formulated the military doctrine of the great leader as  an integral one with chuche military idea, military theory, and  military tactics as its keynote and has comprehensively  developed it in depth, thus, brilliantly solving the urgent  questions raised by military practice in the present times.  [applause]    Because of this immortal achievement by the dear comrade  leader, the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory were  both in name and reality clearly proven as a new and unique  military doctrine that is the most scientific and revolutionary  military doctrine based on the man-centered philosophical theory.    The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il developed and enriched the chuche-oriented military  ideology into a new doctrine and propositions. In particular,  based on the theory of the revolutionary outlook on the leader,  he presented a unique military construction ideology that the  working-class revolutionary Army is in essence an army of the  leader and army of the party. This truly has important  significance in building, strengthening, and developing the  working-class revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary  Armed Forces that truly serves the party, the leader, and cause  of socialism.    The profound and multifaceted military ideologies and  theories elucidated by the dear comrade leader are the most  scientific and revolutionary military ideology and theory, all  based on the chuche revolutionary theory. Therefore, it is  being elucidated as an ever-victorious military (?valuable  sword).    Saying that the new era has ushered in with the end of the  Cold War era, the imperialists and the renegades of the  revolution are babbling about the so-called new military  doctrine.    In view of today's complicated situation, our people and  People's Army are truly fortunate to possess the ever-victorious  precious military sword which is running thoroughly with  revolutionary spirit and scientific accuracy. [applause]    Amid all sorts of rampant wave of antirevolutionary  opportunism, our revolutionary Armed Forces are firmly adhering  to their revolutionary character of being chuche-type  revolutionary Armed Forces, and staunchly defending the  socialist cause under the banner of chuche military idea,  without knowing about trivial deviation of difficulties.    With an outstanding and tested commanding art, the respected  and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely  led the whole party, all the people, and the entire Army to  implement our party's line of self-reliant defense. In doing so,  the defense capabilities of the nation have been consolidated  rock firm in all aspects.    Powerful self-reliant national defense power is a military  guarantee that defends the national sovereignty from the  imperialists' aggression, and that enables us to build the  socialism and communism triumphantly.    All-people defense system and powerful self-reliant national  defense power--which firmly defends the sovereignty of the  country and the nation by smashing any formidable imperialist  enemy with our own power--are unthinkable without the excelled  and tested leadership of the respected and beloved supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause]    The People's Army is the core of the self-reliant national  defense power. The major work our party has always given top  priority to is bringing up the People's Army as the ranks of  loyalty who sacrifice their life for the party and the leader  [suryong] and as an indomitable army which can smash any enemy.    The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set  forth the program of army construction on modelling the entire  Army after the chuche idea. By so doing, he has provided a firm  guarantee whereby our revolutionary Armed Forces can be brought  up as an indomitable army defeating any formidable imperialist  enemy as the party's true army, a revolutionary army, endlessly  loyal to the party and the leader [suryong].    Likewise, in conformity with the requirements of modelling  the entire Army after the chuche idea, he has given definite  precedence to the party's monolithic ideological system and the  monolithic system of guidance in the military construction and  every domain of military activities. He has put big emphasis on  strengthening the work of educating the spirit of loyalty to the  party and the leader [suryong] among the officers. In this way,  he has firmly ensured the unitary of the leader's ideology and  leadership in every work of the People's Army, and achieved the  entire Army's single-hearted unity, and made the entire Army  have the faith of loyalty to the extent they would sacrifice  their life for the party and the leader.    The might of the revolutionary Army is a political,  ideological might and this can only be highly demonstrated when  it is connected with modern military techniques.    The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has  given  decisive precedence to the work to firmly prepare the People's  Army politically, ideologically while energetically organizing  and leading the work to strengthen the People's Army militarily  and technically.    Thanks to our party's energetic leadership, today our  People's Army has grown in strength and developed into  invincible revolutionary Armed Forces with all services and  arms, powerful means of strike and defense and unique tactics of  chuche, which are sufficient for any modern warfare.    The ever-victorious might of the People's Army lies in that  the whole Army has one loyal heart to defend the party and the  leader with death, closely united with one idea and one purpose,  and are firmly prepared militarily and technically to defeat any  formidable enemy. [applause]    One of the great military achievements of dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il, who has further wisely led the chuche-based cause of  the founding of the Army, is having so firmly consolidated our  People's Army in political, ideological, military, and  technological aspects. [applause]    In addition to strengthening the People's Army in all  aspects, comrade dear leader brilliantly armed all the people  and turned the entire country into a fortress, firmly set up an  all-people and all-nation defense system in the entire country,  built up a powerful self-reliant defense industry, and wisely  led the huge work of resolutely coping with the enemies' new war  provocative moves.    Today, the civilian Armed Forces, including the Red  Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guards, are generally  firmly consolidated, and the entire nation literally turned into  an impregnable fortress.    And, because our own strong self-defensive national defense  industry has been built, we have today come to have the  capability of further improving the country's defense forces  with our own strength if we made up our mind to do so.    Along with this, the tradition of the people-army unity is  fully blooming on a new, higher level and the ideological and  willful cohesion between the army and the people is further  firmly consolidated.    The two troop reviews commemorating the 40th anniversary of  the victory in fatherland liberation war and the 60th  anniversary of the founding of the KPA, which left a record of a  brilliant chapter of our revolution's chronicle, were active  displays of the indomitable might of our self-reliant defense  power with the People's Army as the core. This gave trust of  victory to our people and the world's revolutionary people, and  anxiety and fear to the enemies.    The proud reality, in which none of the opponents dare to  intrude the self-reliant national defense power that has been  built under the extraordinarily difficult condition of building  socialism amid constant risk of the U.S. imperialists'  aggression and war, is a brilliant fruition of the outstanding  and tested leadership of the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander. [applause]    The greatness of a sagacious general is highlighted by the  practice of leading the army and the people with peerless  courage and outstanding wisdom to gain supremacy over the  enemies' offensives, and of reliably defending the country's  independence and the nation's dignity.    Our country is an arena of the most acute confrontation on  earth between revolution and antirevolution, and socialism and  capitalism, and dark and heavy clouds of war constantly float  around the Korean peninsula. However, our people and the  People's Army have smashed [chitpusida] every step of the  enemies' antirevolutionary offensive and reliably defended the  independence right of the country and the gains of revolution  under the wise leadership of the party and the leader.    In confrontation with the enemies, dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il,  who wholly embodied the wisdom of a great sagacious general, has  always gained supremacy over the enemies with wonderful and  brilliant strategies and tactics and put the exhausted enemies  on the defensive.    In recent years, whenever the enemies conducted the Team  Spirit war exercise, our country was laid in a situation of  ultra-tension [choginjang] in a brink of war. Without the  slightest hesitation and vacillation, our people and the  People's Army fought to repulse them every time and made every  step of the rascals' war exercises commotion stumble because  they were led by the comrade supreme commander who has iron-clad  will and peerless courage.    The truth is that when the leader of revolution is great and  the military sagacious leader is extraordinary, the people and  the army can display independent spirit hundreds and thousands  times more and become mighty people and indomitably strong army,  is proven by our people's eloquent revolutionary practices today.    The spirit of national independence, and revolution and  militant trait of our people and the People's Army under the  leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is  an extraordinary sagacious general, are displayed today on an  unprecedentedly lofty level.    Today, our people and the officers and men of the People's  Army are fully blossoming the revolutionary army trait of  fulfilling to the end the invincibility of jumping into water  and fire if it is an order of the comrade supreme commander, and  the virtue of army-people unity in which the army and the people  are upholding the party through complete unity.    Only the great chuche idea--our party's revolutionary  ideology--dominates in our revolutionary ranks, and in every  hearts of our people and the officers and men of the People's  Army, they are overflowing with the firm faith of sharing their  fate with the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander.  The trait of attaching great importance to the military in the  whole society and the trait of faithfully learning the military  affairs is overflowing, and the country has truly changed into  an impregnable fortress. [applause]    Even under the condition in which the imperialists tried to  commit aggressive maneuvers at any time at all to crush [apsal]  the small countries through forcible measures and threat, our  party and people were vigorously advancing the socialist cause,  with the faith of victory, because we were provided with a truly  strong defense capacity and an invincibly strong army.    Our country, which has a small territory and a small  population, smashed [chitbusigo] all kinds of challenges of the  imperialists and reactionaries and defended the nation's  dignity. Therefore, all the victories achieved to advance the  socialist cause are a great victory of the dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il's, the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people,  iron-like faith and will, extraordinary strategy and tactic, and  outstanding military strategy. [applause]    Through this significant meeting, filled with the utmost  admiration and blazing loyalty, on behalf of all the people and  the officers and men of the People's Army, I would like to give  the greatest honor and warmest thanks to the dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission  and supreme commander of the KPA, who elucidated the dignity of  the fatherland and nation through his extraordinary military  ideology and refined leadership and always led our people and  the People's Army toward the one road of victory and glory.  [applause]    Comrades: Today, our people and all the officers and men of  the People's Army are faced with the heavy and honorary task of  further consolidating the country's defense capacity like an  impregnable fortress and to achieve ahead of schedule the  fatherland's independent reunification and the ultimate victory  of the chuche revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand  of the prevailing situation.    A tense situation in which a war may break out anytime  prevails in our country at present because of the vicious  antisocialist, antirepublic maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists  and other international reactionary forces.    The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release  the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable  [tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to  crush [apsal] us.    Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking  up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they  would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that  they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war.    In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to  stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and  babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok]  against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve  reunification if it is necessary.    The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on  special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to  invade the North.    Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply  involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the  southern Korean peninsula.    All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists  and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our  Republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war  may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime.    However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our  people and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership  of the great commander [yongjan].    If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people  and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the  same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on  and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy.  [applause]    Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with  dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun  taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo  chongchaegimnida].    The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not  miscalculate  [osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after  clearly seeing the trend of the times.    All the people and People's Army officers and men must  vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist  fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's  infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces  impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible  revolutionary army.    The most important problem in effecting a bigger upsurge in  the socialist construction while securing the chuche  revolutionary cause by force of arms is brilliantly inheriting  and developing our revolution's tradition of single-hearted  unity. [applause]    Single-hearted unity is the banner of victory and the primal  basis of our revolution. Our single-hearted unity is the  single-hearted unity which upholds the supreme commander Comrade  Kim Chong-il at the center of its unity with faith and filial  duty, and is the everlasting single-hearted unity which does not  move an inch even under any raging storm in the world.  [applause]    With strong faith that they will always win if there is the  dear leader, all the people and People's Army officers and men  must resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] by  becoming a shield of single-hearted unity and faithfully  upholding the party's monolithic leadership.    Firmly securing the chuche revolutionary cause by force of  arms is the basic mission of the People's Army. The entire  officers and men of the People's Army must make loyalty to the  respected and beloved comrade supreme commander their faith,  conscience, morality, and life by thoroughly arming themselves  with the chuche idea. They must persistently hold fast to the  party's line on modelling the entire Army after the chuche idea.  Thus, they should strengthen the political, ideological might  of the People's Army in every way.    The officers of the People's Army must make the entire ranks  overflowing with the revolutionary ethos of going through fire  and water to carry through the comrade supreme commander's order  and direction to the end and carrying out discipline, life, and  learning the way the anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. They  should also make the entire ranks overflowing with the  traditional virtue of the unity between the officers and men,  and the unity between the party and society.    Furthermore, the officers of the People's Army must set up  steel-like regulations inside the entire Army and prepare  soldiers as one-a-match-for-100 fighters who are possessed of  invulnerable power, military techniques, markermanship worthy of  a crack shot, and adroit military strategy. They must  ceaselessly modernize the armed equipments of the People's Army  and further consolidate the military posts as an impregnable  fortresses.    Defending the socialist fatherland is an all-popular work.  It is firm will of our people to vigorously push ahead with the  socialist construction and the defense of the nation, holding a  gun on one hand and a sickle and a hammer on another. [applause]    Today's acute situation, in which provocative moves for a  new  war are endlessly perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists and the  puppet clique, calls on us to all the more firmly consolidate  all-people, all-state defense system by thoroughly implementing  our party's line on arming all the people and turning the entire  country into a fortress.    Our party members and workers must strongly arm themselves  with our party's chuche-oriented view on war [chonjaenggwanjom]  and firmly establish in the entire society a trait of attaching  importance to military affairs and sincerely learning military  affairs. By so doing, they must make thorough political and  ideological, military, and material preparations against any  unanticipated event on our own initiative [buruiui satae edo  chudongjoguro taechohalssu innun chongchisasangjok chunbi  kunsajok chunbi mulchilchok chunbirul pintumopsi kachuoya  hagessumnida].    In particular, all the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the  Young Red Guards must cherish deep in their hearts great pride  in being revolutionary warriors of the great general, strengthen  combat and political training and, thus, defend their work  places, villages, and schools with vigilance.    The traditional beautiful trait of Army-people unity which  is  highly maintained today in our society is an expression of the  noble idea and spirit that all people and the entire Army share  the life and death and destiny with the comrade supreme  commander under any stern trial.    All people and officers and men of the People's Army must  vigorously carry out the our guardpost is our village, our  village is our guardpost movement and, thus, ensure that a  beautiful trait be further fostered throughout the country in  which the Army positively helps the people and in which the  people sincerely assist the Army. By so doing, the Army and  people must become one in flesh and spirit in the same trenches,  resolutely punish the aggressors and, thus, again demonstrate  the dignity and honor of the heroic Korea if the enemy dares to  provoke a new war. [applause]    The revolutionary economic strategy presented by our party  is  a banner of struggle to strengthen the overall national power  and more highly display the superiority of popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style. [applause]    To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy, we must highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and arduous struggle. All party members and  workers must score great upsurges in production and construction  in hearty response to the party's militant slogan on vigorously  accelerating the general onward socialist march with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    The fatherland's reunification is the unanimous earnest  desire of all Korean people and achieving the fatherland's  reunification in the nineties without fail is our party's firm  will. [applause]    All people and officers and men of the People's Army must  possess the belief that achieving the fatherland's reunification  in the nineties is a certainty [hwakchongjok] because there is  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, resolutely crush  [chippussida] the maneuvers by the antireunification forces, and  more staunchly fight to hasten the fatherland's reunification.  [applause]    All Korean compatriots in the North and South and overseas  must achieve strong unity under the banner of the 10-point  program of great unity of the entire nation presented by the  great leader and more boldly wage the struggle to prevent the  danger of a new war and carry out the historic cause of the  fatherland's reunification.    A revolutionary road is far and turbulent, and our future  road may be fraught with trials and adversities. However, we  are not afraid of any trial. Our people and People's Army are  filled with the firm belief that they, just like they did in the  past, will be ever-victorious in the future, as well, because  they uphold respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il at the  head of the party and revolutionary armed forces [[kyongaehanun  kim chong-il tongjirul tanggwa hyongmyongmuryogui suwie  mosigoitkie].    No matter how frantically the imperialists and reactionaries  try to isolate and crush [korip apsal] our Republic, all  progressive people of the world who love justice and peace will  be on our side, and our socialism, the chuche-oriented  socialism, which defeated all trials in history, will win  victory after victory. [applause]    For socialism to win victory and for imperialism to be  ruined  is the law of the development of history. Let us all be  single-heartedly united around respected and beloved Supreme  Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and more vigorously fight for a  victory in the socialist cause, the fatherland's independent  reunification, and the ultimate completion of the chuche  revolutionary cause. [applause]    Long live the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of  the DPRK National Defense Committee and supreme commander of the  KPA! [applause]</p>

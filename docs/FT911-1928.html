			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Efta sidetracked by the lure of EC membership: Joining the Community is beginning to appeal more than a free trade zone THERE ARE growing signs that efforts to set up a free trade zone between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association are doomed as Efta members warm to the idea of seeking full EC membership instead. For one thing, the European Economic Area talks themselves are deadlocked: the Swiss are threatening to walk out and get on with applying for EC membership; Iceland announced yesterday it would boycott the talks until the EC stopped making 'unrealistic demands' about fishing jurisdiction; and Sweden may apply as soon as next month to become a full Community member. The next EC-Efta ministerial meeting is scheduled for May 13 in Brussels and this could well turn into a make-or-break session. The original hope of having a framework EEA (European Economic Area) agreement ready for Efta's annual conference in Salzburg in June is looking doubtful. The areas of division remain considerable. It is not only the issue of EC access to the fishing grounds off Iceland and Norway that threatens to paralyse negotiations. It is now clear the attempts at formulating joint decision-making bodies to police the EEA have run into trouble, particularly from the European Court in Luxembourg, which refuses to accept that Efta judges should sit with it in ajudicating on breaches of EEA rules. In fact, there has been an unreal quality to the EC-Efta talks for some time. The EEA was first proposed by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, in Strasbourg in January 1989 as a way of discouraging individual Efta countries from applying for EC membership at a time when the EC was concentrating on the speed-up of integration with the internal market by 1992. The Efta countries responded favourably to Mr Delors' initiative and both sides met in Oslo in February 1989, where they agreed on negotiating an EEA, however unclear that concept remained. But the original reasons for having an EEA no longer seem so obvious as the pace of change has accelerated in Europe. Increasingly the EEA has been seen by many as a transition stage on the road to full EC membership for the Efta countries and not a real alternative. Austria was the first to break ranks and send in an EC membership application in July 1989 though insisting it was still committed as a loyal Efta member to the EEA negotiations. But it was Sweden's sudden conversion last October to the idea of joining the EC that really began to undermine the Efta position. At the time the other Nordic states greeted the Swedish volte-face with a mixture of anger and shock and insisted this did not affect their own outlook. However, with Sweden's announcement yesterday that it would send in its EC membership application in June, and the deadlock in the EEA talks, official attitudes can be expected to continue in the Nordic glacial fashion - a slow undercurrent for change to be followed by rapid acceptance of the new orthodoxy. Until last weekend politicians in Finland had remained adamant, except for a few brave voices on the fringe, that the country - for historical reasons of its neutrality and close relations with the Soviet Union - could not consider joining the EC. For the Finns the EEA seemed the tailor-made answer to their country's dilemma as a market economy increasingly dependent on EC trade but requiring co-existence with whoever rules in the Kremlin. In Finland's recent general election the EC question was studiously avoided by all the parties. But last weekend former foreign minister Pentti Paasio, a Social Democrat, broke ranks within hours of leaving office to say Finland ought to consider applying to join the EC, while the new Centre-Conservative coalition says it does not rule out such a move as long as the country's national interests can be protected. In Oslo the response has so far been more muted, but then Labour prime minister Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland finds herself in a difficult position. Her minority government, which came to power last November, is dependent for its present position on the support of the anti-EC Centre Party. Mrs Brundtland has said over and over that her Labour party - which is the key to a Norwegian EC application - cannot decide its position until the autumn of 1993 at its next conference and that the issue will have to be resolved finally in the next Norwegian general election, which cannot take place until September 1994. Now there are signs that the government - under pressure from the opposition Conservatives - will have to debate what to do as early as this summer, particularly if the Efta-EC negotiations collapse. The trouble is that public opinion remains volatile and evenly divided over EC membership and memories of the bitter EC referendum campaign of 1972 continue to haunt Norway's politicians. The Nordic ice may be breaking on the issue, but it remains unclear as to just how fast a pace the countries of the region intend to pursue it. But all of them - except Iceland, for whom the fish question is non-negotiable - are heading in the same direction. Perhaps as early as January 1 1995, or soon afterwards, most of them may well have joined the EC either together or separately. It is an outcome more probable than a week ago, despite the obstacles that still lie in the way. Sweden sets about slicing cost of food, page 34</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BAT sees 'sin tax' of Dollars 2 as unrealistic SIR PATRICK Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, said he expected that President Clinton would impose a federal 'sin tax' on tobacco, but thought it was unlikely to start before 1994. While he did not rule out an increase in tax from 24 cents a packet to 50 cents or even higher, Sir Patrick said he thought rumours of a levy of Dollars 2 per packet being spread by anti-smoking campaigners were 'totally unrealistic'. He said: 'People can just roll their own, and America is a tobacco-growing country. There is also a huge land border - Canada has seen a big increase in smuggling since prices were increased there.' Sir Patrick gave three reasons for confidence, even if US taxes were increased - BAT's high level of cigarette exports from the US, the continuing growth in world demand for tobacco, and the group's expectations that its financial services businesses would show further growth and recovery. BAT said that it was particularly encouraging that cigarette exports, especially from the UK, US, Germany and Brazil, had grown by a further 23 per cent. Exports now accounted for almost a quarter of group sales. Export volumes from the UK had increased substantially, mainly to the Far East. With export growth set to expand further, a Pounds 175m development programme was well under way at BAT's Southampton factory, which exports all its output. The group's annual production capacity in the UK will eventually rise to 55bn cigarettes. BAT has also authorised a large investment programme at its plant at Macon in the US, which will increase its annual capacity by 50 per cent, to 150bn cigarettes. Sir Patrick said: 'This export success is all the more important in the light of the extremely competitive pressures which were affecting margins in the US domestic market. However, we are improving market share there, particularly in the rapidly growing value-for-money segment.' Domestic market share also grew in Germany and Australia, where there had been a good recovery. The group's market share had remained stable in Brazil, at 83 per cent, even though the overall market volume increased in the face of difficult market conditions. However, it said that more realistic pricing had led to a notable increase in trading profit. In Asia, BAT Hong Kong's domestic volumes and market shares were down, while profits were lower due to excise increases and higher costs. Elsewhere, volumes and profits were higher overall.</p>

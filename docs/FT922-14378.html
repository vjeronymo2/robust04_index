			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BUYING by independent traders, as they anticipated a hung parliament in this week's election, led to a squeeze in stock index futures, sending the June contract on the FT-SE sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract kicked off two points ahead of its Friday close of 2,415, but quickly fell back to 2,411 on early selling orders. This turned out to be the low of the day and was only a temporary decline, before independent traders went on a buying spree as they took positions ahead of Thursday's UK general election, discounting the prospect of an outright winner in the contest. By mid-afternoon, June had reached 2,442, the high of the day, but profit-taking thereafter caused a decline in the contract's advance. June eventually closed at 2,429, a 28-point premium to the cash market and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover at 7,033 was healthy. The traded options market continued to witness good volumes, with 29,698 contracts traded. The FT-SE option was again busy, trading a day's total of 8,590 contracts. Among stock options, Barclays was active, with 5,786 contracts transacted.</p>

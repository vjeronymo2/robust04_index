This came in a statement by the Swiss Foreign Ministry.    Switzerland claims that she is a neutral country and many  Libyans go there for medical treatment at her hospitals  supporting her economy through spending. Accordingly the Libyans  should take note of this as they declare daily their defiance of  the embargo and readiness for confrontation.</p>

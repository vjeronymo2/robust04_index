			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (11): Parts giant expands - Profile of Automotive Components Group General Motors last month announced a restructuring of its top management which, in the process, gave greater autonomy to its components operations, ACG (Automotive Components Group), to seek business with virtually any car or truck maker anywhere in the world. The intention is that by 2003 more than 50 per cent of ACG's sales will be to customers outside the GM group in North America, compared with only 15 per cent at the start of the 1990s. It will be spanning the world with a matrix of manufacturing plants and joint ventures capable of supplying any manufacturer with complex components systems wherever they might choose to set up assembly plants. With a Dollars 25.1bn turnover last year, ACG is already at least twice as big as its nearest rivals, as well as having a broader product spread within its six divisions. And it has already made progress towards its long-term goal. Around 27 per cent of last year's turnover, or nearly Dollars 7bn, was earned from customers outside GM's North American Operations (NAO) and the figure is expected to rise to more than 30 per cent by 1996. It employs 178,000 people world-wide, operates 180 manufacturing plants in 23 countries and has 13 technical centres and proving grounds spread around the world. In 1987, it had 109 plants located within North America and 51 outside. By last year there were only 86 plants in North America, with 95 overseas. The non-NAO business is not wholly non-GM. It includes unquantified sales to Opel, GM's German cars division, and other GM subsidiaries, although Mr JT Battenberg 111, its president, maintains that ACG is having to fight for the business like anyone else. Already ACG is present in all 20 of the world's principal vehicle markets and can supply most systems to any outside company. Among recent contracts is supply of the dashboard module, wiring harness and other components for the leisure four-wheel-drive vehicle Mercedes is to start producing in Alabama in 1998. Ned McLurg, a GM vice-president and general manager of the newly-formed AC Delco Systems division, also stresses the substantial business his division has won with Toyota as well as the Japanese car maker's highest quality award. 'Other manufacturers are saying to us, sell us what you've done for Toyota,' says Mr McLurg - despite Toyota recently issuing a warning to some of its North American suppliers that quality needed further upgrading. Mr McLurg readily acknowledges that rivals, in particular those based in Europe, are not going to yield sales meekly and says there is 'no question that going head to head with rivals like Siemens and Bosch would be difficult'. Instead, he says, 'there are still component areas where they don't have a presence and there are also big opportunities in new products as emissions legislation tightens further, such as exhaust gas recirculation equipment'. ACG comprises Delco Chassis, Saginaw (steering systems), Harrison (thermal management systems), Packard Electric, Inland Fisher Guide and AC Delco Systems, newly created by combining AC Rochester (engine management) and Delco Remy (electrical energy storage and conversion). Additionally, two other entities, ACG Europe and ACG Asia Pacific, are charged with finding non-NAO business. ACG was set up in 1988, at a time when there were 13 components divisions with 300 product lines. As the long 1980s global motor industry boom ended, profits - based heavily on unrealistic internal GM transfer prices - evaporated. Between 1992 and this year there were a number of strategic initiatives based on a sombre evaluation of strengths and weaknesses. ACG felt that within its core businesses it had recognised good technology and quality, and in places competitive cost structures and margins as well as good relations with most other large vehicle makers. But there was also an uncomfortable number of uncompetitive operations with too many high-cost manufacturing sites, too many product lines and too great a dependence on 'captive' GM business. 'We had arrived,' recalls Mr Battenberg, 'at a strategic crossroads.' Systematic benchmarking against world-class suppliers was introduced and a target 10 per cent average growth rate set for non-NAO business. Product lines were cut to 155 from 300. In 1993, non-NAO sales hit Dollars 6.6bn, representing 27 per cent of total turnover. The target set at the start of the overhaul of reaching 30 per cent non-GM North America business by 1996 is now certain to be exceeded.</p>

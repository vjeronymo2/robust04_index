			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Soccer: Last amateurs keep faith in empty temple 'MAYBE IT'S an old-fashioned ideal,' says Martin Smith, chairman of Glasgow club Queen's Park, 'but I believe that money should not be part of sport. Football should not be about buying your way to success but about bringing up your own players and making the most of their effort and ability.' Queen's Park, nicknamed the Spiders, are Scotland's oldest and most traditional side. Smith readily admits that they are 'a bit of a strange entity.' Queen's Park, who own Scotland's huge national stadium Hampden Park, are the only truly amateur team playing in a senior, professional league anywhere. This season's lavish 125th birthday celebrations have been held as the club bumps along the bottom of the Scottish second division. There is no relegation from the division but the position is galling for a team that started at the top. The Spiders, founded in 1867, were once kings of Scottish soccer. They supplied the entire home team for the first Scotland v England international in 1872. In 1884 and 1885 they were finalists in the FA Cup in England and once went seven years without conceding a goal. The more commercial soccer has become, the more Queen's Park have fallen behind. In the last 50 years, they have failed to supply a single senior Scottish international player but former Queen's Parkers include managers Andy Roxburgh, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Brown and Ian McColl. Hampden Park, which the club built in 1903, is not only an impressive status symbol for a second division team but also a guarantee that Queen's Park will stay afloat. The club sub-lets the ground to Scottish soccer's ruling bodies for internationals and cup matches and the income, 20 to 25 per cent of net gate receipts, ensures that upkeep costs (Pounds 500,000 but likely to rise) can be met. Last year, work started on a Pounds 12m programme - paid for mainly by the Scottish Football Association, the Scottish Football League and the Football Trust - to turn Hampden into an all-seater, Taylored stadium with a 45,000 capacity. This is due to be finished in April 1994. International games have been transferred across the city to Ibrox, but the building work does not impinge on second division games, when an average crowd of about 600 finds itself sprinkled round the ageing South Stand. The mood is low-key, except when the Tannoy (designed for 100,000) blares, shaking the fans in their seats. The famous Hampden Roar is down to a whisper. Behind the scenes, the Queen's Park ethos is equality. The players are not employees, many are club members, technically 'shareholders', entitled to vote at the AGM. The boardroom is no launchpad for the personal power of the moneyed and ambitious. Even the chairman is democratically elected. The Spiders remain sticklers for tradition. They play in a '60s-style strip with black and white hooped jerseys rather than the computer-generated polyesters favoured by opponents. Queen's Park players must wear shirts outside shorts in spite of a FIFA ruling to the contrary. The Corinthian spirit was always a privilege of the upper classes and so it used to be at Hampden. Queen's Park were the Gentlemen's Team. Smith, a lawyer, says: '50 years ago, if you were from the professions, as most of them were, it would have been frowned upon to accept money to play football. Just wasn't the done thing.' Coach and ex-player Eddie Hunter - a man famous for claiming that seeing Queen's Park score is better than making love - has been with the club for 34 years. He used to go to training in his overalls after a day's work as a plumber and step into a dressing room full of men in pinstripes. 'When I came to the club as a youngster in the late '50s, it was very much bowler hat and brolly and I didn't feel part of that. 'But the barriers have come down. We now have players from across the whole spectrum, university people, bankers, lawyers, labourers, the unemployed. It used to be them and us but Martin Smith has brought the club into the '90s.' It has been more difficult to bring team performance up to date. Smith says the problems of finding good players have grown. 'It used to be football, football, football here in the west of Scotland but now people have other things to do. We run five teams but every year it becomes harder to find players of good enough quality to play. 'Professional clubs now sign players at 13 and 14, so it often follows that if you find a boy of 19 who is still amateur it's because he was never good enough in the first place.' Queen's Park's rigorous interpretation of amateur status is perhaps their greatest handicap. Not only must their players be amateur but they must never at any time have accepted money for playing football. Thus the boy, who signs for Aberdeen at 16 and does not make it, and who then becomes a reinstated amateur, no longer qualifies. There is talk among members that the club should look at the rules again. Graeme Elder, club captain for six years, says: 'The club has become a staging post for people turning pro. Players have been moving on too quickly, for their good and for ours.' But he adds: 'Queen's Park's is a happy dressing room. There's not the same bickering and back-stabbing that you get elsewhere. Players I know that have moved on to other clubs become disillusioned. They soon discover that professional football is a dirty, dirty game. 'The way things are here, everyone is in it for the good of the club. If you make a mistake in a professional team, you could be losing your mates a win bonus. Here the slate is wiped clean after a game. Money isn't a pressure.'</p>

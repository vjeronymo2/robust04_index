The Belarusian  authorities, which have created a powerful propaganda apparatus  based on the republic publications which depend on them, are now  trying to dictate their will to foreign mass media.    Representatives of the nomenklatura are expressing, directly  from the Supreme Soviet rostrum, their dissatisfaction with the  fact that some people's opinions differ from the official line  about events and processes occurring in the Republic. Last week  Valeriy Tikhinya, former secretary of the Communist Party of  Belarus Central Committee and currently one of the leaders of  the Belarusian pro-Communist people's movement, stated that  certain mass media are covering events occurring in our republic  today in a distorted and biased way. This primarily applies to  materials published in NARODNAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and  IZVESTIYA, and to the Ostankino television channel news....  This type of article, he believes, plays into the hands of  right-wing extremist and nationalistic forces, and is aimed at  destabilizing the situation in the republic.    As always in such cases, there were no specific complaints  made against the mass media. They are biased, and that is that.  One is amazed by the aplomb used in a speech by a man about  whom the ordinary citizens expressed their attitude back in  August 1991. At that time, indignation about his behavior was  so great that it overflowed into not entirely decorous forms:  When Tikhinya left the square outside Government House he had  literally been spat upon.    His thankless task was continued by Belarusian Parliament  Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb. Speaking at the 1 March session, he  accused the SVOBODA and IZVESTIYA newspapers of compromising him  as an individual and particularly as Supreme Soviet chairman.    Hryb assured everyone that the rumors about him are entirely  unfounded. At the same time, he not only did not cite any  evidence disproving them, but he did not even indicate what  exactly he was talking about. Or is it that everything that is  written about the speaker by newspapers which are not  subordinate to him does not correspond to reality?    It is indicative that 20 minutes before giving this speech,  Hryb switched off the microphone used by his predecessor  Stanislav Shushkevich, accusing him of insulting the people's  deputies. What was this about? It was about the fact that the  former chairman of the Supreme Soviet dared to remind his  colleagues about the promise to hold early parliamentary  elections in March 1994. Thus it is not only the journalists'  mouths they are trying to close.    Such speeches would be the strictly personal affair of the  people making them if it were not for two circumstances. First  of all, these are people invested with power and called upon to  observe certain standards of decency. Second, these statements  are periodically alternated with threats to refuse the  accreditation of objectionable foreign mass media and, as it  happens, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry is dealing with  accreditations right now. Meanwhile, behind the scenes in the  Supreme Soviet, reports are being actively circulated to the  effect that a group of deputies intends to address to the  Foreign Ministry a message about the expediency of giving  accreditation to IZVESTIYA and the Ostankino Television  Broadcasting Company. If this happens, the people's  representatives will primarily put themselves in a ridiculous  position. But the initiators of the planned message are  apparently not too worried about this: To make up for it, no  one will get in the way of their reviving a communist state.</p>

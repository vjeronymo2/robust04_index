			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Samsung wins approval to become vehicle maker SAMSUNG has received government approval to become South Korea's sixth vehicle maker despite protests from the domestic industry. Samsung Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding and heavy equipment subsidiary of South Korea's largest conglomerate, will begin producing heavy trucks and construction vehicles in 1994 in technical co-operation with Nissan Diesel Motor of Japan. South Korea's other vehicle producers argued that Samsung's entry will contribute to overcapacity when domestic demand for heavy trucks is falling due to a construction slowdown. Sales of heavy trucks last year amounted to 27,900 units, including 2,000 that were imported.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sears continues retailing drive SEARS' drive to focus on retailing and mail order may be finalised this year with the disposal of its Galliford house-building business. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said this could incur a further extraordinary charge this year on top of the Pounds 84m included in the interim results. All but Pounds 2m of this sum was for the shedding of men's wear through the sale, announced last week, of Fosters and Your Price to management for Pounds 1. Galliford used to contribute up to Pounds 30m a year in trading profits, but the group decided to give it up in July 1990. The only provision made then was for the carrying costs 'to avoid it impacting on the profit and loss account'. The portfolio had since been run down from Pounds 109m to Pounds 58m and Pounds 11m cash was released in the first half of this year. The original plan was 'to develop it out by July 1994'. The group was considering whether to dispose of it within the next six months, possibly via a management buy-out. Housing sales, 'tax planning' and cash generation had helped reduce net debt by Pounds 75m in July 1991 to Pounds 133m this time, gearing of 11.3 per cent. Net interest costs, however, rose to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.3m) as the amount capitalised in Galliford was cut from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2.8m. Recession finally caught up with the home shopping division, where trading profit fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 11.9m on sales of Pounds 264.9m (Pounds 249.8m). 'It hit the wall quickly last year leaving a cost overhang,' said Mr Liam Strong, chief executive. The subsequent cuts had included 300 jobs, 6 per cent of the workforce. The annual savings would amount to between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m. Sears paid Pounds 477m for the Freemans mail order business in 1988 and failed in its bid to expand it last year by buying Grattan from Next. Mr Strong said he hoped to push Freemans' annual trading profit up to more than Pounds 30m. In speciality retailing, women's wear was the biggest contributor with Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.6m) profit on sales of Pounds 243.6m (Pounds 214m). Miss Selfridge - which claims 20 per cent of the disco clothing market - and Wallis, aimed at 25 to 35-year-olds, had performed strongly. Selfridges department store in London, which has a division to itself, enhanced its productivity in a period of sluggish sales caused by a lack of tourists. Trading profit rose to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.9m) on sales of Pounds 94.6m (Pounds 92.7m).</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Avoidance of VAT on fuel bills is no joke Sir, The portrayal of the devil in your article 'Dodge that VAT' (March 19) was not without deeper significance. Surely there is something evil about a society that allows the wealthier members to escape taxation, by means of advanced payment for fuel in this case, yet insists that those poorer members must pay the tax in full. The call by John Major, the prime minister, to return to basic values has a hollow ring if it does not begin by each of us accepting our responsibility as citizens to pay our taxes. I wonder what would be the response of the Inland Revenue if I offered to pay my mortgage in advance for five years to ensure continuing relief at 25 per cent? One law for the rich and another for the poor is no April fool's joke - despite the date on the cartoon calender. Roy D Bennett, (chaplain, University Hospital Nottingham), The Yews, 225 Edwards Lane, Sherwood, Nottingham NG5 6EQ</p>

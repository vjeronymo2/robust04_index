			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck campaign boost THE campaign of Mr Robert Monks, an investor activist, to win a contested seat on the board of Sears, Roebuck, the largest US retailer, was boosted yesterday. The California Public Employees Retirement Systems (Calpers), a large pension fund holding 2.3m shares in Sears, Roebuck, said it would cast its votes for Mr Monks. He has been fighting for a seat on the Sears, Roebuck board because he claims the company, which has been struggling financially, has earned an inadequate return on shareholders' equity. Last year, Sears Roebuck's return on equity was only about 7 per cent.</p>

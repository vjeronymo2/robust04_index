			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / BR sell-off plans 'could force 15% fare rises' RAIL fares could rise by as much as 15 per cent next year if the government presses ahead with its plans to privatise British Rail, the main passengers' watchdog warned yesterday. BR has warned the Department of Transport that splitting the rail network into 25 regional operations in preparation for their eventual sell-off would create extra costs requiring fare increases of up to 10 per cent. But Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the passengers' watchdog, said that these extra costs were likely to be 'on top of any fare increase that BR might propose for its own purposes'. He said: 'BR has often made above-inflation fare increases. If the cost of privatisation adds 10 per cent, then the total could be as much as 15 per cent.' Mr Patterson added: 'It is a source of considerable concern to us that the direct consequences (of privatisation) could lead to fare increases of this order when inflation is below 2 per cent.' Labour yesterday demanded an urgent government statement on fare increases. Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour frontbench transport spokesman, said privatisation was 'a monstrous scheme which offers nothing to the travelling public except higher fares and inconvenience'. BR will make no decision on next year's fare increases for a further three months, but discussion documents at the Department of Transport are understood to warn that fares might have to rise by 5 per cent to 10 per cent by next May, with some increases in January. 'There is a lot of difference between theoretical discussions and actual plans,' BR said yesterday. 'But restructuring will lead to additional costs, and those costs have to be met from some quarter.' Critics of rail privatisation have long warned that fares could rise after the network is sold off, but BR is warning of fare increases even before then. The break-up of the network would lead to duplication of overheads and other costs, with the new regional operators competing for higher shares of funding. The Department of Transport refused to discuss the documents yesterday but said they were 'officials' working-group papers which would not have been seen by ministers. They do not represent policy.' Mr Patterson said that 'discussion documents have a habit of becoming policy documents'. He was concerned by reports that discussion documents proposed that competition should be introduced on key routes between different operators by restricting the inter-availability of some tickets. Passengers would face restrictions on some lines on travelling out with one operator and returning with a different one, and might have to pay twice to do so. Other proposals are that only 400 of the UK's 2,400 stations would sell tickets for journeys throughout the UK. Meanwhile, the passenger watchdog will announce this week that complaints about BR services rose again last year.</p>

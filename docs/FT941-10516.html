			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Outlaw upwards-only provisions on commercial rents Sir, Now that there are signs of recovery in the property market it might be worth considering again the sense and legality of upwards-only rent review provisions in commercial leases. It has been the consistent practice of landlords and their agents in the last 25 years to insist on upwards-only rent review provisions. I am aware of no significant exceptions since 1966. I have seen two booms and their respective collapses from 1973 and 1989. In the recent 1980s boom, the premium for space in the City of London was so high and the imposition of upwards-only rent reviews so remorseless that one might be tempted to conclude there was a conspiracy. The subsequent crash, however, accompanied by high interest rates, found tenants with falling revenues locked into upwards-only clauses which prevented rentals reflecting market trends. The consequence has been insolvency for many, so aggravating the recession, and a considerable amount of unlet space at rents less than half the boom-year peak. This agony prompts one to discount the conspiracy theory. At present, upwards-only rent review clauses are enforceable on grounds that they are part of a freely negotiated commercial bargain by the parties. This is rubbish. Tenants locked into high rents that are unaffordable in a recession suffer a powerful restraint on trade. In recent negotiations, rentals are enticingly low. Yet the upwards-only rent review emerges unharmed. There are some deals that modify it, but I submit these are rare and, as the market goes up, the old habit will be reinforced again. As the damage to businesses and profitability both for tenants and landlords has been so obvious in recent years, surely the time has come to outlaw upwards-only rent review provisions. Some may argue that abolition will damage the balance sheets of property companies and the banks and institutions which lend to them. Recent events should show these banks and institutions the folly of favouring one small group of customers over the majority - the tenants. Regrettably, however, the lessons have not been learnt. Legislation is the only way to end this pernicious practice. V A G Tregear, Bentleys, Stokes &amp; Lowless, International House, 1 St Katharine's Way, London E1 9YL</p>

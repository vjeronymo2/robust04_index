			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley urges move on Maxwell cash MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday increased pressure on trustees and others to take urgent action to disentangle the amounts available to the various Maxwell pension schemes. He also warned that he did not intend to provide further government help for the pensioners. He told MPs on the cross-party social security committee that he had made no provision in his departmental budget next year for further assistance to the pensioners, and spoke of a 'growing sense of impatience' that, more than a year after the scandal had broken, the Pounds 100m-plus in the Common Investment Fund had still not been allocated. Latest estimates of the realised or realisable value of the fund are about Pounds 140m, of which more than Pounds 97m is still under dispute. 'I hope that trustees, liquidators and lawyers and others trying to reach agreement will have a renewed sense of urgency,' Mr Lilley said. 'It would be wrong to assume that this can be allowed to linger and that the taxpayer will foot the bill.' Under pressure himself from Mr David Shaw, one of the Tory committee members, he insisted that the focus of attention should be the fund. Mr Patrick Harrex of Law Debenture Corporation, trustee of the Maxwell Communication pension plan, said Mr Lilley's remarks were 'rather simplistic although understandable'. 'All the trustees are certainly working very closely to do something,' he said. 'We are as keen as anyone to draw the money out. But there are a small number of very significant transactions which need to be disentangled.' He said it was almost inevitable that there would need to be legal action between the trustees of the different pensions funds to determine ownership. He expected this to take up to one year to resolve, but discussions were well advanced on a mechanism to use money from the fund in the meantime. About Pounds 1m remained from the Pounds 2.5m set aside by the government to provide a 'drip feed' for the pension funds until the money in the fund could be allocated, Mr Lilley said.</p>

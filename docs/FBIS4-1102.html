			<p>BFN     [Text] Lome, 21 Apr (AFP) -- Seven people, including three  from the opposition, have announced their candidacy for  legislative by-elections, which will be held on 15 and 29 May in  three Togolese constituencies, it was learned today from the  Interior Ministry. The results of the February poll were  invalidated in these three constituencies by the Supreme Court  as a result of "disturbances" observed during the second round,  and the "ineligibility" of the deputies' alternates. These  three polls saw the victory of opposition candidates -- two from  the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and one from the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD]. At the end of the elections, the  opposition had obtained an absolute majority -- 43 out of 81  seats -- at the National Assembly.    The Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] -- the former single  ruling party -- is presenting a candidate in each of the three  constituencies, while the Alliance of Democrats for the  Republic, which did not obtain any seat in February, is  presenting one candidate in the first constituency of Oti. The  opposition, after contesting the Supreme Court's decision,  finally agreed to present candidates "as a safeguard." The UTD  and the CAR presented single candidates in the three  constituencies -- one for the UTD and two for the CAR.    Since the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the  election  of the opposition deputies, there has been an impasse in  negotiations to select the future prime minister, who, according  to the Togolese Constitution, must come from the parliamentary  majority. However, President Eyadema has again met -- twice  early this week -- with CAR Chairman Yao Agboyibor, as part of  consultations undertaken since 15 March.</p>

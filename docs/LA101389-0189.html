			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LAKERS MIFFED, WAIVE DAILEY  </P> <P> The Lakers, refusing to put up with Quintin Dailey's "unconscionable" behavior,  waived the veteran guard today, one day after he apparently overslept and  missed practice.  </P> <P> The Lakers signed the former University of San Francisco star as a free agent  on Sept. 12 but were displeased with his performance and work habits in  training camp. Dailey was cut even though his contract, reportedly worth  $400,000, is guaranteed.  </P> <P> "Our team is undergoing a major transitional period at this time, and we feel  it has become apparent that Quintin is not fitting in," General Manager Jerry  West said in a statement.  </P> <P> "We are making this move at this time to give him a better opportunity with  another team, and we wish him continued success on and off the basketball  court."  </P> <P> Dailey, 28, began camp by missing the Lakers' flight to Honolulu, then did not  show for a team meeting. He left the opening practice early and failed to  appear for a 9 a.m. practice Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Money Markets: Jitters push up rates RATES soared in a frenzied UK money market yesterday, as news of Labour's firm lead in the opinion polls sank in. A batch of polls on Tuesday night put Labour between four and 7 per cent ahead of the Conservatives, enough to give Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, an overall majority this time next week in the general election. The news 'fired the market into life', as one dealer put it, after several sleepy days in which the polls showed no decisive lead. During the day the three-month sterling interbank rate - the key guide to the level of base rates - firmed   3/8 of a point to just above 11 per cent, compared with a base rate of 10.5 per cent. It closed at 11 1/4 - 1/8 , anticipating more than a mere half-point rise in base rates after the election to support the pound. At the longer end, rates also firmed. The one year rate rose from 11 1/8 -11 per cent to 11 3/8 - 5/16 . The June sterling contract dropped from an opening 88.86 to 88.77 in high volumes of trading. The Bank of England gave the money market Pounds 350m of assistance in the morning, having revised its forecast liquidity shortage from Pounds 500m to Pounds 350m. It bought Pounds 365m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon, but again revised its forecast liquidity shortage, this time to Pounds 300m. The only consolation for the market was a flood of cheap money. Discount houses filled up with money that was being 'chucked around' at 10 per cent in the first half of the morning. The overnight rate, having firmed to around 10 1/2 - 1/4 per cent for a brief spell, slid down to 9 1/8 -8 5/8 after the Bank revised its forecast at midday. It closed at 10 1/4 - 1/8 . German call money remained stuck near the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate after the Bundesbank took a relatively large DM9.4bn of liquidity from the banks with this week's securities repurchase transaction. Dealers quoted call money at 9.65/70 per cent, unchanged from Tuesday. The US Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system with overnight system repurchase agreements. The intervention had been expected by economists because of firmness in the Federal Funds Rate at the end of the two-week reserve maintenance period.</p>

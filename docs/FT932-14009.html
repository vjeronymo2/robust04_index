			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cuts sought in housing benefit budget HOUSING BENEFIT has emerged as a main target for savings in the government's fundamental review of the Pounds 80bn social security budget. Two of the most likely changes are increasing the rate at which housing benefit is withdrawn as someone's income rises above eligibility for the maximum benefit, and making tenants who receive some housing benefit bear some of the cost of rent increases. The government estimates that making the 'taper', the rate at which the benefit is withdrawn, 80 per cent rather than 65 per cent would save Pounds 240m a year. It is, however, unlikely that people who are eligible to have all their rent paid through housing benefit would be required to make a contribution. Changes to the subsidy payable to housing associations to 'claw back' some money from that quarter also look less likely, especially given the increased emphasis since the Autumn Statement on housing associations raising private-sector funding. High-level officials from the Department of Social Security, the Department of the Environment and the Treasury are examining ways to cut spending on the benefit. The group was set up last year but has become part of the Treasury's public-spending review, which is intended to yield savings as early as next year's expenditure, as well as setting a longer-term path for curbing departmental budgets. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said yesterday that no area of his department's budget would be ruled out of the review, but said that changes would be introduced gradually. 'There will be no big bang,' he told the Commons social security committee. He said officials were examining the increased take-up in benefits, and studying how long people were drawing benefit and comparing this with previous years. Ministers' decisions would be focused on targeting benefits to those most in need - encouraging personal independence, withdrawing state benefits where they were no longer appropriate, improving incentives to work and reducing the scope for fraud. Mr Lilley said that the most scope for radical reform lay in the streamlining of the delivery of benefits. Eventually, this could lead to changes in the structure of benefit with people being assessed for all their needs at one time. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said that Mr Lilley's evidence to the committee about departmental spending had left millions of low-income households still in the dark about how the government planned to compensate them for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.</p>

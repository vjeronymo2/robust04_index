			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general rules for assessing civil penalties for violations before the enactment of the CPAA Act are found in &sect;13.16 of the FAR. These rules remain in effect for all actions arising from violations that occurred before August 26, 1992. These rules will remain in effect for all actions arising from violations occurring after that date, except for violations by persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, and repairmen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a person charged with a violation under &sect;13.16 requests a hearing, the rules of practice in Part 13, Subpart G govern the proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13.16(a) of the FAA currently contains a partial list of the statutory provisions authorizing the FAA to assess civil penalties. The FAA proposes to expand that list to provide more information. Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(1) would describe the statutory provisions that give the FAA authority to assess civil penalties. Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(2) would specify the amounts of the penalties that may be assessed. There may be other civil penalty provisions that may apply on occasion, and when necessary this authority is used to assess civil penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(1) describes the FAA's general statutory authority for assessing civil penalties. Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(1)(i) states that under section 905 of the FAAct, in effect on July 31, 1992 (before section 905 expired), the FAA may assess a civil penalty for violations occurring before August 26, 1992, for violations of the FAAct. Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(1)(ii) states that under section 901(a)(3) of the FAAct, in effect on July 31, 1992, the FAA may assess a civil penalty for a violation of title V of the FAAct (which relates to the registration of aircraft and recordation of aircraft ownership) occurring before August 26, 1992. Section 905 of the FAAct was repealed by section 2(b) of the CPAA Act, and section 901(a)(3) was amended by section 2(a) of the CPAA Act. Section 2(c) of the CPAA Act, however, provides that sections 901(a)(3) and 905 of the FAAct as they existed on July 31, 1992, continue in effect with respect to violations of the FAAct occurring before August 26, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;13.16(a)(1)(iii) states that under section 901(a)(3) of the FAAct, the FAA may assess civil penalties against persons other than those acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, or repairmen, for violations occurring on or after August 26, 1992. This provision applies to violations of title III, V, VI, or XII or section 1101 of 1115(e)(2)(B) of the FAAct or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder. This is the authority granted in section 2(a) of the CPAA Act. In addition, this section applies to violations of section 901(c) and 901(d) of the FAAct occurring on or after October 31, 1992, the date of the technical amendment cited above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

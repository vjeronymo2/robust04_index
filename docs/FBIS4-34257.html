			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, President Salinas said there is a  national consensus on peace. He said the negative position the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has expressed in  Chiapas is more a political issue than a social problem.    [Begin Salinas recording] The peace process continues, and  local organizations must ensure smooth progress. Allow me to  say the efforts of the peace commissioner and the mediator have  paved the way for the San Cristobal negotiations and certified  the cease-fire. Their job was quite satisfactory and  constituted a starting point for continued progress.    Allow me to say that despite not having a formal peace  agreement yet, it is noteworthy to mention the cease-fire is  still in effect, and both sides do prefer a political solution  for peace. These two things, the cease-fire and the political  solution, have been achieved. They confirm the strategy we  chose to deal with the problem from the very beginning was in  fact the correct one.    We have managed to build a national consensus in favor of  peace. The EZLN's response seems to come from a more political  decision than as the result of social or justice analyses. The  federal government reaffirms the following:    1. We will proceed to ensure military security in the area  and guarantee national sovereignty over the territory.    2. Current social programs will be reinforced,  particularly for health and supplies.    3. Government institutions, organizations, parties, and  society in general will participate in the continuing debate on  the country's political and democratic progress, in accordance  with the law.

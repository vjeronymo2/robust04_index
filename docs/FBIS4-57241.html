			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All names as published] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 15 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Security  Minister Juan Diego Castro reported that the Costa Rican  Government has asked Nicaragua for "explanations" on the capture  of two motor boats carrying tourists by a Sandinist People's  Army (EPS) patrol on Saturday in Costa Rican Caribbean  territorial waters.    The two boats captured off the Barra del Colorado coast, 240  km northeast of San Jose, had a Costa Rican crew and were  carrying foreign tourists engaged in deep-sea fishing, when they  were intercepted and towed to the port of Bluefields, in  Nicaragua, the minister said.    Castro said the Costa Rican Government asked the Nicaraguan  Government for "explanations" and the "immediate return of the  boats and their crew." The Costa Rican Government also sent the  Nicaraguan Government a report drafted by witnesses who observed  the EPS maneuvers from a small airplane.    The boats were towed to Bluefilelds in Nicaragua, "and so  far, we have not received any news on the whereabouts of the  tourists or the boats' crews," Castro said today.    The minister added that the EPS soldiers went about 1,500  meters inside the high-seas territorial waters, where they  stayed for approximately two hours inspecting identity documents  of several boats anchored off the Barra del Colorado coast.    The boat "Bull Shark" was piloted by Costa Rican citizens  Luis Torres and Wallace Bryan and their passengers were  identified as Erick Beacker, Brian Broheart, and Jean Carl  Becquer.    The other captured boat is the "Guapote," which was piloted  by Captain Roberto Brown. It was carrying foreign tourists who  were identified by the police as Frank Vanbenbourgh and Ted  Mosinut. The authorities did not reveal their nationalities.</p>

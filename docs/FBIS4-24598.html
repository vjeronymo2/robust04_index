			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station correspondents Duoyou (1122 1429) and </F> Zhadun (2089 7319) over video; from the "Regional News Hookup"  program]    [Text] At the invitation of the Lhasa Customs Department,  a six-member Nepalese customs delegation led by Nepalese Customs  Department Director Mr. (Ubudeya) began on 21 May a visit to the  Lhasa, Xigaze, and Nyalam customs offices.    The Nepalese customs delegation's main mission for this trip  was to attend the eighth round of border talks between Chinese  and Nepalese customs departments. During the talks, the two  customs departments exchanged their experience in collecting  customs duties, checking smuggling, and other work over recent  years; briefed each other on last year's work; and exchanged  views on sharing information to jointly prohibit smuggling.    During their visit, the entire delegation was accorded a  reception by regional people's government Vice Chairman Gyamco.  The delegation will return to Nepal by plane on 28 May.    This round of border talks deepened the understanding and  friendship between Chinese and Nepalese customs departments and  was conducive to developing Sino-Nepalese border trade and  solving trade problems.</p>

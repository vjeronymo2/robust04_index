			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IRVINE HOLDS OFF DANA HILLS' LATE RALLIES  </P> <P> It was a day of almosts for the Dana Hills High School baseball team against  Irvine Tuesday in the South Coast League.  </P> <P> Dana Hills nearly overcame a 3-0 deficit with rallies in the sixth and seventh  innings. Lance Marks, the Dolphins' slugging catcher, came close to becoming  Orange County's career home run leader.  </P> <P> But in the end, Dana Hills' playoff chances disappeared and Marks will have to  wait to set the record after a 3-2 loss to Irvine.  </P> <P> It was the fifth one-run loss in league play for Dana Hills (13-11-1, 7-7).  Irvine (13-12, 8-6) needs another victory against Dana Hills Thursday to clinch  third place with Mission Viejo a half-game behind.  </P> <P> "This is a competitive group, and I'm proud as hell of them, but you've got to  win some of those one-run games to make the playoffs," said Bob Canary, Dana  Hills coach. "It's very disappointing."  </P> <P> Marks entered the game tied with former Valencia standout Andy Ruscitto as the  county's career home run leader with 22. He went two for three and had a long  fly ball caught at the warning track in center in the third inning.  </P> <P> Marks hit an 0-2 fastball into a strong wind that held it up long enough for  Irvine center fielder Mike Booker, who caught it about two feet in front of the  fence.  </P> <P> Marks will get another chance at the record Thursday and needs only one hit to  reach 100 career hits in three seasons.  </P> <P> Mike Seal (6-7) established a school record for Irvine by striking out six  batters, giving him 94 for the season. Rodney Poissant set the school mark of  93 in 1983.  </P> <P> "Mike is the best 6-7 pitcher in the county," said Bob Flint, Irvine coach.  "Mike and Bob Hamelin are the two best competitors I have coached at Irvine.  Nobody else comes close."  </P> <P> Although Marks failed to hit the homer, Flint endorsed the senior for the  league's most valuable player award.  </P> <P> "He's the best athlete in the league," Flint said. "He's a bona fide draft  choice with a great future ahead of him."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 5, San Clemente 0 -- Steve Evans (7-5) pitched a three-hitter and  had seven strikeouts to lead host Mission Viejo (10-11-2, 7-6-1). Lee Williams  hit a three-run home run in the second and Don Disbro had two hits and an RBI.  </P> <P> El Toro 4, Capistrano Valley 3 -- Greg Pearce (6-2) pitched a seven-hitter and  Chris Sauritch had two hits to lead host El Toro (19-6, 11-3). El Toro clinched  the league title last week.  </P></p>

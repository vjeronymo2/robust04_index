			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / World News in Brief: Market pins hopes on base rates cut This week has seen a recovery of 31.9 points in the FT-SE 100 index, fuelled largely by hopes that chancellor Kenneth Clarke will sanction a cut in base rates in his Mansion House speech to the City on Tuesday. The index closed last night at 2,861.8, up 1.8 on the day after moderate trading. London Stock Exchange, Page 17; Lex, Page 26</p>

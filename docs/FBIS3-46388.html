			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Zhou </F> Hongyang (0719 3126 3152): "Grain: From 200 to 456.4 Billion Kg"]    [Text] Food is the first necessity of the people, and  grain is the foundation of food. The Chinese people in  particular realize the truth in this because they have led  difficult lives owing to grain shortages for considerably long  periods of time.    Some 30 years ago, we were proud of our lofty aspirations  that "we may make the land yield as much grain as we wish so  long as we are bold enough to command it," and we were also  delighted at the "good news" that "10,000 jin or even 100,000  jin of grain was reaped per mu." However, in 1958, a year full  of vigor and dynamism, the total grain yield throughout the  country was only 200 billion kg. After that, we worked hard  unflinchingly to strive for the targets of 200, 250, and 400 kg  per unit area yield in different regions as stipulated in the  National Program for Agricultural Development. But, it was not  until 20 long years had passed that the country's grain output  was raised to the level of 300 billion kgs.    The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee  lifted the curtain of China's rural reform, under which the  contract responsibility system on a household basis with  remuneration linked to output was universally practiced like a  spring tide which pushed forward substantial increases in grain  yields. Document No. 1 of the Party Central Committee discussed  the agricultural issue for five consecutive years from 1982. In  1984, China's grain yield hit a record high by breaking through  the level of 400 billion kgs, and per capita grain possession  approached 400 kgs for the first time.    The total yield of 400 billion kgs considerably mitigated  the  contradiction between demand and supply of grain in China. In  the few years that followed, given some short periods of  fluctuation, demand and supply were relatively stable, and great  ups and downs did not occur in the markets. Even in 1991 when  China was seriously afflicted by floods, demand and supply were  basically balanced, and grain prices in the market were stable.  The year 1993 once again saw brilliant achievements in grain  production as output reached 456.4 billion kg. What needs to be  pointed out is that, while guaranteeing the grain production  level, peasants have paid greater attention to grain quality,  with the proportion of refined and quality grain substantially  enhanced, which is quite different from the past. Counties in  which grain yield per mu exceeds 1 ton have emerged not only in  the south, but also in northern provinces, including Shandong,  Henan, and so on.    Of course, in order to achieve the goal of 500 billion kg --  total grain yield per year -- by the end of the century, greater  efforts are still necessary. Compared with countries that are  rich in per capita land resources, our per capita possession of  grain is still very low and, compared with countries with high  agricultural production levels, the gap is rather big in terms  of per unit area yield. However, since the old structure which  hindered growth of the productive forces in grain has been  broken, we are able to make limited land yield more grain so  long as we have appropriate policies and powerful measures.</p>

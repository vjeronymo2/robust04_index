			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Time to ban opinion polls during elections Sir, From merely anecdotal evidence (no stratified sampling, I'm afraid), I tend to conclude that I am not alone in wishing that opinion polls should be banned during electioneering. It is not only that they turn what should be a tug-of-war into something more like the Boat Race, with all the misleading consequences that that entails. They are also a colossal bore. Your contributor Joe Rogaly's articles over the past few weeks have devoted more space to analysing and commenting on the polls than they have to the parties, policies and personalities concerned. That, at any rate, is the impression they make on one constant reader (myself). If Mr Rogaly is still writing for you at the next general election, and if the polls have not been banned, I hope that he will ignore them, and write about what the poll-bemused politicians frequently referred to last night as 'the real world'.

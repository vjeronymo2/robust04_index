			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Yen's strength batters Canon CANON, the Japanese copier and camera maker, is to seek further operating activities abroad. Yesterday, it blamed the strength of the yen for a 61 per cent slide in interim pre-tax profits, to Y15.54bn (Dollars 151m). Sales were down just 2.6 per cent, at Y493.9bn, for the six months to June. The company said the rise in the yen over the period had a Y50bn negative effect on export revenues, which it managed in part to cover through price increases and cost cuts. Canon is to seek ways to transfer research and development, as well as production bases, overseas. It also wants to open joint ventures with companies abroad. The company already has research centres in Britain, France, the US and Australia, and manufactures in several countries. Its only area of revenue growth in the half-year was in computer peripherals. Copiers were slightly lower, but camera sales fell by a quarter. Net earnings fell 48.1 per cent to Y11.58bn. For the full year, it is maintaining an earlier forecast of a 0.3 per cent dip in sales, to Y1,060bn; pre-tax profits down 50.7 per cent to Y38bn; and net earnings 48.1 per cent weaker at Y21bn. The dividend is being held at Y12.50, of which Y6.25 is being paid now. Cosmo Securities, the financially-troubled Japanese second-tier broker, is to issue 243.75m new shares worth Y78bn in a third party allotment to Daiwa Bank. Daiwa announced last week it would rescue Cosmo, which last year made an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn. The bank will buy the stocks at Y320 per share.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Romanian government wins crucial vote in parliament Romania's four-month-old minority government yesterday survived a vote of no confidence brought by pro-reform opposition parties unhappy with the pace and depth of the country's transition to a market economy, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. With the support of nationalists and ex-communist parties, the left-wing Democratic National Salvation Front government defeated the no confidence motion by 260 to 192 votes. Opposition parties brought the motion last week after the government presented its four-year governing strategy but refused to allow parliament to vote on it. The opposition said the strategy failed to specify measures to restructure and stem economic decline, and criticised the government for aiming to raise state involvement in managing market reform - a 'dirigism' which, it said, showed the government did not understand the workings of a market economy.</p>

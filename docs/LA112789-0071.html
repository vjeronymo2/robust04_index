			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO LA VERNE PLAYERS INJURED IN CRASH  </P> <P> Two men's basketball players from the University of La Verne were seriously  injured, one critically, in an auto accident on the Pomona Freeway Sunday  morning in Ontario.  </P> <P> Jeff Schroeder, a junior, and Andre Purry, a senior, were injured when Purry  apparently lost control of his car on a rain-soaked portion of the highway. It  skidded into the center divider and careened into an embankment.  </P> <P> Schroeder, a passenger in the car, was taken to San Antonio Community Hospital  in Upland, where a spokesman said he is in critical condition with head  injuries. Purry was listed in serious but stable condition at Ontario Community  Hospital.  </P> <P> Roland Ortmayer, athletic director at La Verne, said Schroeder suffered massive  head injuries. He said Purry apparently has a spinal injury, although "they  don't think there's any paralysis."  </P> <P> The players had been returning from a basketball tournament at UC San Diego in  La Jolla, where La Verne had competed Saturday night.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said the shock of the accident was starting to settle on the school.  </P> <P> "It's just a very, very tough situation," he said. "We're dealing with our  psychologists to help the coaches and team members as much as possible. We  can't do anything about the tragedy, but we're trying to deal with the  psychological aspects as best as we can."  </P> <P> Both players are transfers from NCAA Division I schools. Purry, a 6-foot-6  forward who has been among La Verne's leading scorers, played at Cal State Long  Beach and was an All-CIF Southern Section selection at Long Beach Poly High.  Schroeder, a 6-3 guard, transferred from the University of Minnesota.  </P></p>

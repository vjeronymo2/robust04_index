			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> f. Merchandise which cannot be located or released without permit is returned to Customs custody.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Defaults Not Involving Merchandise; Modified CF 5955A. Defaults not involving merchandise shall be processed in accordance with the following guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Modified CF 5955A. Notices of liquidated damages incurred may be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petition for relief. The bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Maximum Assessments. In cases involving violations which do not involve merchandise which are assessed at $1,000 for each business day that the violation continues, a maximum of $10,000 shall be assessed for any one such continuing violation unless the district director can articulate a legitimate enforcement purpose for exceeding said limit. These claims shall be cancelled in conformance with the terms of these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Clerical Error. If the breach resulted from clerical error, the claim may be cancelled without payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Negligence. If the breach resulted from negligence, the claim may be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $250 per default actually assessed, depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. For example, if a document is filed 100 days late, Customs, by policy, will generally limit the assessment to $10,000. Mitigation will be based on the $10,000 actual assessment and not relate to the $100,000 potential assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Intentional violation. If the breach was intentional, no relief shall be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand. The modified form should not be offered in any situation where the district director anticipates that substantial factual or legal issues may be raised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed.

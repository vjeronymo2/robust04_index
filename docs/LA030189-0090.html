			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFECT AMMUNITION FOR CHARACTER ASSASSINATION  </P> <P> Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) voted against John Tower in the Armed Services  Committee because, although there is no "smoking gun," the ground is covered  with "empty cartridges." And Wirth worries that rumors (cartridges?) of Tower's  "womanizing" set an "example" that might cause women in the military to be  "discriminated against."  </P> <P> Wirth will not talk about specifics because that would be "unfair." We know  everyone is trying to be fair.  </P> <P> Regarding the allegations, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) stresses quantity over  quality. He voted against Tower because the "allegations" (cartridges?) come  "from a great many unconnected sources."  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), another quantity man, is impressed that "the  firestorm of allegations" has not stopped. Many allegations are, he says,  merely "rumors and innuendo," but (read this carefully) "other allegations  offer cause for considerable alarm." Does Dixon think they are true? All he  says is: "There may not be a smoking gun, but there is an abundance of smoke."  Smoking cartridges, perhaps?  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) says the "effectiveness" of an officeholder depends on  "perceptions" and in Tower's case, "They may not be fair -- I agree with that  -- may not be fact. But the perceptions are there." Thus a confirmation process  that began purporting to pursue the truth ends by declaring the truth  irrelevant.  </P> <P> However, Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) explains that we are witnessing senatorial  idealism: "We ought to be looking for the very best we can find in the nation.  The President has the right to go out and find that person, but the Senate has  an obligation to determine whether, in fact, this is the best we can find out  there in the whole country." So the Senate's ("we") preferences are at least of  equal weight with those of the man who wins the presidential election.  </P> <P> Adding them up, the reasons for rejecting Tower include: alleged drunkenness  that no senator serving with Tower claims to have ever seen, but which most  Democrats now say they believe on the basis of reports (cartridges?) gathered  by the FBI. Undefined and undocumented "womanizing." The "appearance" of  "conflicts of interest" (more about which in a moment). And the Senate's thirst  for "the best."  </P> <P> A rule: In Washington, when four reasons are given for doing something, the  real reason is none of the four.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) was most worried about Tower's use of alcohol. Then Tower  pledged not to touch it. Then Nunn changed his emphasis. Nunn was clear about  only what he was not saying. "I'm not saying," he said, that Tower as a private  consultant improperly gave information to defense contractors. But "it's the  appearance that is so bad."  </P> <P> Now, is it really asking too much to ask Nunn, who has rendered an emphatic  judgment on Tower, to be comparably clear about his reasons for the judgment?  It is simply smarmy for him to issue these simpering disclaimers ("I'm not  saying . . . ") while destroying a man's reputation, career and life with  studied ambiguities.  </P> <P> Does Nunn think Tower today has an alcohol problem? Has Nunn decided that Tower  behaved unethically as a consultant? If Nunn cannot decide, he should defer to  the presidential decision on Tower.  </P> <P> "I'm in a hopeless situation," Nunn says, because he cannot reveal his reasons  for trashing Tower. FBI reports are confidential. They also are often  confusing, contradictory and inconclusive. Because the White House has  characterized the reports differently than Nunn has, Nunn has threatened to  reopen the hearings and subpoena people for testimony under oath. That, he  says, would be "unfortunate."  </P> <P> Oh? For whom? Not Tower, who can hardly be more injured.  </P> <P> If it is fair to judge Tower for "appearances," it is as fair to note that Nunn  "appears" to be taking this personally. As Nunn likes to say, I'm not saying  that he is. But there is a "perception" that this is simply a power struggle.  The perception may be unfair, but we know how seriously Nunn and his allies  take perceptions.  </P> <P> Some Democrats are behaving the way some Republicans did between 1949 and 1952,  when they had been too long without the sobering responsibility of executive  power. As Democrats bandy "allegations," try something. Try substituting the  phrase "allegations of communist sympathies" for "allegations of alcohol abuse"  (or "womanizing" or "conflicts of interest"). Then see what you think of the  flavor of this senatorial high-mindedness. As some earlier senators (McCarthy  and Jenner and others) understood, empty cartridges are the perfect ammunition  for character assassinations.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Communists Planning To Put Their Opponents Against the </F> Wall"]    [Text] On 31 March, the Communist Party candidates for the  office of deputy to the Supreme Council of Ukraine who made it  to the second round of elections in Kharkiv Oblast held a press  conference. Among those appearing at the conference were  Anatoliy Sereda, leader of "Working Kharkiv," Anatoliy  Perepylytsya, head of the "Union of Communists," and Alla  Alyeksandrovska, second secretary of the oblast committee of the  CPU.    The results of the first round of voting were described as a  victory for the CPU, and they stated that they expected to win  the elections.    Responding to a question regarding what he would do in  parliament if elected, A. Sereda said that he would "be in  charge of repressions and work in the Cheka." He did not specify  against whom these repressions would be carried out, but a shout  rang out from the audience: "The first people we will put up  against the wall will be Khmara and Chornovil, then ravchuk and  Plyushch, and all speculators, businessmen, and you  correspondents." Following this shouted remark, most journalists  left the press conference.    Ivan Latin, docent of the agricultural institute and a  candidate for the office of deputy to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine, answering a question from one of the few remaining  journalists regarding whether repressions against businessmen  would not result in increasing the number of beggars in Ukraine,  replied: "The more beggars there are in Ukraine, the more  communism and socialism there will be."</p>

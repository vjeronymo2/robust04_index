			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Toyota warns of continued decline Toyota, the leading Japanese carmaker, forecast yesterday that its earnings would 'bottom out' in the current financial year to the end of June 1994. 'We believe that Toyota then can achieve a gradual upturn in earnings,' said Mr Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota executive vice-president responsible for finance. However, he warned that growth in Japan would be slow, and the domestic industry would have to be restructured. 'Growth will be slower than the growth we took for granted in the 1970s and 1980s. Automakers will not share equally in that growth.' With 11 domestic vehicle makers, the Japanese industry was 'pretty crowded', said Mr Okuda. 'If the yen remains strong and domestic demand remains weak, not all of these automakers will survive in their present form.' Toyota's pre-tax profits declined by 25 per cent in the year to the end of June, to Y322.2bn (Dollars 3bn), and are forecast to fall steeply again this year under pressure from the sharp appreciation of the yen and the continuing decline in the domestic Japanese market. Mr Okuda forecast that by 1995-96 (the year to June 1996) Toyota would have restored its pre-tax earnings to the level of 1991-92, when they totalled Y427.9bn. Toyota would need another year of strenuous efforts to cut costs to offset the impact of the strong yen, Mr Okuda told financial analysts in London. Cost-savings achieved through streamlining operations and reductions in fixed costs had amounted to Y160bn in the last financial year, he said. He forecast Toyota's growth would be strong in emerging markets such as south-east Asia, where the group has sold more than 300,000 cars and trucks in the last financial year, to claim market share of around 20 per cent. This week it is establishing a finance subsidiary in Thailand. New car sales in Japan, which have been falling for three years in succession, were expected to begin to recover in 1994, said Mr Okuda. He said Toyota did not plan any redundancies in Japan. To streamline production, it was cutting the number of its model specifications by 20 per cent, and component variations by 30 per cent. Toyota had the strongest financial position in the world auto industry, he claimed, with total liquid assets with a book value of Y2,100bn. In addition, the Toyota group's securities portfolio had a hidden reserve (the market value in excess of the book value) of Y1,600bn. Toyota will begin UK output of a hatchback version of its Carina E next month. UK production will reach 400 units a day, or an annual rate of 100,000 during the first half of 1994.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Shares fall worldwide on fears for Japanese economy By STEFAN WAGSTYL, EMIKO TERAZONO, PETER MARSH, DAVID BARCHARD and KAREN ZAGOR SHARE PRICES fell sharply in Japan, Europe and the US yesterday amid fears about the international repercussions of the faltering Japanese economy. Investors showed concern that financially troubled Japanese banks could reduce their lending to other parts of the developed world, adding to the risks of a global economic slowdown. Worries on this score were particularly marked in Europe, which has benefited in recent years from large inward investments from Japan. A reduction in lending could particularly affect growth prospects in countries such as Britain and France which are in economic difficulties. There is also nervousness that the mounting problems in Japan could hold back faltering signs of a revival in the still-fragile US economy. In Tokyo, domestic investors showed increasing concern about the gloomy outlook for the Japanese economy. According to a survey by the Keidanren, the employers' federation, 90 per cent of business leaders expect the economy to remain sluggish at least until October. On the Tokyo stock market, such sentiments helped to push the Nikkei average down 616.02, to close at 17,175.53, its lowest level in 5 1/2 years. During trading the Nikkei fell through the 17,000 level and touched 16,892, but recovered amid sporadic bargain-hunting. Early today, the market opened on a steadier note, with the Nikkei barely changed in initial trading. The Nikkei has fallen by 25 per cent since the beginning of the year and by 56 per cent from its peak in December 1989. In Europe, reactions to the falls in Tokyo were particularly pronounced in France, where prices on the Paris bourse were shaved by 3.4 per cent. Shares quoted in Frankfurt and Amsterdam dropped by 1 per cent. But in London, where investors are preoccupied with today's general election, stock prices were less affected. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares, which has steadied in the past few days after a 65-point fall last week, lost 11.0, closing at 2,393.2. On Wall Street, Tokyo's fall unnerved traders and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 50.31 to 3,163.24 in morning trading, its lowest level of the year, before rallying somewhat to close 32.20 lower at 3,181.35. Mr James Williams, a fund manager at Barings merchant bank in London, said: 'Japanese banks will be no position to expand their loan books and Japanese lending overseas will be very few and far between over the next few months.' In Tokyo, brokers said investors were largely sitting on the sidelines, waiting for prices to settle.

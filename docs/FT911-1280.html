			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / EBRD draws up list of its priorities in east Europe: Bank to focus on privatisation and restructuring THE newly established European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will play a selective role in helping the countries of eastern and central Europe adopt market economies and will focus its efforts initially on such areas as privatisation and economic restructuring. In a first statement of the bank's priorities and policies, the EBRD said it would concentrate on developing 'an entrepreneurial spirit at grass roots level by helping the establishment of small enterprises'. It will support their development by promoting a new financial infrastructure in the former communist countries that could one day include a network of merchant banks spanning the region. The bank, which formally began operations last month, will seek a close advisory relationship with the governments in central and eastern Europe and will not hesitate to express its views to them on their political and economic reforms. Senior bank officials have said that the EBRD intends that its offices in eastern and central Europe should become the prime sources of on-the-spot advice for governments in the region. However, the bank admits that it will not be able to take a leading role in all areas of activity. 'It expects to respond to country needs progressively in a manner that is commensurate with the growth of its own experience and expertise,' the document said. Especially in the early days, it will co-operate and co-finance projects with other multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank. The document goes some way to fleshing out the aims of the bank, which remains a controversial institution under its mercurial president Mr Jacques Attali despite declarations of support from member governments. Whereas Mr Attali refers frequently to his 'vision' of the bank as the first 'pan-European institution' to bind together the eastern and western halves of the European continent, the policy statement focuses on more mundane issues. However, the EBRD appears at one point to express reservations about the current belief among western governments that eastern Europe must take rapid and radical steps towards the market economy. The statement was approved by the bank's 23 strong board of directors, who represent the 39 countries and two European Community institutions that are subscribing the EBRD's Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.95bn) capital. It says the bank will place initial emphasis on programmes and activities that support: the creation and strengthening of infrastructure, including regulatory infrastructure and improved energy, transport, and telecommunications; privatisation; reform of the financial sector, including development of capital markets and privatisation of commercial banks; development of a productive, competitive private sector, including small and medium-sized companies in industry, agriculture and services; restructuring the region's industrial sectors to put them on a competitive footing; encouraging foreign direct investment, and cleaning up the environment.</p>

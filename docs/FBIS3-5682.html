			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] and the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of  Corporate Executives] compiled on 7 March the agenda of their  respective emergency proposals concerning Japan-U.S. relations,  in which a crack is developing in the wake of the recent  Japan-U.S. summit talks. The Keidanren, in its agenda of  proposals, asks the government to revise the basic plan for  public investment totaling 430 trillion yen on which Japan and  the United States agreed three years ago and to add more than  100 trillion yen. The Keizai Doyukai, in its agenda of  proposals, calls on the government to 1) add 100 trillion yen  for public investment, 2) reduce Japan's current account surplus  to about 2 percent of its GDP (gross national product) three  years later, 3) cut the income tax, not for one year, but for at  least three years prior to raising the consumption tax, and 4)  work out an action program to narrow price differentials between  Japan and other nations. The two economic organizations have  submitted their proposals to the prime minister.    On 7 March, the president and vice presidents of Keidanren  met to compile the agenda of emergency proposals entitled "View  on Aggressive Solution of Japan-U.S. Issues." The Keizai  Doyukai inaugurated an ad hoc committee shortly after the recent  Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off to study ways to compile the  agenda of the emergency proposal. As reasons for making the  emergency proposal, the Keidanren says, "the United States is  moving to slap sanctions on Japan over the mobile phone issue  after the Super 301 provision was revived, and a sense of crisis  is growing at home." Keizai Doyukai President Masaru Hayami  says, "Both Japan and the United States should restore mutual  trust at the earliest date." A growing sense of crisis among  business leaders has prompted the two economic organizations to  compile the agenda of their emergency proposals.    The Keidanren, in its agenda of proposals, calls for  increasing the amount of public investment, thoroughly relaxing  bureaucratic regulations, taking measures to help foreign firms  gain access to the Japanese market through the removal of import  and investment barriers, implementing properly a competitive  policy, and reducing areas subject to exclusion from the  competitive policy. As for the revival of the Super 301  provision, the Keidanren makes clear its view that Japan should  take its case to GATT if necessary, saying, "Japan should handle  a bilateral trade dispute with the United States in GATT, and a  hollowing out of international organizations and systems should  be prevented."    The Keizai Doyukai makes concrete proposals to Japanese  enterprises, U.S. corporations, the Japanese Government, and the  U.S. Government. In its concrete proposals, the Keizai Doyukai  asks Japanese enterprises to stop exporting goods at below  production costs, aggressively purchase equipment and raw  materials from abroad, address Japan's traditional trade  practices, and rebuild their structure of business and  production, and asks U.S. corporations to make self-help efforts  to develop goods that are salable on the Japanese market.    Commenting on the "reduction of Japan's current account  surplus to about 2 percent of GDP," the centerpiece of the  Keizai Doyukai's proposal to the Japanese Government, Keizai  Doyukai President Masaru Hayami says: "This year, Japan's  current account surplus is 2.8 percent of its GDP, a decrease of  0.3 percentage points from a year earlier. If this trend  continues every year, the target figure could be met."  Regarding the action program on bridging price differentials  between Japan and other nations, the president says, the action  program and timetable should be worked out to cut in half the  gap between the exchange rate and purchasing power parity. He  urges the U.S. Government to stabilize the exchange rate.</p>

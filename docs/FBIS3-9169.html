			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bileca, March 21 (TANJUG) -- There is no peace  between the Croats and Moslems in Mostar despite the Washington  agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia.    On Monday the Moslems lodged yet another protest with the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) accusing the Croats for  violating the ceasefire in Mostar and its surroundings, said  Sarajevo Radio in Monday.    Members of the Bosnian Croat armed force (HVO) without any  provocation opened strong infantry fire on the separation lines,  while in the central parts of the city the HVO fired from  hand-held rocket launchers on Moslem positions, Sarajevo Radio  said. The Moslem radio failed to say whether the Moslems had  returned fire or if there had been any casualties.    A representative of the Moslem authorities on Sunday  expressed doubt that life in Mostar would return to normal soon  despite the Washington agreement. The Bosnian Croats and  Moslems have for the past year been engaged in fierce battles in  Mostar in an attempt to divide the city, from which they have  expelled almost all the Serbs, into two ethnically clean parts.    The representatives of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats in  Washington submitted to strong U.S. pressure to set up their  federation in the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent one with the republic of  Croatia.    Political analysts believe that Washington's initiative aims  to isolate the Bosnian Serbs and pressure them to make  additional territorial concessions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Two candidate tires of the same construction type,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer, line, and size designation are prepared and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested utilizing the same test procedures described above for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard tires, except that the candidate tires are loaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 85 percent of the test loads specified in &sect;575.104(h). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted traction coefficients of the candidate tires are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined in accordance with &sect;575.104(f)(2) (ix) and (x).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once tested, candidate tires are assigned grades ``A'', ``B'',  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ``C''. A tire that achieved a high level of performance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both asphalt (above 0.47&mu;) and concrete (above 0.35&mu;) is graded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``A''. A tire achieving at least medium performance on both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces is graded ``B'' (above 0.38&mu; on asphalt and above 0.26&mu;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on concrete). A tire achieving relatively low performance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either or both surfaces (below 0.38&mu; on asphalt or below 0.26&mu;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on concrete) is graded ``C''. From examining traction test data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has observed that while nearly all tires achieve high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traction values on the wet asphalt surface, very few achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high values on the wet concrete surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA conducted a statistical analysis of the traction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test data since 1989 to determine the frequency distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the traction coefficients of tires tested on both surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis showed that the arithmetic mean of the traction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients of tires on the wet asphalt surface was 0.51&mu;, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard deviation was  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.03&mu;. Assuming a normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution (in a normal or bell-shaped distribution, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard deviation on both sides of the arithmetic mean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents 68.27% of the values included within the limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated (see ``Statistical Methods,'' by Arkin and Colton, 4th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ed. (Rev.), 1958, pages 37 and 38)), it follows that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 68 percent of the tires tested on the asphalt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface would have a traction coefficient greater than 0.48&mu;,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but less than 0.54&mu;. The arithmetic mean of traction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients of tires tested on the wet concrete surface was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.38&mu;,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.03&mu;, indicating that approximately 68 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tires tested on the wet concrete surface would have a traction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficient greater than 0.35&mu;, but less than 0.41&mu;.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That analysis suggests that tire traction has improved to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the point that it may be appropriate to upgrade the standard by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raising the minimum traction values for each category. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, an ``A'' rating could call for a traction coefficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above 0.54&mu; on asphalt and above 0.41&mu; on concrete; a ``B''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rating could be above 0.48&mu; on asphalt and above 0.35&mu; on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concrete; and for ``C'', below 0.48&mu; on asphalt and below 0.35&mu;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on concrete. Alternatively, a new category ``AA'' could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created, the lower limit of which could be 0.54&mu; for asphalt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 0.41&mu; for concrete, with the ``A'', ``B'', and ``C'' categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining as they are. Either of these alternatives would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a more balanced distribution of tires among grades  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``A'', ``B'', and ``C''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another area of increasing concern in traction testing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the possible use of a peak tire traction category for testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than the sliding traction presently measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contemporary vehicles are increasingly utilizing anti-lock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes where sliding traction is not the primary traction force  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in panic braking. Those vehicles rely on peak tire traction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, maximum braking action is obtained when the tire is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still rolling. Although peak tire traction may be desirable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information for consumers with vehicles equipped with anti-lock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes, high peak traction may compromise other tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics such as degradation of traction when cornering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If peak traction performance of tires differs substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from sliding traction, an alternative traction grading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure may be necessary. NHTSA needs additional data on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement of peak traction coefficients and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlation of peak traction coefficients with stopping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance, which may be available from commenters. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is soliciting any such data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Temperature Resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The temperature resistance grade is intended to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent to which heat is generated and/or dissipated by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given tire, and the capability of the tire to withstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting temperature without failure. The heat that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated depends on the amount of energy absorbed by the tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the flexing of the rubber and its reinforcing materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That energy is wasted and appears in the tire as heat. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more energy wasted, the greater the amount of heat that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated and, if the tire is not capable of dissipating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater amount of heat and/or if the tire is not able to resist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effects of the higher operating temperature that results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that greater amount of heat, the lower the temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

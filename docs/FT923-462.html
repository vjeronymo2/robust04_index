			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / French Socialists gain seats FRANCE'S ruling Socialist party has scored a double-edged political gain in Sunday's senate election, by winning five more seats in the upper house at the cost of seeing its majority in the National Assembly shrink further. Four of the new Socialist senators, including Mr Pierre Mauroy, the former prime minister, were deputies in the national assembly. Their seats will remain vacant, because French electoral law prevents by-elections within a year of legislative elections, due next March. This quirky result comes just as the government faces the possibility of an opposition motion of censure, possibly on the 1993 budget, when the two houses of parliament reconvene on Friday. In June the government fought off a censure motion on EC agricultural reform by only three votes. The Socialists' gains in the senate, which is indirectly elected, partly by regional councillors, do not indicate any upturn in their current political ill-fortune, but just a reflection of local election gains three years ago.</p>

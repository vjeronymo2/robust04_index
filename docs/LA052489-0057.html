			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO INCREASE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCLUDES DEVELOPER FEE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved in concept a sweeping set of  plans to create badly needed affordable housing, including a fee to be paid by  commercial developers into a housing fund.  </P> <P> The watershed package of programs -- ideas borrowed from several cities that  are well ahead of Los Angeles in responding to skyrocketing housing costs --  was approved 13 to 0 after some of its aspects were strengthened by the  council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Show of Support  </P> <P> The complex set of proposals received a surprising show of support, not only  from council members but also from a wide range of advocates for the poor,  housing experts, corporate leaders and commercial development representatives  who spoke. It was applauded by Mayor Tom Bradley, who released a statement  saying that he will "eagerly sign these proposals into law."  </P> <P> City officials have estimated that one-third of the city's renters -- 300,000  families -- pay more than 30% of their earnings for rent, an amount considered  unaffordable by the federal government. Another 40,000 families live in garages  and 30,000 to 35,000 people are believed to be homeless.  </P> <P> Each proposal will be drawn up as an ordinance and returned to the council for  final votes. How much the programs will cost the city, and how many new units  of housing they will generate, are yet to be determined.  </P> <P> Among the key provisions are:  </P> <P> * A "linkage" fee of between $2.50 and $7.50 per square foot on large  commercial construction, which will go into a special housing fund. In San  Francisco, Boston, Seattle and elsewhere such a fee is already raising tens of  millions of dollars, and has helped create thousands of permanent low-cost  apartments renting for less than $450 a month.  </P> <P> * Funding for programs that will bring new clout to the city's nonprofit  housing developers, who are widely viewed as crucial to the creation of  permanent low-rent housing. Nonprofit developers will be awarded special  financing and technical assistance not now available.  </P> <P> * Creation of a Housing Partnership, an approach that has worked in other  cities. Such partnerships encourage corporations and nonprofit housing groups  to raise and share funds for affordable housing.  </P> <P> * Establishment of a Housing Commission to oversee the tangled and sometimes  duplicative efforts of 11 city departments that have a say in low-cost housing  issues.  </P> <P> * Strengthening of a long-existing city ordinance that requires new residential  buildings to include 15% affordable housing, contingent upon the developers  receiving subsidies. The ordinance has created little low-rent housing because  of lack of government funds.  </P> <P> * An increase in the document transfer tax charged on real estate transactions  and other document transactions, a provision that would require changes in  state law. The money would be paid into an affordable housing fund.  </P> <P> * Allowing expenditures of up to $10 million from the city's reserve fund to  shore up aging brick buildings that must comply with city earthquake  strengthening laws or be torn down. Currently such buildings contain more than  40,000 low-rent apartments, and city officials believe that losing that housing  would be devastating.  </P> <P> * Placement of a $100-million bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot to provide  low-cost loans and other assistance to owners of aging brick buildings who must  comply with city earthquake standards.  </P> <P> * Creation of a special city unit to negotiate with owners of 22,000 affordable  rental units, whose rents could skyrocket to market level in a few years as  federal restrictions on their rental limits expire. Most apartments would also  be placed under city rent control.  </P> <P> * Development of a plan to control the demolition of affordable housing, a  problem that is reaching huge proportions as the city's development boom  continues. City officials estimate that more than 4,000 units of affordable  housing, much of it in sturdy condition, falls to the wrecking ball each year.  </P> <P> Gary Squier, the acting city Housing Authority director, told the council that  in the year it has taken the proposals to reach the council, "6,000 additional  new families moved to Los Angeles who now have inadequate housing" and 5,000  affordable units were torn down to make way for developments and luxury  apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Major Backers  </P> <P> Among those backing the proposals were Arco President Robert Wykoff; developer  representative George Mihlsten; Ann Reiss Lane, president of the Shelter  Partnership, a homeless organization, and Sister Diane Donohue, of the  South-Central Organizing Committee. All four were on a blue-ribbon committee  that spent nearly a year drafting the plans. Developers on the panel had  opposed aspects of the linkage fee, but supported it Tuesday.  </P> <P> Most of the council debate Tuesday centered on the linkage fee.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gloria Molina questioned a proposal to set the fee at $2.50 per  square feet, saying it was too low. The debate was quelled when Councilman  Marvin Braude suggested an initial fee ranging from $2.50 to $7.50, which was  adopted.  </P> <P> "I want something that is not a lip service figure but a realistic figure,"  Molina said. "I am worried about locking ourselves into such a low fee."  </P> <P> Donohue told the council, for example, that 10 million to 12 million square  feet of commercial development is created downtown each year, and if each  developer were paying $2.50 per square foot, "that would create $25 million a  year for housing. Even though that isn't enough, it's a start."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need Special Study  </P> <P> Under federal law, the city must complete a special study before making  developers pay such linkage fees. The study report, due this fall, will show  how much housing demand is created each time a developer erects a commercial  building that attracts workers, who then must find housing.  </P> <P> Permanent fees will be based on the study. Studies in other West Coast cities  have set the fees at $5 to $8 per square foot.  </P> <P> To provide affordable housing for all who need it, especially given the huge  influx of immigrants and low-paid workers entering the city each day, city  officials have estimated that Los Angeles will need several billion dollars.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Austrian oil company slips into loss in first six months OMV, the Austrian national oil group, blamed a severe recession in the plastics and chemicals industry as it fell into a pre-tax loss of Sch584m (Dollars 59.7m) in the six months to June, from a Sch807m profit in the same period last year. The loss exceeded forecasts of about Sch500m, and OMV warned it expected a significant fall in earnings for the full year, although it hoped to end 1992 in profit. Continued low profits from the plastics and chemicals sectors were expected to be offset by better results from the energy division. Mr Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, chief financial officer, said OMV expected to return to former levels of profitability in the medium term, and was likely to maintain its full-year dividend of Sch20 a share. He added that OMV was launching a cost-cutting programme aimed at saving Sch1bn a year by 1994. Staff costs would be reduced through early retirement, natural wastage and a change in the pensions policy. Capital expenditure would also be cut except where it relates to OMV's long-term strategy, including plans to secure a leading position in the oil and gas businesses of central Europe. First-half turnover this year fell slightly to Sch39.9bn from Sch40.6bn, with energy accounting for more than three-quarters of this. Profits in the energy division were Sch305m, with particularly strong results from exploration and production, and the gas business. However, slow economic growth and a fall in the price of petrochemical products led to a loss by the refining business. The chemicals division made first-half losses of Sch203m, blamed on a depressed market and competition from cheap imports. Plastics, however, made the largest loss, at Sch686m, hit by a severe recession in the polyolefines plastics business. The Austrian government has plans to merge OMV with the utility Verbundgesellschaft in a reorganisation of Austria's state-owned industrial companies, which would create an energy group with turnover of more than Sch85bn.</p>

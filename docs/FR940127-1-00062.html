			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Freshwater or Pearly Mussels (Family Unionidae) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The bivalve mollusc family Unionidae (pearly mussels or naiads) is one of the most diverse mollusc families in North America. Their geographic distribution is widespread; naiads are found in most of the major river drainages in the Southeast and Midwest, including the Upper Mississippi drainage system, and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas. Members of this family also occur in Europe <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1987, the Ten-Year Review Committee Chairman withdrew a proposal to remove the six unionid species listed in Appendix II (with the other 26 species remaining in Appendix I) with the understanding that the United States would review the need for the listings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the species included in Appendix I are listed as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and two of the species included in Appendix II are now listed as endangered. However, seven of the Appendix I species and the remaining four Appendix II species are not listed as endangered or threatened under ESA. A few species of pearly mussels are valued as a source of beads for the cultured pearl industry, and shells of these species as well as the pearls made from such shells are heavily traded. The Service's concern is how to provide the appropriate protection to the endangered pearly mussels without unnecessarily regulating the trade in the few commercially valuable, non-threatened mussels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mussel shells used in the manufacture of cultured pearls are identifiable by their heavier, all white shells, and they occur in larger rivers and reservoirs with few species of endangered mussels. Furthermore, State regulations usually prohibit the collection of shells from those sections of rivers with significant populations of the endangered mussels. Even with these and other State restrictions, some endangered mussels may be harvested by the divers; however, it is believed that the buyers exclude shells not valuable for the making of pearl beads, and the exporters further screen all shells to sort them into species and size categories to fill specific orders from foreign buyers. Therefore, the likelihood of endangered mussels being exported for the pearl industry is extremely low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather, the potential trade threat to the endangered species may be from shell collectors and the use of shells in the jewelry industry. It is probably only the most endangered species that would be affected by trade for collections, and the Service is endeavoring to determine whether there is any threat to endangered species from the trade in mussels for jewelry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 58 endangered freshwater mussels and another 53 that may be endangered but for which definitive status information is not yet available. If the most endangered of these species may be affected by trade, having the species listed under CITES would provide additional protection for the species. Therefore, the Service is considering preparing a proposal to list in Appendix I only the most endangered of the species (thus, downlisting some of the present Appendix I species) and proposing the remainder of the native species for inclusion in Appendix II, except those clearly identifiable species exported for the pearl industry. The basis for this proposal would be either because of status of the species or for reasons of similarity of appearance. The species that the Service is considering excluding are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actinonaias ligamentina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (= <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. carinata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amblema plicata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyclonaias tuberculata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elliptio crassidens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elliparia lineolata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fusconaia ebena <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fusconaia flava <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ligumia recta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Megalonaias nervosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Obliquaria reflexa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleurobema cordatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrula apiculata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrula metanevra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrula nodulata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrula pustulosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrula quadrula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tritogonia verrucosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This approach provides the shortest list (unless the entire unionid taxon were listed, which would add an unnecessary permit burden), and the shorter list would assist enforcement officers in focusing their efforts. This approach would also involve downlisting some species presently listed in Appendix I. An alternative may be that, for those species where there is not a sufficient probability of trade to warrant any CITES listing, the Service might propose the deletion of present Appendix I and II freshwater mussel species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service would especially appreciate comments as to whether information already available sufficiently identifies the most endangered species so that further identification of these species by listing them in Appendix I does not increase the threat from collection. Additional information on the trade in shells for the jewelry industry would be appreciated, as well as comments on the above recommendations for species to be excluded from any proposal that the Service may submit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Gaviria pins hopes on oil RISING oil revenues could push Colombia's economic growth from last year's 3.6 per cent to an annual 5-6 per cent, President Cesar Gaviria said yesterday. Mr Gaviria, on a three-day official visit to Britain, suggested that, if the country made progress in its fight against political and drugs-related violence, 'growth through the rest of this decade will be even higher'. The president is pinning his hopes for higher growth on the Cusiana and Cupiaga oil fields, in Colombia's eastern Andes. The fields are being jointly developed by BP, Total, Triton and Colombia's state-owned Ecopetrol. BP has estimated production will reach 150,000 b/d by the end of 1995, but a second stage of development could take output to 600,000-800,000 b/d in 1998, a prospect Colombian officials greet with barely concealed excitement. Colombia now produces about 450,000 b/d of crude, exporting some 180,000 b/d. Mr Gaviria said his country was able to deal with the potentially inflationary consequences of soaring oil revenues, and stressed the independence of the central bank. Earlier in his trip, aimed principally at boosting trade and British investment in Colombia, he signed an agreement with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, to co-operate on confiscating proceeds from drug trafficking. The agreement would commit both countries to trace, seize and confiscate drug assets, according to a British official. However, a hoped-for investment protection accord between Colombia and the UK failed to materialise.</p>

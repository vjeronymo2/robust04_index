			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia will play a role to have the UN economic  sanction against Iraq lifted if the country has indeed satisfied  the conditions imposed by the world body. Law Minister Datuk  Syed Hamid Albar said Malaysia felt that if the UN conditions  had been satisfied, the economic sanction should be reviewed.    He told reporters this after talks with visiting Iraqi  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf at his office in Kuala  Lumpur. He added Malaysia wished to see peace prevail in West  Asia and did not want innocent people to suffer from economic  sanction. He said it was Malaysia's hope that the right and  sovereignty of nations would always be respected.    Syed Hamid said Muhammad Sa'id had requested Malaysia's help  in having the economic sanction against his country lifted. The  Iraqi minister said that his country had satisfied all UN  conditions and had submitted documents to this effect. The  documents would be submitted to the Malaysian Government for  further action.    Muhammad Sa'id arrived in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon for a  three-day visit as part of a tour of various countries to enlist  their support for the lifting of the sanction. Malaysia is the  first stop for the Iraqi minister.</p>

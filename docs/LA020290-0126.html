			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS WILL LEAVE IRVIN UNPROTECTED;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: CORNERBACK PROBABLY WILL RETIRE AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER. LANSFORD  ALSO WON'T BE PROTECTED AS TEAM TAKES A GAMBLE WITH KICKER.  </P> <P> Several veteran Rams, including cornerback LeRoy Irvin and kicker Mike  Lansford, will be among the players left unprotected when the team's Plan B  free agency list is announced today.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the restricted free agency plan, the Rams can protect 37 of  their 52 players under contract at the end of the season. Those not protected  can negotiate with any other NFL team until April 1 and not be subjected to  compensation rules.  </P> <P> Unprotected players may also chose to stay with their present teams.  </P> <P> Although he has a year remaining on his contract, Irvin, 32, will not be  protected, sources say, and probably will retire after a 10-year career with  the Rams.  </P> <P> Lansford's case is different. He recently signed a two-year contract with the  Rams and will almost assuredly return in 1990 as the team's kicker. The Rams  exposed him to free up a valuable spot on the protected list, knowing Lansford  probably isn't going to play anywhere else.  </P> <P> Reached Thursday afternoon, Lansford confirmed the Rams' strategy: "They're  thinking I'm secure here, I enjoy L.A., that I grew up here, that all my  family's here, and they're right."  </P> <P> Lansford, however, said he will listen to other offers.  </P> <P> Other Rams expected to be on today's list include veteran defensive lineman  Shawn Miller, reserve wide receiver Ron Brown and punter Dale Hatcher.  </P> <P> There was speculation late in the week that either veteran linebacker Mel Owens  or tight end Pete Holohan would not be protected.  </P> <P> Owens, 31, had not been contacted by the Rams as of Thursday evening, which he  understood to mean he was going to be protected.  </P> <P> "I think John (Robinson) would have called me," Owens said. "I think he would  have said, 'Mel, we're going to put you out there.' "  </P> <P> Robinson and the Ram coaching staff are in Hawaii preparing for Sunday's Pro  Bowl game.  </P> <P> Owens added that if the decision came down to Owens or Holohan, the Rams would  protect their tight end.  </P> <P> "He caught 51 passes this year," Owens said.  </P> <P> Holohan, 30, did not return phone calls Thursday.  </P> <P> Owens said he would not be upset if he is not protected.  </P> <P> "I think I have some market value," he said. "I've seen a lot of people benefit  by it."  </P> <P> Last year, 12 of 19 Rams left unprotected signed with other teams for more  money.  </P></p>

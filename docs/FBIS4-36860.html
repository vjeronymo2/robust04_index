			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "'Arafat Orders Closure of </F> Military Offices in Tunisia; Transfer of Cadres Awaits Israeli  Approval"]    [Text] Tunis -- A senior PLO official has told AL-HAYAH  that the decision issued by President 'Arafat yesterday ordering  the closure of the Palestinian offices in Tunisia 15 June  especially covered the military offices attached to the  commander in chief and did not apply to the PLO departments and  offices in Tunisia.    The official, who declined to reveal his identity, said that  the PLO's main military offices were in Hammam al-Shatt suburb  (16 km south of the capital, Tunis). These offices were the  target of an Israeli raid 2 October 1985. He put the number of  these offices at about 50, concerned with the mobilization,  guidance, command, and military security of the Palestinian  forces scattered throughout nine Arab countries.    He stressed that the closure of these offices, including the  office of the commander in chief, was also in implementation of  another decision made by President 'Arafat, who is also the  commander in chief of the Palestinian revolution's forces,  stipulating that no official or cadre should remain in the  military offices in Tunisia after 1 July.    It has been noticed in PLO offices and departments that  preparations are underway for the departure from Tunisia to the  autonomy areas. The Palestinians have begun selling their  furniture and motor vehicles, but no decision has been issued  for the closure of civilian departments and offices, and there  is no clear date for the cadres and employees in PLO departments  to leave Tunisia. The general feeling, however, is that they  will not remain in Tunisia after the end of July.    Meanwhile, a highly placed Fatah source has stated that the  Organization and Mobilization Office run by [Fatah] Central  Committee Member Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), the Ideological  Mobilization Office run by Central Committee Member Sakhr Habash  (Abu-Nizar), and the Office of Fatah's Revolutionary Council run  by Hamdan 'Ashur, will remain in Tunisia until the end of this  current year at least. That is in addition to the PLO  departments which, it has been decided, will remain abroad. The  most important of these departments are the Political  Department, the Returnees Department, and the Arab and  International Relations Department headed by Mahmud 'Abbas  (Abu-Mazin).    Furthermore, AL-HAYAH has learned that the PLO has prepared  a  new name list of 1,000 people working in Palestinian offices and  departments, mostly in Tunisia, to be submitted to Israel for  approval of their entry to the autonomy areas. An official who  participated in preparing that list said that it would not be  handed over before approval is received from Israel for the  first list of 601 officials and cadres who will accompany  President 'Arafat on his journey to Jericho which was handed  over recently by the PLO. He added that the new list contains  information identical to that contained in the first list: full  name, place of birth, office of work, and type of travel  document held.    Palestinian sources have confirmed that President 'Arafat's  move to Jericho has been postponed further, until the beginning  of next month at the earliest. They said that Palestinian and  Arab figures, including Muhsin Ibrahim, who recently came to  Tunis to accompany President 'Arafat on his return journey, have  now left there following the second postponement.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BARDENS PACES UCI PAST PACIFIC, 3-1  </P> <P> Billy Bardens doubled in a run and scored another to lead UC Irvine to a 3-1  victory over University of the Pacific in a Big West Conference baseball game  Friday at Irvine.  </P> <P> The Anteaters managed only one hit in four innings off starter Jim Yanko, who  faced the minimum when Chris Gallego was caught stealing after his first-inning  single.  </P> <P> But Fred Combs led off the fifth with a single, and one out later, Bardens  lined his RBI double to the wall in left-center field.  </P> <P> "I haven't hit too many long balls," Bardens said. "I was hoping that it just  would fall (in for a hit). I guess I was hoping it would go out, too."  </P> <P> One out later, Bardens scored to give Irvine a 2-1 lead on John Skaggs' triple  up the alley in right. But Ed Luna flied deep to center to end the inning.  </P> <P> Pacific (13-25, 0-5 in conference) scored in the third inning on Doug Welpot's  two-out solo homer to center. The home run served as a wake-up call for the  Anteaters, who still seemed sluggish after being swept in a three-game series  at Fresno State last weekend.  </P> <P> David Bladow (5-3) finished with a four-hitter, striking out nine and walking  one, for Irvine (25-17, 3-5).  </P> <P> "I didn't have any stuff," Bladow said. "My split (finger fastball) wasn't  working at first. But right after the home run, I started to feel more in  control."  </P> <P> Irvine scored another run in the eighth. Dan Roberson singled, stole second and  took third when catcher Curt Wright's throw went into the outfield. Roberson  scored on Luna's sacrifice fly to center.  </P> <P> In California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball:  </P> <P> UC Riverside 11, Chapman 9 (11 innings) -- Chad Townsend hit a two-run home run  in the 11th for first-place Riverside (29-10, 13-6) at Hart Park in Orange.  </P> <P> Rod Klopfer had four hits and two RBIs, Jason Rolish had two hits and two RBIs,  and Tom Allison had three hits and scored twice for second-place Chapman  (23-14, 13-6).  </P> <P> In Big West Conference softball:  </P> <P> University of the Pacific 1-0, Cal State Fullerton 0-8 -- Shireen Campbell  pitched a four-hitter for Fullerton (37-10, 15-4) in the second game. Pacific  is 22-16, 7-11.  </P></p>

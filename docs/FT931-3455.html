			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Leading Article: How not to run the BBC THIS WEEK, the governors of the BBC meet in an atmosphere of crisis. Following revelations about the unseemly pay contract of the corporation's director-general, there are widespread calls for resignations and dismissals. The board is badly split. Deja vu. In 1987, one director-general was dismissed in controversial circumstances. Four years later, a second's desire for a further term of office divided the board and resulted in a two-year fudge in which the BBC was hobbled with a director-general and a director-general-in-waiting, Mr John Birt. It is now Mr Birt's future which sets governor against governor. Given that the single most important managerial task of the governors is to select and then monitor the progress of the director-general, such an accident-prone system cannot be said to be working well. The problem is that the governors do not know what they are there for. A miscellany of academics, artists, Whitehall types and business executives, the law says they are responsible for ensuring that parliament's wishes, enshrined in the corporation's constitution, are fulfilled. In its clearest sense, their mission is to regulate, standing between politicians and broadcasters. In practice, governors make their influence felt by controlling the most senior appointments and discussing any issue which takes their fancy. Blurred boundaries This has meant that the governors do not do much well. Their ability to supervise standards of taste has been judged so defective that other bodies have entered the vacuum. Individual governors openly differ on whether they should exercise the right to view programmes before transmission. On the managerial front, they have tried to work more closely with management, holding more joint meetings. It is not surprising that in this atmosphere of blurred boundaries, nobody has been precise about who should do what. Do all top appointments have to be by open competition? Some think so, but many have not been. Who determines the terms and conditions of senior managers? The whole board? A remuneration sub-committee? Whoever the chairman happens to invite in for a drink? It is against this background that the affair of Mr Birt's contract must be judged. That he made a serious misjudgment in believing he could be the corporation's first freelance director-general is beyond doubt. To the ordinary citizen, these accountancy fictions, with their unidentified secretaries and glamorous-sounding expense accounts, are a fiddle. Not indispensable The mitigating circumstances are that his tax arrangements were legal, approved by the Inland Revenue and accepted by his employer. Mr Birt has apologised, put his arrangements in order and should now be allowed to get on with the job. He is not indispensable to the future of the BBC, but it is primarily his vision which informs the case the BBC has made for a new royal charter. Most who wish to see him ousted would prefer a more comfortable notion of the BBC's future, but this is fantasy. The real question about Mr Birt's vision is whether it is radical enough. The other reputation on the line is that of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the board of governors. Mr Hussey's achievement has been to find Mr Birt and to back him, against much mutiny, in the pursuit of a more efficient and accountable BBC. He has helped put the BBC in a stronger political position than it has enjoyed for decades. But Mr Hussey is a schemer, a Fleet Street alley cat. He has alternately charmed, bullied and excluded governors unsympathetic to his purpose. This is not a style appropriate to the reformed mode of governance the BBC itself envisaged in its recent response to the government's green paper. That document calls for less meddling, clear structures, defined reporting lines, consistently monitored standards and effective mechanisms for complaint. Mr Hussey has performed a public service in kicking the BBC towards a more realistic view of its future. The government should now ask him to prepare, in an orderly fashion, to hand over to a successor.</p>

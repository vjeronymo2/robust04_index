			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST SIGN YOU FOLKS HAVE  EVER SEEN. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.' -- ROBERT GRUSNICK, AUBURN HILLS  MAYOR;  </P> <P> VINCENT TO PAY IF LAKERS LOSE THEIR MAGIC TOUCH  </P> <P> As if injuries to Magic Johnson and Byron Scott and two straight losses weren't  enough, there's more bad news for Lakers fans.  </P> <P> A friendly wager between Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and his counterpart in  the Detroit Pistons' new home of Auburn Hills would add to the sting of a  Pistons' victory.  </P> <P> If the Lakers lose, Auburn Hills Mayor Robert Grusnick will win the right to  put up a Pistons sign on Kareem Court outside the Forum for 30 days. Also,  Vincent will have to keep a stiff upper lip during an Inglewood City Council  meeting while wearing a black "Bad Boys" T-shirt that sports pictures of Bill  Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn.  </P> <P> "California, here I come!" Grusnick sang into the telephone Friday morning,  while whooping with laughter. "We're going to have the biggest sign you folks  have ever seen. And you're not going to like it."  </P> <P> Vincent, along with a lot of Laker fans, was not available Friday to comment on  basketball.  </P> <P> A city spokesman, however, said everyone at City Hall is behind the hometown  team.  </P> <P> "We are nervously optimistic," said Inglewood Assistant City Manager Norman  Cravens. "The Lakers pulled it out last year after being down and we certainly  think they'll do it again this year."  </P> <P> A come-from-behind Laker championship would mean that Vincent would install a  3-by-5 foot Lakers sign outside The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons' home  arena, and Grusnick would be forced to wear a Lakers' "Three-Peat" T-shirt.  </P> <P> Grusnick scoffs at that possibility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Hope He Fits Into It'  </P> <P> "I'm going to be (in Inglewood) to make sure your mayor wears our 'Bad Boys'  shirt," Grusnick gloated. "I just hope he fits into it."  </P> <P> Last year, in a bet with Pontiac Mayor Walter Moore, Vincent walked away with  two weeks' free use of a 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix SE -- a car he liked so much  that he later bought it -- and enough light bulbs to illuminate City Hall.  </P> <P> If the Lakers come out on top this time around, city officials said their sign  in Michigan will promote Inglewood's recent designation as an All-America City.  </P> <P> "My staff is coming up with some appropriately modest and tasteful suggestions  that should not offend anybody -- except perhaps Pistons fans," Vincent said  earlier in the week before the playoffs began.  </P></p>

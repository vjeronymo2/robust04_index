			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Campbell Soup back in the black New products and acquisitions helped Campbell Soup, the US soup and food company, report a sharp swing from net losses of Dollars 121m last time to net profits of Dollars 203m for its second quarter ended January 30. The previous year's figure was hit by a restructuring charge of Dollars 353m before tax, but Campbell said net profits in the latest quarter would still have shown a 13 per cent increase without the charge. Earnings a share were a record 81 cents, compared with 71 cents before the restructuring charge last time or losses a share of 48 cents after the charge. For the half year, net earnings were Dollars 369m, a 12 per cent increase on the previous year's figure before restructuring and accounting charges. In the US, a new advertising campaign helped lift soup sales in the second quarter, although shipments to the trade were down by 3 per cent because of heavy promotional activity in the comparable quarter. Biscuit and bakery sales rose 48 per cent, largely because Campbell bought majority control of Arnotts, Australia's leading biscuit maker. International earnings were boosted by the purchase of the Fray Bentos meat products company last April.</p>

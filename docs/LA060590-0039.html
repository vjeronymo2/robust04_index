			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POTENTIAL BARRY CASE JURORS FACE BATTERY OF QUESTIONS  </P> <P> Selection of a jury began Monday in the drug use and perjury trial of Mayor  Marion Barry amid reports that plea bargaining talks have broken down.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson distributed written questionnaires  to 250 prospective jurors who will be screened for what is expected to be a  monthlong trial. Reflecting more in-depth probing because of the sensitivity of  the case, the questionnaires asked potential jurors about their attitudes  toward drug use and alcoholism, whether anyone close to them has been  chemically addicted and what they think about someone lying after "having taken  an oath to tell the truth."  </P> <P> Jackson said that he and attorneys in the case would begin questioning members  of the jury pool individually this morning in search of an "unbiased and  unprejudiced" 12-member jury and six alternate jurors. The process will take  several days, he said.  </P> <P> Barry, avoiding reporters, entered the U.S. Courthouse through a side entrance  accompanied by his wife, Effi. The mayor, who has been in office for 12 years,  reportedly has been willing to plead guilty to several misdemeanors involving  the use of cocaine, but U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens has said that any plea  agreement must include at least one felony, which could involve a prison term.  </P> <P> A plea bargain still could develop later this week, although sources said that  the two sides presently are far apart.  </P> <P> Of the 14 charges facing Barry, three are felonies charging that he lied by  denying under oath to a federal grand jury that he ever had used cocaine.  </P> <P> The other counts are misdemeanors involving 10 charges of drug possession and  one charge of conspiracy to use cocaine.  </P> <P> While some of the mayor's past associates are expected to testify about his  drug use dating back to 1984, the government has described as its most graphic  evidence an hourlong FBI videotape, taken with a hidden camera. The videotape  allegedly shows Barry smoking crack cocaine with a former girlfriend, model  Rasheeda Moore, in a hotel room last January.  </P> <P> Barry said in a local radio interview Monday that such invasions of his privacy  are akin to "a totalitarian kind of society." He previously accused the FBI of  endangering his life by providing Moore with powerful cocaine and cognac that  was to be offered him.  </P> <P> Government attorneys have responded in court that Barry voluntarily used the  drug.  </P> <P> One of the 69 questions being asked of prospective jurors seeks their opinion  "about the fairness of law enforcement agencies using concealed video and audio  recording devices during the course of an undercover investigation."  </P> <P> If convicted on all counts, Barry could be sentenced to a maximum term of 26  years in prison and subjected to fines of more than $1.8 million. Incarceration  after conviction of any crime also would prevent him from seeking a fourth term  in office this year.  </P></p>

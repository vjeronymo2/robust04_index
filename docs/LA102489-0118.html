			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BEYOND ANATEVKA IN LENINGRAD'S 'BROTHERS, SISTERS';  </P> <P> THEATER: ABRAMOV PLAY AT THE OLD GLOBE IS A STUNNING CENTERPIECE IN SAN DIEGO'S  SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL.  </P> <P> "How shall we live?" A familiar question in Russian drama, from Chekhov on. But  the villagers portrayed in the Maly Theatre of Leningrad's "Brothers and  Sisters" are not debating it over the tea-table. Five years after the defeat of  the Nazis, these people are still feeding their children "bread" made of moss  and sawdust. How shall we live?  </P> <P> The surprise of this two-part, six-hour saga at the Old Globe Theatre, a  centerpiece of San Diego's Soviet arts festival, is that it's not more of an  ordeal. It would have a right to be, considering what the village in the story  is going through. But director Lev Dodin and his company -- 41 actors! --  realize that a theater audience can only absorb so much suffering.  </P> <P> So "Brothers and Sisters" is first of all, and quite consciously, a theater  piece -- an entertainment. Indeed, there's so much gaiety and color on stage at  times that the village in question might be named Anatevka. There is also a  healthy amount of sex, observed far more frankly than used to be the case in  Soviet theater.  </P> <P> Without quite being a spectacular, "Brothers and Sisters" consistently rewards  the eye and the ear. Anyone with the slightest sense of theater will respond to  the great scene at the end of Part 1 when the soldiers of the village finally  come home from the Great Patriotic War, and the play's teen-age hero, Mikhail  (Pyotr Semak), gets to stand up at the marriage table with the woman of his  dreams, Varvara (Natalya Fomenko.)  </P> <P> And anyone who has been paying any attention to the story will realize that the  scene is happening in Mikhail's head -- Mikhail who, up to now, has appeared to  be about as fanciful as a plow horse: a young fellow who doesn't even have time  to read the newspaper.  </P> <P> The scene is not, however, the dreaded "dream sequence" that another director  might have ordered. Dodin is much more sophisticated than that. He and his  designers (Eduard Kochergin, setting; Oleg Kozlov, lights; Inna Gabai,  costumes) fill the show with strong theatrical images, but they are arrived at  the hard way, using the wood and the straw and the snow of the village. No  smoke bombs, no glitz. The craft is all above the table, and the acting is just  as honest.  </P> <P> That's a matter of pride and also a matter of respecting the material.  "Brothers and Sisters" is not to be confused with "Fiddler on the Roof." The  suffering is there, because it did go on. And something in the faces of the  actors -- even the children -- suggests that each of them has personal  knowledge of it. The message is there as well. Life in the U.S.S.R. did have to  be hard after the war, with 20 million dead and the cities in ruins.  </P> <P> But it didn't have to be this hard. Choices were made that resulted in sawdust  bread. And the men who made these choices -- men sitting at desks 1,000 miles  from the villages -- didn't have to eat the results.  </P> <P> An American viewer will naturally see "Brothers and Sisters" as a glasnost  play. Actually it goes back a little before glasnost, to 1985. Its source, a  trilogy of "village" novels by Fyodor Abramov (who grew up in just such a  village), goes back farther than that, to the late 1950s.  </P> <P> There is nothing radical in the form of the play. It is rooted in the tradition  of heroic Soviet drama, where a group of ordinary people make themselves into  "one fist" in order to do their duty on the home front and beat the Nazis. It  shows enormous respect for the effort and the victory.  </P> <P> But a fist is not the normal condition of the human hand. (The observation is  made by one of the play's strongest female characters, a former village leader  now forced to take a back seat to the men -- Tatyana Shestakova.) Eventually a  fist will cramp. The fingers will want to go back to being fingers.  </P> <P> Having paid its respects to the the war effort, "Brothers and Sisters" (the  title comes from Stalin's exhortation to the Russian people after the Nazi  invasion) goes on to protest the notion that a nation's people can be ordered  about like soldiers for 10, 20, 30 years on the excuse that the larger society  is engaged in a heroic, warlike struggle that will one day transform the world.  </P> <P> "I have only one life," a villager points out to a Party official arrogantly  collecting for the latest "voluntary" national loan. The official (Sergei  Bekhterev) naturally finds this a symptom of counterrevolutionary tendencies.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the men in the offices back in the city are watching -- and, human  nature being what it is, believing -- the films that they themselves have  commissioned about the happy life on the collective farms. When a nation's  leadership gets this divorced from reality, something has to give.  </P> <P> Part 2 of "Brothers and Sisters" ends with an image familiar in Russian  literature and films -- that of a young man looking yearningly at the sky, as  the cranes pass overhead. At one time, the sub-text of that image was: Hope.  Endure. Today, the image perhaps something else. We have endured. Now we expect  to live.  </P> <P> All this without shaking a fist. Again, Dodin is above that sort of  obviousness. It's clear, watching this play, that glasnost had to come. But  it's equally clear that Dodin and his actors see their immediate job as telling  a story. They are first-class storytellers.  </P> <P> Some people have compared the play to "Nicholas Nickleby." No and yes. It is  not as long a sit, for one thing -- six hours, as opposed to eight. Nor does it  have the panache of Dickens' tale. There are few eccentric characters in  "Brothers and Sisters," simply normal people trying to get their work done and  have a little something with their tea.  </P> <P> But there are similarities. Again, we have a conscientious young man (Semak)  and his mild-eyed sister (Natalya Akimova) discovering, through various  adventures, what a cold and deceiving world it can be. There are no conscious  villains in the story, but there are certainly negative forces -- the prissy,  revengeful party official (Sergei Bekhterev), the willful young hustler who  marries the hero's sister (Igor Tupikin). (In the way of the theater, he is  also one of the most entertaining people in the show -- rascals always are.)  </P> <P> Though long, the story is not complicated. One can follow the spoken  translation with one earphone, leaving the other ear free to pick up the  actors' voices, and the voices and body language tell you exactly where you  are.  </P> <P> The acting is in the very best realistic Russian tradition, which is to say  that when an actor touches a piece of cloth or wood, or hugs a child, the touch  registers on the viewer's nervous system. This is all the translation that  "Brothers and Sisters" needs to come across as an experience that we, with  worse luck, might have undergone ourselves in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Perhaps there are moments when the acting becomes too detailed -- cadenzas  where the actor is allowed to linger over a piece of business not strictly  necessary to the story. (The playful business with the cigarette lighter when  Vladimir Artemov's Grigori comes home from the war, for example.)  </P> <P> There are also moments when the actor or actress gets too general. Natalya  Fomenko establishes Varava's allure and devil-may-care ways, and it is all too  easy to see why she is the scandal of the village. But do we also see her as  the hardest worker in the village? I didn't.  </P> <P> No matter. "Brothers and Sisters" is an uncommonly satisfying theatrical event,  a banquet that doesn't allow us to forget the taste of that sawdust bread.  Broadway couldn't afford to import this piece.

The municipal government decided recently that it will  further boost these sectors this year.    In machinery, 115,000 automobiles are to be churned out in  1994. And stress will be put on machine-tooling, hydraulic  electrogenerating facilities and engineering machines.    In the electronics sector, improvement of video recorders  and  color televisions will enjoy priority as well as advanced  telecommunications and computers.    The chemical industry will develop high-efficiency  pesticide,  first-class paint and other products.    And top-flight metal products will top the agenda in the  metallurgical field.    At present, most enterprises involved in these fields boast  large scale production. And their products have held a large  market share at home. For example, "Xiali" cars and "Dafa"  minibuses from the Tianjin Automobile Company have dominated the  taxi market in large and medium-sized cities.    So far, the industrial output value in Tianjin, north  China's  No. 1 industrial city, has reached some 50 billion yuan.    The city started the development of the four pillar  industries in the 1980s.</p>

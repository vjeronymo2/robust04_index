			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- The Azanian People's  Organisation [Azapo] on Wednesday [23 March] urged blacks to  continue their "revolutionary campaigns against the remaining  dummy structures and puppets in the so-called bantustan and  tricameral administrations".    An Azapo statement expressed the organisation's "salutation  to black people in the Eastern Cape for having forced once more  another puppet dictator, Mr (Brig) Oupa Gqozo, out of power".  Brig Gqozo was the leader of Ciskei. The statement continued:  "The brave and relentless efforts of black people against  (Brig) Oupa Gqozo's administration vindicates Azapo's  longstanding position that our people have never accepted the  bantustan and tricameral system and its puppet leaders."    Azapo called on blacks to celebrate their victories in  forcing Brig Gqozo and Bophuthatswana leader Mr Lucas Mangope  out of power. "Azapo also calls upon black people to defend and  protect their revolutionary gains by rejecting all attempts by  the illegitimate (President F W) de Klerk regime and its  advisory body (Transitional Executive Council) to install yet  another of its white functionaries or lackeys to administer the  already discredited bantustan or tricameral structures as they  have done in the so-called Bophuthatswana. Azapo further  appeals to black people to struggle more than ever before not  only to ensure the collapse of the puppet administrators but  also to ensure that the (Mr) de Klerk regime is overthrown to  usher in a new and democratic socialist republic of Azania."</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEATING GOT STAR TREATMENT DURING STAY IN COUNTY JAIL  </P> <P> When Charles H. Keating Jr. stepped to freedom through the doors of Los Angeles  County Jail Thursday night, he told reporters, "Everyone in there was just  fine."  </P> <P> Indeed. During his monthlong imprisonment, the Phoenix businessman known for  his lavish lifestyle was afforded a level of personal service and liberal  treatment not given most other inmates, jail officials said Friday.  </P> <P> He was allowed four hours a day of exercise and leisure time -- much of which  he spent on the phone -- compared to two hours a week usually given most  prisoners. Keating's food was served in plates and bowls, compared to  TV-dinner-like trays for others. And he ate ample portions of the servings.  </P> <P> At his disposal during leisure time were a color television, pay telephone,  exercise bike, shower, books and magazines.  </P> <P> "Some inmates refer to it as the 'country club,' " Commander Robert Pash, a  county jail spokesman, said of the wing where Keating stayed.  </P> <P> Authorities described Keating as a cooperative prisoner who created no  controversy inside the jail since entering it on Sept. 18 after being indicted  on 42 counts of securities fraud in connection with Phoenix-based American  Continental Corp. and its failed former unit, Irvine-based Lincoln Savings  &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old former American Continental chairman, released Thursday night  after a federal judge lowered his bail to $300,000 from $5 million, followed  rules and got along with guards and inmates -- spending 33 quiet days in a  highly isolated but relatively freer prison environment, authorities said.  </P> <P> "He was in high spirits considering the situation," said Dan Ordway, a deputy  sheriff at the jail. "He was courteous and he smiled occasionally."  </P> <P> Ordway said the inmate population was aware of Keating's presence, but he "did  not create a stir" compared to Christian Brando -- son of actor Marlon Brando  -- who earlier had been housed in the same special wing as Keating.  </P> <P> Jail officials say Keating -- who refused requests for an interview -- was  treated like about 60 other prisoners detained in a separate security section  called the "7000 wing." Actor Todd Bridges was detained there, as was Brando.  </P> <P> The wing is set aside for high-profile prisoners or others who might need  protection from fellow inmates, Pash said. There were three others in Keating's  block -- all in one-person cells divided by a 7-by-40-foot leisure area known  as the freeway, which contained the TV, phone and other amenities. Only one of  the four inmates had access to the freeway at a time.  </P> <P> "He was kept in a high-security area for high-risk people because of his  notoriety," Pash said. "There is some freedom . . . but the area is needed  because (otherwise) every time we move him outside the cell, he would have to  be escorted by a guard. This minimizes the need for security escort. We make up  for the restrictions on movement by letting them out into the freeway for  longer periods."  </P> <P> "They're housed this way for a reason and for our convenience," Pash said.  </P> <P> For Keating -- accustomed to corporate jets, mansion living and top-notch  service -- the setting and experience was still a radical change. However, he  was given personal service because he -- like other high-profile prisoners --  was not allowed to make trips to the facility's cafeteria or the jail store.  </P> <P> Instead, food was brought to Keating's cell at 6 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 5 p.m.  daily. The main dinner courses included dishes such as spaghetti, turkey a la  king, ham and chili. Salad, bread and dessert -- pastry, cookies or ice cream,  for example -- were part of dinner.  </P> <P> The same fare was served to the general jail population, but those inmates --  about 6,500 people -- eat from trays, a faster way to serve a large group.  Metal bowls, metal cups and paper plates were used in Keating's block.  </P> <P> "He ate well," Pash said.  </P> <P> Items from the jail store -- newspapers, candy, tobacco products and shaving  items -- were wheeled to Keating's cell twice a week. Guards said Keating  bought shaving items and newspapers.  </P> <P> As are other high-profile prisoners, Keating was allowed visitors daily between  noon and 7 p.m. While inmates in the general population are restricted to about  20 minutes of visitation per day, the segregated group in the 7000 wing could  get up to 90 minutes per visitor -- for up to five hours per day -- because  they are fewer in number. Keating saw visitors daily, mainly family members,  guards said.  </P> <P> However, there is nothing posh about the setting in the 7000 wing. Keating's  6-by-10-foot cell -- painted white -- contained a bunk with a mattress and  blanket, toilet and sink. Prisoners in the general population are locked behind  jail doors made of bars. Cells in the 7000 wing contain metal doors with a  window and slots for food delivery.  </P> <P> Despite the isolation and greater sound-resistant doors, Keating occasionally  chatted with others in his cell block, guards said.  </P> <P> However, guards said, Keating did most of his talking on the telephone --  mainly to his lawyers -- during his daily four-hour leisure period.  </P> <P> Although Keating indicated that he was treated well, there were some hitches.  When he arrived, he traded in his business suit and tie for prison blues. His  business attire, like all inmate clothing, was to be dry cleaned and made  available upon his release.  </P> <P> But a deputy said Keating's clothing could not be found when a bond agent  secured his release Thursday. Freedom was delayed while family members arranged  to acquire other clothing, the deputy said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James S. Granelli contributed to this story.  </P></p>

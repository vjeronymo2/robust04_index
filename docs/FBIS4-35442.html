			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] fugitives  were killed this afternoon in the village of al-Ram, north of  Jerusalem, during an operation by the Shin Bet and the Israel  Police special antiterror unit.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that one of the two men  killed was Yusuf Naji, the murderer of the late Shin Bet agent  No'am Kohen. As may be recalled, Naji was a former collaborator  with the authorities and Kohen was his handler.    In the course of a meeting, Naji and his accomplices shot  No'am Kohen and his two bodyguards. No'am Kohen died as a  result of the shooting and the Shin Bet has been conducting a  manhunt after Naji ever since.</p>

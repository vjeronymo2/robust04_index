Presently,  although this initiative is purely national in scope, the French  Government wishes other European partners--beginning with Spain  and Italy--to become involved with this program's first phase.    In comparison to Helios I (two optical observation  satellites, one of which is to be orbited at the beginning of  1995), the Helios II program anticipates the building of four  higher-performance satellites. Their additional infrared  capacity will permit them to see equally at night and day,  during cloudy weather and under bad atmospheric conditions.  Helios I has been designed in the mold of Spot-4 civilian  program (it uses the same platforms and image storing  recorders), the same way Helios II resembles the Spot-5 program.  These are 2.5-ton military satellites launched by Ariane. Helios  II will follow Helios I beginning in 2001.    The Helios I program, sponsored jointly by Italy (14  percent)  and Spain (7 percent), has been estimated to cost 7.5 billion  French francs. The Helios II program, a partnership of CNES  (National Center for Space Studies), Aerospatiale, Matra and  Dassault Electronique, should cost about the same. According to  Mr. Leotard, "conservative measures" have been taken because  "Italy and Spain, and eventually other European partners, can  join the  program"</p>

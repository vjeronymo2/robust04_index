Sales of rice from Thailand and China are slated to begin  next Tuesday, with authorities planning to sell a total of  50,000 tons of the imported grain this month.    Japanese consumers should be able to find imported rice on  the shop shelves for the first time in late February.    According to the Food Agency, unblended Californian rice  will  be sold to wholesalers for about 17,000 yen per 60-kilogram  sack, or 16 percent cheaper than the standard price for domestic  varieties.    Japan's domestic rice prices, however, are far higher than  world market prices. For example, the U.S.-grown Koshihikari  top-grade rice was retailing in the United States for 1.93  dollars (208 yen at current exchange rates) per kilogram last  year, while the equivalent in Japan was being sold at 650 yen a  kilogram.    The imported grain is likely to be initially sold in  test-size two-kilogram and five-kilogram bags.    When supplies of Japanese-grown rice become tight in March,  imported rice and blends of domestic and foreign grain are  expected to dominate rice sales.    Japan opted to import rice as an emergency measure after a  poor harvest last year left the nation with a major shortfall of  its main staple.    In December, Japan agreed at global trade talks to partially  open its rice market, breaking a long-standing policy of barring  most imports.</p>

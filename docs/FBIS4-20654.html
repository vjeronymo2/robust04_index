			<p>CSO     [Text] AIST's National Institute of Bioscience and Human  Technology (NIBH) has developed a CAD (computer-aided design)  system incorporating virtual reality. This makes it possible to  design transformation of a material on the computer with the  feeling of doing workmanship in clay. It is now easy to design  products with subtle curves for which previously models had to  be built.    The newly-developed system includes a manipulator maneuvered  by a person, a computer, and a monitor that shows virtual space.  The manipulator can move lengthwise, sideways, or in height in  addition to rotating. It has six degrees of freedom and moves  throughout three-dimensional space.    The grasp of the manipulator is moved on the screen by the  cursor. It can be maneuvered on the screen just like pushing  clay with a scoop. The sense of resistance and the  transformation of the virtual material can freely be regulated.    A rapid calculation algorithm (direct deformation  manipulation method or DDM) to directly and smoothly change the  place touched by the cursor was developed for transforming the  virtual material. It succeeds in reflecting changes on the  screen as the manipulator moves.    Automotive steering wheel, body and other products are often  made with a combination of subtle curves which are finely  altered in ways unseen to the eye. They have needed models  remade and checked by hand. It has also taken time to design  parts such as helicopter rotors which have complex curves. This  new system will help simplify this kind of design.</p>

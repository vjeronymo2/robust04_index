			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / New Zealand repays most debt Unexpectedly strong economic growth will allow the New Zealand government to repay most of its foreign debt within the next four years, Mr Bill Birch, minister of finance, said. In releasing on Tuesday what he said was the most positive budget outlook the country had seen in decades, Mr Birch forecast that the surplus for the financial year to June 30 would be NZDollars 2.3bn (Pounds 940m), twice the estimate made in the budget in June. The Treasury estimates that, helped by higher tax income, the surplus will grow to NZDollars 3.5bn in 1996, to NZDollars 5bn in 1997 and to Dollars NZDollars 7.6bn in 1998. Mr Birch said that the government will resist pressure to spend the surpluses on domestic programmes, but will continue to concentrate on repaying debt and keeping the brakes on inflation, rather than let the economy steam ahead. This would mean New Zealand could create more jobs and raise household incomes.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italcimenti warns on profits ITALCEMENTI, Italy's biggest cement group, which this year became one of the world's largest producers after buying Ciments Francais in France, has warned of lower profits and dividends for 1992. Mr Giampiero Pesenti, chairman, said sales for the first half of this year rose by 4.7 per cent to L768bn (Dollars 612m). However, the group was being held back in the home market, in which it has a share of over 30 per cent, by slow sales and continuing price controls, which prevented it from passing on higher costs. Speaking at the annual meeting of Italmobiliare, his holding company, Mr Pesenti said Italcementi's cement deliveries had grown by 4.4 per cent in the first half, against a 6.1 per cent national average. Production, up by 4 per cent, had also lagged the national average. Speaking of a 'static period' in the home market, Mr Pesenti forecast this year's earnings and dividends would be overshadowed by rising costs and lower turnover owning to falling prices. 'The dividend is bound to feel the block on prices and the rise in costs,' Mr Pesenti told shareholders. First half sales also slipped at Ciments Francais, acquired for L1,700bn, with a 5 per cent decrease to FFr7.5bn (Dollars 1.45bn). Adjusted for disposals, the fall was 1.6 per cent, and reflected the downturn in the French economy. Europa Metalli, the industrial arm of the Italian SMI non-ferrous metals group, reported a fall in first half consolidated turnover to L1,567bn from L1,610bn a year earlier, owing to the continuing drop in metals prices.</p>

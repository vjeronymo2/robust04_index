			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Chemicals jobs forecast to fall by 9,000 The Pounds 28bn-a-year UK chemicals industry will shed more than 9,000 jobs during 1994 as companies struggle to compete with foreign suppliers, according to forecasts from the Chemical Industries Association yesterday. Output, investment and exports will nevertheless rise as the UK leads the rest of Europe to recovery. Productivity growth in the UK will be 'very positive', said the association. It forecasts a 3 per cent jobs fall and a rise in output of 2.5 per cent. An increasing proportion of production will be exported, and the trade surplus is likely to rise from Pounds 3.8bn to 'over Pounds 4bn', said Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI and chairman of the association's Economic Appraisal Committee. The forecasts are strongly affected by trends in the pharmaceutical sector, which accounts for 30 per cent of UK chemicals production. Excluding pharmaceuticals, growth in chemicals production will rise from 1 per cent in 1993 to 2 per cent this year, said Mr Freeman. The UK and France will be the only two large countries in western Europe which will raise investment. UK investment will show a sharp turnaround from 1993, when it fell by 10 per cent, to register an increase of 5 per cent this year. However, the Continent will show a much sharper change in investment strategy with, for example, western Germany improving from last year's 21 per cent cut in investment to a 2 per cent fall in 1994. The figures were given at the annual business outlook conference held by the association. At the same conference, the association's director-general, Mr John Cox, said that the successful implementation of the Uruguay round of Gatt talks 'should be worth an additional Pounds 1bn per annum for the chemical industry by the end of the decade'. However, Mr Clive Thompson, vice-president of operations and supply at Arco Chemical Europe, warned that 'there are few bright signs of competitiveness in the (European) chemicals industry'. He said that although growth would probably return, it was unlikely to be fast enough to sustain historic levels of research, development and capital programmes. Three sectors are forecast to remain under heavy pressure: organic chemicals  -mostly petrochemicals - fibres and fertilisers.

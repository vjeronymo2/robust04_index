			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Tory opinion poll lead cut to 2.5 points THE CONSERVATIVE lead over Labour has halved, according to an opinion poll published today. That was before the political storm over this week's gloomy figures on unemployment, house repossessions and economic output. The Tories' 40 per cent rating in a Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph is 2.5 percentage points above Labour's - compared with a 5 point lead a week before. The poll was completed on Tuesday. Labour and Tory strategists will study opinion polls over the next few days for any sign of the latest economic statistics marking a turning point in the campaign. Neither party has been able to build a lasting lead so far this year. The Gallup poll shows the Liberal Democrats up 3.5 points at 17.5 per cent. MPs now regard April 9 as a near certainty for the election date, leaving only three complete weeks before the campaign proper begins. Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, intensified the pre-election mood at Westminster yesterday by threatening legal action against Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, over comments Mr Hain made last week on BBC television over thefts from MPs offices. Conservative party lawyers have been instructed to start libel proceedings - unless Mr Hain apologises, retracts and gives redress for what Mr Patten said were 'untrue' allegations. Mr Patten said Mr Hain had said that he had organised or encouraged a concerted campaign of criminal activity to gain political intelligence to discredit the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Mr Hain said he would not be 'gagged' by Conservative Central Office 'about these sinister series of apparently politically motivated pre-election smears and computer burglaries'. Mr Patten's threat came as ministers acknowledged that some of the legislative programme would be lost if the general election was on April 9. Two possible casualties are the Asylum Bill and the Schools Bill, which seeks to privatise the Schools' Inspectorate. Ministers raised the prospect of changes to immigration rules being part of the Conservative manifesto by saying that if the controversial Asylum Bill was not completed it would be reintroduced if the Tories won the election. The bill was proposed by the government to toughen immigration procedures in the face of increasing numbers of asylum seekers.</p>

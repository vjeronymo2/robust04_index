			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Serbs in Croatia hold out on UN HARDLINE leaders of a Serb enclave in the republic of Croatia denied last night that they had dropped their objections to a UN peace-keeping plan. According to the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav presidency, after three days of talks in Belgrade the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina, in southern Croatia, had accepted the UN plan to send 10,000 peace-keepers to Croatia In a statement reported by the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, the presidency said that the president of Krajina's parliament, Mr Mile Paspalj, had accepted the plan on behalf of the parliament in the absence of Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president. But later, in a statement signed by Mr Babic and issued by the Krajina government office in Belgrade, the Krajina government said it had not agreed to accept UN peace-keepers on its territory. A spokesman at the office said Mr Paspalj did not have the authority to sign any agreements on behalf of the Krajina government. In more than 30 hours of closed-door talks Serb leaders from throughout Yugoslavia were unable to persuade Mr Babic to agree to the UN plan. In a sign of the widening rift with Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, Mr Babic accused the rump Yugoslav presidency of plotting a coup d'etat to unseat his government. While Mr Babic's opposition has blocked the Serbian side, Croat leaders have also objected to the UN plan. They insist that the mandate for peacekeepers should not be extended for more than a year, fearing long-term deployment would mean the permanent loss of Krajina to Serbia. The federal army and Serb irregulars currently control about one-third of Croatia. Mr Babic says the Serb-controlled federal army must remain in Krajina even after peacekeepers are deployed. He insists Serb paramilitary units should not be disarmed unless Croat forces are disbanded.</p>

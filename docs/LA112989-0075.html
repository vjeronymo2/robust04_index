			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR FORCE SAYS BILL THREATENS TEST FLIGHTS  </P> <P> Air Force officials told Antelope Valley business people Tuesday that a desert  preservation bill pending in Congress could hamper low-altitude flights from  Edwards Air Force Base. However, the officials rejected local speculation that  the base might be forced to move.  </P> <P> The proposed California desert protection act, sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.), would give about 7.5 million acres of desert -- mostly in Southern  California -- either wilderness or parkland status. The land would include  tracts under the airspace used by Edwards and other military bases.  </P> <P> Cranston and environmental groups supporting his bill say it would not restrict  military use of airspace over the desert. But Air Force officials say it could  preclude the sort of low-altitude testing now done at Edwards. The officials  said the base will stay where it is, but that they could be forced to shift  some flights to more remote areas.  </P></p>

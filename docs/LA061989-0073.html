			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE REFORM NEEDED TO CURB RISING COSTS, SULLIVAN TELLS AMA  </P> <P> The nation's health chief told the American Medical Assn. on Sunday that a  Medicare reform plan strongly opposed by the group is a solution to  skyrocketing medical costs and lack of access to quality care.  </P> <P> Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,  said that such solutions are better than a total overhaul of the system.  </P> <P> The U.S. per capita expenditures for health care are the highest in the world,  consuming more than 11% of the country's gross national product, "and they  continue to rise at an unsustainable rate," Sullivan told more than 1,000  physicians on the opening day of the AMA's five-day policy-making session.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lags in Health Indices  </P> <P> "Yet the United States lags far behind other industrialized countries in some  basic health indices, including average life expectancy and maternal  mortality," he said.  </P> <P> Sullivan told reporters afterward that he had reiterated the Bush  Administration's support for "expenditure targets" during a meeting with the  AMA's Board of Trustees earlier Sunday.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, aimed at curbing increasing fees by doctors who treat  Medicare patients, the government would set maximum levels for reimbursement.  </P> <P> Dr. James H. Sammons, the association's executive vice president, called the  proposal "rationing" of medical care in a speech to members later Sunday and  said he has "personally communicated the medical profession's objections" to  the White House and to Sullivan.  </P></p>

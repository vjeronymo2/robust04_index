			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: A moment of truth Since the UK equity market has been trading at near-record levels in recent days, investors must have been reasonably sanguine about the Maastricht vote. The downside risk from a government defeat was after all clear in advance: political confusion of a sort that is anathema to financial markets and the prospect of a much weaker pound (which was also holding up remarkably well against the D-Mark ahead of the vote). A No vote thus hardly held the promise of an equity market rally of the sort that greeted the UK's initial departure from the ERM. Then the assumption was that freedom from the shackles of Europe would give the government the freedom to pursue an independent economic policy for recovery. Only later did it dawn that a widening PSBR would be much harder to fund with institutional cash-flow tight and sterling floating free. Yesterday's modest fall in long gilts suggests investors in that market too were fairly relaxed. None of this means, however, that equities approached last night with much to look forward to from a favourable vote. An historic market multiple of over 16 makes shares expensive when there is still no economic recovery and corporate earnings are stagnant. Besides, many more nasty moments loom on the political and economic front, such as public sector pay, mine closures, and the Edinburgh summit.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BIOMEDICINE  </P> <P> 'Cold' Laser Catheter: Trimedyne Inc. is "hedging its bets" on what form of  laser technology will win the allegiance of physicians looking for a tool to  unclog blocked arteries in the heart and limbs.  </P> <P> The Tustin company, which already has approval from the Food and Drug  Administration to market a thermal-type laser-assisted catheter, is also  conducting tests on two varieties of so-called "cold" laser catheters, which  use laser beams to remove plaque without creating much heat. On Wednesday, the  company said it had received FDA approval to begin human clinical trials of a  cold laser to open partially blocked blood vessels. Several weeks ago, it  received similar approval to begin testing a cold laser on fully blocked  vessels.  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / 3i to back buy-out of Daf unit THE UK's largest venture capital group, 3i, plans to provide financial backing for a management buy-out of the Leyland Daf van operations in Birmingham. The vans plant, which still employs 1,200, is being operated as a going concern by administrative receivers. The 3i move was being hailed last night as a significant breakthrough by the buy-out team, which is being led by managing director Mr Allan Amey. 3i gave no indication of either the form its support is to take, or the size of the funding likely to be involved. However, its Birmingham director, Mr Chris Rowlands, said: 'We have evaluated very closely the plans which the management team has developed and we are satisfied, subject to further due diligence, that they represent a viable basis for a successful future. 'We are delighted to commit a substantial package of support alongside other institutions to help the management team deliver their plans as quickly as possible.' There was no immediate indication of which other financial institutions might be involved, or the terms under which they might participate. Mr Amey and several fellow directors taking part in the buy-out attempt have stressed that their business plan requires a long-term commitment from financial backers, and that they are not interested in surrendering equity control which could lead to an early sale of the business. Mr Amey said he was 'confident' that the balance of finance would be in place to meet a target date in the second half of April for a buy-out to be completed. Mr Murdoch McKillop, the Arthur Andersen joint administrative receiver, yesterday finished setting up the Birmingham operation - which also provides vehicle body pressings to the Land Rover group and other industry users - as a distinct, stand-alone business from the Leyland trucks plant and other activities also in receivership as a result of parent Daf group's collapse. As part of these arrangements, new franchise agreements have been concluded with dealers. Mr David Duggins, Arthur Andersen's partner responsible for the Birmingham facilities, described the arrangements as 'an important milestone'. The receivers still regard further job cuts at the plant as inevitable, however. 'This review is designed to establish the business on a viable long-term footing. Regrettably, it is likely to result in some further redundancies,' a spokesman said. There are still considerable stocks in the system and production will be cut from about 230 a week to 200. Precisely how many jobs are to go is expected to be known within the next fortnight.</p>

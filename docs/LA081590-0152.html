			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEC PROBING SPOKANE EXCHANGE  </P> <P> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has started what it calls an  "informal investigation" of trading practices at the antiquated Spokane Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> In a letter delivered Tuesday to exchange members, the SEC's Enforcement  Division asked the exchange to provide documents covering surveillance  procedures, complaints and other matters.  </P> <P> Exchange compliance officer John Campbell said the inquiry could determine  whether the nearly 100-year-old exchange can continue operating as the nation's  only exchange without an electronic quotation system.  </P> <P> The exchange was established in the 1890s to provide capital for the mining  industry in eastern Washington, northern Idaho and British Columbia. Despite  efforts to diversify, it is still dominated by highly speculative mining  stocks.  </P></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (16): Now the lines are busier than ever - Facsimile Systems THE European facsimile market is holding its own, according to market research company BIS Strategic Decisions, with unit sales forecast to rise to over 2.5m in 1995, which represents an 8 per cent CAGR over the 1991-95 period. However, the market value is expected to decline as a result of lowering prices to USDollars 2.5bn in 1995 from the Dollars 2.8bn high in 1991. There is no decline in revenues for the network operators, though. The 1993 Pitney Bowes/Gallup survey of UK FT 1000 companies shows a jump of 61 per cent in the number of outgoing faxes in the past year, with the daily average per business rising from 40.3 documents of 3.6 pages to 65.1 documents of 5.1 pages. The survey also found that the number of fax machines in FT 1000 companies has almost doubled, from an average of 6.5 units per company in 1992 to 14.5 in 1993. All surveys note the trend towards more sophisticated features and plain paper fax (PPF), with BIS estimating that the PPF share of the European fax market was 9 per cent in 1991 (19 per cent by value) but will be 45 per cent (72 per cent in value) by 1996. According to Dataquest research, 53,000 PPF units were shipped in the UK last year, with the figure set to rise to 177,000 by 1997, an annual growth of 35 per cent. A Pounds 5m order placed by British Gas for a new fleet of Rank Xerox plain paper fax machines would appear to add weight to the prediction. Inkjet technology will, however, experience the strongest growth, with unit sales expected to grow from 20,000 units a year now to 75,000 by 1997. The early success of the Canon B200, which came in at under Pounds 900, appears to prove the point. Gunning for the same market seven months later is Olivetti with the OFX2100, a sub-Pounds 900 unit which has the added advantage of a PC interface. Those launching inkjets at around Pounds 1,285, Infotec, Panasonic and Ricoh among them, tend to be targeting the business rather than the mass market, where fast response after sales service is considered a more important criterion than price per se. Increased competition from new technologies should mean that toner-based PPF fax will either come down in price or will boast more sophisticated features designed to save operating costs or improve image quality at the same price. These include faster speeds, higher resolutions, larger memories, dual or multi-access facilities and, like the newer inkjets, PC or network interfaces. As one might expect from a company that commissioned the Gallup research, epitomising the trend is the new Model 9640 PPF machine from Pitney Bowes which is priced at Pounds 2,795 plus Vat, and comes with a fast 14.4Kbps modem, 620K memory, extra fine resolution and RS232 interface. COMPUTER FAX Users are still cautious about PC fax, it seems. Dataquest says less than 5 per cent of PCs and LANs have on-board fax facilities. The Pitney Bowes/Gallup survey show a rosier picture for FT 1000 companies, with 24 per cent of users sending faxes direct from their computers, although 38 per cent do use a computer equipped with a modem. Peter Champion, market development manager, Ascom Data Networks, an established supplier of computer fax, believes that the slow take-up is largely due to a lack of user-friendly software applications and ignorance on the part of business users. The software developers are getting there, slowly, with the help of Windows-based software. Current favourite among the fax/modem suppliers such as Dataflex and US Robotics who supply a total package is Delrina Winfax. Word-processing users would much prefer faxing to be as easy as printing from within the application; hopefully the inclusion of fax communications in the new 6.0 versions of WordPerfect, due out soon, will set a trend and encourage greater use in offices where the large number of fax messages are generated. Dataquest believes that the one the networked PC community should watch for is Microsoft at Work which, although at least a year away, will make fax, copying, printing and voice a standard combination on all desktop systems. PORTABLE FAX Although Ricoh and NEC are winning sales for their mobile fax machines, and Canon has a baby mobile fax in the wings, it still appears to be a niche market. However, portable PC fax looks set for take-off, with an informal Dataquest survey finding that a LAN-adapter is the top priority for users, facsimile second. The spur to market growth is likely to be the advent of PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association) standard fax/modems which are credit-card sized. With the market forecast to grow six-fold and 400 hardware and software suppliers committed to the standard, we can expect a flurry of activity soon. But first on the market with PCMCIA fax/modems for mobile cellular and public phone networks are US Robotics and, soon, Nokia/AT&amp;T. MULTIFUNCTION FAX Ownership of fax devices in the home jumped dramatically last year, according to BIS, with over 47 per cent of home office and 89 per cent of work-at-home users purchasing devices in the past year. Main suppliers in this market are Muratec, Ricoh, Samsung and Toshiba. Innovations such as large memories, polling from remote machines and paging with phone-answering, as found on the new under-Pounds 500 Brother 360DT, should boost the market further. Those on a budget looking for a page printer, a plain paper fax, PC fax and scanner may well look to combination products. Typifying the genre, the Muratec F-75/Laserfax which can be used as a hard copy fax (Pounds 1,995) or as an image scanner and as a DOSor Windows compatible PC system. GROUP 4 FAX The arguments about the relative merits of the Group 4 standard versus Group 3 continue, although little if anything has been heard of Group 3bis, the 64K fast fax contender. Suppliers such as Infotec and Ricoh claim that this is not surprising since the uptake of ISDN digital lines from BT and Mercury for head office to branch communications is resulting in steady, though not euphoric, sales of Group 4 machines. With approximately 2,000 companies using ISDN channels (300 per cent up on last year), the potential savings in time, and thus in transmission costs, are being recognised. In the UK, HM Customs &amp; Excise, for example, has placed an order for ten Canon L3300i Group 4 fax machines for its regional offices. Companies who want to benefit from the savings in transmission costs between the UK and US but do not have the constant volumes to justify purchasing the equipment can now benefit from the first G4 fax service which has been set up by Infotec for Ocean Group, whereby users can end faxes via the fast London-Manhattan link with documents transferred to G3 machines at local country rates. The advent of ISDN also opens up the market to colour fax. SERVICES While the high-margin end of the market is still struggling, the suppliers of low-cost consumer fax machines will continue to win the lion's share of unit sales, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, with the market driven by automated fax-on-demand services. Government departments were among the first to embrace the technology with Statfax which provides economic statistics, with Weatherfax among the more popular. It is being used increasingly by customer support departments to save time and improves customer service response levels. An example is copier supplier Konica which has introduced Flashfax, a computer to fax information retrieval service which enables engineers to get immediate help in fault-finding when out on service calls. The fact that fax services can be set up very quickly and run for a specified period is a big bonus. In March, for example, Hambros Bank used Mercury Communications' Surefax service to launch Budgetline, a financial information broadcasting service designed to provide all clients simultaneously with accurate, up to the minute information about changes introduced in the budget and their implications.</p>

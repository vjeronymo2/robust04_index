			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Trashutin: "The Sibinkor Empire"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Deputy Speaker </H5>   Kharkov--Oleh Dyomin was born in 1942. He is Russian, and  has  a college education. He has great experience in party and  economic work. Dyomin was the first secretary of the  Kominternovskiy Rayon Committee, and later a secretary of the  CPSU Kharkov City Committee. After the CPSU was banned, he moved  on to the Ukrainian-Siberian investment corporation as vice  president. He is president of the Prospect 21 foundation. Dyomin  calls himself a nonparty member. He did not engage in political  activities between September 1991 and the moment of his  nomination for the Supreme Council. He was nominated for the  post of mayor in Kharkov, but withdrew as a candidate after his  election as deputy speaker.  <H5>  The Election </H5>   The candidate was nominated in Kominternovskiy Electoral  District No. 371 by a group of voters, the labor collective of  the Budhidroprylad state enterprise, and Motor Vehicle Pool  16,328. During the election campaign he drew on his old  connections in the rayon since the time of his tenure as  secretary. He was virtually the only candidate whose victory was  predicted unanimously by the political observers of Kharkov. He  did not shrink from directly flirting with voters, for example,  as he spoke on 8 March in the imeni Artem park before members of  the Soldiers' Brotherhood club of veterans, he arranged for a  free smorgasbord and presents for the wives packaged in  brand-name paper bags with Ukrsybinkor labels. In the first  round he got 24.4 percent, and his closest rival--9.4 percent.  In the second round he got 53.54 percent, or 31.2 percent of the  total number of voters. His political views--a supporter of the  Chinese way and strong centralized power. His vision of  transformations is in keeping with this pattern: economic  reform, reform of social consciousness, reform of the political  system. He believes that only a soviet political system is  capable of conducting economic reform in the direction of the  market. For this reason he denounces the destruction of this  system. He calls the 1 December referendum a "deception of the  people" because "the people were in favor of independence but  within the Union." The introduction of the coupon was a tragedy  and a national disgrace. "Ukraine has been ripped out of the  ruble zone!" About the Belovezha agreements: "Unfortunately, the  personal mercenary interests of individual princelings prevailed  rather than the interests of the people." For this reason it is  "necessary to resume relations with Russia to the full extent  not only in the economic but also in the military-political  sphere." Dyomin's participation, along with that of Sibinkor  President Taranov, in the proceedings of a roundtable panel of  the representatives of centrist forces of the three independent  states in Kharkov on 21 May 1994 is explained precisely by this  vision of relations between Ukraine and Russia.    Together with another group of moneybags, he signed a  declaration before the second round of voting to deflect  accusations about forming an anticommunist bloc. The declaration  said in particular: "An anticommunist bloc is out of the  question. All of us are the children of our motherland and our  time. We know well, perhaps better than others, what our country  achieved under socialism and how many people were inspired and  propelled into battle and labor by the communist idea. We do not  renounce our convictions at present, either.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   The Unity group of deputies, which in addition to Dyomin,  the  residents of Kharkov Taranov, the Sibinkor president, Alekseyev  (Civic Congress of Ukraine) and Chornousenko (SBU) [Ukrainian  Security Service] joined, was established on a nonparty basis on  the principles of counteracting the spread of "dense  nationalism," mutually advantageous economic relations with  Russia, and putting the economy in order. They quickly found a  common language with the left. The latter, lacking a real  program for overcoming the crisis, agreed to yield a string of  key positions to their allies (Taranov's appointment as head of  the economic policy commission). The new postcommunist  bourgeoisie which comes from the communist circles suits them  just fine because it voices (at least publicly) views that are  quite close to theirs. On the other hand, it may serve as a  guide of sorts to the future. Under the circumstances, Hrynyov  and his ilk are the losers because this new bourgeoisie has come  to power itself, and it no longer needs the services of overly  talkative and continuously hungry intermediaries. Power is  gradually acquiring the features of an oligarchy. This, in turn,  indicates that a quite stable trend toward some kind of  Chinese-Latin American way of sociopolitical development has  emerged in Ukraine.    FROM THE FILES OF POST-POSTUP: The origins of the  Ukrsybinkor joint-stock company date back to the moment of the  creation in 1991 of the Universal Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange  (UUSB), of which the Rapid plant (director, Taranov) and the  organizations of the city of Tyumen were founders. In 1992 the  AT [Joint-Stock Company] Ukrsybinkor investment corporation was  created with a statutory fund of R250 million. Hundreds of  enterprises from the former USSR are its shareholders. In 1992  the controlling share of the Kharkivvinkombank was purchased,  which was transformed into the Ukrsybbank. At present there are  more than 30 enterprises and institutions in the joint-stock  company, including a plant for recycling precious metals. The  sphere of operations of the joint-stock company includes  production, commercial, intermediary, and banking services, and  glass production. Since summer 1992 the USB [Ukrainian-Siberian  Exchange] has engaged in the sale of Russian weapons (planes,  tanks, artillery systems, air defense materiel, and firearms).  For example, on 28 January 1993 a delivery of weapons worth more  than $2 billion was put up for sale. The AT Ukrsybinkor has its  own guard in the form of the 250-strong Alfa-Profi detachment of  the guardians of legal order set up under the aegis of the  Prospect 21 foundation. All of them have the certificates of  auxiliary militia employees. The detachment was actively used  during Oleg Taranov's election campaign. On one occasion this  resulted in a noisy scandal when its combatants seized in the  street citizens who were pasting up anti-Taranov leaflets.    The USB engages in extensive charitable activities,  supporting the development of children's athletics in  particular. People's Deputy Taranov is president of the AT  Ukrsybinkor. Dyomin, the deputy speaker and people's deputy, is  vice president.</p>

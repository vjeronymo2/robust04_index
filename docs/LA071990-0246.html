			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAUTHEN DRAWS BRITISH FINE FOR LATE PULLOUT FROM RACE  </P> <P> American jockey Steve Cauthen was fined $1,800 today by the Jockey Club, the  governing body of British horse racing, for pulling out of a race at the last  minute in May.  </P> <P> Cauthen refused to ride Pip Payne-trained colt Nicholas Payne at Leicester  after he had weighed out.  </P> <P> He was substituted by Richard Fox, who placed eighth in the race.  </P> <P> Cauthen said after the hearing that he disagreed with the Jockey Club's  decision and would do the same again.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was fair of the trainer to book me for that particular  horse. There is no doubt he was a difficult ride -- everybody backed me," the  former champion said.  </P> <P> Cauthen can appeal the decision. The last time he appeared before the Jockey  Club was in 1983, when he appealed unsuccessfully against an eight-day  suspension for careless riding.  </P></p>

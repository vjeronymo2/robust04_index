The city's discipline inspection and supervision organs have  investigated and handled a large number of law-violation and  discipline-violation cases involving party and government cadres  in a timely manner with the result that a total of 82 corrupt  elements have been expelled from the party and 35 others removed  from various government posts in 1993.    Yesterday, Guo Kaidian, a member of the Guangzhou City CPC  Committee Standing Committee and secretary of the Guangzhou City  CPC Discipline Inspection Commission, disclosed at the second  plenary session of the city's discipline inspection commission  that discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels  across the city have conscientiously conducted education on  clean government building as well as strict law and discipline  enforcement among party and government cadres at and above  county or provincial department section level this year, with  the result that more than 3,000 leading cadres at and above  county or provincial department section level in the city have  now completed a self-examination and self-rectification campaign  among themselves, 504 of whom have confessed their wrongdoings.    In the anticorruption struggle, the city's discipline  inspection and supervision organs have devoted more energy to  investigating and handling discipline-violation and  law-violation cases. In the January-November period this year,  a total of 369 discipline- violation and law-violation cases and  a total of 377 people were placed on file for investigation and  prosecution with the result that a total of 176 people were  disciplined within the party and a total of 128 people penalized  within the government, four people were removed from various  party posts and 11 people were relieved of various government  posts, and another batch of cadres was placed on probation  within the party, given a serious disciplinary warning, demoted  in position and rank, recorded a demerit, or were penalized in  other ways within the party and government.</p>

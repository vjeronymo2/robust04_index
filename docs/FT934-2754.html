			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Travel: Golfers with the urge to drive by night We were on the lam in south-west Ireland and we were loving every minute of it. Me and my friend Jock knew we would be caught by fading daylight eventually. The question was whether we could delay the moment long enough to eke out a few more holes of golf. Our intention was to play as many as we could before dinner. It had been a sudden idea, as the best ones often are, cooked up in a moment in late afternoon. No sooner had we thought of it than we had jumped into my car and set off, wheels spinning, for Tralee golf club 30 miles away. There were few barriers to our sudden serendipitous idea. At that time of night, there were would not be many others around to hold us up. I knew Tralee, the first course designed in Europe by Arnold Palmer, from several earlier visits. Jock, on the other hand, had never been there. He was anxious to see as many of its outstanding holes as he could: the long 2nd, the demanding 3rd, the glorious 8th which lies so well along the sweep of the bay, the short 13th across the pit, the devilish 15th. Perhaps the 16th - which, from the back tees, I believe to be one of the most difficult and heroic short holes in the world - might be too far; but we would move as quickly as we could and hope to get them all in. We began at a gallop and, after taking a deep breath, walked all the way to the back tee of the 3rd, high above the sea. To James Joyce writing in Ulysses, it had been 'the snotgreen sea, the scrotum-tightening sea.' Now, however, it snoozed softly below us, benign and silvery. The green, built on rocks, jutted out in the distance. Beneath it was the cave used in Ryan's Daughter. Behind us, deserted and inviting, was the wide, long beach used in the same film. My first ball pinged off the rocks; another soared away to the left. It was 220 yards just to reach the green from this tee. What on earth made me think I could hit the ball that far with an iron, even on a still night such as this? As the daylight began to fade I caught a glimpse of Jock. His face, burnished by the wind and sun, had a look of sublime contentment. We were at one with our surroundings and, just as important, with our own golf. The setting sun spurred us to play still faster. The ebbing tide moved slowly down the estuary leaving thickening fingers of mud behind. It looked tired. We certainly were. It had, after all, been a long day, one that had begun 14 hours earlier. We had not eaten since lunch and had hardly eaten then. I had forgotten how hungry I was until we dashed from the 8th green to the 9th tee to play our last hole. In the gathering gloom, we each whacked a drive towards the beckoning light of the clubhouse. Then we half-walked, half-ran until we found the balls. We whacked them again and again. By now, it was so dark we could not make out the flag on the green. Somehow we halved the hole, five whacks and several putts each. In the clubhouse, the hands of the clock stood at 9.55. The only place still serving dinner was the Oyster Bar in Spa, six miles towards Tralee. The barman telephoned for us. 'They will hold a table for you but you must get there by 10.30,' he said. Dinner was as much a surprise as anything that had happened to us all evening: delicious soda bread and fresh salmon, perhaps caught a mile or so from where we were sitting. Afterwards, there was a tap on my right elbow. I looked up to see a stout lady with a friendly face. Soon, we were deep in conversation. She sat at a long table with what looked to be six or seven relatives. At the head was a small boy in a blazer, no more than 12. 'My father died a year ago today,' explained the lady. 'We had a mass this afternoon and now we're celebrating. He had a good life. He was 90 when he died. In his later years, he often said to me: 'If you look after me well when I am still alive, then you can dance on my grave when I'm gone'.' At midnight, the singing ended and the restaurant emptied quickly. We drove home slowly in the velvet-soft darkness. Jock looked out of the window. I concentrated on driving. My feet had stopped aching and I felt the intense pleasure of a man who had exercised well. It had been a rare old day, one that lingers in the mind for years.</p>

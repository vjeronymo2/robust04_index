			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Beechcraft a contender forBAe division BEECHCRAFT, the business aircraft division of the US Raytheon group, has emerged at the Farnborough Air Show as a strong contender to buy British Aerospace's corporate jet division. BAe announced earlier this year it intended to sell a majority stake in its corporate jet division activities, which include the BAe 125-800 and 125-1000 jets, as part of its overall restructuring programme. The UK group will unveil details of its latest restructuring on September 23 when it announces its financial results for the first half of this year. The industry is expecting details of the eventual sale of the corporate jet division, as well as of the future of the company's loss-making regional jet operations. BAe is considering withdrawing from the regional jet market if it fails to secure a partnership to ensure adequate capital resources to remain a significant competitor. It has been holding active talks with Taiwan on a partnership. Details of a Beechcraft offer for the corporate aircraft business have not been revealed, but it is believed that the BAe activities could fetch about Pounds 200m and would complement Beechcraft's own executive aircraft products. Beechcraft is the leader in the turbo propeller executive aircraft market and the BAe division would help the US company expand into the larger business jet market. Two other potential buyers, including Dassault of France and Bombardier of Canada, indicated yesterday they had no interest in the BAe corporate jet activities. Mr Serge Dassault, chairman of the French group, said his company wanted to develop its own products in the business jet market rather than buy other activities. Mr Laurent Baudoin, chairman of Bombardier, said yesterday that BAe's corporate jet activities did not fit with the Canadian company's product line.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Baudouin Bollaert report on interview with European </F> Commissioner for Agriculture Rene Steichen in Brussels; date not  given: "Rene Steichen's Four Truths"]    [Text] Brussels -- Luxembourg's Rene Steichen, 51 years old  and commissioner for "green Europe" for 14 months, has just  taken part in what he called "the longest marathon of my life":  in other words the five days of fierce negotiations on the  expansion of the European Union with Sweden, Finland, Austria,  and Norway. It must be said that agriculture was probably one  of the biggest obstacles to be overcome, because the new  arrivals have prices which are markedly higher than those of the  Twelve and will have to be brought into line as of 1 January  1995.    In an interview with LE FIG-ECO, Mr. Steichen first explains  that he is "satisfied" with the results and that the various  amounts of compensation granted to the candidates "will not  affect the implementation of the reform of the CAP [Common  Agricultural Policy]." In his view, these countries have "a  concept of public support for agriculture which is closer to  regional development and environmental protection than to  performance at all costs" and, he added, "because the reform  tries to reconcile the two problems, I am not particularly  worried."    However, he makes no secret of the fact that it is "rather  the rules for operating the European machinery which will become  problematical." The need to depart from the (famous) guidelines  of the European budget, which place a ceiling on agricultural  spending during the 1994-1999 period, could thus prove  necessary. "It is an important question," Rene Steichen  admitted. "A solution will have to be found. What solution?  We are working on it. When the GDR automatically became a  member, the guideline was increased.... The arrival of the new  members should generate more GDP and hence a broader guideline."    Is he not afraid, more generally, that "green Europe" --  which absorbs a good half of the European budget -- will be at  the mercy of a budgetary crisis? "Every effort has been made to  prevent it," he replied. "However, there are problems to be  solved: The monetary chaos has led to an additional bill of 10  billion [currency not specified] which the Twelve have pledged  to settle. We will have to be careful about spending in 1995  because economic growth will only leave us little room to  manuever.... But I do not expect anything insurmountable."    At a time when he is preparing to fly to Budapest, the  commissioner could not fail to discuss the competition from the  East European countries which is likely to become increasingly  fierce. "For the time being, that is not the case," he said.  "More because of their own structural problems than because of  our health or other barriers, their agricultural exports to us  fell by 7 percent between 1991 and 1992, whereas our exports to  them increased by 11 percent. I would like to add that  agricultural production fell by 12 percent in Poland and by 20  percent in Hungary in 1992."    But Mr. Steichen admits that it is "inevitable" that the  Twelve will open up to East Europe and that for 30 years the  East European countries have often been a "convenient outlet for  our surpluses." He thinks that "the fall in prices for which  the reform makes provision will be the best protection of the  European Union's agricultural potential faced with competitoin  from these Central and East European countries which are already  opening up and will open up more."  <H5>  Verbal Exaggerations </H5>   The commissioner for "green Europe," who is confident by  nature and hardworking, is satisfied with the implementation of  the CAP reform more than one year on. "Even though the  individual position of many farmers is still worrying, I think  we must first put an end to the `alarmist' statements on the  CAP," he said. "There is deep disquiet in this section of the  rural world. The drop in the number of young farmers setting up  worries me. Should it be attributed to the uncertainties of  GATT or the reform? Some extreme statements also influence the  farmers' individual behavior....    ``What is the real situation? We were at a point at which  European agriculture was threatened with explosion both on the  internal and international levels. The situation has not become  ideal but we now have a plan to support agriculture which is  trying to reconcile competitiveness and the occupation of the  rural area. The rules of reciprocal discipline accepted in the  GATT framework henceforth bring us international peace.''    With regard to big farms, Rene Steichen thinks that the  objectives are being achieved. "The control of grain production  at around 165 million tons will not lead to additional set-aside  if it is confirmed," he noted. "The ruinous stocks are being  reduced. They were still 32 million tons last summer. They are  21 million tons now. Finally, the regular loss of our markets  in animal feed in favor of substitutes is being reversed."  <H5>  Positive Result of the Reform </H5>   "Our fears," he continued, "relate to beef and we have been  saying this from the start. There is an ultimate risk of a  serious crisis if production is not better controlled, which  would have serious consequences for stock-raisers' incomes.  Moreover, the sale of the surpluses is continuing: 400,000  tons of stocks currently, as against 1 million tons last year."    Mr. Steichen also thinks that the setting up of the system  of  direct aid to farmers is going well. Especially in France where  "aid has been paid within the time stipulated," which proves  "the efficiency of the French civil service." But he refuses to  launch into controversy over the development of incomes. "I  will merely say to those who predicted a disaster that they were  mistaken: There was a 12 percent increase in France in revenue  from `big farms' in 1993 compared with 1992."    "I note," he added, "that the sectors which are recording  considerable loss of revenue are those which have not been  reformed...." And he announced that, in the wine, fruit, and  vegetables sectors which have still narrowly escaped reform, he  intends to make proposals soon. The wine issue "greatly  worries" him. Moreover, he thinks that the fruit and vegetable  situation is "complex."  <H5>  A Set of New Measures </H5>   What if the CAP reform failed? This iconoclastic question  received a direct answer. "The risks of failure cannot be ruled  out. Some people are even predicting them with relish. If the  race for yields is not controlled, if there is cheating over  subsidies or set-aside, if there is monetary instability, there  will be a problem. And it will not be the fault of GATT or the  Americans... It will then be necessary to choose between two bad  solutions: Either a return to market stabilization measures  which will increase the rural exodus -- that was the policy  followed before the reform -- or taking administrative measures  to manage production which will curb intra-Community trade.  Indeed, it is in France's interests to ensure that the reform  succeeds even if some provisions may be reviewed."    Mr. Steichen thinks this reform provides "a panoply of new  measures" which can also contribute to the regional development  policy. "Our aid can henceforth encourage environmental  protection, the use of pasture, forests, rural tourism, and so  forth. We are also preparing a system for the protection of  regional products inspired by French legislation. Finally, the  considerable increase in Europe's participation in contracts  between states and regions must be noted. More than half of  France's rural areas will benefit from a contribution of 15  billion francs for the next five years."</p>

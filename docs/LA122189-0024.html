			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY QUESTIONS MIRALESTE REPORT  </P> <P> A draft environmental impact report on the closing of Miraleste High School  fails to adequately address potential traffic, air pollution and other problems  that could affect Rancho Palos Verdes, according to a letter drafted by the  city.  </P> <P> City Council members voted Tuesday to send the letter to the Palos Verdes  Peninsula Unified School District as a formal response to the report, which is  being prepared by the district under a court order.  </P> <P> In the letter, the city did not take a position on the closure of the east-side  high school. The district voted in November, 1987, to shut the school because  of declining enrollment, but a parents group sued to stop the closure and the  school remains open.  </P> <P> The city's letter says more attention should be given to the effect the school  closure would have on traffic. It says the report should suggest mitigation  measures such as upgrading intersections or adding parking facilities at the  district's two other high schools.  </P> <P> The letter also says the report should address the issue of redeveloping the  Miraleste property if the school is closed.  </P> <P> District officials have said all comments on the report are being forwarded to  the consultant hired to prepare it. A final report is to be completed by late  February.  </P></p>

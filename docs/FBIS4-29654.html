			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Ong Teng Cheong said last night he has  recovered fully from the loss of his voice and has resumed  normal duties since Monday.    Speaking to reporters during the intermission of the Beijing  People's Art Theatre performance at the Victoria Theatre, he  said the loss of his voice last week was due to a virus  infection.    He had been warded at the National University Hospital on  June 8 for rest and observation after a routine medical  check-up, which included an endoscopy of his stomach, colon, and  rectum and was discharged last Saturday.    He said that he developed a sore throat after the endoscopy  procedure during which a tube-like instrument was lowered into  his body.    "I think I probably have some slight trauma to the throat  after the procedure, but the loss of voice was due to a virus  infection which occurred unfortunately at about the same time of  the endoscopy," he said.    He described the infection as a "coincidence, a rare  coincidence."    He said that since he was diagnosed as suffering fron  low-grade lymphoma in l992 he has been going for regular  check-ups.    He has blood tests every two to three months and other tests  such as computed tomography scans and X-rays once or twice a  year.    He added that when his lymphoma was first diagnosed, his  doctors had not recommended treatment "but to wait and watch"  for signs of progression of the disease.    So far, they had not recommended any treatment.    "I lead a normal life, I don't suffer from pain, so  everything is normal," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

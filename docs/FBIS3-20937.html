			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview by Gordon Hewitt of the Manchester Business </F> School by hfe., date and place not given: "`Europe's Enterprises  Could Deprive Themselves of Their Future'"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Most of the enterprises in Europe still  do not seem to know what international competition means,  concludes Gordon Hewitt. To be sure, sales and production in  international markets are part of the everyday picture for most  medium-sized companies as well. But this is by no means  participating in the global competition. For that reason,  Europe's businesses could deprive themselves of their future if  they don't change their way of thinking.    The organization of enterprises is much more oriented toward  local conditions. But if global competition is misunderstood in  this manner, even the most renowned producers could lose their  position in the market. It is therefore important for the  management to organize the company globally, which is far  removed from "Develop and produce here, sell there." This global  know-how does not involve merely the geography of the business  activity but involves thinking past the edge of the national  dinner plate. And in so doing, the question "Is our company even  prepared for global competition?" unavoidably emerges. In order  to create certainty, the company management should specify the  way into the future and clearly define the goals. Pure financial  planning would be no substitute for strategy here.    Of course, status quo is also not a guarantee for the future  in global competition. A good position in Europe, for example  in telecommunications, by no means results in a leading position  in the international markets. European companies should quickly  accept this fact, or else their domestic position will also be  in jeopardy in the future. It is evident even today that, for  example in the field of high technology, no European enterprise  is any longer participating in shaping the future. "Sure,  Siemens or Olivetti are very strong in Europe and help determine  the markets. But the longer the distance from which one looks at  the companies, the smaller their importance appears," says  Hewitt.    Truly global enterprises, on the other hand, are present  everywhere. And if you take that as the standard, you must also  be concerned about the European automobile industry. A glance at  the streets of Asia or America should correct Europe's judgement  of itself. Not even the bastion of high-priced cars has held.  The stylish European manufacturers have now clearly felt the  quality-offensive from the Far East. Even so, the impression  remains that many Europeans still have not grasped the situation  in earnest. Hewitt thinks that the only chance is repeatedly to  make it clear to those responsible that not only have the  economic rules of the game changed, but that an entirely new  game is now being played. This can be compared to England's  situation in the postwar era; there, too, attempts were made to  keep or further develop the old virtues and capabilities. This  was the reason that the connection was missed. What remains is  only nostalgia--such as for the auto names of Triumph or Aston  Martin. Reversing this process is an urgent task for the  management. There are enough examples of this as well, such as  British Airways. This airline has a past as a totally  insufficiently managed state-owned enterprise and is today one  of the leading airlines in the world. The inertia in industry  also led to new, innovative products no longer being created in  the old companies, as the "garage manufacturers" at Sachsen  Computer have repeatedly proved. "Part of the way the rules of  the game have changed is also that strangers to the industry  suddenly take up a production and do it very successfully," says  Hewitt and refers to the conflicts between Nintendo and Atari in  computer games, Toshiba and IBM in laptop computers and Canon  with ex-champion Xerox in copying.</p>

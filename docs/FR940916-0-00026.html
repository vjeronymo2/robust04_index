This rule is being made to relieve highway congestion created by back-to-back bridge openings while still meeting the reasonable needs of navigation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> October 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Brodie Rich, Project Manager, Bridge Section at (305) 536&hyph;5117. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Brodie Rich, Project Manager, and LT. J.M. Losego, Project Counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On June 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 29405). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new drawbridge presently opens on signal. Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. requested that the Coast Guard conduct a study to determine whether scheduled openings would improve traffic conditions in the area. The bridge owner (Florida Department of Transportation) recommended hour and half-hour openings on weekdays and 20-minute openings on weekends during the season to reduce traffic delays. A Coast Guard evaluation of the proposal concluded that the very light highway traffic levels for this six-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed opening schedules. However, in order to eliminate back-to-back openings during the tourist season, the Coast Guard tested a 15-minute opening schedule between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily from December 1, 1993 through January 30, 1994, pursuant to a published Notice of Deviation (58 FR 65668; December 16, 1993). No comments were received in response to the Notice of Deviation. The results of the test indicated that traffic backups created by back-to-back openings were reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule allows for a 15-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily during the season (November 15th through May 15th). This schedule should eliminate back-to-back openings and help to reduce traffic delays without unreasonably impacting navigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received no comments in response to our public notice. The Final rule is unchanged from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs with tows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 1 February a news conference was held at our  country's embassy in Russia concerning the 31 January statement  by a Foreign Ministry spokesman. Present at the conference were  reporters from newspapers, news agencies, and radios of Russia.    Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country, made a statement at  the news conference. He explained the details of the Foreign  Ministry statement. He pointed out that the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula has been raised as a grave issue today  because the United States, deploying more than 1,000 nuclear  weapons to South Korea, staged commotions about suspicions of  our nonexistent nuclear arms development and has intensified the  nuclear threat to us now more than ever before.    He said: The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New  Year address taught that the reason our nuclear issue is loudly  talked about by the United States and its followers is a result  of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently  pursued by the United States.    Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is an  issue that should be resolved only through talks between us and  the United States. With a view to evading such responsibility,  however, the United States insists that the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula be resolved between the North and the South  of Korea, and between us and the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    The United States, being unable to stand our principled  demand any longer, was compelled to come forward to negotiate  with us.    He pointed out that a joint statement, which had affirmative  significance in resolving the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula, was announced during the first round of DPRK-U.S.  talks last year, after which a certain progress was made in the  second round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    He continued: As the result of 18 rounds of working-level  contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the two sides  have reached an agreement on basic issues. We agreed that the  United States will suspend the Team Spirit joint military  exercise and we will accept limited-scope [chaehandoen pomwieso]  nuclear inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards. We  agreed to discuss the package solution plan, which we raised,  during the forthcoming third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    However, the United States, at a decisive moment when a  bright vista for a complete resolution of the nuclear issue of  the Korean peninsula is being opened up, is leading the  situation to a catastrophe by overturning agreements made with  us. This is not only a flagrant infringement of the agreements  made at the DPRK-U.S. talks, but is also a shameless breach of  faith against the dialogue. As the conditions under which we had  to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty still remain, the  word of full-scope inspection, as well, is inconceivable.    Not only this, the United States is continuing military  conspiratorial plots against us behind the scene of the talks.  The United States is scheming to stage another type of military  exercise in case the Team Spirit joint military exercise is not  staged and to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea.    All facts clearly show that the new war provocation  maneuvers  in South Korea are more unscrupulous and that the United States  has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula by peaceful means and is also tenaciously running wild  to crush [apsal] our Republic.    We cannot overlook such pressure and threats by the United  States, nor can we yield to them. In this connection, the  spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country  expressed, in a statement, our principled stance.    In the statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman  warned that if the United States reneges on promises made to us,  we will not be bound to the promises made to the United States;  that if the United States has no intention to hold DPRK-U.S  talks, we will not try to hold them either; and that if the  United States chooses another way, we will take a commensurate  countermeasure.    We are fully prepared to respond to dialogue with dialogue  and to war with war. [urinun taehwaenun taehwaro chonjaengenun  chonjaenguro taedaphal mandanui chunbiga toeoitta]    The United States should renounce the delusion that only it  has the right of choice and to act discreetly.    Then, he answered questions raised by reporters.</p>

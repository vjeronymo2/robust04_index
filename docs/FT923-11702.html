			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Government to tighten controls on spending: New policy likely to prompt reductions in departmental programmes THE CABINET yesterday agreed a tough new policy to tighten control of public spending, in the most sweeping effort for a decade to rein back spending increases. Put to cabinet by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, the new approach, which is likely to lead to large cuts in some departmental programmes during the next few years, incorporates a new procedure for enforcing Treasury control. It may produce cuts in the financial year beginning next April in areas such as transport and housing. The new policy is intended to demonstrate to financial markets that Britain is determined to limit increases in the public sector borrowing requirement by linking spending to the expected low economic growth in the next few years. Ministers agreed to increase public spending over the next three financial years by a rate below the expected level of economic growth. During the general election campaign, Mr John Major emphasised his party's determination to keep a firm grip on public spending. After yesterday's cabinet meeting ministers admitted that the existing system had 'failed to deliver public spending control'. From next year, the current system - under which ministers bargain with the Treasury for extra spending - will be scrapped. In its place, the cabinet will decide overall spending limits, with negotiations among ministers being limited to how the total is shared out. Any increases in one department's spending will mean cuts for another department. It will almost certainly end the large increases in public spending of recent years. Last November, Mr Lamont agreed to increase spending in 1993-94 by Pounds 13bn over previously agreed levels. There was also a large increase in spending for the current financial year, in a package designed to appeal to voters ahead of the general election. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, began what will be a sustained Labour attack on the government's decisions, by accusing the prime minister of 'the fastest betrayal in history'. 'With the recession costing an extra Pounds 4bn alone, this public spending announcement means further cuts in public services next year and with Pounds 16bn of cuts in the changes that follow, promises made in April are being betrayed in July after only 100 days of government,' he said The government assumes that inflation will be kept low over the next few years by Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result of low inflation, increases in public spending at current prices should also be kept low, while maintaining the quality of public services. The new procedure will feature a 'control total', to be decided by the cabinet early in each year's public spending round. The concept will be introduced into next year's spending round, applying to 1994-95. Next year's decisions will also be the first to link spending plans with Budget targets for government revenues. The definition of the control total - which will exclude social security payments related to unemployment - has yet to be finalised by the Treasury. For the 1993-94 financial year, the government will stick within its existing planning total for public spending of Pounds 244.5bn agreed last November. Since unemployment-related social security benefits, which account for up to one fifth of public spending, are set for a large rise because of the longer-than-expected recession, the new policy may mean cuts in other areas, such as housing and road building. Whether cuts will be needed will depend on how much the increases in social security payments eat into an unallocated Pounds 8bn reserve which is part of the Pounds 244.5bn total for 1993-94. Under the arrangements, once cabinet has agreed a control total, the chief secretary to the Treasury will discuss the allocation of that money with departmental ministers. A new committee, chaired by the chancellor, will decide on the final share-out. Faced with the prospect of having to hold back on specific election spending pledges, ministers yesterday emphasised the government's manifesto commitment to reduce public spending as a proportion of national income. The three-hour cabinet meeting agreed the control total would grow by no more than 3 per cent in 1994-95 and 3.25 per cent in 1995-96 in cash terms. These figures assume inflation will be 2.25 per cent in both years. Under existing arrangements the planning total for 1994-95 and 1995-96 in both years is due to increase by about 5 per cent a year. Although comparisons between the planning total and control totals are difficult, this indicates that some cuts in programmes may be needed. Editorial Comment, Page 16 Lex, Page 18</p>

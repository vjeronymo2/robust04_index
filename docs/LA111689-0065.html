			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER STUDY FINDS COUNTY MUST CUT AIR POLLUTION BY 40%;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS CONSIDER BROAD RANGE OF MEASURES TO MEET FEDERAL EPA  STANDARDS.  </P> <P> Ventura County must find ways to cut air pollution by another 40% to meet  minimum federal standards, according to information derived from unprecedented  computer modeling conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> The county failed to meet the standards on one out of every six days in 1988,  officials said.  </P> <P> Richard Baldwin, county air pollution control officer, said his agency is  considering a broad range of pollution-reducing measures, including requiring  factories and other industrial sources of pollution to modify their equipment.  At present, only new industry is required to install what is called the "best  available control technology."  </P> <P> Emissions limits also might be lowered for new industry.  </P> <P> Other possible measures cited by Baldwin include:  </P> <P> Reducing the use of certain pesticides.  </P> <P> Cutting emissions from boats that ferry supplies to offshore oil platforms.  </P> <P> Requiring clean fuels, such as compressed natural gas or electricity, for  automotive fleets with 15 or more vehicles.  </P> <P> Requiring methane gas recovery systems for all landfills.  </P> <P> Imposing more restrictions on dry cleaners.  </P> <P> Imposing more restrictions on the kinds of coatings and paints used on houses,  used cars and boats.  </P> <P> The EPA performed the computer studies as part of a settlement in a lawsuit  against it and the county Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, an environmentalist group, sued over the  district's 1982 Air Quality Management Plan, which failed to show means by  which the county could meet clean air standards.  </P> <P> The settlement last March set a September, 1990, deadline for the county to  draft stringent new rules -- a process that required data available only from  elaborate computer modeling.  </P> <P> Without that data, the district could make only educated guesses on how  emissions added to weather conditions to produce the daily pollution picture.  </P> <P> "We come up with a grand scheme of things to do to reduce emissions," Baldwin  said, "but we don't know what that will do to air quality until we put it into  the model."  </P> <P> If the county does not draft effective rules, the EPA will, and Baldwin said he  fears it would do so with measures as drastic as gas rationing or restrictions  on the days one may drive a car.  </P> <P> "The EPA might say no driving on Monday if your license ends in A," Baldwin  said. "Nobody wants to see those things, and I'm working hard to avoid it."  </P> <P> In computer modeling, scientists feed into the system information on emissions,  weather patterns and air flows from both on and offshore, said John Vimont, a  regional meteorologist in the EPA's San Francisco office. The model also  considers existing population, planned growth and future emission reductions  from pollution-control programs now in place.  </P> <P> Using software developed over the last 15 years, the computer follows the  movement of air through a region and predicts how it will react with  pollutants.  </P> <P> After several runs, the model pegged the clean-air target at a 40% reduction of  both oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic compounds, the major components of  smog.  </P> <P> "It is a planning tool," Baldwin said, adding that the error factor is as high  as plus or minus 30%. "But it tells you if you're going in the right direction.  It's an extremely complex science to try to link emissions and meteorology to  air quality levels."  </P> <P> "It gives us a ballpark figure," Vimont said.  </P> <P> Motor vehicles produce the lion's share of both sets of emissions in the  county, according to Ventura County district figures. The oil industry and  power plants are the next largest contributors, followed by other industrial  sources and agriculture.  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ilva's loss jangles nerves of steel - Haig Simonian on the factors reshaping the industry worldwide THE L498bn (Dollars 410m) loss announced on Tuesday by Ilva shows how deeply the steel crisis is affecting Europe's third biggest producer, which picked up the pieces of the Italian state steel industry after Finsider was wound up in 1988. Like its big European counterparts, Ilva has been buffeted by weak demand and depressed prices, just as competition from low-cost eastern Europe and Third World producers is rising. Meanwhile, costs have climbed steadily. However, Ilva is more vulnerable than most. Executives claim it has been unfairly handicapped by the European Commission, which got it off to a bad start by saddling it with about L3,000bn more in debt than planned. That, along with later spending on investments and acquisitions, pushed group borrowings up to L6,300bn by last December. Alter the debt-equity ratio, and Ilva would be in much better shape, they say. Prospects for radical surgery to Ilva's balance sheet seem remote. Government funds have already been restricted by problems at IRI, Ilva's public-sector parent, which has had to adjust to a drip feed of state cash because of the country's spiralling budget deficit. The European Commission is subjecting what government money is coming Ilva's way to minute examination to test whether it is for restructuring, not aid in disguise. Last year's loss also quashed hopes of raising money from private investors. Under its managing director, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva has dreamed of a stock market flotation. However, Italian bourse rules require three consecutive years of profits before a company can go public. Last year's loss, which followed net earnings of L115bn in 1990 and L208bn in 1989, has dashed such plans: Ilva's only hope is for a quotation through the back door by merging with an already-listed company. Rationalisation is Ilva's new buzzword. It is focusing on flat products, of which it is Europe's second biggest producer. Output, concentrated at its huge Taranto plant in southern Italy, amounted to 8.5m tonnes last year. Other activities will be sold or spun off into joint ventures. Foremost is the big integrated steelworks at Piombino in Tuscany. The plant made about 1.5m tonnes of steel in 1990, mostly long products, for which price competition has been most severe. Piombino has been hived off into a separate company, and Mr Gambardella thinks he is now close to a deal to bring in some of Ilva's leading private sector counterparts as co-shareholders. Executives hope to have a deal by year-end. Mr Gambardella argues that the days of empire building for Italy's state steel industry are over. 'I'd prefer to have 30 per cent of something that's making money than 100 per cent of something that isn't,' he said last week. However, critics put many of Ilva's problems squarely at his door. Encouraged by a buoyant market, it went on a L1,300bn three-year spree of acquisitions and joint ventures after its birth. With new investments, group debt has doubled from L3,100bn. Mr Gambardella defends many of the purchases as essential to protect its home market at a time of predatory expansion by European rivals, notably France's Usinor Sacilor. The 1990 alliance with Falck, a Milan steel group which also specialises in flat products, was driven by the fact that the French were also eagerly courting the company. Disposals have become Ilva's top priority. In February, it sold its Capolo steel cans subsidiary under a complex deal involving a linked merger with a specialist lithography group. Ilva retained 18 per cent of the amalgam, now Italy's second-biggest steel packaging group. Most of Ilva's manoeuvres have involved financial rather than physical engineering. In a race to generate extraordinary earnings to offset last year's steelmaking losses, the company reaped L411bn in capital gains by selling its headquarters building and its 49 per cent stake in a shipping group. Using capital gains to increase profits and thus meet bourse requirements for a listing was derailed by IRI, which was uneasy about a flotation based on such poor quality earnings, especially when the steel market shows little sign of picking up. Mr Gambardella may not have renounced ambitions of bringing Ilva to the bourse. Another big IRI subsidiary, Finmeccanica, has mapped out its part-privatisation in November by merging with SIFA, a little-known but already quoted IRI offshoot. Privately Ilva executives hint they have been thinking along similar lines.</p>

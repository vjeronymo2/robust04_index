			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Finance role split at Berkeley The Berkeley Group, the Surrey-based housebuilder, has brought Roger Lewis on to the board with responsibility for corporate finance and, with chief executive Tony Pidgley, strategy. Pidgley, who is wary of companies with finance directors who spend too much time in the City, believes in splitting the role of finance director. So Brian Davis remains in charge of day-to-day functions while Lewis concentrates on what Pidgley terms corporate finance - which includes long-term funding arrangements, financing for joint ventures and for new acquisitions. Lewis, 45, joined the company last year, and has already been working in these areas, although his promotion to the board gives him an opportunity to become more closely involved in decisions relating to 'strategic growth'. ***** Alison Horrocks has been appointed group company secretary of SHANDWICK. ***** George Neophitou has been promoted to financial director of HARLAND SIMON following the resignation of John Macaulay. ***** David Johnson, a director of LAWSON MARDON's folding carton division, has been appointed business planning director of IMG Packaging, Europe, formed from the former rigid plastics &amp; metals sector and the flexible packaging division, Europe. ***** Charles Banks, chief operating officer of Ferguson Enterprises, and John Watson, vice-president of Brossette, are appointed to the WOLSELEY main board. ***** Chris Lyddon, finance director of ASW, is retiring because of ill-health; Christopher Tracy, director corporate development, will continue his responsibilities for the time being.</p>

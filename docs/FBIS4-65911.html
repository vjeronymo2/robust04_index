			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- French Defense Minister  Francois Leotard on Wednesday [25 May] confirmed that the French  military contingent in former Yugoslavia would be dropped by  2,500 men by the end of the year.    He said it was "a French decision determined by the  evolution  of the crisis."    By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our  forces in Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around  Sarajevo. This is a decision we have taken," Leotard said on  French radio.    France now has 6,800 troops in former Yugoslavia, the  backbone of the UN contingent there. A thousand of them will be  repatriated in June from northern Krajina, a Serb-occupied Croat  territory, while another 1,200 others are to leave the Moslem  pocket of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia in six months, the  Defense Ministry recently announced.    France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull  their forces out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the  peace process. Britain has about 3,000 troops in former  Yugoslavia.    France on Wednesday was hosting talks by the belligerents  and  the international contact group trying to restart peace talks.  They were being held in Talloires, in the French Alps, just  across the border from Geneva.    Juppe warned Tuesday that "if the parties involved don't  want  peace we will act accordingly."    French Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard on Wednesday  urged that "negotiations still be given a chance" but said they  could only work "if there is a serious threat of air strikes"  backing them up.    Rocard also voiced support for lifting the arms embargo  against Bosnia if the lastest negotiation bid fails.    Given the lack of success of UN efforts to resolve the  Bosnian crisis up to now, he said "elementary morality would  imply that at least if we cannot protect the Bosnians, we let  them protect themselves."</p>

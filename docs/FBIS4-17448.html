			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Another round of Georgian-Abkhaz talks held last  week in Geneva still did not produce any tangible results.  Although the fact that the talks are being held at all is in  itself a positive development. The Georgian side's position on  the return of refugees to Galskiy Rayon remains unchanged: Their  safety has to be ensured. As for Abkhazia's political status,  the United Nations has produced a document on setting up a  coordinating council, which is to operate until the conflict is  completely settled.    It has also become known that Jaba Ioseliani, head of the  Georgian delegation, has expressed resentment with the stand  taken by the United Nations, which decided not to send its  peacekeeping contingent to the area until this August.  According to Ioseliani, it is quite possible that Georgia will  accept the proposal put forward by the Russian Federation, which  offered to send its forces to Abkhaz territory as soon as  possible.    But in the view of Aleksandr Kavsadze, the head of state's  personal envoy for the settlement of the conflict, all  prerequisites exist even now for the UN Security Council to make  a decision to deploy international peacekeeping forces on the  entire territory of Abkhazia.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SEEKS FULL FUNDING FOR STEALTH;  </P> <P> CONGRESS URGED TO SUPPORT BOMBER AT COST OF $70.2 BILLION  </P> <P> President Bush asked Congress today to provide full funding for the stealth  bomber, saying the United States needed maximum flexibility as it pressed ahead  with arms control talks.  </P> <P> "It is a revolutionary plane with revolutionary technology and again I would  strongly urge your support on that," Bush said at the start of a meeting with  Senate Armed Services Committee members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $70.2-Billion Program  </P> <P> The Administration is backing a $70.2-billion program to build 132 B-2, or  stealth, bombers at a cost of $530 million per plane. Bush wants $4.7 billion  for the plane in the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Development of the aircraft, designed to evade detection by radar, has been  plagued by problems, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn  (D-Ga.) wants a freeze in production funds until the plane completes flight  testing.  </P> <P> Other members of Congress want to kill the program completely, but both Nunn  and Bush say that would complicate U.S. arms control strategy by weakening the  military's bomber arm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Security, Arms Talks  </P> <P> Bush was asked by reporters how he could justify the costly program in the face  of rising social needs.  </P> <P> "The prime responsibility of a President of the United States is the national  security of the United States and I'm determined to put forth a program that is  sound in every way," he said.  </P> <P> "That's how I justify it and I also justify it because when you look at the  full defense program, I want to have maximum flexibility as we have arms  control negotiations," the President said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Back to the Drawing Board'  </P> <P> After the talk with Bush, Nunn told reporters that cancellation of the B-2  would leave the United States without an effective penetrating bomber by the  late 1990s and "we'd have to go back to the drawing board on arms control."  </P> <P> The stealth flew for the first time a week ago in a highly publicized test that  was televised across the country. An earlier test failed when takeoff was  aborted because of a faulty fuel gauge.  </P> <P> Bush also asked Congress to back his 1990 budget-year request for $4.6 billion  for the "Star Wars" anti-missile system, which he called critically important.  The House Armed Services Committee has already slashed the request by more than  $1 billion.  </P></p>

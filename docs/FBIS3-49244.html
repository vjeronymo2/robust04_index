			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The viewpoint on the coming visit of U.S. President  Bill Clinton to Prague was published by the Left Bloc today.  Jaroslav Ortman, deputy chairman of the party, said the  following:    [Begin Ortman recording] The changed situation in Europe, we  are convinced, should lead toward seeking new paths to solving  questions of security and not toward using [word indistinct]  patterns. It is obvious that the policy of the U.S. Government  and the United States, presented by the "Partnership for Peace"  plan, is in the incipient stage.    The path of the Left Bloc does not lead via the expansion of  NATO. We have registered the words of Prime Minister Klaus  saying that membership of the Czech Republic in NATO is not  topical. No one wants us there anyway at the moment.    We see a solution in the system of collective security and  not in the existence of a military pact of a part of Europe,  whether big or small. We are convinced that, particularly in the  sphere of seeking paths of collective security, Czech foreign  policy should be much more active. [end recording]</p>

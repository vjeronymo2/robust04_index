			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: When praise of Fischer sounds rather hollow Sir, I was outraged by Dominic Lawson's attack on the character of Bobby Fischer ('The dark knight returns, his strange genius undimmed', September 5). His article is an example of why Fischer shuns the press and media so often. There is a difference between objectively criticising people and sticking labels on them. I was especially disgusted to read: ''. . . What is morally degraded can be aesthetically right.' That telling phrase encapsulates the paradox of Bobby Fischer.' How dare he say Fischer is morally degraded. Few people in the press, if any, know anything in particular about the finesses of Fischer's opinions, motivations or beliefs and are not likely to if they keep on needlessly insulting him. Praising the flawless beauty of Bobby's chess moves sounds rather hollow if, in the same breath, someone slaps an unjust label on the genius who made them.

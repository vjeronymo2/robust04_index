			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Re-tuning the orchestras: Off the Wall - Batons and bids SUDDENLY the nation's orchestras are generating excitement. Not so much from their playing - in the recession they are performing safer and safer programmes - but from their organisation. In the past, orchestras were dominated by glamorous principal conductors while invisible general managers did the work behind the scenes. Now principal conductors seem less relevant - they sell themselves to three or more orchestras worldwide, often spending less than 10 weeks a year with any one - while general managers are becoming the key operators. When Paul Findlay moves from head of opera at Covent Garden to run the RPO he will almost double his salary to Pounds 96,000. The leader of the LPO, John Willen, and David Wheldon of the Philharmonia, are scarcely out of the headlines as they brawl publicly over the respective roles of their orchestras as residents on London's South Bank. Meanwhile, Clive Gillinson of the LSO has just won the Pounds 10,000 Garrett Award for his success in attracting sponsors to the orchestra. But the dominance of general managers may be curbed as the two big paymasters of classical music in the UK, the BBC and the Arts Council, both of whom spend about Pounds 12m a year subsidising symphony orchestras, finally get together to bring sense to what has become a chaotic scene. History has given the Liverpool-Manchester conurbation three major orchestras - the Halle, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the BBC Philharmonic, while the east of England is musically bereft. London has five major symphony orchestras, while the south and the west gets by with just the Bournemouth Symphony. The inquiry, by such heavyweights as Nicholas Kenyon, the new head of Radio 3, and Kenneth Baird, head of music at the Arts Council, will attempt to redraw the musical map of the country - and redraw it quickly. Its findings should be known by the end of the year and will look at audience needs and local authority commitment as well as the future of the orchestras. Since it is well known that the BBC wants to cut the cost of running four symphony orchestras, a package relocating one or two them to the east and south, smoothed by Arts Council cash and a generous local authority, seems likely. The Council might seek savings by reducing further the Pounds 400,000 it gives the RPO. Findlay will certainly earn his salary if he can find a role for the RPO which is both artistically and commercially acceptable. * * * The recession is confronting the auction houses with many problems, mainly built around fewer buyers for fewer decent lots. To this underlying misery has been added a pretty problem - what to do about after-sale bids?. It is an increasingly common scenario. There is an auction of contemporary art or Old Master drawings with some decent pieces on offer, but the bids do not quite reach reserve. Then, after the sale, the dealers make an offer for an unsold lot at a price just below the last unsuccessful bid. It is very tempting for the auctioneer. He makes a sale and picks up a commission. He is inclined to advise the seller to accept rather than wait for the next auction. So the buyer gets a bargain. The trouble is that in a weak market more and more potential bidders are waiting for the after-auction clear-out. Dealers see a saleable picture with a low estimate of Pounds 10,000, perhaps a fair wholesale price in normal times but with so few buyers around the dealer is reluctant to buy additional stock. However, if he can obtain the picture for Pounds 8,000, well, it becomes a fair gamble. On average, two or three lots changed hands after the auction. Now the number is increasing. Usually the vendor is contacted. If he or she is desperate to raise money, a lower offer might be accepted. But auction houses are equally desperate to make after-sale trading the exception. It could undermine their business. That at least is the official line. But last week, Christie's had to improvise quickly twice on the same day. It was offering Old Master drawings, until now a strong market. The department saw little need to reduce reserves. But a drawing of a nude youth by Prud'hon, which provided the cover illustration of drawings from the Woodner collection, failed to reach its Pounds 60,000 low estimate. Minutes later bidding for a Guardi drawing, which graced the cover of the general catalogue, stopped short of the Pounds 120,000 reserve. When a dealer offered Pounds 100,000 for the Guardi after the auction the temptation proved too great. Later the Prud'hon was quietly sold to collector Fred Koch. A consolation is that the trade is being hammered harder than the salerooms. This has prevented 'rings' developing in vulnerable areas dominated by dealers, with dealers sitting on their hands waiting for an after-auction share-out among the trade.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Why Britain needs Maradonas: It is not saintliness that excites, it is winning First, Britain lost its Empire. Then it began losing at sport. What else is left to perpetuate its self-esteem? The fact that British men are gentlemen, and the rest of the world cheats or worse. How gratifying it is to us all in Britain that OJ Simpson is to be tried for the murder of his former wife, Nicole, and a 25-year-old friend of the former Mrs OJ We had not known much of Mr Simpson until the most recent developments in his social life. But we are told that he was the biggest American football star of his generation and that he was the most popular sportsman in that country. See how foolish our young American cousins are. They have put their faith in a bad 'un once again. For English commentators this has been an unmitigated pleasure. Since we had never needed to know about Simpson until now, none of us has ever said anything laudatory about the man, which we need now embarrassingly retract. We can just make the most of the further staining of what is sometimes called 'The American Dream' - the rise to stardom of poor kids from nowhere. In fact, we have not had so much fun since the jailing for rape of Mike Tyson, former heavyweight boxing champion. There is another aspect to this which thrills the British. People such as Simpson and Tyson were conspicuous spenders, as poor people tend to be when they come into vast sums of money. In Britain we find that repulsive, and so the thought of such vulgar brutes being brutally separated from their wealth is delightful, almost to the point of titillation. We do, naturally, aspire to sporting greatness, as much as any nation. We would be agog with excitement and admiration if, by some bizarre turn of events, a British man bestrode the world of American football like a colossus. Real football, the sort we invented, is, of course, the one we most care about. It was a savage blow to British pride when successively England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland failed to qualify for the World Cup. It had been only scant consolation that an Englishman, Jack Charlton, was the manager of the qualifying team from the Republic of Ireland. But now all is well again, and true Britons can hold their heads in pride - Diego Maradona has been booted out of the World Cup for drug abuse. One might question whether the taking of a cure for cold, which is available over the counter, is worthy of such treatment by football's governing body. But this would be to miss the point, and certainly to fail to recognise why the British newspapers have devoted such hand-rubbing space to Maradona's expulsion. This was the man who, by cheating, knocked England out of the World Cup in 1986. Naturally, no Englishman would deliberately hand-ball, as Maradona did on that famous occasion. To our rejoicing he has finally realised the limits of ungentlemanly conduct. It helps our sense of outrage that Maradona is a representative of a nation we have recently fought against. Do not these chaps know when they are beaten? Boris Becker's apparent gamesmanship in the current Wimbledon tennis championship would be worthy enough of our righteous outrage, but he was already in trouble for being German and better than any of our boys. 'Our boys' at Wimbledon tend to conform to a different stereotype. Like Jeremy Bates, they are all decent, clean-cut sportsmen, who would never deliberately distract their opponents. What we must never admit is that our boys could not beat Boris Becker even employing dirty tricks. Nor can we admit that Diego Maradona has done more to popularise football than any Englishman alive. What we have yet to learn is that it is not manners, still less saintliness, which inspire and excite. It is winning, winning at all costs and against all odds. That attitude demands characters of an extreme, almost primitive energy. We need them in British sport. They are, after all, the sort without whom we could never have built an Empire.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Artem Yerkanyan: "I Came, I Saw, I Signed. On </F> General Grachev's Visit to the Transcaucasus"]    [Text] Russia has no intention of conceding the  Transcaucasus to anyone. The latest confirmation of this  obvious fact was the last visit to the region by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev, which demonstrated the seriousness of  Moscow's intentions. Was the Kremlin satisfied with the results  of the Caucasian voyage of the chief of the military department?  Most likely it was, although the Russian general was not  received in all the Caucasian capitals with the courtesy to  which he had every right to lay claim.    There was no doubt that Grachev would not have any problems  in Yerevan. The question of deploying a contingent of the  Russian Army on the territory of Armenia was decided long before  the ceremony for signing the corresponding agreement, the  conclusion of which, incidentally, was welcomed by all political  groups of the republic without exception. The reaction to the  agreement on Russia's military presence in Georgia was, of  course, not as unambiguous. And there were even quite  contradictory stories about the expediency, admissibility, and  correctness of the participation of Russian peacekeeping forces  in the resolution of the Abkhazian conflict stipulated in the  document that was signed in Tbilisi with the approval of the  Abkhazian and Georgian parliaments.    It is most difficult of all to assess the results of the  negotiations in Baku, since the meeting of the Russian minister  with the president of Azerbaijan took place behind closed doors,  and it is hardly a good idea to believe the information that  leaks through them. Both parties are trying to convince the  mass media that the future of the Gabarlinskaya radar station  was the main subject of discussion at the meeting. And this  means that so far no definite success has been achieved in the  question of reaching agreement about the Russian plan for  regulating the Abkhazian conflict. There is no reason to expect  that Azerbaijan will give way on its positions, since Geydar  Aliyev had just returned from Istanbul at that time. The  meetings on the Turkish land, of course, reinforced the  Azerbaijani leader's belief in the "correctness of the chosen  path." At the same time Aliyev had nothing with which to  counter the persistence of the Kremlin emissary, as a result of  which, official Baku, judging from everything, has recognized  the inevitability of conceding to the Russian military the right  to "be in charge" at the Gabarlinskaya radar station. The final  "i" will be dotted during the visit of the Azerbaijani defense  minister to Moscow, which was recently arranged for an  unspecified date. Then one can expect a more definite response  from Azerbaijan to the Russian peace initiative.</p>

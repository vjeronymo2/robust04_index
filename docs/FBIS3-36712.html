They Are Power in the Republic"]    [Text] For three days, groups of experts of Belarus and  Russia were in session at a government residence not far from  Minsk. They were discussing one more time the mechanisms and  terms for merging both countries' monetary systems.    First Vice Premier Mikhail Myasnikovich stated in a news  conference that accord had been reached on the question most  painful for Belarus -- single prices of energy resources. In  the meantime, according to Myasnikovich, Belarus buys Russian  oil at $77 per tonne whereas Moscow sells it at $45 to its  internal consumers. The same ratio of $75 against $17 applies  to gas. Responding to the Russian claim that single energy  prices were a disadvantage for Russia, the Belarus experts spoke  about the advantages Russia has: free transit of all types of  transport across Belarus territory, gas pipelines and oil  pipelines, the free-of-charge presence of Russian strategic  troops on the republic's territory.    As some politicians and observers think, Moscow has no  reason  for agreeing to single prices. They argue that once Belarus  volunteers (especially in the wake of Shushkevich's resignation)  as it does for the closest possible union with Russia, it should  be set the toughest terms. Thus, it is quite natural that the  question of including Belarus in Russia's monetary system is  political first and foremost. Belarus Prime Minister Kebich,  who has placed the main political chips on the merger, obviously  realizes this too.    Scoring a success here is especially important for him in  light of the impending all-Belarus political strike. At this  point, not only opposition politicians and bankers, but some  ministers, too, also realize the danger of the action being  undertaken. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned  by chance about a conference in one of the ministries where its  head was painting for his staff a sad prospect of the agency's  work after the merger of the monetary systems. None the less, a  brief effect of external improvement in the wake of the  "rubleization" of Belarus is supposed to take place. Realizing  this, Kebich, together with his cabinet, hypes the successes of  another round of talks, insisting especially that cash is  supposed to be exchanged at a one-for-one rate.    The Russian delegation, as the talks have shown, is not too  eager so far to agree to go along with such a fabulous rate as  far as Belarus is concerned. However, as the prime minister  stated to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent: "The experts'  business is to work, but it is up to the two premiers to say the  last word on prices and the level of rates."</p>

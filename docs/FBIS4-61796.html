			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 09, BNS -- A recent Baltic summit in  Jurmala may have encouraged Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev to make a threatening statement with respect to Estonia,  the leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition  said Monday [9 May].    Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius that judging  from Russian TV reports, Lithuanian and Latvian president's  urged Estonian President Lennart Meri to accelerate troop  withdrawal talks with Russia.    The opposition leader said is was "a big political mistake"  to urge Estonia without urging Russia because two Baltic states  indirectly pressured the third one.    Landsbergis also noted that the future of Russian troops in  the Kaliningrad region should be discussed on an international  level. Commenting on Russia's intentions to merge Kaliningrad  navy, army and air force headquarters into one center,  Landsbergis said such steps are usually done to improve the  efficiency of operations.    Politically, Landsbergis said, the step would mean that  Russia strengthens its military presence in the center of  Europe. He said there is also a possibility that Russia wants  to know the limit beyond which there would be strong reaction  from the West.</p>

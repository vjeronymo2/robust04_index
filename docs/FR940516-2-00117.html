No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, after having considered the application and all other pertinent information, SBA has approved the Transfer of Ownership and Control and Capital Reorganization of Polestar Capital, Inc., under the following terms and conditions, effective April 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) At this time, subject to number two (2) below and current regulations, your application does not address the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back Program or the Preferential Payment Distribution to Amoco Corporation (``AMOCO''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) No distributions, including the Preferential Payment Distribution, could be made to any shareholder or Amoco without full repayment of the accrued dividends outstanding owed to the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') for your outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock. Provided that Polestar Capital, Inc. (``PCI'') is in compliance with SBA regulations, after the payment of the accrued but unpaid dividends owed to SBA, then PCI could make distributions to other shareholders and to Amoco as long as PCI had the ability to make additional distributions in compliance with all SBA regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Once the final regulations were completed for the Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would be eligible to apply under the then current existing regulations. PCI could not request terms or conditions that were utilized in the pilot program, if such conditions have been changed for the final program. Amoco Corporation has indicated that they do not desire and would not apply for the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back Program prior to the actual change of ownership and control. For the purposes of the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would agree that it could not claim distressed status under the Buy Back regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any future sale or conversion of a controlling interest (50 percent or more of the common stock) of the common stock of PCI would continue to be subordinated to the accrued but unpaid interest and principal of the Small Business Administration's (``SBA'') outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock, and would require under existing regulation SBA's prior approval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 59.011, Small Business Investment Companies) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert D.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / No shelter in Bosnia's battle zones: The three wars raging in the former central Yugoslav republic LAST Sunday, hundreds of children were evacuated to Moscow from Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. As they boarded buses, amid shelling and sniper fire, their mothers started sobbing, not knowing if they would ever see their families again. In Bosnia, there is no shelter for children even in towns and villages. As Serb irregulars, backed by the Yugoslav army, pound the capital with mortar and artillery, two other wars are raging elsewhere in the republic. In the north of Bosnia, Croat and Serb forces are fighting it out at Bosanski Brod, a swathe of territory which runs along the river Sava and borders Serbia and Croatia. Control of this region is crucial for the governments of Croatia and Serbia. If President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia captures it, he will be able to link up with the eastern parts of Croatia, still in the hands of the federal army, and Serb militants. Moreover, victory at Bosanski Brod would eventually allow Serbia to link the self-proclaimed, Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, in south-west Croatia, with eastern Croatia. The creation of a Greater Serbia would then be in his grasp. Another, equally bloody war is taking place in Hercegovina, south-west of Bosnia. The region is inhabited largely by Croats, and by Moslems and Serbs. Croatia's National Guard, deployed along territory wedged between the Adriatic coast and Bosnia, is determined to defend fellow-Croats. Croatian nationalists want this part of Hercegovina annexed to Croatia. But the war is turning the beautiful old Turkish city of Mostar, the capital of Hercegovina, into a second Vukovar - the Croatian city which the Serb army and irregulars flattened to the ground last year. As a means of reaching some agreement over the future of Bosnia, Bosnia's Serb and Croat leaders last week held secret talks in the Austrian city of Graz. The negotiations, backed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Mr Milosevic, discussed how Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided between them. The Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the republic's 4.3m population, had no say in the talks. Any carve-up of the republic would not only leave them without a homeland. It would put paid to pledges by both presidents to recognise the inviolability of the borders of the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia's Croat and Serb leaders have already started arguing over the plan, which involves dividing Sarajevo, as well as ceding parts of Hercegovina to Croatia, and northern parts of Bosnia to Serbia. Serbia insists on keeping control of the valley south of the river Neretva, on which Mostar is built - there are sizeable arms production enterprises here. If it does, the medieval Croatian city of Dubrovnik, south-west of Mostar, would probably be permanently cut off from Croatia proper. That is why a victory at Mostar is important for the Croats. It is not in sight. At the weekend, Belgrade started deploying the federal army's elite paratroop corps in the region. The fighting in these two areas of Bosnia-Hercegovina has taken a terrible toll on the population. Since Bosnia's independence was recognised by the international community six weeks ago, over 300,000 people have been displaced, 1,300 have been killed, and 350,000 have fled the republic. In Sarajevo, as the federal army and Serb irregulars lay siege to the city, starving Moslems, Serbs and Croats continue to defend their capital. The Serbian leadership is determined to speed the capitulation of Sarajevo, and Bosnia. The purge of the army last week, in which 38 generals were replaced by young, ruthless Serb officers, was aimed at isolating those generals who might have had qualms about unleashing its full fire-power on Bosnia, and who might have resented the way in which Mr Milosevic's war aims have destroyed Yugoslavia. But Mr Milosevic also wants Bosnia quickly pacified in case he needs the army to defend Serbia itself. This is the nightmare which haunts all Serbs. Serbia is not an ethnically homogenous republic. Over 200,000 Moslems live in the Sanjzak, a poor region which borders Bosnia and Montenegro, the tiny republic which supports Serbia. Already, thousands of Montenegrin reservists of the Yugoslav federal army have been dispatched to the Sanjzak to suppress any potential unrest. But time may be running out for Serbia. Bosnian Moslems said Mr Suleiman Ugljanin, head of the 'Moslem National Council' in the Sanjzak, is likely to rebel in support of his Moslem brethren in Bosnia. A spark which inflames the Sanjzak could spread to the southern province of Kosovo, which in 1990 was forcibly integrated into Serbia. Over the past two years, Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of the population of 2m, have been living in a virtual police state controlled by Belgrade. In the northern province of Vojvodina, which was also annexed by Serbia in 1990, the 380,000-strong Hungarian ethnic minority is now demanding that Serbia guarantees its ethnic rights, while the 80,000 Croats in Vojvodina want to hold a referendum on whether to remain in Serbia. Thus, any uprising in the Sanjzak, Kosovo, and Vojvodina would not only stretch the Yugoslav federal army - particularly since it is still trying to consolidate its gains in Croatia and in Bosnia. It would engulf Serbia in civil war. Peace efforts by the United Nations and by General Colm Doyle, the European Community's indefatigable negotiator in Sarajevo, have failed to stop the killing and the grab for land. 'What hope can we promise these poor people of Bosnia?' an EC monitor said yesterday. He added that if, and when, the fighting stops in Bosnia, 'the air will be full of revenge, the morgues will be full of bodies, and another part of this evil Balkan war will creep into Serbia.'</p>

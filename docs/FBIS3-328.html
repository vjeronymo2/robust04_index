Convention of Nationalist Reformers  Chairman Jacques Matanda announced two days ago that the radical  Zairian opposition would launch an armed struggle to paralyze  the country and force President Mobutu to quit. Jacques Matanda  also said, quote: Mobutu can be overthrown, the main thing is to  start it. As one might imagine, the MPR, the former sole party,  has reacted to the statement. The party's European  representative, Jean-Paul Huamba, has expressed his displeasure  at Mr. Matanda's statement. He spoke to Mohamed Youssouffou  Saliou.    [Begin Huamba recording] Any idea of democracy that includes  violence and any kind of undemocratic behavior must be rejected.  Mr. Matanda has no right to incite people to violence, as  Zairians are currently seeking a political solution to their  problem through the High Council of the Republic-Transitional  Parliament [HCR-TP]. The MPR, therefore, finds Mr. Matanda's  statement in Luanda offensive. We have only just signed the  Palais de Marbre agreement, which welcomed negotiators and  former parliamentarians into the HCR- TP. He could have waited  until the constitutional document governing the transitional  period has been formulated, as this will clarify the political  situation. [end recording]</p>

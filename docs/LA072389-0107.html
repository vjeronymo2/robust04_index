			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONFRONTATION AT TUSTIN'S ABORTION CLINIC  </P> <P> It was heartening to be part of the Pro-Choice Majority at the Tustin Clinic on  July 8. I was, however, dismayed to read in The Times that "each group declared  it was the victor." The true victors were the patients who successfully  obtained the health care they sought, thanks to the support of those of us who  don't believe that religion should dictate our laws.  </P> <P> I was also confused when I read in The Times that the "Tustin demonstration was  largely nonviolent." I was there, and I saw people being pushed and shoved in a  very violent manner. I was there and saw one woman jabbed so hard in the  stomach that she couldn't catch her breath -- just one of many instances of  violence initiated by anti-choice demonstrators.  </P> <P> I commend the Tustin clinic personnel who, despite their busy schedule that  day, took those injured people into the clinic and tended them. Please don't  perpetuate the myth that Operation Rescue people are nonviolent. I've seen them  for the fanatic, violent group they are because I was there.  </P> <P> NANCY UTSLER  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

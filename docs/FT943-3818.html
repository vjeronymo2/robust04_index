			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: A spate of UK economic data will focus market attention on the strength of the British recovery this week.

Tuesday: Last week's German GDP data has again focused attention on the unexpectedly strong pick-up in the German economy. July retail sales data due early this week are expected to show that consumers remain relatively cautious, however, with retail sales forecast to show a year-on-year fall of 0.5 per cent. Wednesday: UK unemployment data are expected to show a continued fall in unemployment levels.

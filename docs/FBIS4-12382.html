			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "'Afula Operation Outshines All Expressions of </F> Condemnation"]    [Text] It was natural that the Palestinian people's  reaction to the "massacre of the age" perpetrated by Zionsts at  the Ibrahimi Mosque be commensurate with its savagery. Hence  the remarkable act of martyrdom effected by a Palestinian youth  in 'Afula yesterday, 40 days after the Hebron carnage.    The Palestinian people's struggle using all means at their  disposal is a legitimate act sanctioned by all divine and  temporal laws. It is an action undertaken to uphold stolen  national rights and to retaliate for the massacres and  horrendous crimes committed against the Palestinian people over  decades. Yesterday's reprisal was, therefore, a legitimate act  of jihad; the Palestinian blood spilled on a daily basis by the  gunfire of the Israeli occupiers is not as cheap as the enemy  imagines. Every drop of blood spilled on the land of Palestine  will kindle the spirit of challenge and heroism and nurture the  values of courage and martyrdom typical of this great people who  have endured the ugliest injustice in the modern age.    If the decline in Arab fortunes and the exceptional  circumstances the Arab nation is going through are casting their  shadow on the Palestinian cause, and have put the Arabs in an  unenviable position in relation to the Israeli arrogance, the  downturn is temporary, and may tempt some to think that  statements of condemnation and denunciation are the only weapons  we have. The truth, however, is that coercion, injustice, and  humiliation are bound to erupt into an explosion. Our  frustrations are something like a layer of ashes over a  smoldering fire.    Jordan has often enough warned about the risks involved in  Israel's repressive and terroristic tactics in the occupied Arab  territories and the brazen breaches of the human rights of the  Palestinians under occupation. His majesty has also sounded a  note of warning that violence only begets violence.    The only way out of the tension gripping the region and the  Palestinian territory in particular is the institution of a  just, comprehensive, and enduring peace predicated on the  land-for-peace formula and UN Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338. Any agreements that foster injustice and do not meet  these requirements have no chance.    The 'Afula act of martyrdom should sound the alarm to the  permanent members of the UN Security Council, in particular the  United States, that they need to pressure Israel to show more  responsiveness to UN resolutions if it is serious about peace.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei affected by losses in privatised issues Broadly based selling depressed equities as a decline in speculative stocks and privatised issues prompted arbitrage-linked sales, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 159.03 lower at 19,264.85 after a day's high of 19,456.69 and low of 19,238.05. Arbitrage selling and stop-loss sales absorbed index-linked buying by trust funds. Individual investors who had bought stocks on margin at their highs in June started to liquidate their positions before the six-month margin settlements in December. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.25 to 1,520.03 and the Nikkei 300 sank 2.43 to 278.40. Losers led gainers by 737 to 224, with 201 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.85 at 1,251.81. Continued declines in privatised issues also worried investors. Traders said sentiment was worse than indicated by the Nikkei's declines. While the Nikkei 225 was still above the March 31 level of 19,111.92, the Topix index had now stayed below the last fiscal year's close for four consecutive days. Volume totalled 292m shares, against 296m. Foreign investors remained inactive, while public funds, expected to support share prices below 19,000 on the Nikkei, were also absent. Japan Tobacco lost Y27,000 or 2.7 per cent at Y967,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone slipped Y12,000 to Y851,000 on foreign selling. Speculative shares bought on the pachinko, or pinball, theme plunged. Nakabayashi, the office equipment maker, fell Y27 to Y893 and Sailor Pen dropped Y100 to Y734. Konami, a video game software company, plummeted Y400 or 17 per cent to Y2,010 after it announced that it was expecting a net loss of Y14.5bn for the current business year. Brokers were lower, reflecting the current stagnation in the stock market. Nomura Securities dipped Y70 to Y1,860 and Nikko Securities Y40 to Y1,040. Some electricals were higher. Mitsubishi Electric rose Y5 to Y700 and Toshiba Y3 to Y722. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 136.11 to 21,329.25 in volume of 17.8m shares. Aoyama Trading, a discount suit retailer, retreated Y400 to Y2,500 after reporting a decline in profits for the six months to September. Roundup The Pacific Rim region remained generally nervous ahead of an expected increase in US interest rates next week. Colombo was closed for trading due to a curfew declared in Sri Lanka to avert post-poll violence after Wednesday's presidential election. SYDNEY declined on offshore selling of leading resources shares as profits were taken following a strong rally in recent months. The All Ordinaries index slipped 11.3 to 1,971.3, in turnover of ADollars 490m. Economic data which showed the October unemployment level at a three-year low lifted prices for a time, but selling pressure was renewed during the afternoon. In the mining sector, CRA weakened 16 cents to ADollars 18.20, WMC was down 24 cents at ADollars 6.88 and MIM receded 9 cents to ADollars 2.64. HONG KONG drifted lower as most investors remained absent in anticipation of a further rise in US interest rates next week. The Hang Seng index shed 14.72 to 9,390.76 on turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn, compared with HKDollars 2.08bn on Wednesday. Some dealers noted futures-led arbitrage selling by institutions, helping to dampen the price of Hong Kong Telecom, which fell 20 cents to HKDollars 15.65. Brokers also commented that there was some buying interest by Japanese investors and brokerages during the day. SINGAPORE finished lower, with the Straits Times Industrial index off 14.46 at 2,329.94 in volume of 125.4m shares. Jurong Shipyard fell 10 cents to SDollars 13.30 and Fraser and Neave 30 cents to SDollars 17, but Cycle and Carriage added 10 cents at SDollars 13.30. MANILA succumbed to widespread selling, having seen substantial gains in early trading, as the Philippine peso fluctuated wildly on the foreign exchange market. The composite index fell by 41.67 to 2,968.20, breaching the 3,000 level. The peso hit a low of 24.80 against the dollar early on, before recovering to 24.30. BOMBAY fell sharply for a second consecutive day, the BSE 30-share index weakening 64.59 to a provisional 4,141.09 after a 2.1 per cent drop on Wednesday. Reliance Industries closed Rs8.75 lower at Rs381.25 after being quoted briefly at Rs360 in early trade. Large investors sold following the company's announcement of plans to merge with two of its associates. BANGKOK's banks and finance houses led the way down as the SET index dropped 24.01 or 1.6 per cent to 1,472.52 in moderate turnover of Bt6.2bn. Banks receded 1.7 per cent, mostly early in the day, and the finance sector retreated 2 per cent. WELLINGTON drifted back to lose some of its early gains on news that the popular Mr Jim Anderton had resigned as leader of the left-wing Alliance party. The NZSE-40 index ended a net 13.71 up at 2,088.88, having been 25 points ahead in late morning trade. KUALA LUMPUR saw turnover tumble from MDollars 550.6m to MDollars 205m as the KLSE composite index relinquished 12.05 at 1,039.46. SEOUL's composite index finished 11.52 down at 1,126.87 on broadly based profit-taking.</p>

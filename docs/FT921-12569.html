			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week (Iris histrioides) This is the sturdiest of the very early flowering, bulbous-rooted Irises and, in a mild winter, it can be opening its clear-blue, gold-crested flowers out of doors without any protection by the end of January. However its flowers are fairly fragile and easily battered by wind and rain so many enthusiasts shelter them with cloches or sheets of glass held securely above them on wire or wooden supports. The ultimate in refinement is to grown them in pots or pans in an unheated greenhouse or conservatory, for which purpose they are ideal. The small bulbs should be planted one to two inches deep in gritty soil and, if they are grown outdoors, a sunny place should be chosen, preferably sheltered from wind. A rock garden or a border against a south or west-facing wall is ideal.</p>

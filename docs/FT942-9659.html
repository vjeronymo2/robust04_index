			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basic research vital to aeronautics' future Sir, I refer to Emma Tucker's article, 'The drift towards managed trade' in your Exporter supplement (May 5). The Department of Trade and Industry has certainly given its backing to the National Technology Acquisition Plan for the British aerospace industry. What it, or rather the government, has not done is provide adequate funding for basic aeronautical research. Over the last three years, the annual budget allocation under the DTI's civil aeronautics research programme has fallen by nearly Pounds 3m. Admittedly, plans for the next two years show a slight rise to about Pounds 22.7m a year, but this includes substantial payments to the European Transonic Windtunnel project. Even so, in the view of those who compiled the National Technology Acquisition Plan, Pounds 22m will be inadequate to sustain the UK aerospace technology base into the next century. Money invested in basic research is not a question of trying to pick individual 'winners'; it is an investment in an entire industry. Aeronautical R&amp;D at this level will also have an impact on other high-technology industries. But even if the benefits were exclusive to the aerospace sector, they would underpin an export potential well into the next century. Ministers proudly point to the current performance of British aerospace companies, but without investment over the long haul, this could be the last flash of flame before the match goes out.

In an opening statement, Ciller expressed the belief that  decisions that will contribute to the development of the Armed  Forces will be adopted at the meeting. She remarked that the  Turkish Armed Forces fulfill their task with regard to internal  security in a spirit of self-sacrifice and discharge the duties  they assume abroad with a view to contributing to world peace.  [passage omitted]    [Begin Ciller recording] The Armed Forces constitute the  most important guarantee of the country's security and our  independence. Certain circles that are well aware of this fact  are engaged in speculations concerning the Turkish Armed Forces  -- either knowingly, because they are not friends of this  country, or unknowingly. This saddens us all. Nevertheless, we  know very well and we believe that our lofty nation is assessing  the events in the most correct way on the basis of its boundless  common sense and is aware of the motives behind them. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    In a statement about the Supreme Military Council meeting,  Staff Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu, spokesman of the General Staff,  declared that the political and military situation in light of  developments in surrounding countries was assessed during the  meeting. According to the statement, proposals for changes in  the legal procedures concerning the Turkish Armed Forces were  also discussed at the meeting.</p>

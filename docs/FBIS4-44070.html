			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Cunliffe-Jones] </F>   [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  leaders, meeting in Corfu, Saturday [25 June] endorsed a  programme of major trans-continental public works to boost jobs  and competitiveness in Europe.    The programme comprises 11 major road and rail links  including access to the Channel tunnel train between Paris,  Brussels and London, plus the Brenner axis linking Verona with  Berlin, and the Oeresund rail-road link between Denmark and  Sweden.    The other projects, all of which are to be started "by 1996  at the latest," are based in Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg, the  Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.    The 11 works programmes will cost an estimated ECU68.5  billion (81.5 billion dollars) by 2010. A final decision on the  financing was put off until the next full EU summit in six  months time.    The 12 European leaders, closing a two-day EU summit  Saturday, also reconfirmed their commitment to the European  Commission's white paper on employment and competitivity which  they adopted in December.    "The improvement in the economic situation (in Europe)  should  not lead to a slackening of efforts to promote structural  adjustment in Europe...particularly in the field of employment,"  they said, in a final summit statement.    Reforms set out in the white paper included plans to boost  labour market flexibility, making it easier for employers to  hire and fire, and increase training.    However, there was no action on a Commission proposal to  switch the cost of Europe's social benefits from charges on  businesses to an antipollution energy tax.    The European Council "takes note of the progress on the  CO[.sub]2[/]/Energy tax issues, underlining the need to  ensure that environmental costs are better reflected throughout  the economy," the statement said.    The EU's 11 transport projects represent the first slice of  a  multi-billion dollar scheme to span the EU with transport,  telecommunications and energy networks stretching eventually  into East Europe.    They are intended to increase the efficiency of the single  market, make businesses more efficient and create better and  safer communications in general.    The EU leaders agreed to continue work on extending the  transport links into "neighbouring countries, in particular to  Central and East European countries and to the Mediterranean  basin."    And they urged continuing work on preparing eight major  projects in the energy sector, but refused to give them a green  light.    Britain had urged holding back on final approval for the  transport projects until their financing had been agreed.    The summit statement stressed that unspecified "measures  will  be taken -- if proved necessary -- to ensure that priority  projects do not run into financial obstacles which would  jeopardize their implementation."    The summit accepted European Commission President Jacques  Delors' proposal for "round tables" of experts to speed up the  action on the transport projects.    They also agreed on his proposal for a minister in each EU  member country to coordinate on the setting up of information  super-highways linking the member states.    On Friday, the 12 agreed the outlines of a common economic  policy vital if they are to bring their economies towards  greater union.    Talks on the agreed themes of price stability, sound public  finances and labour market flexibility were brief, the main  points having already been approved at a meeting of the EU  member's ministers of economy and finance two weeks ago,  diplomatic sources said.</p>

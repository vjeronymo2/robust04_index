			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Negative view of what is an essential policy of privatisation Sir, Those reforms in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union that have had the most positive effect on sustainable, long-term job creation have been brought about by those who recognise that private enterprise is a way of facing up to the pressure of the invisible hand of the market. By ignoring the positive motives for governments' decision to withdraw state control over sectors of the economy, the article 'Privatisation in Europe could cost 800,000 jobs' (May 25) presents privatisation as a zero-sum game, rather than as a tool for managing change in a global economy. It is a one-sided view of a policy the many virtues of which the FT has long extolled, not least, implicitly, in the editorial, 'A manifesto for business', of the same day ('It is encouraging that the government now accepts that (big new spending on industrial support) more often (creates) problems by retarding essential adjustment'). To what does BA owe its increase in profits, except to such 'essential adjustment'? Why do BT, British Gas and British Steel have healthier futures than most of their competitors? Privatisation is not a cure-all, but it is surprising to see the FT highlighting only the negative side of an essential policy. David Ringrose, Hamerstraat 44, Brussels, Belgium</p>

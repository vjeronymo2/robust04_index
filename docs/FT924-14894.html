			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Intel plans new plant INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday announced plans for a Dollars 400m manufacturing plant at the site of its California headquarters. The plant will be the first new large-scale semiconductor production facility to be built in the area for several years. In recent years many California chip makers have located new plants outside the high-tech region in areas with lower land prices and fewer regulatory barriers. This trend has raised concerns about the 'hollowing' of Silicon Valley. Intel already owned the site of its new plant and gained the co-operation of state and local officials in accelerating the complex process of obtaining environmental and other permits for construction. The Intel expansion will add 250 new jobs. Production is due to begin in the third quarter of 1993. The plant had previously been used for research and development and will be expanded to include a mass production facility. Intel will make microprocessors and related chips at the new factory.</p>

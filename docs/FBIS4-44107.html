			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Altero Matteoli by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Matteoli: `What Is  This About a Black, I Am a Real Green'"]    [Text] Rome -- The only "fascist" thing that has remained  is the balcony on Piazza Venezia, right in front of the windows  of his ministerial office. Even Altero Matteoli, [National  Alliance leader] Fini's political arm in the Berlusconi  government had to pay the score of being right-wing in a Europe  that was left-wing before 12 June. However, the pre-election  controversy, unleashed from abroad by the socialists, ended up  in a celebration as the current holder of the Environment  Ministry tells IL GIORNALE for the first time.    "It was the Belgian colleague, but not the usual Di Rupo, to  state his concern over the safeguarding of democracy in a  `Community country' during the meeting in Luxembourg," reminded  Matteoli. "When my turn came, I answered as I should have  answered him. All the more that U.S. President Clinton had just  met with leading exponents of National Alliance. The British  minister gave me his solidarity immediately. Then we all went  to lunch, including the `contester'..."    [Guiglia] How can somebody who is against the Greens be an  environment minister?    [Matteoli] He can, of course he can. I have nothing against  the Greens. Rather, I have good relations with some of them  because I have been a parliamentarian for four legislatures and  we have often worked shoulder to shoulder. What I do criticize  instead is their purely ideological way of facing environmental  problems. Some see my ministry as being like a bunker, inside  which I must defend myself in order to say no to everything.  But how can you do this? The Greens have brought the ecological  issue to the attention of everybody. This is an undeniable  historical merit. Today they seem to be like the Northern  League: They have lost their "propulsive thrust" to change  after having given an important pushover to the First Republic.    [Guiglia] Which are the environmental emergencies of the  Second Republic?    [Matteoli] Coastal erosion, the pollution of the sea and  rivers. My great bet is making the fish return to the Tiber  River. The British succeeded with the Thames; we will succeed as  well.    [Guiglia] And what about the Right's challenge to the  progressive mayor of Italy's capital city?    [Matteoli] Let us put it this way, I think that [Rome Mayor]  Rutelli himself will willingly accept the challenge. You see,  however, in the past I had already attempted to create a  parliamentary commission of investigation into the Arno river.  There was nothing to be done. Now, however, I will return to  the charge. I am strengthening the NOC.    [Guiglia] The what?    [Matteoli] NOC, the Operational Nucleus of the Military  Police. We have about 80 in Rome and seven -- I repeat, seven --  in Milan and Naples. I want to upgrade them. I want to discover  who pollutes the small and larger rivers in Italy and how,  where, and when they do it.    [Guiglia] When there was too much smog the mayors stopped  the  traffic circulating on Sundays. Does the minister agree?    [Matteoli] It is a fanciful measure. After having induced  the Italians to buy one or two automobiles per person, we are  now exhorting them not to use them. The problem lies at the  source: We need car parks. At least in part, and with other  measures, they could resolve the matter.    [Guiglia] Can nuclear energy return in Italy?    [Matteoli] There are contrasting positions in Europe. The  United Kingdom wants more nuclear power plants, Spain wants  less. We missed the nuclear energy train 15 years ago.  Reproposing it today would be useless and outdated, despite the  merits. However, Italy would do well to continue studies on the  topic. We spent 17 trillion lire for Montaldo di Castro  [nuclear power plant].</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC AGREES TO BAN IVORY IMPORT  </P> <P> The 12 European Community states agreed in principle today to ban the import of  ivory which threatens the African elephant with extinction, diplomats said.  </P> <P> Until a community ban on raw and worked ivory is completed, environment  ministers may take emergency action against imports in their own countries.  Britain, which initiated the EC action, has decided on an immediate ban, the  diplomats said.  </P> <P> African elephants, slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks, have dwindled  to 625,000 today from 1.3 million in 1979.  </P> <P> The EC's executive Commission will draw up proposals for a ban that could be  adopted by the end of June. The EC also plans to back a call for a global ban  at a meeting of 102 nations in Switzerland in October.  </P></p>

Section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires all States that have ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above to implement a Stage II vapor recovery program. The Stage II vapor recovery program requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities that dispense greater than 10,000 gallons of fuel per month (50,000 gallon per month in the case of an independent small business marketer) to install and operate gasoline vehicle refueling vapor recovery systems. Vapor recovery systems control the release of volatile organic compounds (VOC), benzene, and toxics emitted during the refueling process. The USEPA is partially approving Ohio's Stage II rule package, and disapproving Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5), which grants the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) the discretion to suspend the Stage II vapor recovery program without prior approval of USEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The USEPA is partially approving the rules since, with the exception of Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5), the program satisfies the criteria for approval of Stage II vapor recovery programs. The USEPA is disapproving Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5) since it fails to satisfy the requirements of Part D of Title I of the CAA by providing the Director of OEPA the discretion to suspend the Stage II program without first obtaining Federal approval. Partial approval of the State of Ohio's Stage II submittal will incorporate the provisions of the program that satisfy USEPA's approval criteria into the State's Federally approved SIP.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will be effective on December 19, 1994 unless notice is received by November 21, 1994 that any person wishes to submit adverse or critical comments.

In November 1991, USEPA issued technical and enforcement guidance to meet this requirement. In addition, on April 16, 1992, USEPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate the elements USEPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 7, 1993, the OEPA submitted a package of reasonably available control technology (RACT) VOC rules to USEPA for approval. The rules for implementation of the Stage II vapor recovery program required by section 182(b)(3) of the CAA were included in the VOC RACT package and apply to three areas in Ohio:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Cincinnati-Hamilton;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Cleveland-Akron-Lorain; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Dayton-Springfield.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The USEPA is conducting this rulemaking on the Stage II vapor recovery regulations separately from the VOC RACT rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(b)(3) of the CAA requires States with areas designated as moderate and above nonattainment areas for ozone to submit a SIP revision to USEPA by November 15, 1992, requiring owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate gasoline vehicle refueling vapor recovery systems. Section 202(a)(6) of the CAA states that Stage II vapor recovery programs are no longer required for moderate ozone nonattainment areas once USEPA promulgates regulations for on-board vapor recovery systems. The final rule for on-board vapor recovery systems has been promulgated and was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16292). Ohio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeks approval for the Stage II program for the purposes of achieving creditable VOC emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cincinnati-Hamilton, Cleveland-Akron-Lorain, Dayton-Springfield, and Toledo areas are designated moderate nonattainment for ozone (see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.336). Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, Ohio was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas by November 15, 1992. The USEPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with USEPA guidance and is now partially approving and partially disapproving this submittal. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below; in addition, a more detailed analysis of the State submittal is contained in a Technical Support Document, dated January 28, 1994, which is available from the Region 5 Office, listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA reviewed the submittal against the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, as interpreted in the General Preamble for Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 13498, 13513 (April 16, 1992)), and two USEPA documents entitled Technical Guidance_Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities (Technical Guidance) and the Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs (Enforcement Guidance). Specifically the following seven general criteria need to be met for a Stage II vapor recovery regulation to be acceptable:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities. Facilities that dispense more than 10,000 gallons per month must install and operate Stage II controls. For gasoline dispensing facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are owned and operated by independent small business marketers, the State may establish a cut-point as high as 50,000 gallons per month. In the General Preamble, USEPA indicated that the suggested method for calculating the gallons per month dispensed by affected facilities would be determined by calculating the average volume of products dispensed per month for the 2 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period prior to adoption of the rule by the State. (See General Preamble, 57 FR at 13514). The Enforcement Guidance suggests that if sufficient data is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not available for a full 2 year period, then the available months of operation during the 2 year period should be used to calculate the facility's average gallons per month. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 3.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee and cocoa prices in late dive - Market Report COFFEE and COCOA futures prices both took a dive at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday afternoon but still were unable to arouse much interest from buyers. May delivery cocoa ended Pounds 11 down at Pounds 904 a tonne, while March coffee lost Dollars 7 to Dollars 1,165 a tonne. At the London Metal Exchange ZINC prices tumbled in after-hours 'kerb' trading under largely technical liquidation prompted by a move below Dollars 1,010 a tonne for three months metal. The market ended at Dollars 1,002, down Dollars 12 from Friday, but above a chart-support line near Dollars 995. News that an announcement on cutting European zinc producing capacity could be made in February cut little ice with the market.</p>

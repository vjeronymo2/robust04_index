The present head of the Finance Ministry has no declared party  membership.    Henryk Chmielak was born in 1948 in Szczecin. He is a Ph.D.  in economic studies, a graduate of the Economics Department of  the Main School of Planning and Statistics [the SGPiS; it is now  called the Main School of Commerce, SGH] in Warsaw.

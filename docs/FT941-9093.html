			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Standard Bank advances 12% as asset base grows Standard Bank Investment Corporation, South Africa's second largest banking group, yesterday announced a 12 per cent advance in pre-tax profit to R1.23bn (Dollars 357m) in the year to end-December from R1.09bn in 1992. The group shrugged off harsh domestic trading conditions through the benefits of continued growth in its asset base, good contributions from its UK and African banking operations, as well as a reduction in its effective tax rate and a R62.5m tax credit which flattered the bottom line. Distributable income jumped by one-third to R844.4m from R637.5m but was diluted by a larger number of shares in issue to the equivalent of 696 cents a share, 17 per cent better than the previous year's 593 cents. A total dividend of 219 cents was declared, against 187 cents. The group's asset base rose to R62.7bn from R58bn, including a sharp rise in its home loan portfolio, up 33 per cent to R16.2m, as well as increases in UK and African assets and the contribution from rights issue proceeds. Mr Harry Shaw, general manager of financial services, said four years of domestic recession had taken its toll on new demand for credit and led to increasing bad debts, which worsened to 0.83 per cent from 0.73 per cent of advances. The level of bad debts, up at R477m from R380.5m, was 'uncomfortably high'. Net interest income rose by nearly one-fifth to R3.1bn from R2.62bn before the increase in debt provisions, higher operating expenses and a flat R467m tax bill left after-tax profit, before the one-off tax credit, 32 per cent higher at R759m against R622.9m. Mr Shaw said the group was budgeting for improved earnings in 1994 but the rate of increase would slow, with improvements in trading conditions as dependent on politics as the economy.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Templeton predicts strong growth in Russian markets The size of Russia's capital markets could match those of the US within 20 years, one of the world's leading emerging markets specialists predicted yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, which manages Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) of assets, said: 'I would rank Russia very highly among emerging markets because of its size and its potential. In the next two decades it is quite possible that Russian capital markets could be as big as (those) in the US.' Mr Mobius is the latest in a string of western fund managers to highlight the attraction of Russia's surging equity markets. Many have a clear vested interest in so doing, but Mr Mobius may deserve to be taken more seriously given the performance of the Templeton Fund, which has produced an annualised rate of return on its original capital of 30 per cent since 1987. The Templeton Fund is opening an office in Moscow and is contemplating launching a Russian country fund of about Dollars 300m. 'I have got about Dollars 1bn sitting in the bank, as 20 per cent to 30 per cent of our money is in cash at the moment,' he said. Mr Mobius said Russia's vast natural resource base and mass privatisation programme had created an exciting investment climate. The possible appreciation of the rouble provided an additional attraction. 'But the reason I came here was, that this was a country which produced Tchaikovsky and which put people on the moon. These are impressive people,' he said. On a 10-year basis Russia might represent as much as 20 per cent of the Templeton Fund's weighting while Hong Kong and China might represent about 15 per cent, but he added: 'Russia is potentially a much more explosive investment climate.' Mr Mobius conceded there were risks in investing in Russia: companies do not yet produce reliable audited financial statements; managers have little concept of shareholder accountability; the share trading environment is chaotic; and there is a danger that a future government might renationalise assets. 'But in emerging markets we must seek out risk which has an inverse relationship to reward,' he said. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, yesterday reaffirmed the government's commitment to creating a more favourable investment climate. 'We need to create an organised market for share trading,' he said yesterday. But earlier in the week, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, warned that a 'catastrophic situation' was developing in Russia's share markets because of a lack of effective regulation and the growing threat of organised crime.</p>

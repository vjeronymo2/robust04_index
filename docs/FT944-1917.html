			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: BHP rises 30.6% to ADollars 836m Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 30.6 per cent advance in first-half profits after tax but before abnormals, to ADollars 836m (USDollars 653m). The figure compared with ADollars 640m in the same six months to end-November in the previous year. Revenues rose 10.4 per cent, to ADollars 9.21bn, and basic earnings per share, excluding abnormals, were 59.9 cents, up from 47.9 cents. The interim dividend is increased 14.3 per cent, to 24 cents a share. BHP took an after-tax abnormal gain of ADollars 234m, for the sale of its remaining stake in Woodside Petroleum. This brought bottom-line profits after tax to ADollars 1.07bn, 67.2 per cent higher than in 1993-94. Mr John Prescott, managing director, noted the figures had been achieved at a time of quite depressed prices, although he conceded that the copper price, which reached a four-year high during the period, had been an exception. He suggested the annual round of negotiations between Japanese buyers and Australian coal and iron ore suppliers, which is under way in Japan, should bring gains in bulk commodities, and said that higher prices should 'impact favourably' towards the end of the current six-month period. 'Firmer world growth should underpin improving prices for some of the company's key products,' said BHP, adding that Australia's strong economic growth should lift domestic demand for steel, 'although some government initiatives can be expected to manage this growth'.</p>

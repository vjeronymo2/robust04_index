			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Argentine exports favoured in policy switch ARGENTINA last night announced a sweeping revision of its foreign trade policies, in the face of recession, a growing trade deficit and rising political opposition to the government of President Carlos Menem. To defend local output from foreign competition, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said Argentina will raise 'temporarily', to 10 per cent from 3 per cent, a flat-rate tax charged on all imports and known as the 'statistics' duty. 'We are doing this because import prices are very low on world markets. There is a lot of recession out there and, therefore, prices are very low,' he argued. 'These measures have been designed to avoid any impact on price indices. On one hand, they will improve the prices of some exports; on the other hand, they will produce a fall in fuel prices and transport costs,' the minister added in his televised speech. He said that, as of next week, the goverment will refund Argentine exporters all taxes they pay in producing their goods, including VAT, gross income tax, fuel and electricity duties, and taxes on assets, wages and raw materials. Mr Cavallo also announced new import tariffs, which were based on the degree of value added to goods and the incidence of taxes in their production. However, the top import tariff was cut to 20 per cent from 35 per cent, and will be imposed on such consumer goods as clothing, home appliances and motorcars. The minister scrapped domestic taxes on gas oil, fuel oil and kerosene. Mr Cavallo acknowledged in his speech that Argentina would probably finish 1992 with a trade deficit larger than Dollars 1bn, against a Dollars 3.7bn surplus last year, but said these measures and fiscal austerity would help the country balance its trade account more evenly in 1993. Analysts expected the measures would offset an increasingly overvalued currency which has crippled exports and triggered a flood of imports. The announcement was prompted by alarm over Argentina's trade deficit, which independent analysts put at Dollars 2bn. Industrialists blame the deficit on Brazilian goods dumped in Argentina. Concern is also growing over a decline in capital inflows. Central bank hard currency purchases - a barometer of capital flows - fell to Dollars 260m this month, the lowest rate this year and 21 per cent below that of September. The measures are part of a broader government attempt to recover the political initiative, maintain growth and pave the way for Mr Menem's controversial bid to amend the constitution so as to clear the way for himself to stand for re-election when his term ends in 1995. Mr Jorge Avila, an economic analyst, said the measures would amount to an indirect devaluation. Instead of making companies more efficient, they would encourage lobbies and corruption, but only delay an inevitable recession and price deflation. Persistent inflation, excessive demand and a fixed exchange rate were driving Argentina to recession, he added. Mr Menem has also demanded an emergency package for pensioners, whose regular weekly protests have become an embarrassment. The plight of Argentina's 3.5m pensioners, many of whom survive on token benefits, has become a symbol of government indifference to social problems created by its strict free-market policies. The docile trade unions have called a one-day general strike for November 9 to protest over low wages and government plans to attack their privileges.</p>

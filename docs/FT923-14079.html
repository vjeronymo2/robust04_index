			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Painful legacy of an empire: Conflicts around Russia's periphery have great significance for the former Soviet states and the west The withdrawal of Russia to within its current borders is as painful and as fraught with danger as any of the great imperial retreats of the past century. No empire has collapsed without blood: Russia's experience is proving no exception. Around the periphery of the Russian federation, a series of conflicts has erupted and potential flashpoints are simmering. Small wars they may be - but with a large significance for the states of the former Soviet Union, and for the international community. The disputes threaten the fragile post-Soviet consensus that existing borders, no matter how historically unjust, are inviolate. They raise the prospect of intractable conflicts and are courting intervention from Russia. For its part, Moscow is taking a more aggressive stance over the protection of its interests and Russian minorities. This week the disputes are being placed firmly on the international agenda. The Commonwealth of Independent States has called for a peace-keeping force to restore order to some of the trouble spots. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - the forum for discussion of security issues including the US, west and eastern European states - will today hear demands from some of the republics of the former Soviet Union for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. There are five main areas of tension, mainly outside Russia. In the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 130,000 Russian troops serve in what was one of the easier billets of the Soviet Army. Tensions have risen to the point where Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, described the area in a speech last month as 'potentially more explosive' than Yugoslavia. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, yesterday promised to withdraw troops from the Baltic states by the middle of 1993 though the Baltic leaders remain sceptical in the face of previous promises to withdraw. Mr Audrius Butkevicius, the young Lithuanian defence minister, is more persuaded by General Yuri Kalininchenko, former head of the border guards for the Commonwealth of Independent States, who told him that he and his colleagues regarded the Lithuanian border with Poland as the western border of Russia. 'Russia sees us as part of their strategic area: they are quite firm on this,' said Mr Butkevicius. In the Republic of Moldova, a war is raging between regular Moldovan forces and forces acting in the name of the self-proclaimed republic of Trans Dnestr, an area on Moldova's eastern border inhabited largely by Russians and Ukrainians. The region has declared independence from Moldova, citing fears that the government is seeking to unite with neighbouring Romania. Before the second world war, most of Moldova was part of Romania, and native Moldovans are ethnic Romanian. On Tuesday, the Moldovan government asked for a multinational peacekeeping force to quell the conflict. But early yesterday, reports from Trans Dnestr indicated that the ceasefire that had been called to allow this force to operate had already broken down. The Russian 14th army, with around 15,000 troops, operates on the side of the Trans Dnestrians. In spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise, it is not being withdrawn. Both Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to the US, and General Dmitri Volkogonnov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, have emphasised this. Mr Yeltsin won acclaim in Trans Dnestr when he appeared to support a Russian intervention in search of a settlement. But he does not control the Trans Dnestrians, and he will not be able to to stop them fighting. Asked how he would respond to an order from the Russian president to withdraw, Mr Vladimir Dmitriev, a 14th Army APC driver, said: 'I have 10 boxes of ammunition and each box contains 10 rounds. I hope I will kill one Romanian (Moldovan) with each one, no matter what Yeltsin says.' The Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are all - in varying degrees - internally unstable and engaged in inter-ethnic hostilities. The oldest of the conflicts, that between the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azeris who surround it, has been the subject of half a dozen peace plans, all failures. The two month-old Azeri government of President Abulfaz Elchibey seems more determined to prosecute the conflict than the previous regime. Efforts by Italy to mediate between the two sides ended in failure earlier this week. In Georgia, the government of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze survived a coup attempt last month by supporters of the previous president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. But Mr Shevardnadze has, it seems, no power to stop his militia pursuing the war against South Ossetia, an area in the north of the republic, where the population is demanding unification with its kin in the Russian republic of North Ossetia. Although Mr Yeltsin and Mr Shevardnadze agreed a truce, the Ossetians - north and south - rejected it. The Georgian forces are now closing in on the partly destroyed Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. Mr Alan Chachiev, deputy leader of the South Ossetian parliament, said last week that he would call in forces from the Caucasian peoples in Russia to his aid if Russia itself did not support him: 'Russia is betraying us, so we will bring the war to Russia.' Even where agreements have been reached, they are fragile and untested. The summit meeting last month between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, was described by both men as a breakthrough. But it was a breakthrough that ignored the question of Crimea, Ukraine's southern region on the Black Sea with a majority Russian population. The region has been reclaimed by the Russian parliament in a decision that annulled its arbitrary transfer from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954. This dispute dwarfs all others in its scope and strategic implications. Both Russia and the Ukraine are seeking to play down the issue while they attempt to stabilise their economic relations. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kravchuk have, for example, agreed to co-operate on the introduction of a Ukrainian currency in three months' time. But both may be pressurised by their nationalists into reviving the dispute. Although most apparent in Crimea and the Ukraine, Russia has an interest in all of these disputes. The immediate reason for its involvement is also the most keenly felt: the perceived need to defend Russian minorities. There are about 25m Russians and Russian speakers who, for the first time since their rulers began the steady conquest of neighbouring peoples more than two centuries ago, find themselves outside the borders of Russia proper, and subject to the laws of other independent nations. They are suffering: there are Russian-speaking refugees streaming back into Russian towns from the Caucasus and from Moldova; they have been excluded from voting in a referendum on the constitution in Estonia; they are regarded with suspicion everywhere. In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, the statue of Russian national poet Pushkin was recently removed from its plinth. This new vulnerability is keenly felt by a people brought up in an era of great power and self-confidence. Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, the young leader of the Russian social democrats and the head of the parliament's constitutional commission, said: 'You must understand, this is not a cause just of the political right, but of all Russian parliamentarians. It is the most important cause we now have.' The Russian cause also involves rights to land and assets. Moscow's claim to the Crimea is partly a demand for the Black Sea naval fleet, most of which Russia wants for itself. The determination with which Russia is pursuing its claims throughout the territories of the former Soviet Union is increasing. General Alexander Rutskoi, Russia's vice-president, has continually pushed for a stronger and more interventionist posture on the part of the Russian military. When Mr Yeltsin was in North America last month, Gen Rutskoi warned his fellow countrymen of the need for a tougher stance, and was backed by his president on his return. A week ago, two generals with strongly nationalist sympathies were appointed to senior posts: General Alexander Lebed as head of the 14th Army in Trans Dnestr and General Boris Gromov as deputy defence minister. As soon as Gen Lebed took up his appointment, he described the Moldovan government as 'fascists' and made clear his determination to defend Trans Dnestr. In addition, General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has grown increasingly categorical - claiming the army's right to intervene across the former Union, and warning last week that the perpetrators of attacks on Russians or Russian speakers would be 'brought to account'. In their pronouncements, these men blur the distinction between protection of Russians and protection of Russia's perceived strategic interests - in their mind, there is no clear division. For them, most of the new republics are tiny statelets which must accommodate the imperatives of a great-power neighbour. They resist the withdrawal of Russian armies from the bases they occupy across the former Union. Mr Yeltsin's views on the stationing of Russian troops have also been equivocal. Last month, he promised President Mircea Snegur of Moldova and President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania that he would withdraw the armies from their countries, but nothing has since happened. Either he has acted cynically or he has not been able to deliver. In either case, Russia can be expected to continue its shift towards a more assertive stance. This means that the west may soon be faced with hard questions itself: how far does it tolerate its new-found friend again imposing a Russian hegemony on the area; and how much suppression of national autonomy can be blinked at in the name of peace? And the international community could have to decide whether to recognise - as the Russians are now demanding - enclaves like Trans Dnestr, Ossetia and Crimea as independent states, thereby alienating the states of which they are presently part.</p>

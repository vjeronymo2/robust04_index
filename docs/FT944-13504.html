			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Court orders France to open up two air routes: Paris fails to delay Brussels monopoly ruling The European Court of Justice yesterday ordered the French government to open up to competition immediately two of the country's busiest and most lucrative internal air routes, ending the monopoly of Air Inter, the domestic partner of Air France. The decision is the second defeat in five months for the French government, which has been attempting to delay liberalising its domestic air transport market while it seeks to restructure its loss-making flag carrier. Last night the government was still seeking to avoid the immediate opening of the routes. Instead, it said it would open them from January next year. France was forced in June to allow British carriers to fly to Orly airport in the south of Paris after a confrontation with the British government and the European Commission. After losing the 'Battle of Orly', it appealed to the European Court against another Brussels ruling ordering it to open up the Orly-Marseilles and Orly-Toulouse routes by October 27. But the court rejected the French request to delay liberalising the two profitable routes until later next year and said France 'must open the lines . . . and take the necessary measures to allow this decision to take effect on October 27'. The French reaction could set Paris on a collision course with Brussels over EU air transport liberalisation policy. Mr Marcelino Oreja, the European Union transport commissioner, called on France yesterday to comply fully with the court ruling. Mr Oreja is understood to be adamant that France cannot delay opening up landing rights until January. 'The EU is a community of equal rights and obligations before the law,' said one Brussels official. Member states and airlines committed to liberalisation are also angry at the Commission's decision to allow the French government to grant FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh subsidies to Air France, as well as approving state aid to Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP Air Portugal. The British government and seven European airlines filed actions in the European Court this month seeking to annul the EU approval for the Air France state aid. The French Transport Ministry said it was committed to 'gradual and managed liberalisation' on domestic routes. In its appeal to the European Court, it had argued that the introduction of competition on the two routes would result in a sharp loss in market share for Air Inter.

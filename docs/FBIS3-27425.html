Because neither  side made concessions, no agreement was reached. This shows  that after the end of the Cold War, economic and trade  contradictions between the two countries have become sharper.    Japan is the second largest trade partner of the United  States. Trade frictions have continuously existed between the  two countries for a long time, and the main problem is the  increasingly serious imbalance in bilateral trade. According to  statistics from the U.S. side, Japan's trade surplus with the  United States has increased year after year, and amounted to $54  billion between January and November 1993. In order to solve  the trade imbalance issue, Clinton reached a "framework  agreement" last July in Tokyo with former Japanese Prime  Minister Miyazawa to make Japan open its markets wider and to  reduce its trade surplus with the United States. In the  agreement, the Japanese side promised to adopt measures to  stimulate economic growth, increase imports, and reduce its  trade surplus. In more concrete terms, Japan agreed to increase  imports of autos and auto parts, telecommunications equipment,  medical equipment, and services from the United States. The  framework agreement stipulated that the leaders of the two  countries would hold talks twice a year. The two sides planned  to reach concrete agreements on implementing the "framework  agreement" at the recent summit meeting.    At the meeting, the positions of the two sides were distant.  Hosokawa put forth his plan to stimulate economic growth in  Japan. The plan will cost $140 billion, and it includes such  measures as reducing individual income taxes, stimulating  consumer purchasing power, and increasing imports. However, the  U.S. Government was not satisfied with this and held that the  plan was not effective enough to bring about substantial changes  in the Japanese economy and did not guarantee an expansion of  imports from the United States. The U.S. side insisted that  Japan should have "objective standards" for expanding the  openness of its market and should lay down "quantitative  targets" for imports. Japan refused to accept this, holding  that this would be de facto "managed trade," which goes against  the principle of free trade. As the two leaders held tough  positions, the talks inevitably broke down. Observers here held  that the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict can mainly be attributed  to the following factors. First, after the end of the Cold War,  the Untied States gave top priority to correcting its trade  imbalance with Japan in its Japanese policy, and it is  impossible for Japan to require the United States to make  concessions on the grounds of "strengthening global cooperation  between Japan and the United States." Before Hosokawa visited  the United States this time, the Japanese foreign minister  arrived in Washington one day earlier and met with a lot of key  diplomats and security officials on the U.S. side in the hope  that U.S. officials would persuade American business circles, as  they had done before, and would thus make concessions. However,  he found that the U.S. officials held the same position and in  turn required the Japanese side to make concessions. Second,  the Clinton administration has found it harder to endure the  increasing trade deficits incurred by its country, and resolved  to adopt tough measures to reduce the trade deficit with Japan  for the sake of the U.S. economy and employment prospects.    At the summit meeting, the Japanese side did not give an  impression of weakness. Japan opposed the adoption of  quantitative targets. On the one hand, it does not want to  subject itself to U.S. controls; on the other hand, Japan has  not yet recovered from its most serious economic recession since  the end of World War II and is finding it hard to increase  imports. As both the United States and Japan have to proceed  from their respective interests, it will be hard for them to  actually solve their trade frictions.</p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Fund based on Brazilian debt THE range of structured funds aimed at investors who want a geared bet on Latin American debt has been expanded this week by what is thought to be the first based on Brazilian debt instruments. Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has created two tranches of debt based on Brazilian IDU bonds, with a total face value of Dollars 100m. The bonds trade at about 60 per cent of face value. Morgan is selling Dollars 35m of senior notes, based directly on IDU bonds, and Dollars 25m of junior notes, geared instruments which give about three times the exposure to the bonds than would be gained by investing directly.</p>

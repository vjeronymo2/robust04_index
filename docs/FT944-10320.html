			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Lloyds' C&amp;G offer attacked Non-executive directors of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society are to be urged by some of the society's members to think again about the board's agreement to the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn cash offer, Alison Smith writes. The C&amp;G Alternatives Group, which has signed up more than 2,000 of the society's 1m-plus members, is launching a letter-writing campaign. The group wants a review of the board's decision to take up the Lloyds offer on a timescale which means some existing investors with the society will not be able to share in the cash handout.</p>

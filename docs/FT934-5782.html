			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not right way to respond Sir, In response to the prime minister's deregulation drive, the Health and Safety Commission set up seven task groups to review health and safety legislation. These groups are due to report in March. As a member of one of these review groups, I wonder why the government has chosen to ignore this consultation process and announce legislation giving itself powers to repeal health and safety regulations without debate. In future, it seems, the government plans to legislate on health and safety without reference to anyone else. This is not a response to the needs of business but an attempt to centralise power further. Bronwen Bernard, 6 Vanbrugh Park Rd West, London SE3 7QD</p>

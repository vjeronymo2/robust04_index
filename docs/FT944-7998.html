			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A different US outlook The authors of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's country reports are always at the mercy of somewhat lagged publication dates. But this month's Congressional elections make the latest annual survey of the US, published yesterday, read rather like an encouraging mid-term report, for a pupil subsequently suspended. One year on from its last assessment of the country's progress, the OECD's verdict resembles that of the electorate: must try harder. Where it differs is in believing that both President Bill Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, must deliver more of the same in the years ahead for the economy's future to be secure. Much of the authors' short-term analysis has been overtaken by the events of recent weeks. Their sobering long-term prescriptions for the economy have not. The US economy, in the OECD's view, has performed 'remarkably well' over the past two years. 'The expansion has become more firmly established, and job creation has accelerated, without the re-emergence of any wage and price pressures thus far.' Unlike many US voters, the organisation awards some of the credit for this achievement to Mr Greenspan and the administration. By raising interest rates before any visible hints of inflation, Mr Greenspan was quicker to tighten the monetary screws than his predecessors. Many in the business community, predictably, griped. Yet, as the authors point out, he was acting to slow a recovery very much of his own making. Domestic demand Low interest rates have played an unusually large role in driving the present upturn. The report notes that, by the end of the second quarter of 1994, the interest rate-sensitive components of domestic demand - fixed investment and durable goods consumption - had risen 30 per cent since the recovery began at the start of 1991. This helped to deliver the 10 per cent rise in gross domestic product over the same period, despite the fact that other demand components rose only 5 per cent. The organisation is duly sceptical about the possibility that current growth rates can be sustained without a pick-up in inflation. Manufacturing productivity has improved dramatically since 1990. Some, including Mr Greenspan, hope that factors like computerisation and continued low inflation may produce a structural improvement in the economy's efficiency. But the OECD, at least, would not rely on it, predicting 2.8 per cent inflation in 1995, up from this year's 2.1 per cent. Interest rates To judge by last week's monetary tightening, Mr Greenspan has decided to be similarly cautious. Indeed, by raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, he has already surpassed the half-point rise by year-end which the authors expected when the report was written. Mr Greenspan's decisiveness appears to have had a favourable impact on market expectations. But the extra  1/4 per cent will give the OECD little reason to revise down its prediction of 2.9 per cent growth in real GDP for 1995, down from around 3.8 per cent this year. Updating the report's careful analysis of Mr Clinton's legislative efforts will present more of a problem. Uncontroversially, the report singles out the 1993 deficit reduction package as something of a landmark, crediting the administration for two-thirds of the fall in the overall US budget deficit in fiscal year 1993. This was 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1993, down from a record 4.3 per cent in 1992. The federal budget deficit is expected to fall to a low of Dollars 173bn in 1996. But, as the authors point out, it will then begin to rise again, topping Dollars 200bn by 1999. Mr Clinton's other legislative programmes - health care, welfare reform, 'reinventing government' and others - receive plaudits from the authors, for addressing, if only on paper, the country's long-term social and economic weaknesses. Of course, these are all things which Mr Clinton failed to deliver in 1994. Republicans in Congress might justifiably argue that the voters elected them to achieve more, in these areas, than Mr Clinton. The danger is that they will see it as a mandate to do less.</p>

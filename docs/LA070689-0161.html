			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Vestron Defaults on Loan: Vestron Inc., a producer and distribution of motion  pictures, video and television entertainment, said it had failed to make  payment on a $25-million note owed to Wells Fargo Bank. In San Francisco, a  spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank had sent a notice of default to  Vestron because the company had not met the July 3 maturity date on the note.  Vestron said it was "actively negotiating" with other financial institutions to  come up with funds to satisfy its obligations and working capital requirements.  </P></p>

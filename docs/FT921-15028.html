			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Poles apart over provision The UK's laissez-faire stance on childcare means it has more in common with the US than with its neighbours in Europe, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study, writes Diane Summers. In both the UK and the US, there is limited public provision, aimed primarily at 'welfare' targets - for example, single mothers and disadvantaged children. For the rest of the population, childcare is seen largely as a private affair. One important difference is that in the US - and not in the UK - parents can offset a proportion of childcare costs against their income tax. At the opposite extreme of provision - and cost to the public purse - are the Nordic countries, which view childcare policy as an area of state responsibility. The overall objective is for childcare to be available to all who want it. In these countries the private sector also plays an important part in providing childcare services. In Denmark and Norway, 40 per cent of all centres are private ventures. These are closely regulated, and the state pays between a third and a half of the costs. Within the European Community, tax relief is allowed for about a third of countries, according to the European Commission. The Netherlands has abandoned relief and diverted funds instead to boosting public provision. The UK and Ireland, the European Commission notes, are exceptional in the EC for not including the children of employed parents as priority groups when it comes to access to publicly provided services, and for limiting these services to 'at risk' children. Apart from Denmark, which has by far the highest public provision in the EC, France and Belgium are the EC leaders. There is least provision in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. Throughout the EC, the part played by private and employer-run nurseries is small, providing places for fewer than 2 per cent of children under the age of three, according to a Commission survey. Overall, the Commission concludes, there is 'evidence of substantial unmet need for publicly funded services throughout Europe, mainly for children under three and outside school hours care for over-threes'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial staffer Keiko Ito: "Popular </F> Support Has Declined, and the JNP Is Bewildered"]    [Text] Recently, the office of Akio Nakajima, a Japan New  Party [JNP] Diet member, has been receiving faxes and telephone  calls one after another from his supporters in protesting:    "I have doubts about [the planned formation of] a joint  parliamentary group with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. (In  light of the JNP's philosophy) should not the JNP draw a line  between themselves and the former Tanaka faction?"    "Are you going to take down the banner you raised during the  election campaign?"    There have been nearly 10 [figure as published] calls so  far.    Two months have passed since the relationship between Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who heads the JNP, and Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads Sakigake [Harbinger],  started to crack. Hosokawa has gradually started to tilt toward  Ichiro Ozawa's Shinseito, and some media reported that "the JNP  and Shinseito will form a joint parliamentary group." [The  protests] were sent immediately after this.    "We never abandoned our slogan of clean [politics],"  Nakajima  explained earnestly at a meeting of his supporters.    After graduating from the Chinese Department at the Osaka  University of Foreign Studies and the Ethics Department at the  University of Tokyo, he worked at the Ministry of Education for  27 years. Since his retirement, he had worked at a private  education firm until the JNP asked him to be "a candidate." At  the age of 57, he started his political career [as a Diet  member] from the Kanagawa No. 3 lower house district.    "Frankly, I was elected because there was a `wind [blowing  for the JNP].' Dirtying our `clean' image is most problematic,"  Nakajima says.    According to him, [the JNP and] Sakigake, the JNP's  parliamentary group partner, are holding special committee  meetings and staff meetings together every day, and all of their  members get along well.    "The images of [the JNP and Sakigake] are similar, and their  members are like-minded. At the same time, it is the power of  Shinseito that is firmly supporting the shaky coalition cabinet.  Both parties are important partners for us."  <H5>  Plan To Form Joint Parliament Group: A Complete Surprise </H5>   There are many troubled Diet members such as Nakajima.    "The secret of Hosokawa's popularity lies in the way he  handles both Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa skillfully. Favoring  one runs counter to why the people support him" (says Diet  member Fumihiko Igarashi).    "If we had married Sakigake then [referring to the planned  merger between the JNP and Sakigake last year], we would be able  to talk frankly with Shinseito now" (says a young JNP member).    The talk of forming a joint parliamentary union was "a  complete surprise" to most JNP Diet members (says JNP Secretary  General Masuo Matsuoka).    According to Matsuoka, the misfortune of the JNP and  Hosokawa  is the fact that "the leader of the small `Hosokawa' party  suddenly rose to be prime minister."    Since he assumed the post of prime minister in August,  Hosokawa has been away from his party headquarters in Takanawa,  Tokyo, for approximately seven months. During that time, he was  extremely busy with his duties as prime minister and was not  involved at all with party affairs.    [The frequency of] visits made by [JNP] party officials to  the Prime Minister's Official Residence to brief [Hosokawa on  party affairs] was every several days. Matsuoka says that this  stood in contrast to the fact that members of Sakigake came to  see Takemura, who is also at the prime minister's official  residence, so often that members of the other parties would ask  ironically, "Is this Sakigake's office?"    Hosokawa told JNP members, "I want to make a sharp  distinction between the job of prime minister and party affairs.  Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka used to do so."    And JNP members were said to be refraining from visiting  Hosokawa because they thought, "It is not desirable for his  `relatives' [members of his own party] to always be hanging  around the prime minister."    "The owner," who had been managing all affairs, was absent  for seven months. As a result, as a young JNP member described,  "No `employee' knows what his `employer' is thinking."    Often, there were discrepancies in opinions and feelings  regarding a change of personnel and party rules between young  JNP Diet members, who were elected last summer, and the staff of  the secretariat, who have been supporting Hosokawa since his  days as governor [of Kumamoto Prefecture] and as a an upper  house member.    "It is Diet members who develop a party!"    "A party has a history of its own!"    They shouted at each other, and this was reported as a  "split  in the JNP," or "internal strife."    After all, an agreement could not be reached within the  party  on the personnel changes for the new leadership for the JNP to  begin in earnest as a party, and the matter was left to the  leader's discretion.    Hosokawa reportedly told Nakajima, who visited the Prime  Minister's Official Residence at the beginning of March, "The  party and I seem to have drifted apart. I think I should visit  the party at least once a week from now on."    Approval Rate Down From 17 Percent to 12 Percent    According to an opinion poll conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN at  the end of February, the support rate for the JNP declined from  17 percent, at the time of a poll in November, to 14 percent in  December, and then to 12 percent. The JNP had difficult  campaigns in which four of its eight official candidates were  defeated in municipal assembly elections in Hino and Machida in  Tokyo in late February. The party has about 30,000 members.    Ryozo Nagata, executive director of the JNP, said "due to  the  controversy over the national welfare tax, party membership has  not increased since January."    The decline in the JNP's popularity is evident to everybody.    Soon after he was inaugurated as prime minister Hosokawa  repeatedly told JNP Diet members: "Your greatest task is to be  returned once again at the next election. Please devote all  your energy to strengthening your home territory."    One Diet member commented: "We do not have networks of local  supporters or national reputations, very must understand that we  would have not been elected if we had not caught hold of the  coattails of Mr. Hosokawa."  <H5>  To Study Policies or To Visit Local Districts </H5>   The JNP has 42 Diet members, 20 seats in the Tokyo  Metropolitan Assembly, and more than 10 members in prefectural  and municipal assemblies. The average age of JNP lower house  members is only 42.    Takashi Kawamura, a JNP Diet member, plans soon to launch  the  "Raison d'Etre Study Group" and he is urging every JNP Diet  member to join. The purpose of the group is to study the future  course of the JNP in the coalition government.    In the 10 years since he started his career in politics,  Kawamura has belonged to the Democratic Socialist Party and the  Liberal Democratic Party, and he has been defeated twice. In  the JNP, which has been ridiculed as "a group of amateurs," he  is a senior member.    He thinks the JNP, which has been helped by the mood of the  country to make progress, needs financial backing and a network  of local supporters to become a real political party.    Visiting his local district, Kawamura takes bus trips or  goes  to the theater with his supporters. Young JNP Diet members  criticize that as being "LDP-like."    Kawamura tells them to, "visit your local districts more,"  but the young members believe "the duty of a politician is to  study policies."    "Standing at the bow of a small ship sailing into a troubled  sea, I would like to sail out flying the flag of an idealism  that we are in danger of losing," Hosokawa said in a declaration  on the party's establishment two years ago.    The spirit that led to the formation of the party was a  search for political ideals, not money or electoral territory,  and that must have been why voters supported the JNP.    Now that the wind has died down, JNP Diet members find  themselves tossed about by the calls for political realignment,  and have only just started to work on finding a way for the JNP  to survive.</p>

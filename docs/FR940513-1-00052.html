			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In 1995, a Senator in the State Q legislature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announces her intention to introduce legislation to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health insurers to cover a particular medical procedure in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies sold in the state. Taxpayer Y, a calendar year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer, has different policies for two groups of employees, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which covers the procedure and one of which does not. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bill is introduced, Y's legislative affairs staff asks Y's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human resources staff to track claims for the procedure that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed, in order to estimate the additional cost of requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coverage under both policies. In 1996, Y's legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affairs staff prepares a study estimating Y's increased costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the results of tracking, in 1995, the claims made. Also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1996, Y writes to members of the state legislature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explains that it opposes the proposed change in insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage based on the study. The letter is a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication (because it refers to and reflects a view on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific legislation). Both the activity of tracking the claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the activity of estimating Y's additional costs under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed legislation relate to the lobbying communication because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are used to support that communication. It is presumed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that Y engaged in 1996 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the activity of estimating the additional costs it would incur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year as the lobbying communication. Based on these facts, Y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to this activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, because Y did not regularly track these claims before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Y engaged in 1995 in the activity of tracking these claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely to make or support the lobbying communication. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facts, because Y tracked these claims to support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut the presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> After several years of developmental work under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various contracts, in 1997, Taxpayer A, a calendar year aerospace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company, contracts with the Department of Defense (DOD) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a prototype of a new generation military aircraft. A is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware that DOD will be able to fund the contract only if Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriates an amount for that purpose in the upcoming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriations process. In 1998, A conducts simulation tests of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the aircraft and revises the specifications of the aircraft's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected performance capabilities, as required under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract. A submits the results of the tests and the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications to DOD. In 1999, Congress considers legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appropriate funds for the contract. In that connection, A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarizes the results of the simulation tests and of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft's expected performance capabilities, and submits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary to interested members of Congress with a cover letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that encourages them to support appropriations of funds for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to specific legislation (i.e., appropriations) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests passage). The described activities in 1998 and 1999  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relate to that lobbying communication and, therefore, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to be for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sole purpose of making or supporting that communication. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on these facts, A cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the summary prepared specifically for that communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because A conducted the tests and revised the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications to comply with its production contract with DOD, A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can rebut the presumption as it relates to those activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> C, president of Taxpayer W, travels to the state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital to attend a two-day conference on new manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes. C plans to spend a third day in the capital meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with state legislators to explain why W opposes a pending bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrelated to the subject of the conference. C's staff prepares a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> briefing book on the pending bill for C's use in meetings with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state legislators. Because the meetings with the legislators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be lobbying communications (because C will refer to and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect a view on specific legislation), C's travel and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of the briefing book are presumed to be solely for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of making or supporting the lobbying communications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these facts, W cannot rebut the presumption as it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relates to the preparation of the briefing book, but can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially rebut the presumption as it relates to C's travel by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating that the travel was engaged in both for lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-lobbying purposes. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, W must reasonably allocate C's travel between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending the conference and meeting with the state legislators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In 1995, Taxpayer F comments on proposed EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and successfully contests their validity on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutional grounds in litigation. In 1997, Senator N  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduces environmental legislation, which F believes to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unconstitutional on the same grounds as the previously proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and defeated regulations. F sends some of the documents it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared in 1995 to Senator N's staff with a cover letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that F opposes the environmental legislation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter to Senator N refers to and reflects a view on specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation and thus is a lobbying communication. F engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the activity of preparing the documents, however, for a non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year in which the lobbying communication was made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the document preparation was engaged in solely for a non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying purpose. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebut that presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On February 1, 1995, a bill is introduced in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress that would affect Company E, a calendar year taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees in E's legislative affairs department, as is customary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare a brief summary of the bill and periodically confirm the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural status of the bill through conversations with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees and members of Congress. On March 31, 1995, the head  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of E's legislative affairs department meets with E's President to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request that B, a chemist, temporarily help the legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affairs department analyze the bill. The President agrees, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests that B also be assigned to draft a position letter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposition to the bill. Employees of the legislative affairs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> department continue to confirm periodically the procedural status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the bill. On October 31, 1995, B's position letter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposition to the bill is delivered to members of Congress. B's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter is a lobbying communication because it refers to and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects a view on specific legislation. Under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(5)(i) of this section, the assignment of B to assist the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative affairs department in analyzing the bill and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafting a position letter in opposition to the bill evidences a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose to influence legislation. Based on these facts, neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the activity of periodically confirming the procedural status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bill nor the activity of preparing the routine, brief summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the bill before March 31 constitutes influencing legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to periodically confirming the procedural status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bill on or after March 31, it is presumed, under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(4) of this section, that E engaged in the activity solely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make or support the lobbying communication because the activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenced in the same taxable year as the lobbying communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These facts indicate that after March 31, E determined the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural status of the bill for the purpose of supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying communication by B and, accordingly, E cannot rebut the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumption as it relates to this activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

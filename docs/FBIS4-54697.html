			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 3 May (TANJUG) -- Croatian Defense Council  [HVO] forces and regular Croatian Army units have resumed their  provocations by firing from infantry weapons at Muslim army  positions in the Mostar area, the Muslim Radio Sarajevo said  today. According to the information service of the Fourth Corps  of the Muslim army, since yesterday Croatian troops have been  using mortar and antitank missiles for attacks on the Mostar  battlefield. According to the Muslim radio, this is yet another  indication that the extreme part of the HVO has still not given  up its expansionist ambitions and its ultimate goal of dividing  Mostar.</p>

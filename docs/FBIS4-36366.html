			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PNA member Ahmad Quray', in Tunis, </F> by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given; from the "With  the Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] PNA [Palestinian National Authority]  member Ahmad Quray', the expenses required by the Palestinian  Authority are not small, especially those needed to run the  police. Where will the money come from to cover these expenses?    [Quray'] In the long run, the Palestinian authority will  have no problem coming up with the money. But in the interim,  the donor nations are duty-bound to make available all the  finances required for the security forces and other departments  of the authority. I cannot make sense of this hesitation and  foot-dragging in providing the finances for the Palestinian  authority. We cannot overstate the importance of this factor,  if the peace process is to be kept going and its momentum  maintained.    [Mu'addi] It is now a month since the Israeli-Palestinian  accord was signed, and yet the Palestinian authority, which has  to tackle major challenges, has still to become operational.  What's the delay?    [Quray'] We trust the Palestinian authority will be  operational before long. Cadres of the PNA were supposed to  begin all their duties in earnest so the transformation could  become visible to the Palestinian man in the street, and in  order for the world to witness the Palestinians' ability to  deliver. The security forces are now deployed, and I think  ordinary Palestinians are happy with their performance. We  trust the bureaucracies will become operational soon.    [Mu'addi] The tax and customs crews have not begun their  work yet, which may result in reduced revenues. When will that  be?    [Quray'] At the moment, strictly speaking, there is no tax  collecting agency to raise money to pay for the PNA's expenses.  We have no choice but to organize the tax collecting authority.  We hope that, now that there is a Finance Ministry, this  department will institute this agency soon.    [Mu'addi] How do you propose to quicken the slow pace of  implementing the economic agreement and opening the Israeli  market to goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip?    [Quray'] The Israeli side is, inexplicably and inexcusably,  responsible for the slow pace. We had thought they would be  anxious to put the agreement in place without reneging on any of  its clauses, particularly given that, in this equation, they are  the stronger side. I just cannot understand, nobody can  understand, why there are obstacles to the export of Palestinian  agricultural produce to the Israeli market. If this clause is  not implemented, what else is left of the agricultural  agreement, or even the trade accord, to implement? Of all  matters, there should not be any foot- dragging on this thing.  The Israelis are in a position to settle this issue promptly.  Their temporization is inexcusable.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Thank you so much.    [Quray'] Thank you.</p>

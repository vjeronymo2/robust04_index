			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Reznik report: "Khabarovsk Kray Governor Calls for </F> Denunciation of Border Agreement With China"; accompanied by  IZVESTIYA PRESS SERVICE report citing Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry staffer]    [Text] Khabarovsk Kray -- Viktor Ishayev, head of the  Khabarovsk Kray Administration, has called the border agreement  between Russia and China that was signed in May 1991 unfair and  an infringement of Russian interests. This document, in his  opinion, has not resolved the border problems that exist between  our giant countries.    At a news conference Ishayev referred to "submerged reefs"  that could create new problems in Russo-Chinese relations. For  instance, Article 5 of the agreement claims that the border  between China and Russia in navigable rivers runs down the  center of the main channel, while in nonnavigable rivers it runs  down the center of the river or the center of its main branch.  And Article 4 prescribes that a joint demarcation commission  should "determine in line with Article 5 of this agreement the  ownership of islands...."    Russia could lose many valuable lands, Viktor Ishayev  claims.  In Maritime Kray alone China could gain around 1,000 hectares of  fertile pastureland. The people of Khabarovsk are also put out,  for instance, by this entry in Article 8 of the agreement: "The  contracting parties agree that ships of various kinds, including  warships, can sail from the Ussuri River into the Amur River  past Khabarovsk and back again without let or hindrance...."  Who would like foreign ships -- much less, warships -- to be  sailing virtually in the city center?... The people of the Far  East again find it impossible to come to terms with their  Chinese neighbors' claims to the age-old Russian Bolshoy  Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands.    The governor cited numerous examples of Chinese ships  navigating our internal waters past Khabarovsk without let or  hindrance. They often deviate from the main channel, enter  other channels, take depth measurements, and photograph the area  and installations.    IZVESTIYA PRESS SERVICE report: "Russian Foreign Ministry  Disagrees"    "Press reports of statements from the head of the Khabarovsk  Kray Administration denouncing the agreement on the eastern  stretch of the border between Russia and China are of concern to  us," IZVESTIYA has been told by a senior Russian Foreign  Ministry official. He refrained from making a definitive  assessment, citing the fact that his department does not have  any accurate information on these statements by the  administration head. "We are trying to corroborate the accuracy  of these reports," the diplomat said.    The Foreign Ministry proceeds on the basis that the 1991  agreement is a fair agreement based on generally accepted norms  of international law -- specifically, on drawing the border in  navigable rivers down the middle of the main channel, and in  nonnavigable rivers down the middle of the river or its main  branch.    The senior Foreign Ministry official asked for it to be  clearly stressed that never before in history had the islands in  the Amur and Ussuri Rivers been divided up between Russia and  China by treaty. The specific ownership of the islands -- which  is, indeed the reason why feelings are running high -- will be  determined in the course of the border demarcation currently  being carried out.    The Foreign Ministry can in no way share the administration  head's indignation about the passage of Chinese ships in the  Khabarovsk area. This is normal practice, the diplomat said,  when foreign vessels enter our ports or internal waters.    The diplomat admitted, however, that regulations governing  navigation have not yet been elaborated in line with the  bilateral agreement. A Russian delegation comprising experts  from different departments -- including the Amur River Shipping  Company -- is currently holding talks with the Chinese on  drawing up such regulations. Conclusion of this work will make  it possible to avoid any complications or misunderstandings in  the future, the diplomat said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il received letters of thanks from the senior  vice-president of the U.S. CNN and the Japanese NHK news  coverage group that had visited Korea with former heads of state  and government and politicians of different countries.    The letters dated April 19 expressed sincere thanks to  Comrade Kim Chong-il for inviting them to visit and report on  the DPRK.    Senior Vice-President of the U.S. CNN Eason Jordan in his  letter of thanks said; "Our visit was extremely successful,  especially our meeting and coverage of President Kim Il-song.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to you".    He hoped that through coverage and report the CNN has made  some contribution to international understanding of Korea and to  the cause of world peace and laid the groundwork for a long-term  and positive relationship with Korea.    The letter expressed once again thanks to consideration and  support of Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The Japanese NHK news coverage group in the letter of thanks  said that the invitation of the NHK coverage group representing  Japan and CNN coverage group representing the United States  under the present rigorous situation surrounding the Korean  peninsula today was made by the wise decision of Comrade Kim  Chong-il.

The true  looks  of the DPRK which no one can know without visiting it and  meeting people have been conveyed to the world, I believe.    NHK will in the future, too, make efforts for the  improvement  of the DPRK-Japan relations and for peace and prosperity of  Northeast Asia on the basis of the deep cooperative relations  with the DPRK hitherto.    The letter hoped that Comrade Kim Chong-il would understand  such a stance of report of NHK and give guidance for the  establishment of eternal relations between NHK and the DPRK.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand and Vietnam signed a memorandum of  understanding on intellectual property, the first of its kind  between the two developing countries in this fast-growing region  of the world.    The document was signed by representatives from Thailand's  Ministry of Commerce and Vietnam's Ministry of Science,  Technology and Environment during the visit by Deputy Minister  of Commerce Churin Laksanawisit to Vietnam during April 22 to  24, 1994.    The agreement is aimed at making Thailand a center for  intellectual property registration and claims for Indochina.    Deputy Minister Churin said that Vietnam is in agreement in  Thailand's proposal.    The memorandum of standing signed by the two sides provided  opportunities for both countries to exchange information on  laws, procedures in registration of patents, trademarks, and  copyrights, registrated marks and patents, and cooperation in  personnel development.    Churin said that the signing of the memorandum of  understanding with Vietnam will benefit Thai business people and  investors, facilitating the registration of their trademarks and  protecting their intellectual property rights.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Tokyo builder misses cash deadlines WATAKYU Kensetsu, a Tokyo-based builder of apartments and office buildings with outstanding debts of Y145bn (Dollars 1.16bn), admitted yesterday to missing two payment deadlines, but still hoped to avoid collapse. The company blamed the non-payment on unsuccessful dealings with a non-bank financial institution. However, Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research agency, said that Watakyu's banks had cut credit lines and that the company was virtually insolvent. Watakyu admitted that a sluggish property market and heavy interest burdens had weakened the company, which has a Y140bn condominium complex under construction in Niigata, central Japan. The company, founded in 1973, said the Niigata project would go ahead if its banks and other creditors provided the necessary finance. Watakyu's difficulties are typical of those facing small and medium size developers which have expanded from traditional niche markets in apartments to building large resorts or apartment complexes. A glut of apartments has forced prices down by 50 per cent over the past two years in some areas, and developers complain they are under pressure because purchasers have failed to meet their payment deadlines.</p>

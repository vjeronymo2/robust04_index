This is the view shared by chief representatives of Beijing  offices of nearly 20 foreign companies and heads of Sino-foreign  joint ventures.    They said in a recent interview with XINHUA reporters that  China's legislation in the economic sector had been much  improved.    Statistics show that the Seventh National People's Congress  [NPC] and its Standing Committee had passed 87 laws during its  five-year term from 1989 to 1993, one fourth of which were on  foreign investment in China, and last year, 15 of the 20 laws  adopted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee concerned the  economy.    They also said that China attached great importance to  protecting interests of foreign companies with laws and  regulations.    Among the adopted laws, the Law of Sino-Foreign Cooperative  Enterprises and Maritime Law of the People's Republic of China  (PRC) are concerned with foreign companies' businesses in China,  and a chapter of the corporate law was made specifically for  foreign companies.    Besides, Law on the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities, Income Tax Law for Enterprises With Foreign  Investments and Foreign Enterprises also defined rights and  obligations of foreign companies in China, which are welcomed by  foreign entrepreneurs and bankers.    Chun Song-chin, chief representative of the Beijing office  of  the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation from the Republic  of Korea, said that although China's legislative system needs to  be further improved, the adoption of so many laws in such a  short time is indeed an "amazing progress."    According to him, China has approved over 70,000  foreign-funded companies last year, which account for half of  the number China has approved in the last 15 years.    Many trans-national groups have come to China in recent  years, he said, adding that foreigners have begun pursuing  long-term development in China, rather than seeking short-term  benefit as most of them did before.    Chun attributed this not only to the social stability, and  the more open market, but also the improving legislation which  makes foreigners feel safer in investing here.    Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that  it is obvious that Chinese laws can protect foreign companies in  China.    The patent law China passed in 1984 did not protect the  patent of chemical products, he said. However, the new patent  law put into operation in 1993 has included the protection of  chemical products and agricultural chemicals. Thus the  interests of foreign chemical enterprises like Du Pont will be  further protected, he said.    Takeshi Kagami, the chief representative of the Beijing  office of the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation,  expressed his hope that the Law on Commercial Banks, Law on the  Central Bank, insurance law and the law of bills which are being  prepared will be passed at an early date.    He said that he was confident that these coming laws will  define clearly business spheres and status of foreign banks in  China, and create better financial conditions for the  development of foreign enterprises.    Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of  Germany's  BASF Chemical Corporation, pointed out that as an international  corporation with branches all over the world, one of his  company's rules is to abide by laws of countries where its  branches are located.    "So we are eager to know every law China has just passed,"  he  said. "We hope that China could publish the English version of  the laws as early as possible."    H. T. Kun, director of the public relations department of  the  AT&amp;T China Company, said that his company had established a  special department to study the Chinese laws, and many other  overseas business offices also do so.</p>

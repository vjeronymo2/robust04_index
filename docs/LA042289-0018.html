I raped her, I strangled her and I bludgeoned her," Scott  Martin Williams told Novato detectives during a tearful admission Wednesday  night, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.  </P> <P> Police said Williams, 29, a volunteer teacher and groundskeeper at Bethel  Baptist Church, made several statements containing facts about the April 13  killing of Jennifer Moore of Novato that were not known to the general public.  </P> <P> Novato Police Chief Charles Brobeck and Marin County Dist. Atty. Jerry Herman  confirmed that Williams had confessed after the Chronicle story appeared.  </P> <P> If convicted, Williams could face the death penalty because of special  circumstances. Specifically, he was charged with committing the murder during a  rape or attempted rape and during lewd and lascivious conduct with a person  under 14.  </P></p>

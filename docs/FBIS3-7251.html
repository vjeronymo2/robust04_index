After castigating countries in Asia and other regions for their  suppression of political freedom and dissent, Washington is now  prodding the rest of the world to crack down on sexual abuses of  women and children.    The latest US campaign mounted by Assistant Secretary of  State for Human Rights John Shattuck should touch some raw  nerves here in Thailand. This is not so much because Thailand  is placed on Washington's list of violators where 800,000 young  people are allegedly subject to sexual abuses -- a figure  already disputed by Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa as  grossly exaggerated.    Rather, the targetting of attack on the under-aged flesh  trade touches on a sensitive issue known to be close to Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai's heart. It may be recalled that the  elimination of "rampant" child prostitution was one of the  cornerstones of the Government's social-policy platform.    But although this policy objective was personally advocated  by the prime minister, the Government appears to have achieved  little tangible progress after having served 18 months. An  initial series of police blitz on brothels catering children for  sex was said to have resulted in some temporary improvement but  industry experts say child prostitution in general has since  resumed by taking on new guises. In the meantime, new  legislation promising tough penalties on procurers and clients  has been slowcoming.    So at the very least, Washington's new campaign should serve  to re-focus the Thai Government's attention and efforts to  tackle this pervasive social problem once again. After all, it  is hardly an enviable position for this country to be placed on  top of the list of violators -- India, Taiwan, the Philippines  and Sri Lanka are also accused as the less severe offenders --  and this piece of uncharitable news has been broadcast around  the world.    Scathing accusations by American rights groups and  legislators on the alleged complicity of Thai officials in the  increasing smuggling of Burmese and Chinese women to serve the  flesh trade here should, hopefully, also prompt some corrective  government action.    While it is unfair to make generalised accusations against  the integrity of the Thai police force, corrupt police elements  extracting gains from illegal gambling dens and brothels around  the country are a well-known systemic trend. Likewise, the  wholesale smuggling of females from across the northern borders  would not have been possible without the collaboration of  corrupt officials stationed there.    In retrospect, it is unfortunate and unnecessary that  government actions to deal with these glaring social ills should  have to be prompted by foreign pressures like the sort now  emanating from Washington. Child prostitution and the smuggling  of Burmese and Chinese women here are very much Thailand's  domestic problems that must be dealt with by our own authorities  without other countries having to tell us what to do or what not  to do.    From Thailand's national standpoint, this also raises the  larger question of how far this country -- or, for that matter,  the other Asian countries targetted for the same fault -- should  tolerate foreign pressures like the Shattuck campaign.    First it was several years of threatened sanctions under  Section 301 of the US Trade Act over allegedly inadequate  property rights protection. Then there were more threats over  alleged child labour abuses and the ban on state-enterprise  labour unions here. After the current attack on under-aged  prostitution, what will Washington come up with next? When do  we -- Thailand and other Asian countries which have all along  been on the receiving end of these pressures -- begin to fight  back?    Whereas governments in the region have the moral and  political obligation to rid their societies of sexual abuses on  women and children, it is also time they stand up to question  Washington's right and legitimacy to set human-rights standards  for the rest of the world.    Should the average Americans be entitled to their basic  rights to have decent housing and food through employment --  something of which a large section of its populace has been  deprived owing to years of economic policy mismanagement? Or  should the average New Yorkers be entitled to the rights to walk  around safely in their city which is notorious for being plagued  with one of the highest crime rates in the world?    The self-appointed world champion of human rights should  clean up its own house before telling others what to do.</p>

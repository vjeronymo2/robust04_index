			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf dips 6% to CDollars 16.9m SECOND-QUARTER profits of Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK, slipped by 6 per cent through competitive pressures and lower interest income. Net profits fell to CDollars 16.9m (Pounds 8.58m) for earnings of 20 cents a share, against CDollars 20m, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose from CDollars 678.2m to CDollars 742.4m. Interest income dropped to CDollars 1.6m (CDollars 2.6m). The group had cash reserves of CDollars 168m at June 30, compared with CDollars 201m a year earlier. Long-term debt climbed from CDollars 28m to CDollars 45.4m. The company painted a brighter picture of prospects for the remainder of the year. Mr Brent Ballantyne, newly-appointed chief operating officer, said the retail sector was showing signs of recovery, while good summer weather should boost prepared meats and bakery volumes. Grocery products, bakeries and flour milling were among the businesses which were hit by competitive and other pressures in the second quarter. Maple Leaf was re-examining the future of its food service division, which supplies restaurants, hospitals and other institutions. On the other hand, agribusiness earnings improved significantly. Fresh pork and poultry operations benefited from plant consolidation and cost-cutting. Frozen food profits were also higher.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Kenya asks UN to expel 500,000 refugees THE Kenyan government, in a sharp policy reversal, yesterday asked the United Nations to send home immediately all 500,000 refugees in the country, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The government said banditry and the strain on the country's resources had prompted the move, which was announced on state radio. It followed a spate of bandit attacks along Kenya's border with Somalia in which at least 18 people, eight of them policemen have been killed. 'The number of refugees in Kenya from Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan have not only seriously compromised the security of this country but greatly outstretched the infrastructure and medical services,' the government said. The statement was made by Mr William Kimalat, a permanent secretary in the office of President Daniel arap Moi, and was the president's first big policy change since winning disputed general elections last month. President Moi said last year that Kenya would do what it could for refugees from its less fortunate neighbours but has complained of the cost because western states suspended aid worth Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m) monthly to his country in 1991. The balance of payments support was withheld to force Mr Moi to hold multi-party polls and overhaul the economy and there is little sign it will be reinstated because of Kenya's failure to achieve key economic targets, diplomats said. There was no immediate comment on the move from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' office in Nairobi or the diplomatic community. The announcement coincided with a UN announcement from Geneva that it was starting an emergency airlift of food to some 300,000 Somali refugees in camps in northern Kenya. Earlier, the Kenyan government freed its last four political prisoners in a goodwill gesture towards domestic and foreign critics. Among those freed was Kenya's most prominent dissident, Koigi wa Wamwere, who faced the death penalty for charges of plotting to overthrow President Moi.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Lord Williams resigns MGN directorship Lord Williams of Elvel, the Labour peer, has become the latest Mirror Group Newspapers figure to resign 'to devote his time to other interests.' He was one of two directors to vote against the appointment of Mr David Montgomery as chief executive. The other was Mr Vic Horwood who was first replaced as chief executive by the former Today editor and then later removed as chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record. Lord Williams' resignation follows the dismissal of Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror, and Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People. Meanwhile, unions at MGN have decided to go ahead with organising a ballot in favour of industrial action in support of 100 casual freelances, many of whom have worked on the various titles for years.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Compromise on aid cash eludes officials at Rio AS THE Earth Summit runs into its final days, there is no doubt as to what is the crunch issue: money. Everyone agrees that billions of dollars of aid will be needed to make the summit agreements effective because most of the clean-up work is in the third world. But who will provide it, and on what terms? Officials were engaged in a hectic round of meetings yesterday to try to resolve the wide disagreements. If they fail, the matter will be put before ministers today. And if they fail, it will be up to heads of state to find an answer when they convene on Friday. The main points at issue are: how much money will be made available; how big a long-term commitment the rich countries will make; how it will be provided. The UN estimated that Dollars 625bn (Pounds 343.4bn) a year would be needed by third world countries, of which they would have to provide Dollars 500bn themselves. The remaining Dollars 125bn would come from an existing Dollars 55bn of aid plus Dollars 70bn in new money. This last sum is what all the wrangling is about. Industrial countries have agreed in principle to advance 'new and additional funds' - but not in the amounts suggested. Mr Mahbubul Haq, the former Pakistani finance minister and now a UN adviser, argues that the industrial countries will have a 'peace dividend' of Dollars 1,200bn over the next 10 years which could be re-channelled into the environment. Alternatively a carbon tax of Dollars 1 per barrel would raise Dollars 40bn. The G7 industrialised countries had hoped to leave Rio without having to make binding commitments, but political pressure is now such that they will have to put hard money on the table. The best estimate at the moment is that they will come up with between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 10bn, but much will depend on Japan. Tokyo's foreign aid currently runs at about Dollars 11bn a year. It has also spent just over Dollars 2bn on environmental aid since 1990. Japanese officials are suggesting that the total foreign aid sum might be increased by 50-75 per cent, with a larger chunk being allocated to the environment. However, a senior Japanese official says: 'It's still a fight between the Foreign Ministry and the Finance Ministry.' The other big demand is that the developed countries commit themselves to channelling 0.7 per cent of their GNP into aid. This is almost double the proportion most countries give in assistance, although some smaller European countries are at that level. The Group of 77 developing countries want developed nations to commit themselves to reaching that level by the year 2000, but the G7 rules this out. There does not, therefore, seem to be any chance of their making a long-term aid commitment in Rio. As for the means by which aid will be advanced, the developing countries have been demanding a multi-billion dollar 'green fund'. The donor countries have insisted that any aid linked to the Earth Summit treaties be channelled through the Global Environmental Facility administered by the UN and the World Bank. But they have agreed to make the GEF more 'democratic' by giving recipient countries a greater say in how its money is spent. The money issue is being thrashed out in a contact group headed by Mr Rubens Ricupero, the Brazilian ambassador to Washington. He put forward a working paper to try to forge agreement. This proposed what Mr Ricupero called a 'system' of financing that would draw on all existing aid channels, regional development banks, the GEF and UN agencies, as well as special measures like debt relief and private investment. The paper deliberately avoids hard money numbers. The only proposal containing actual numbers that has so far been put forward is the EC's. France has suggested that the EC commit Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) over the next three to five years for environmental aid. This would be in addition to whatever sums member states pledge individually. Mr Ricupero is hoping donors will commit themselves to 'orders of magnitude'; one western official estimated that the measures would imply aid of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 9bn. His initiative has made virtually no progress, however. Members of Europe's leading non-governmental organisations (NGOs) last night met Euroepan environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest convention, reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. With only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will be any agreement on deforestation, which is continuing at a rate of 17m hectares a year. Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being negotiated simultaneously in Rio.</p>

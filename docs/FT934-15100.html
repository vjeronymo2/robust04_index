			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (2): Symbol of hope in a time of despair - The South MELFI this autumn has been become the symbol of hope for the industrial resurgence of southern Italy. In record time, a greenfield site worked as agricultural land for centuries has been transformed into Italy's most modern industrial plant by Fiat. The Turin-based vehicle group started production in September of the Punto - the new model which Fiat hopes can claw back its declining share of the world car market. Yet the evidence of neglect and despair is widespread. The other, bleaker, side to southern industry has been the wave of labour unrest protesting job losses and threats to employment. At Crotone last month, workers at Enichem, the chemicals arm of ENI, the state oil concern, burned chemical drums and blocked the road and railways for 10 days. At Taranto, further south, 170 desperate workers employed by a sub-contractor, chained themselves to the installations of Ilva, the state steel producer. For five days, they nearly brought production at Europe's largest steel complex to a halt. Elsewhere, at Goia Tauro, the railway line was blocked for fifth time this year by workers and their families protesting over the failure to find a future for an area earmarked in the seventies to host a giant steel plant. Today, Goia Tauro contains a port and four kilometres of quays all unused, and once fertile land has been covered by highways that lead nowhere but which awaited an industrial park. The L4,600bn Fiat plant at Melfi is a bold attempt to prove that industrial investment can be made to work in the south, despite the poor communications, the distance from core European markets and the record of low productivity of southern labour. Fiat's choice of a Melfi was in part the result of generous government grants and subsidies - all approved by the EC. This, combined with lower costs than the north, made Melfi an attractive, if not an inevitable choice compared to other greenfield sites elsewhere in Europe. With automotive plants in southern locations that include Avellino, Pomigliano near Naples and Cassino, Fiat next year will be producing more from its industries in the south than the north. This is an historic change, but for the moment it is a one-off phenomenon in Italian manufacturing. Other big groups such as Olivetti have operations in the south but it is much less important in the overall scheme of production. It also has to be said that a leading player such as Fiat has infinitely more muscle in dealing both with the government, local administrations and the complex inter-play of political forces that are an essential component in managing investment in the south. To these local phenomena should be added the existence of organised crime. Fiat is considered a big enough organisation to stand up to the creeping tentacles of the Naples Camora. However, it was significant that Melfi happens to have been regarded as a 'clean' area. In areas of Calabria, the hold of the local mafia over contractors and labour is a big disincentive. Overall, wage differentials with the north, except in construction, are only marginal. One recent academic study showed industrial wages in the south were 11 per cent lower. In contrast, productivity levels are on occasions 25 per cent lower. Small employers maintain that deals can be struck and the unions, where represented, are less rigid. However, for the labour element to be a factor in attracting investment, the unions will have to be more flexible on national minimums, as well as work practices and hiring and firing. From the fifties onwards, the main investments have been state-directed and mostly by state-controlled companies. By law, state companies in the IRI group or companies such as ENI are obliged to direct 60 per cent of their investment in the Mezzogiorno - including Sardinia and Sicily. In practice the percentage peaked at about 50 per cent in the seventies and now it is down to about 30 per cent. The aim was laudable - to ensure that southern living standards were raised to the level of those in the north. And through massive transfers this has been largely achieved. However, the enormous sums of public money pumped into the south, equivalent annually to 0.7 per cent of GDP, have not achieved the stated aim of providing a self-sustaining industrial and service base. And the weight of manufacturing has not changed. Over the past 40 years it has remained below 15 per cent in the overall composition of output. The main explanation for this is the way state industrial initiatives have been directed towards big capital-intense investments: the so-called 'cathedrals in the desert,' Thus the south has had more than its share of steel plants and petrochemical complexes. But these have been built without reference to the needs or potential of the local economy. For example, the main industries relying on the products produced by Sicilian petrochemical complexes are in northern Italy. Since the steel complex project was stalled at Goia Tauro in the late 1970s, successive governments have agonised as they were lobbied by local political potentates over what to do with the huge and idle infrastructure already built. Finally, last month, it was agreed to go ahead with a project to build a multi-fuel power station. But Goia Tauro power will be carried, at cost, to the north. There is no industry to benefit near the site. Furthermore, with rare exceptions such as Fiat, a process of de-industrialisation is under way in the south. The steel industry, located at Naples and Taranto, is in the process of being rationalised and production cut because of over-capacity in the EC. ENI, the owner of a series of large petrochemical complexes in the south, is having to restructure. Although decisions on closures, notably those plants producing fertilisers, have been postponed constantly, the day of reckoning is close. Elsewhere the picture is of job losses and threats to plants - especially in the Naples area. Alenia, the state-controlled aerospace group, has cut back its operations at Naples. The Ciampi government is still formulating its policies. They are likely to focus on efforts to 're-industrialise' those areas where mature industries are in decline; encourage more professional training; and persuade the unions to drop their rigid labour practices. There is also likely to be greater emphasis on problem areas, instead of lumping the entire Mezzogiorno into one hopeless basket. Only if these policies are pursued vigorously, and accompanied by increased police success against the local mafias, will fresh industrial investment take root. Otherwise, Italy runs the serious risk of seeing the industrial divide grow, and the north distance itself from the south.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTA FE BANK, GROSSMONT MAY MERGE  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Fe National Bank has begun negotiations toward a merger with La  Mesa-based Grossmont Bank, officials said Monday. If completed, the proposed  deal would create a bank with $412 million in assets and 11 branch offices in  San Diego County.  </P> <P> The preliminary negotiations are subject to the execution of a definitive  agreement, as well as approval by both banks' shareholders, the California  State Banking Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal  Reserve Board. Grossmont would become the surviving bank, according to terms of  the proposal.  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Fe National, which is headquartered in Rancho Santa Fe, operates  two branch offices. On Dec. 31, the bank reported $110 million in assets and  $835,000 in net income. Grossmont reported $302 million in assets and $4.1  million in net assets.  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Fe National last year failed to complete a proposed $12-million  sale to Costa Mesa-based Citizens Holdings for $12 million. Rancho Santa Fe  National's shareholders would have received $21.70 per share had that deal been  completed.  </P> <P> Citizens, which had signed a letter of intent to acquire Rancho Santa Fe  National, blamed new federal banking policies when it abandoned the deal in  late October.  </P> <P> That deal marked the third time in recent years that Rancho Santa Fe National  failed to complete a proposed merger or acquisition. In 1985, it abandoned a  previously announced acquisition of Hidden Valley National Bank of Escondido. A  year later, it opened its branch office in Escondido.  </P> <P> In 1986, Rancho Santa Fe National backed away from a planned merger involving  three other San Diego County banks. First National Corp., National Bank of  Fairbanks Ranch and National Bankshares of La Jolla eventually completed that  merger in 1987.  </P></p>

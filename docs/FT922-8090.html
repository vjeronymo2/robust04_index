			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Time Inc moves into in-store advertising TIME Incorporated, the magazine and book publishing subsidiary of the Time Warner group, is to acquire Media One, an in-store advertising company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it is believed to have cost Time around Dollars 20m. Media One, which is based in New York, is the second biggest in-store advertising company in the US. It has a network of display units in more than 6,000 grocery stores including big chains such as Safeway, Kroger and Winn-Dixie. The company's most recognisable product is a two-sided display at supermarket check-out counters. Time, which is making its first foray into the advertising business with this acquisition, said it planned to offer Media One's display products to prospective advertisers in the company's magazine division. In a separate development, Time Warner said a consortium of banks led by Bankers Trust and Chemical bank had given a commitment that a previously disclosed Dollars 6.2bn new loan facility would be available by the end of June. It emerged last month that Time Warner was seeking to reschedule more than Dollars 7bn of debt, substantial amounts of which would have begun coming due next year. The centrepiece of the plan was to stretch out repayments of principal with the new and longer term Dollars 6.2bn loan. Another part of the plan was the raising of Dollars 850m by way of a recent private placement and a commitment from Merrill Lynch to provide Dollars 250m of bridging loans, to be replaced later this year by a 10-year bond issue.</p>

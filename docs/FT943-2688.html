			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: How to make your bank really listen  -A look at ways to complain Most banks admit, unofficially, that some of their less affluent private customers are more trouble than they are worth. But all want to keep the ones with large balances who are suitable targets for other financial services. Measures to retain them range from cash incentives to promises of a better service. Earlier this year, Abbey National halved its authorised overdraft rate, while Midland bank promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each failure to meet certain standards of service in transferring a current account from another bank. Barclays bank has just announced that it is improving its complaints system. It was the subject of bad publicity earlier this year after a customer committed suicide. 'The way we handle complaints is a vital part of our efforts to improve customer service,' said Chris Lendrum, deputy managing director of UK banking services. 'Handled badly, a customer may understandably take his business elsewhere.' One frequent complaint by readers is that branch staff sometimes are unable to provide even such simple information as how to complain. Here, then, are the complaints procedures for some of the UK's largest banks. They sound good - but let us know if theory differs from practice. Barclays The bank is setting up a National Complaints Initiative in branches to handle both personal and business complaints. Staff will complete an 'action form' for customers who complain in person and who will be given a copy for reference. Telephone and written complaints will receive a response within 24 hours. 'In complex cases, this may initially take the form of a holding letter,' says Barclays. Bank of Scotland It has a three-stage process. First, make the complaint (in person, by letter or telephone) to the senior manager of the branch where the problem arose. If you are unhappy with the reply, ask the branch for the name and address of the regional manager responsible for the branch and write to him. If the complaint remains unresolved, take it to the relevant general manager. Midland Go first to the branch manager. The complaint will be answered within two working days, or an acknowledgement sent stating how long the matter is likely to take. If you want to take it further, write to Derek Stafford, Customer Relations Manager, Midland Bank plc, Head Office, Poultry, London EC2P 2BX (the letter will be acknowledged within two working days) or telephone the bank's customer service centre on 0345-707 070. Calls are charged at local rates and are recorded 'to provide conclusive evidence in cases of dispute'. Lloyds Complain first to the branch (if you telephone outside working hours, leave a message on the answering machine and your call will be returned the next working day). If the matter is not resolved, either write to the regional executive director (the branch will provide the name and address) or telephone customer services at head office on Freephone 0800-147 789. Complaints about credit cards are handled by the Senior Manager, Card Services, Essex House, Southchurch Avenue, Southend-on-Sea, Essex SS99 3PP. The local branch will deal with complaints about a Lloyds' payment card. National Westminster Branch-based complaints are handled 'immediately' by the branch but, in complex cases, it will take a maximum of two days. If you want to take the matter further, write to head office, which will acknowledge the letter within 24 hours. There is also a Freephone customer serviceline (0800-505 050) which handles queries, suggestions and complaints. Royal Bank of Scotland Once again, the complaint should be addressed to the branch at which it originated. If you remain unhappy, write to the Head of Service Quality Department, Royal Bank of Scotland, Freepost, PO Box 31, Edinburgh EH2 0DG. An acknowledgment will be sent within two working days and a full response within 10. In all cases, if you have completed the internal complaints process and still feel aggrieved, write to the Banking Ombudsman, 70 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8NB (tel: 071-404 9944).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the Iranian National  Resistance Council, has described the new Persian year as the  year in which the sun will rise brilliantly, signaling the  liberation of the Iranian people. It will also be the year the  regime that brought destruction to Iran will ebb, he noted.    In a congratulatory message addressed to the Iranian people  on the Nauruz festivities and the beginning of a new Persian  year, Rajavi added that the victories scored by the Iranian  resistance last year undermined the structure of the ruling  regime and surpassed the expectations of all observers.    Rajavi indicated that the ruling Iranian regime is  experiencing an impasse due to resistance attacks and the  political and military siege, which has confused it and rendered  it unable to address aggravated crises.    Rajavi added that the popular protest waves which erupt from  time to time throughout Iran confirm that the repression and  oppression being used by the regime cannot muzzle free people  throughout Iran.    Concluding his message, he noted that the UN Human Rights  Commission's condemnation of the Tehran regime a few days ago  confirm that this regime is illegal.</p>

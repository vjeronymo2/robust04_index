			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Power Corp surges 30% on rise from subsidiaries POWER CORP of Canada, the senior holding company of Mr Paul Desmarais, the Montreal financier, unveiled a 30 per cent increase in nine-month net profits. The group lifted earnings to CDollars 135m (USDollars 107m), or CDollars 1.03 a share, up from CDollars 104m, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier on revenues which edged ahead to CDollars 4.5bn from CDollars 4.47bn. The subsidiaries, mainly in financial services and communications, contributed CDollars 74.4m, against CDollars 70m. Third-quarter net profits advanced 12 per cent to CDollars 32.3m, or 24 cents a share, on revenues marginally ahead at CDollars 1.47bn. The results for both periods show that on an operating basis the subsidiaries improved their performance. At September 30, Power Corp and 70 per cent-owned Power Financial had CDollars 750m cash and the group was virtually debt-free. Its biggest subsidiaries are the publicly held Great West Lifeco, one of North America's main life insurance companies, and Investors Group, a financial services retailer. Mr Desmarais, in a joint venture with the Frere family of Belgium, owns 57 per cent of Paresa, the European holding company controlling Petrofina and a string of investments in Europe's industrial, financial services and communications sectors. Hydro-Quebec, the electric power utility fully owned by the Quebec government, suffered a 13.5 per cent decline in profits to CDollars 343m in the first nine months.</p>

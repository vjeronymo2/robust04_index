			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan's economic relationship with the United  States has become murky as the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled  on 11 February are approaching. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has hammered out a plan to boost domestic demand by  implementing a comprehensive pump-priming package centered on  implementing tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen and  introducing a national welfare tax system. However, while  Hosokawa has been forced to make a complete turnaround and  "rescind the plan for raising and cutting taxes," U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor has returned home without  achieving his plan to reach a political compromise. What has  been left behind is a damaged image of the prime minister due to  his failure to exercise leadership.    "For the government to be thought of as being weak would be  disadvantageous to Japan." These were words of concern uttered  by a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] after watching the prime minister make a series  of moves on the tax issue.    On the morning of 3 February, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii  briefed Kantor on government plans to boost domestic demand by  implementing pump-priming measures. In response, Kantor said:  "We hope they (the pump-priming measures) will help promote  growth of the global economy." He had just finished making this  comment when in less than 24 hours it was decided the government  would start over from scratch on the tax measures.    The government hopes to somehow work out a pump-priming  package, which includes tax measures, before the planned  Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, voices have been raised  questioning "whether changing a plan, for which a news  conference was even held, should be considered a mere matter of  procedure," (as stated by a senior MITI official). Since, to  begin with, the United States has expressed dissatisfaction at  the size of the planned tax cuts, it is certain all the more  that the U.S. Government holds doubts about the prime minister's  leadership.    Japan has hoped that negotiations in the disputed sectoral  trade issues, such as automobiles and auto parts, would proceed  smoothly if it could achieve a certain level of success  regarding macroeconomic measures. However, it seems this plan  has completely fallen through. What has been made clear in  Kantor's meetings with Japan's foreign minister, trade minister,  and finance minister is the gap between Japan and the United  States on numerical targets.    In a bid to seek a political compromise, the U.S.  Government,  which has complained that "trade negotiations are not  progressing because Japanese bureaucrats are inflexible," has  sent Kantor at a time when it felt that Prime Minister  Hosokawa's leadership has reached the highest point so far with  the passage of the political reform bills. However, retracting  the announced tax measures has left no small impact on the  United States.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Iranian Embassy in  Tokyo on Monday [13 June] denied as "absurd" an allegation that  Iran has test-fired Nodong missiles supplied by North Korea and  insisted that Tehran's nuclear program is "peaceful."    Iranian Ambassador to Japan Hoseyn Kazempur-Ardabili, in a  letter dated Monday and received the same day, took issue with a  KYODO NEWS SERVICE story Sunday that had said Japan is  reportedly pressuring Iran to stop test-firing the North  Korean-made missiles.    The story quoted the latest edition of the U.S. NEWS AND  WORLD REPORT as saying the Japanese Government is threatening to  suspend financial assistance to a 1.2 billion dollar dam project  in Iran unless Tehran stops the missile testing.    The envoy said the missile allegation "has been denied time  and again at the highest level of my government and Japanese and  South Korean officials have been amply and convincingly assured  of (its) absurdity."    He said that raising it at the time, with the growing  tension  on the Korean peninsula and concern about it in Japan, "is  another attempt to undermine the friendly relations between Iran  and Japan."</p>

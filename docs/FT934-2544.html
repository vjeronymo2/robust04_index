			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Eximbank signs India deal - US takes aggressive line on export finance The US Export-Import Bank yesterday signed a Dollars 60m (Pounds 40.2m) financing arrangement with India signalling its determination aggressively to match subsidised export financing by foreign governments in support of domestic industries. The beneficiary of the tied aid deal is Raytheon, which will provide air traffic control equipment to India's National Airports Authority. Some 45 per cent of the financing will be provided by a grant from a multi-million dollar 'war chest' established for the purpose. The rest of the financing, provided by Eximbank, is a loan carrying an interest rate of 6.6 per cent. The last two Republican administrations were reluctant to employ tied aid, mingling commercial credit and government grants, and often failed to use the various 'war chests' provided by Congress. The Clinton administration has vowed to be more aggressive. However, it was the Bush administration which first offered the financing in 1991, in an ultimately successful effort to get industrialised countries to curb the use of tied aid. A year later it 'improved' its offer, boosting the grant component from 35 to 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Council's  circular on "paying serious attention to spring plowing," which  was issued today, points out: It is now the busiest season for  spring plowing. People's governments at all levels should take  emergency action to conscientiously carry out various rural  economic policies, continue to lighten the peasants' burdens,  further mobilize the peasants' initiative in production, lose no  time in making preparations for spring plowing, and work  assiduously to strive for another bumper harvest in agriculture  this year.    The circular says: Last year, a relatively good harvest was  reaped in agriculture, and comprehensive development was  attained in the rural economy, with grain yields rising to the  new level of 450 billion kg. This has exercised an important  role in increasing effective supplies of agricultural products  and promoting national economic development. This year, we  should seize the good opportunity to carry out in-depth reform,  make further efforts to intensify agriculture and rural work,  and initiate an exceptionally favorable situation in rural  areas. At present, spring plowing is being gradually carried  out from south to north, so that it is time to make full  preparations for spring plowing in the north as well. People's  governments at all levels and the various departments concerned  must enhance their awareness of the urgency and must seriously  do a good job of preparations and spring plowing.    To this end, the State Council has set the following demands  in its circular:    1. Acquire a clearer understanding and take the preparation  work and spring plowing very seriously. This year, the  principal tasks of rural work include: Developing the rural  economy, increasing the peasants' income, and ensuring effective  supplies in the market. These are arduous tasks. In order to do  rural work well this year, it is of vital importance to ensure  the smooth implementation of various reform measures, maintain a  sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received] development in the  national economy, and maintain social stability. With regard to  the current rural work, it is necessary to concentrate efforts  on making proper preparations and organizing the appropriate  manpower for spring plowing so as to lay a solid foundation for  the steady increase of output of the major agricultural  products, including grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on, as  well as products from the "shopping basket" project. As the  whole year's work depends on a good start in spring, people's  governments at all levels and the various departments concerned  should, under the new situation of establishing a socialist  market economic structure, further deepen their understanding,  intensify the position of agriculture as a foundation, and take  the preparation work and spring plowing seriously to avoid  bungling the farming season.    2. Strengthen leadership and ensure that various policies  are put into practice. The crux of taking firm control of  spring plowing this year lies in the serious attention paid by  the leading cadres and the actual implementation of various  policies. At present, it is necessary to urgently carry out the  various policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, the central rural work conference,  and the national work meeting on the "shopping basket" project  as well as grain, cotton, and edible oil. We must resolve  practical problems which crop up in the course of policy  implementation and ensure that various state policies to foster  agriculture are put into practice. People's governments at all  levels should concentrate their energies on strengthening  leadership in spring plowing. The various departments concerned  should clearly understand their responsibility, perform their  duties properly, and enthusiastically give assistance and  support to agriculture. It is necessary to enlist cadres to go  deep into the grass-roots level to resolve various practical  problems in spring plowing in a timely manner. Leading cadres  at prefectural (city) and county levels should personally work  on the front line of production in these crucial times in order  to become acquainted with the real conditions there and resolve  any problems.    3. Give positive guidance and concentrate efforts on  ensuring sufficient grain and cotton acreage. The effort to  maintain stability in the farming area of bulk agricultural  products such as grain, cotton, and others, which have a bearing  on the national economy and people's livelihood, is a task of  primary importance for spring farming this year. Governments at  all levels must adopt vigorous measures to encourage peasants to  boost production in grain, cotton, edible oil, and other  agricultural products through various forms. In both producing  and marketing areas, the increase of grain and cotton output  must be placed in a significant position. Under the precondition  of ensuring stabilized acreage for grain and cotton, efforts  should also be made to rationally readjust structure and layout  so as to enhance economic results. People's governments in the  cotton producing areas along the Huang He, the Huai He, and the  Hai He should try every possible means to guide peasants in  growing more cotton and ensure that the existing fallow land  [chun bai di 2504 4101 0966] and reserved cotton fields are  properly grown, while cotton producing areas in the Chang Jiang  valley and Northwest China should try their best to increase  cotton acreage. An inspection on ensuring sufficient grain and  cotton acreage should be carried out immediately in various  localities so that the work is conducted according to plan. In  the meantime, field management for grain and oil-bearing crops  should be reinforced, and various measures for increasing output  should be intensified to ensure that another bumper harvest in  grain and edible oil will be reaped this summer.    4. Make overall planning and develop the rural economy in a  comprehensive way. During the spring plowing, it is necessary  to make overall planning while giving prominence to key points,  keep in mind the goal of increasing the peasants' income,  organize rural economic work in a comprehensive way, make proper  arrangements for spring afforestation, vigorously develop animal  husbandry and aquiculture, increase the output and supply of  "shopping basket" products, lead township and town enterprises  in their robust and healthy development, and so on. To achieve  the above aims, it is necessary to make comprehensive  arrangements and conscientiously put them into effect.    5. Provide better services to agriculture and do a good job  of supplying adequate agricultural means of production, loans,  and so on. All trades and professions should increase their  awareness of serving agriculture and conscientiously perform  various tasks to serve agriculture. It is necessary to  stabilize the organs that disseminate agricultural science and  technology and the contingent of agricultural scientific and  technological personnel, vigorously disseminate improved  varieties, and popularize advanced and applicable agricultural  production technology. As regards the production and transfer  of agricultural means of production, fertilizer in particular,  the State Council has set explicit demands, and various  departments and local governments at all levels should really  take up responsibility to put them into effect. The departments  in charge of material supplies and marketing should provide  peasant households with the necessary chemical fertilizer,  pesticides, plastic film, diesel oil, and farming implements.  Departments in charge of water resources should take firm  control of building water conservancy projects in spring and  continue to enlist the masses in the construction of irrigation  works. The departments in charge of agricultural machinery  should step up their work in organizing the overhauls, repairs,  transfers, and experiments of farming machines. In various  localities, the masses should be mobilized to collect farmyard  manure, publicize the application of mixed manure, spread  fertilizer deep into the earth, and popularize other effective  techniques to economize on fertilizer and increase soil  fertility. The departments in charge of commodity prices and  administrations for industry and commerce should intensify their  supervision over the markets of agricultural production means,  strictly check arbitrary price rises, resolutely crack down on  the production and marketing of forged and inferior goods, and  safeguard the peasants' legitimate rights and interests.    6. Make proper arrangements of the masses' lives and  production in impoverished and disaster-hit areas. Governments  at all levels must guarantee the supply of grain to the masses  in impoverished and disaster-hit areas so that grain will not be  out of supply in these areas under any circumstances. To  counter the situation of spring crop failure in a small number  of disaster-hit areas, the state has arranged 1 billion kg from  the special reserved grain to overcome the masses' grain  shortage in these areas. At the same time, various localities  must arrange a certain quantity of relief grain and organize the  transfer and supply of such relief grain in a conscientious  manner. Special consideration should be given to the peasant  households who are short of money and grain. The supply of  materials and funds necessary for the preparation work of spring  plowing should be meticulously organized for the masses in the  areas encountering spring crop failure, and the people's ability  to combat disasters and provide for and help themselves in the  disaster-hit and impoverished areas should be augmented.</p>

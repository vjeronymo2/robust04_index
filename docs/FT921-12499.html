			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Bout of election madness: The controlled panic at Westminster The tension eased momentarily at the glittering Foreign Office party on Wednesday evening. Mr John Major moved cheerily between ambassadors, Whitehall mandarins and journalists. Privately, the prime minister was fretting: he was worried about his appearance on Desert Island Discs - the BBC radio programme which had chosen him to celebrate its 50th anniversary tomorrow. But the gentle hum of Whitehall small-talk and political gossip offered only the briefest of respites from the controlled panic which has gripped the nation's politicians. The rest of the week saw Westminster engulfed in the most intensive - and frequently farcical - election campaigning that MPs could recall. No matter that, even if Mr Major trusts his instincts and opts for April 9, the campaign proper was still nearly two months off. A slightly sheepish minister offered eloquent testimony to the atmosphere. Glumly contemplating a dawn television appearance he confessed: 'I haven't attacked Neil Kinnock for at least an hour - another black mark, I suppose, from (Conservative) central office.' The tone had been set earlier by Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, at one of the daily press conferences from which the politicians now daily hurl vollies of abuse. Launching (or was it relaunching?) his party's tax offensive, Mr Patten handed out cardboard slide-rules so that journalists could compute the personal cost of a Labour victory. Mr Kinnock's elegantly-named 'tax bombshell' would rob anyone on Pounds 25,000 a year of more than Pounds 2,000 in extra tax. It seemed churlish to suggest the arithmetic would not meet the national curriculum standards for seven year-olds. The black-painted bomb was the symbol of the week, the centrepiece of a chilling party political broadcast which in less permissive times would have attracted an X-certificate. Only the Daily Mirror (the figures were 'lies') and the Daily Telegraph (the Conservatives wanted too big a discount) refused to carry the accompanying newspaper advertisements. Mr Patten is one of the more cerebral of our politicians, suspected still of distinctly leftish tendencies. But his job now is to destroy the Labour party. And with the help of Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising firm, he is setting about it with a boyish enthusiasm that owes nothing to his intellectual capabilities. In between press conferences and television appearances Mr Patten was slamming Labour-controlled Camden council for not cleaning its streets or reminding waverers that Labour had shamed Britain 25 years ago by selling off the gold it held in trust for the Baltic states. At his side an earnest official clutching the party's secret war plan evoked images of the aide who trails behind the US president with the country's nuclear codes. There was no monopoly on hyperbole. If the Conservatives' tax offensive often drowned out Labour's message, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager, was never short of his own dubious statistics. Mr Patten claimed that the Labour party was set on a Pounds 37bn spending spree. Mr Cunningham produced figures showing the Conservatives had wasted up to Pounds 30bn by underpricing the sale of state assets. There were no free slide-rules to check the sums, but instead wooden spoons for Conservative councils across the country which had also squandered taxpayers' money. As the Daily Mirror lambasted the Conservatives and the Tory tabloids embellished further Mr Patten's press releases, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, waged a personal war against Sir David English, the editor of the Daily Mail. Mr Hattersley, alluding to the 'slugs and worms' who inhabit the garden of a free society, repeatedly challenged Sir David to a televised debate on whether he should give a modest slice of his large salary to pay for higher pensions and child benefit. Sir David demurred. His tribulations were nothing compared with those of television journalists attempting to produce balanced reports. After every news bulletin telephone lines crackled with complaints. Labour charged that Tory 'lies' dominated the air waves, the Conservatives that news bulletins occasionally featured an opposition press conference. The Liberal Democrats demanded they too be allocated 30 seconds or so to abuse the others. The madness infected the House of Commons, forcing the Speaker to remind MPs that their behaviour risked descending to the level of the kindergarten. Discussion among ministers about Budget options became surreal. One lamented that the case for 1p off the basic rate of tax had become almost respectable. Perhaps now he would press the case for a 2p cut. When told that the Treasury's economists worried about the size of the borrowing requirement, a colleague suggested 'they should keep their noses out of politics'. We are promised some respite. Next week Mr Major is launching a new phase in his Citizen's Charter. Mr Patten has promised some positive campaigning to emphasise the Conservatives' commitment to public services. Labour, keen to move from the back foot, might not feel so obliging. Either way the outlook is grim. Mr Kinnock's conversion to the market and Mr Major's retreat from Thatcherism have greatly narrowed the gulf between their parties. But in personal terms the stakes are as high as they have been at any election. We can expect more lies, damned lies and politics.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ELECTION CALENDAR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JANUARY 1992 31: John Major chairs UN security council meeting, New York.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FEBRUARY 13: January unemployment figures. 14: January RPI &amp; December industrial production figures.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARCH 7: Major speaks at Tory local government conference, London. 10: Budget.

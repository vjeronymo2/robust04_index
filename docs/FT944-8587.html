			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / New world order going badly wrong: Bruce Clark and Chrystia Freeland explain the dispute on handling the war in Bosnia The Bosnian crisis, which the US, the European powers and Russia have tried to resolve collectively under the aegis of their international contact group, has been the most prominent laboratory for the new post-cold war world order. Judging by harsh comments from senior British officials, who said yesterday that US-UK relations were more strained than they had been since the Suez crisis, the experiment is going badly wrong. The catalyst for the dispute was the US decision last week to withdraw unilaterally from enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia. This decision was broadly expected and its immediate consequences are limited. But some European officials, notably in France, see the US decision as more than a gesture. It could be a declaration of support for war as a means of ending the conflict by punishing the Serbs and allowing the Bosnians to reclaim lost territory. In contrast with this morally-imbued American position, Mr Charles Dick, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in Sandhurst, says that 'if you are a western European government you might prefer some sort of stalemate, no matter how unsatisfactory, to an escalation of the fighting.' In Europe, these clashing objectives have given rise to 'a strong fear that the US is trying to push the European forces in Bosnia into playing a direct role in the conflict', according to one European expert. He said the Europeans were concerned that the Americans, who have not committed any of their own forces, 'are willing to support the Bosnian government down to the last French or UK soldier'. In addition to specific concerns about their own troops, the Europeans are also accusing the US of violating the transatlantic modus vivendi tentatively established after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'Since the end of the cold war, we've talked about sharing responsibility,' said Mr Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'The Americans said that there might be situations in which the Europeans would play a direct military role on their own. 'But even though the Americans don't have troops in Bosnia, that hasn't prevented them from telling the Europeans what to do.' The US administration stresses that it still respects the ban on arms supplies to Bosnia. The government will neither send arms to Bosnia itself nor allow US citizens to do so. However, European officials fear that the current official US stance is consistent with some discreet assistance to the Moslem and Croat forces, aimed at encouraging them to overcome distrust and fight together. Alarm bells rang in European foreign ministries last month over a report in the New York Times of a mission to Sarajevo by retired General George Galvin, a senior US officer. Mr Gojko Susak, Croatian defence minister, said the US mission would be helping to forge a joint Moslem-Croat army. US policy statements present Croat-Moslem co-operation as something which could form either a building block for a settlement, or the basis to pursue war against the Serbs. Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassador to Croatia, has termed Croat-Moslem co-operation an 'alliance between two victims of Serbian aggression (which) has made those two victims better able to deal diplomatically, politically and militarily with that aggression'. US policy-makers say they want to see Serb nationalism hemmed in for reasons that go beyond Bosnia; they are worried by the prospect of an even bigger standoff between Serbs and Albanians. By contrast, European diplomats fear that stepping up pressure on Serbia by easing the arms embargo on Bosnia could lead to an escalation of the conflict. 'If you get a Bosnian army with Croat allies making real progress then the prospect of the war escalating has got to be on the cards,' says Mr Dick. 'It would be difficult for Belgrade not to be drawn in and then you're in danger of a Balkan war.' These fears have given European diplomacy - particularly that of France and Russia - a different focus. It aims at promoting reconciliation between Presidents Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade and Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb, in the hope that between them, they could bring the situation in Bosnia under control. France brokered a secret meeting between armed forces chiefs from Belgrade and Zagreb in September. Moscow, for its part, has sought to boost the authority of President Milosevic and rebuild Serbia as a bastion of Russian influence. Russia successfully insisted that Mr Milosevic should be rewarded for severing ties with the Bosnian Serbs, and it now wants him to be offered even greater rewards if he fully recognises Croatia. The US is committed to the territorial integrity of Croatia, and it has pressed the Serbs who control one third of that republic to settle with Zagreb. However, it fears any approach to this problem which involves boosting the status of Mr Milosevic. Fear of antagonising the Russians, with their strong historic and cultural ties to Serbia, is another source of European objections to the US decision to withdraw from the arms embargo. The Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, reiterated fierce Russian criticisms of the US move yesterday in Paris when he told reporters: 'All of us share anxiety over military developments in Bosnia and object to resolving the Bosnian problem by force.' But many western observers believe that for the time being Russia is too weak to take action matching its verbal protests. 'The Americans appear to be calculating that Yeltsin will not respond,' Mr Eyal said, 'and, for now, they are probably right.' However, with outside powers pursuing at least two separate strategies in Bosnia, analysts fear that the rival approaches could become disastrously entangled. In mid-January, Croatia must decide whether to renew the mandate of the UN peace-keepers on its territory. If it does not, that will be a signal that it intends to retake by force the land which it has lost to the Serbs. Diplomat see this as a real possibility. Amid confusing signals from the main capitals, Mr Tudjman might conclude that he can win out both ways: the US will support his forces - as long as they are fighting within their own republic - while Russia restrains Mr Milosevic. If that calculation then proves wrong, an almighty war will ensue.</p>

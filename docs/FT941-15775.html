			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: First Leisure After First Leisure's shares fell nearly 40 per cent between May and November last year, the market could be forgiven for being wary about yesterday's full-year results. In fact, though margins have fallen, they are still more than respectable, ranging up to 42.6 per cent in bowling. Despite a Pounds 67.5m write-down on property, gearing is only 13 per cent, making First Leisure a picture of health compared with companies such as Rank. Still, the company has had to make price concessions to keep admissions up in discotheques. Without the benefit of substantial discounts from its beer suppliers, margins would certainly have fallen yet more steeply. A main worry is that bowling, which still accounts for 39 per cent of operating profits and on which the company made its name, may simply not be so fashionable any more. This is borne out both by the company's admission that it may have pushed margins too hard at the height of the bowling boom in 1992 and by its attempts to stimulate additional interest with trendy extras in its bowling facilities, the latest being Sega games. The decision to branch out more or less simultaneously into both bingo and health clubs suggests the company is groping for new sources of growth. Both can be adapted to the out-of-town formula which proved successful in bowling, but bingo is a competitive market and health clubs are expensive to maintain. While the jury remains out, First Leisure looks more comfortable on a rating slightly above the market rather than at the 40 per cent premium at which it peaked last year.</p>

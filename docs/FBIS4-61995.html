			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, May 11, BNS -- Estonia should have  turned to U.N. structures, foreign governments and international  organizations after Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's  remarks on May 6 that Russia may suspend army withdrawal from  Estonia or even bring in additional troops, opposition MP Peeter  Lorents said.    "Unluckily it seems that this was done neither on May 6 nor  later, and therefore one is left with the impression that the  Estonian Government has once again let pass an extremely good  opportunity to raise the issue of Russian troops staying in  Estonia to the center of attention of international  organizations and the public," Lorents, the deputy leader of the  Coalition Party faction in the parliament said in a statement  today.

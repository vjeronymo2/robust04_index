			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> The international uproar over the novel "The Satanic Verses" should be called  "The Last Temptation of Christ -- Part II." Whether it's Islamic leaders  threatening the life of an author or Christians burning theaters in France for  showing Oscar nominee Scorsese's "Last Temptation," it gives religion a bad  name.  </P> <P> These attempts at artistic suppression have served only to motivate people to  (1) buy a book that doesn't exactly sound like zippy material and (2) see a  film they wouldn't have wanted to see.  </P> <P> LINDA COWAN MOSE  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4.3&blank;Analysis of Housing-Related Expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because section 4.2.4 covers the identification and quantification of housing-related expenses, these topics are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it should be noted that Runzheimer incorporated home sale prices from this study into the calculations of real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance, which depend upon the value of the home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.5&blank;Housing Survey Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the above sections, Runzheimer describes how it measured the costs for maintenance, insurance, utilities, real estate taxes, rents, and homeowner mortgages. Appendix 7 shows the cost of each of these items, for renters and homeowners separately, in each allowance area and in the Washington, DC, area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 8 compares the total cost of these items in each allowance area with the total cost of the same items in the Washington, DC, area. Again, there are separate comparisons for renters and homeowners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final housing-cost comparisons take the form of indexes that are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total, overall index for owners and renters. (Refer to section 2.2 for a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes are combined.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.1&blank;Component Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Transportation component consisted of expenses related to private and public transportation. The private transportation category contained expenses related to owning and operating a vehicle in each area. The public transportation category focused on the cost of air fares from each location to a common point within the contiguous 48 states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was done in previous surveys, Runzheimer used national average expenditure data to combine the private and public transportation relative cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, DC, area to arrive at a total Transportation component index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2&blank;Private Transportation Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer determined that an accurate and reasonable approach to measure transportation costs was to select and analyze three commonly driven vehicles (a domestic auto, an import auto and a utility vehicle) in all areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New vehicles were the basis for developing the transportation-cost calculations. Although Runzheimer could have developed costs from the premise that ``identical'' used vehicles would be purchased from auto dealers in each location, Runzheimer believed that costing new vehicles reduced the potential for inconsistencies due to value judgements concerning used vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2.1&blank;Vehicle Selection and Pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, Runzheimer selected and priced a domestic auto, an import auto, and a utility vehicle as the basic vehicle types to cost in all locations. We based our selection of these vehicle types on their popularity in the United States as demonstrated by owner registration data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To select a specific make and model within each vehicle type, Runzheimer identified the top-selling models in each car class. For these models, Runzheimer's research associates collected new vehicle prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At each auto dealership in the sample, Runzheimer recorded the suggested retail prices of the three vehicles plus any additional charges, such as shipping, excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. Runzheimer used the suggested retail prices (not negotiated prices) in the analysis. Runzheimer also included documentation fees as part of the new-vehicle costs in Alaskan locations. Contacted dealerships explained that a documentation fee is charged on a new-car purchase to cover paperwork costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

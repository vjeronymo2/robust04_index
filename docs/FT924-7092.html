			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: National Power The electricity market may be showing the signs of recession - with sales falling for the first time in a decade - but National Power continues to prosper. The key is aggressive cost control, and while the management has reaped the easiest part of manpower reductions, further savings will come from more flexible working practices. Although National Power will lose market share in coming years, its costs will fall even more rapidly than revenues as its least efficient plant is retired. That healthy outlook is marred by the uncertainty surrounding the coal industry, but at least the outline of a compromise is visible. The original proposal was for the generators to buy 40m tonnes of British coal. If this were augmented by contracts to buy an additional 15m tonnes next year, declining to 5m tonnes over the following two years, the strains would be eased. British Coal could phase its rationalisation programme, and the extra time might mean that more pits could be made competitive. The generators would still be buying fuel more cheaply than at present, so customers should get lower bills, and, of course, the government's blushes would be spared. Whatever happens to coal, National Power's biggest problem may prove to be its own success. Profits are still rising sharply and the dividend is covered 3.5 times even after yesterday's 10 per cent increase in the interim. Yet releasing those earnings to investors might just attract the attention of the regulator.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains on G7 summit declaration THE economic declaration of the G7 summit, which included clauses calling for Japan to take fiscal and monetary measures to revive its sluggish economy, prompted hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 188.72 higher at 19,877.39, 1.3 per cent higher on the week, on buying by arbitrageurs and public pension funds. The index opened at the day's low of 19,699.97 and rose to a high of 19,946.79 just before the close. Volume rose from 349m to 480m shares. While this was the highest level since June 11, traders said that July futures options settlements and speculative trading in Nikkatsu accounted for about 200m shares. Advances led declines by 761 to 227 with 141 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 17.69 to 1,608.62 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.79 to 1,219.58. At the end of the G7 summit Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, said that while the government did not intend to introduce another economic stimulus package, spending on public works projects, including high technology infrastructure, would be increased. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained on Mr Miyazawa's comments, rising Y19,000 to Y884,000. Other high-technology issues also advanced, with NEC up Y11 to Y957 and Fujitsu rising Y24 to Y740. Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day with almost 20 per cent of the day's volume, rose Y9 to Y25. The film producer and distributor, which filed for court protection last week, has recently become a speculative favourite among traders looking for quick profits. Hopes of lower interest rates helped banks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y40 to Y3,050 and Mitsubishi Bank added Y60 to Y2,830. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.78 to 21,929.23 in volume of 13.6m shares. Roundup WHERE it moved, the region maintained an upward trend. NEW ZEALAND registered another three-year high, the NZSE-40 index closing 7.17 higher at 1,723.66, 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Volume was NZDollars 40m, the bulk of it in Carter Holt and Telecom. Telecom rose another 5 cents to Dollars 3.31; Carter Holt was unchanged at Dollars 2.94. SEOUL's composite index rose 9.78 higher at 770.46, 3.2 per cent higher on the week, in a session dominated by strong interest in construction and financial stocks. TAIWAN featured late buying of textiles and blue chips, with strong interest in China Steel, 90 cents higher at TDollars 20.20 on reports of good profits in June. The textile stock, Hualon, also gained 60 cents, to TDollars 26.20 as the weighted index ended 50.88 higher at 4,068.47, 3.7 per cent up on the week. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 14.95bn. AUSTRALIA saw a drop in golds after the bullion price lost its impetus, the gold shares index ending 40.5 lower at 2,172.9. However, the All Ordinaries index still managed to end 0.4 higher at 1,782.9, a new, post-1987 crash high. A strong News Corp helped support the market. It peaked at ADollars 8.00, to finish 20 cents up at ADollars 7.92 after a link up between its BSkyB arm and Australian analysts on Thursday boosted confidence in the stock. HONG KONG saw late selling as the latest Sino-British talks on the colony ended without agreement. The Hang Seng index lost 51.78 to 7,070.61, 2 per cent lower on the week, although turnover stayed thin at HKDollars 3.29bn, against HKDollars 2.95bn on Thursday. Most blue chips were hit by the late selling with Cheung Kong dipping 40 cents to HKDollars 26.40 and its affiliate, Hutchison Whampoa, off 20 cents to HKDollars 21.40.</p>

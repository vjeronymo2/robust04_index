			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland(2): Weak recovery is forecast - The economy is in need of structural reforms OVER the past three years, Finland's economy has suffered a juddering recession spectacular even by the recent grim standards of western Europe. Real output declined by 10 per cent over 1991 and 1992 and at best will be flat in 1993. Unemployment reached 20 per cent in July. The banking sector lurched into losses so severe that the state will spend some FM60bn or more to bail it out. The budget deficit has ballooned to around 10 per cent of gross domestic product and foreign debt has doubled to almost 50 per cent of GDP. But, at last, there are signs of a respite. 'The Finnish economy is not going to continue going down the drain,' asserts Mr Sixten Korkman, the chief economist at the finance ministry. 'Next year there will be some recovery, even though it will be weak.' Mr Korkman is not letting optimism get the better of him. In fact, his projections of 1 per cent GDP growth in 1994 are more gloomy than last month's OECD report on the Finnish economy, which foresaw growth of 2.1 per cent next year. But he is confident that a dramatic surge in exports already under way, following a 50 per cent fall in the value of the Finnish markka over the past two years, will drive a return to growth. The current account may move into surplus, easing the foreign debt burden and underpinning low interest rates. The problem is, as Mr Korkman readily acknowledges, that the domestic economy, which is the only realistic source of significant employment growth, remains stuck deep in recession. Much of the explanation for this lies in the continued hangover from an exaggerated foreign credit boom in the late 1980s which burst when Finland's mainstay trade with the former Soviet Union disappeared and international recession hit simultaneously. Suddenly, interest rates - which generous tax allowances had rendered negative in many cases - went up steeply, asset values tumbled and foreign debt soared in markka terms. Savings ratios rocketed and are set to stay high while thousands of individuals and companies unwind their debts. The result has been a slump in private consumption. Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a spending squeeze to try to control its rising deficits. Overall, domestic demand is set to fall by 5 per cent this year, the third year of shrinkage in succession. The OECD sees a further small decline next year. 'I am quite sure the domestic economy will remain slow even when it turns around,' says Dr Sirkka Hamalainen, governor of the Bank of Finland. 'I am sure households will remain very reluctant to take on new debt.' Government policy can be summed up as a mixture of tight fiscal policy and relatively loose monetary policy. Mr Iiro Viinanen, the finance minister, has been adamant that the scale of the deficit leaves no room for expansionary measures in the budget - especially with rising unemployment and the banking crisis adding heavily to government expenditure. The government is sticking to its target of holding down public expenditure in real terms at 1991 levels. Instead, with inflation at less than 3 per cent, the steep fall in the value of the markka and tumbling interest rates are looked to as the chief sources of economic stimulus. But here, too, the authorities have been reluctant to go too far. The finance ministry and central bank are now ready to admit that their defence of the markka's link to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which they finally broke by floating the currency in September last year, was misplaced, given the depth of the recession the country was suffering. Still, there is concern about the level of the markka which has restrained the central bank from letting short-term rates fall below the 6 per cent level at which they currently stand. 'We could not have pushed down interest rates faster,' says Dr Hamalainen. 'With hindsight, you might say that if we had floated in 1991 then we could have had lower interest rates. But after we floated the currency last autumn, in practice our freedom to cut interest rates was low because of the high levels of foreign debt both in the public and private sector. In many ways we have been in a trap.' The policy approach of the authorities was largely endorsed by reports on the economy commissioned from three foreign economists earlier this year by the Bank of Finland. All stressed the importance of getting the national finances back into balance. Two - Professor David Currie of the London School of Economics and Professor Christian Bordes from the University of Bordeaux - agreed that, for the time being, controlling the deficit and lowering interest rates was the way forward. 'A tight fiscal stance coupled with a looser monetary stance offers the best prospect of economic recovery, of tackling the twin debt problem of internal and external debt, and of maintaining a competitive level of the markka, boosting exports in a difficult world trading environment,' wrote Prof Currie. The third economist - Mr Hans Tson Soderstrom of the Stockholm School of Economics - differed by suggesting that unemployment, set to remain above 12 per cent five years hence, was so severe that some loosening of fiscal policy was justified. He said Finland's gross public debt was not excessive by international standards and the country could contemplate a demand stimulus in the form of tax cuts. However, the clear message from all three economists was that Finland must also undertake difficult structural reforms to underpin a return to sustained long-term growth. Mr Soderstrom identified these as including: deregulation and reduced subsidies in the sheltered domestic economy; a shift in public spending from consumption and transfer payments to investment; recapitalisation of the banking system and increased labour market flexibility. 'The need to combine demand and supply-side measures and short-term policy action with long-term policy commitments into one comprehensive policy programme poses a serious co-ordination and credibility problem,' wrote the Swedish economist. While there has been a high degree of co-operation between the government and the opposition Social Democrats in parliament over fiscal policy recently, there is no doubt that structural reforms raise much greater difficulties. Already the powerful trade union organisations have curbed government efforts to lower minimum wage levels. Privatisation has yet to get seriously under way. But among policymakers there is a growing realisation that changes are necessary. Mr Viinanen, the finance minister, recently described Finland's extremely high levels of unemployment benefits as 'a cancer' on the economy. Some 60,000 jobs in the public sector have been axed in recent years. 'There is still a long way to go on labour market reforms,' says Mr Korkman. 'But I think there have been many profound changes in the public sector. Ministries are really cutting expenditure and improving efficiency - even though the result is to increase unemployment. The mental attitude has changed.'</p>

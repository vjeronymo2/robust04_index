			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the change proposed, one tolerance for all applicants would be used and that would not differ depending on the specific programs to which the student is applying for assistance. The Secretary considers the value of this simplification of the regulations to outweigh any potential loss in flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of a new tolerance amount to be used in the calculation of an applicant's EFC would not establish a new policy. Institutions are currently using tolerance amounts in the calculation of an applicant's EFC. However, since the Secretary would be implementing a new single tolerance amount and deleting the zero PGI charts to simplify the processing of Title IV assistance, the Secretary requests public comment on the establishment of the $400 tolerance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary will issue final changes to &sect;&sect;668.54 and 668.59 of these regulations following an opportunity for public comment in response to the proposed changes listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities affected by these regulations are small institutions of higher education. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the small institutions affected because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements necessary to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Invitation To Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments concerning these proposed changes should be sent to the contact person given above.
